Mr. President, it is my privilege to start off \nthis session by making some comments about our guest Chaplain, who has \nbeen a personal friend of mine in Orlando for the last three decades. \nHe has pastored over those three decades the very significant and very \ndynamic First Baptist Church of Orlando, just recently handing over the \nreins to his successor after a transition period of some number of \nyears which have seen that particular church become one of the dominant \ninstitutions in the State of Florida; among spiritual institutions, one \nof the giants.\n  Jim Henry is, indeed, a great leader in the church, not only among \nhis flock, which was Orlando, but having risen to the position as the \nhead of the Southern Baptist Convention. All of us in this political \nrealm know the enormous tensions that have been raised in the religious \ncommunity over various doctrines, the interpretation of the Scriptures, \ndifferences that arise and cause strife. As the leader of the Southern \nBaptist Convention, Jim Henry was the great healer, the great \nreconciler, bringing together the various sides to, in effect, emulate \nwhat Jesus of Nazareth taught.\n  It is interesting, in Jim's prayer this morning, he asked that we all \nbecome servant leaders. Isn't that true about the role model that was \nset by Jesus of Nazareth, a servant leader who said that if you want to \nbe first, you should be last; if you want to be the master, you should \nbe the servant? That principle, laid out in the Scriptures, is one of \nthe greatest principles for us to follow as public servants. What is \nour obligation? To serve as servants of the public we represent.\n  It is with great privilege that I welcome my dear friend and one of \nthe great spiritual leaders of America, Pastor Jim Henry, and thank him \nfor his service as the Chaplain in the Senate for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12695-8", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12695-S12696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Yesterday, the President vetoed the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program expansion that the Congress had sent to him, \nas he said he would. I would hope all of us would get down to work on \nthe serious matter of trying to come up with a compromise which would \nachieve the original intent of Congress when we passed the legislation \nback in 1997 and when it was signed into law by President Clinton and \nwhich has served the Nation's children so well. Instead, it appears you \ncan't take the politics out of politics and you can't take the politics \nout of Washington.\n  This matter has become a political football that is going to be used \nfor partisan political gain. I think that is a shame. I say that not \nwith a sense of anger but with a sense of disappointment that we would \nsee something as important as providing health coverage to our Nation's \nchildren be used in political ads and that rather than have a veto-\noverride vote in the House of Representatives forthwith, it has now \nbeen postponed by Speaker Pelosi to October 18 to give the Democratic \nCongressional Campaign Committee time to run ads against those who \nwould likely uphold the veto in their congressional districts over the \nnext week or so. That is a shame. I wish they would reconsider.\n  The problem, after all, with the bill Congress passed is that while \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program was designed to take up \nwhere Medicaid left off, this was fundamentally a welfare benefit, one \nwhich I believe the Congress wisely decided was necessary for our \nNation's poor, low-income children, to make sure they got access to \nhealth coverage. But what we see is this vehicle was then used, with a \n140-percent increase in Federal spending, to take this program not just \nfrom children up to 200 percent of poverty but to then say this can be \na wealth transfer from the pockets of the American taxpayers to the \nmiddle class because under the bill the President vetoed, up to 400 \npercent of poverty level could be covered by this welfare benefit. That \ntranslates to a family of four roughly making $80,000 a year. It is \nsimply unacceptable, from my perspective, to say that you can take \nmoney from the pockets of the American taxpayer not for a welfare \nbenefit to help those in need but to help those who already have their \nown health insurance, simply to provide a free benefit to those who are \nalready covered by their own health insurance. There is no sound basis \nupon which to take what is essentially a welfare benefit and transform \nthat into a middle-class entitlement--unless, of course, there is \nsomething else going on here, which I suspect there is. I will talk \nabout that in a moment.\n  In my own State, I wish we would redouble our efforts to focus our \nvision on the original intent of the SCHIP legislation because in my \nState, there are roughly 500,000 Medicaid-eligible children who are not \ncovered by Medicaid. Why? Because their parents haven't signed them up \nfor benefits they are entitled to under the law. There are an \nadditional 200,000 SCHIP-eligible children, up to 200 percent of \npoverty level in Texas, who are not signed up for that benefit. So why \nin the world, when there are still children in the target population we \nare trying to help who remain uncovered, are we going to be diverted by \na huge expansion of this program beyond its original intent to cover \nadults in 14 States? In the State of Wisconsin, more adults than \nchildren are covered by the State Children's Health Insurance Program--\nobviously, that was not part of Congress's original intent--up to 400 \npercent of poverty level, up to $80,000-plus for a family of four. It \nis simply another example of a well-intended, perhaps as originally \nintended, program that has now been expanded beyond all recognition.\n  If possible, I would say this was the equivalent of mission creep for \nthe U.S. military. It is clearly another example of trying to use a \nsuccessful Government program, a welfare benefit for low-income kids, \nand to expand it beyond recognition--another example, I am afraid, of \nwasteful Washington spending run amok.\n  The question is not whether the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram will continue. Even after the President's veto, as my \ncolleagues know, we passed a continuing resolution which would continue \nthe current program through November 16. I know today that if we had an \nopportunity to vote on a continuation of the current program as \ntargeted, it would pass unanimously in the Senate. But rather than take \ncare of business, rather than do our jobs, unfortunately this has \ndegenerated into political gamesmanship, where the House leadership, \nSpeaker Pelosi and others, have decided that rather than have the vote \non the override of the President's veto, which they know will be \nsustained, immediately they have decided to put it off until October 18 \nin order for the political games to continue.\n  Obviously, this is another reason Congress's approval rating in most \npublic opinion polls is well under 20 percent. The American people \nwonder why is it that Washington is not hearing what they are saying \nwhen it comes to being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, when it \ncomes to making sure the money we do spend that they earn and which is \ntransferred to the U.S. Treasury is spent efficiently and effectively \non important programs we all support as opposed to these programs being \nused essentially as a Trojan horse for other objectives.\n  The final concern I have about this vast expansion of the SCHIP \nprogram--a 140-percent increase over the current program--is it clearly \nrepresents another step toward a Washington-controlled health care \nsystem, something I think would be a tragedy for our country. \nEventually, it would crowd out the private sector and the choice and \nthe individual decisionmaking Americans can make with their own health \ncare provider to determine what is in their best interest, what kind of \ntreatment they want to have for their health care needs, as opposed to \nturning that over to Government bureaucrats.\n  There are three things I can guarantee will happen when Washington \nmakes all the health care decisions. No. 1 is, it will be expensive. It \nwill not be free, or I should say you would be surprised at how \nexpensive ``free'' health care turns out to be in terms of the tax \npayments that will be required to support it.\n  Secondly, I will tell you that a Washington-controlled health care \nsystem will be excessively bureaucratic. It is just in the nature of \nWashington. With central Government control for 300 million people, \nthere will be more red tape than anybody can imagine. It will make it \nharder to get access to the health care that right now is readily \navailable for virtually all Americans. The question is, how are we \ngoing to deliver it the most efficiently, not whether they can get \naccess to it. Because we all agree they should have and do have access \nto health care today.\n  The third thing I will say is, I will guarantee once Washington makes \nall health care decisions, it will be controlled by rationing. The \ncosts of health care delivery--when Washington makes all the \ndecisions--will be controlled by rationing. What is the evidence of \nthat? Well, if you look right now at the reimbursement rates Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP provide to\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\nhealth care providers, who provide health care services under those \nprograms, those reimbursement rates are much lower than private health \ninsurance.\n  Where I live in Austin, TX, only 18 percent of physicians are \naccepting new Medicare patients. Why? It is because the reimbursement \nrates set by the Federal Government are so low that most doctors cannot \ntreat new Medicare patients and keep their doors open for other \nbusiness.\n  So if we continue down this road to a single-payer, Government-run \nhealth care system out of Washington, DC, it will be expensive, it will \nbe bureaucratic, and it will result in rationing such as citizens of \nCanada and the United Kingdom currently have with their single-payer \nsystem, where the kinds of access to health care we take for granted in \nthis country--and we can get in a matter of hours or a matter of days, \nat most--they have to wait months and years because of the rationing \nresulting from a single-payer, Government-run health care system.\n  That is the wrong prescription for the American people. I believe \nonce they begin to realize this radical expansion of this program--\nwhich has a very important target audience of 200 percent of poverty, \npoor kids--has now been blown up into something that hardly anybody \nwould recognize, covering middle-class Americans, resulting in a vast \nwealth transfer from the taxpayers to the middle class--and that it is \nnot just a welfare benefit, but an incremental step toward a single-\npayer, Washington-controlled health care system--I think that would be \nthe wrong prescription for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout this issue of health care and children's health care, the issue \nabout all the politics that are involved, and the issue about the next \nelection and how you can make somebody look bad because they do not \nagree that we ought to transfer a large segment of our health care to \nthe Government.\n  I think it is most important that the American people ought to be \nasking some questions. Why is it we have a health care program that we \nare putting out that the President rightly vetoed that pays $4,000 to \nbuy $2,300 worth of care? It is a simple question. We are going to pay \n$1,700 more than we should to run it through the Government--to buy \n$2,300 worth of care. That makes no sense. But whoever said Washington \nmakes sense?\n  As a matter of fact, this bill is more nonsensical than any bill we \nhave passed this year. It assumes that 22 million Americans now have to \nstart smoking to pay the taxes that will pay for this bill. Twenty-two \nmillion? Right now we have a problem with the cost of tobacco use in \nthis country and long-term care.\n  The other situation which has not been characterized is, if you look \nat the CBO scoring, for any one new child who goes on SCHIP under this \nbill, one comes off of private insurance. It is one for one. That is \nwhat the CBO says. So what we are doing is, we are asking the American \ntaxpayers--but, actually, we are not. We are asking the very children \nwhom we are supposedly going to give care to, to allow us to borrow \nmoney now to pay for their care so they can pay a higher tax rate 25 \nyears from now.\n  This bill lacks integrity in terms of the way it pays for itself. \nEverybody knows that. It is another little wink and nod from \nWashington: Yes, we have a pay-go rule. Yes, we are going to pay for \nit. But, oh, by the way, it costs $121 billion, but we are only going \nto tell you it costs $35 billion. And, by the way, we don't have the \ntax revenues to pay for it, so we are going to lie about the tax \nrevenues on it.\n  It is important that Washington start getting what America has \nalready got; that is, how about some plain words that have to do with \nour health care situation? If we want to move to national health care, \nlet's have a debate about national health care. Let's talk about the \nfact that in England the average length of time waiting for treatment \nfor a cancer after it is diagnosed--they are trying to move from 10 \nmonths to 3 months. In this country it is 4 weeks. It is 4 weeks. The \ncure rates for cancers in this country are 50 percent to 100 percent \nbetter than anywhere else that has a nationalized health care system. \nWhy is that? Why is it that 80 percent of all the innovation in health \ncare in terms of new medical products, new techniques, new devices, new \ndiagnostics come out of this country's private sector?\n  Let's have a real debate about national health care. But let's quit \nlying to the American people that in the name of children we are going \nto spend their future money to create a segue to national health care.\n  In the State of New Jersey, well over half the money for children's \nhealth care is spent on adults. In the State of Florida, 750,000 kids \nunder 200 percent of the poverty level are not on SCHIP right now. In \nthe State of Texas, 700,000 are not. Yet we are going to create a \nsystem to raise--it is important the American people know what 200 \npercent of the poverty level is. It is $42,000 a year.\n\n  What we are saying under the present SCHIP bill--the one that has \nbeen extended with the CR--is if you as a family make less than that, \nwe are going to help you out with your kids. But if you make more than \nthat, you ought to be contributing.\n  This body does not care about kids because it voted against a premium \nsupport amendment to allow kids in these higher income families a way \nto buy health insurance. What we have said is no, we cannot do that. \nBut we can certainly be dishonest about what our intentions are in the \nrest of the bill.\n  So as the American public hears all the criticism of those who say: \nWe don't want more Government; we want less; we want the Government we \nhave to be more efficient, more transparent, and more accountable--as \nthey criticize us for those positions, they are going to say we don't \ncare about children.\n  Do you care about children if you are going to steal their future by \nundermining their ability to have a future by not paying for and \ngrowing the Government and borrowing more and more money? It cannot \nhappen. We cannot give our children a future if we continue to be \ndishonest with ourselves and dishonest with the American public.\n  I think President Bush is right on this issue. No. I don't think so. \nI know he is. One of the reasons we are having difficulty at this time \nin our country with health care is because 52 percent of the health \ncare now is run by the Government. Why is it a large percentage of \npeople who are now coming on to Medicare--and in 3 years the baby \nboomers start coming on to Medicare--why is it the vast majority of \nthem cannot find a Medicare physician? Why is that? Could it be that we \nhave promised something we are not going to pay for, so we are going to \nreimburse at a lower level?\n  The next thing to come out of this body will be: If you are a \nphysician in this country, you have to take Medicare, just as in \nMassachusetts you have to take Medicaid. Our health care system ought \nto be about freedom and choice and personal responsibility, and, yes, \nit ought to be about helping those who need our help. But, quite \nfrankly, if you are making $80,000 a year in this country, we ought to \nbe about paying off debt rather than paying for your child's health \ninsurance. That is what this bill does. That is what this bill allows.\n  So we are going to have a debate. We are going to see the political \ngames played out. This bill will not be overridden in the House, and \nthen we are going to have to come back and address it. My hope is when \nwe address it, we will add premium support for those who are on the \nedge so we can help those who are in private insurance stay in private \ninsurance, we will be honest on how we pay for it. The most \ndisappointing thing about this bill is the lack of integrity and \nhonesty and character in terms of the way it is paid for. It shows the \ndepths of which we fool ourselves and play the game of politics rather \nthan play the game of statesmanship. It is a disappointing aspect, and \nI would say our approval rating is well earned just on the basis of \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I have traveled around Rhode \nIsland, I have met so many families who worry about health care. Will \ntheir child fall ill? Will the price of prescription drugs or a visit \nto the doctor go up again?\n  As health care costs skyrocket and the number of uninsured Americans \napproaches a staggering 50 million, we have a solemn obligation to make \nhealth care more accessible and affordable.\n  This obligation is not new. For decades, our Government has treated \nit as one of the most sacred promises we keep with the American people, \nand it has been one of our best opportunities to just plain do the \nright thing. Initiatives such as Medicare and Medicaid are among our \ngreatest accomplishments. The Children's Health Insurance Program is a \nshining light in the American health care system, providing health \ncoverage to millions of American children whose families could not \notherwise afford insurance.\n  Since its creation in 1997, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nhas given children in America's working families better access to \nmedical care for common conditions such as asthma or ear infections, \nbetter school attendance rates, better academic achievement, better \nmedical access, and more preventive care. It means that children stay \nout of expensive urgent care settings such as the emergency room. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is among the singular health care \nsuccess stories of our generation. That is why it has long enjoyed \nbipartisan support, including enthusiastic support from Republican \nGovernors.\n  My State of Rhode Island has played a vital role in creating and \nsustaining the Children's Health Insurance Program. The distinguished \nRepublican Senator John Chafee, whom so many of my colleagues will \nremember, was one of the early bipartisan architects of this bill. For \nyears, my senior Senator, Jack Reed, has been one of the most powerful \nadvocates for this program in the Senate. I am proud to add my voice of \nsupport to his.\n  I am proud also to represent a State with one of the lowest rates of \nuninsured children and adults in the Nation. Rhode Island has worked \nfor 15 years to achieve this success, beginning with Gov. Bruce \nSundlun's establishment of the original RIteCare Program in 1993. I was \nhonored to have been part of Governor Sundlun's team.\n  Similar to many State programs, RIteCare relies on this funding that \nthe President vetoed--relies on it to help families pay for regular \ncheckups, immunizations, prescriptions, nutrition and other services \nand to reduce the number of uninsured children in our State.\n  This year, leaders on both sides of the aisle came together in the \nSenate to make this strong, vital program even stronger. The $35 \nbillion agreement Congress passed last week would have brought health \ncare to 10 million American children over the next 5 years, including \nadding up to 6,600 currently uninsured children in Rhode Island. We \nimproved the program in other ways as well, adding quality dental and \nmental health care for children and new incentives for States to enroll \nmore eligible children and to improve the quality of care.\n  But President Bush took all that away with the stroke of his veto \npen. Why? Health insurance, he says, should be delivered in the private \nmarket. Well, guess what, Mr. President. The majority of children's \nhealth beneficiaries receive their coverage through private health \nplans. In fact, in 2005, all but two separate State children's health \nprograms used a managed care company to provide CHIP benefits. The \nchildren's health plan does not threaten privatized health care; it is \nprivatized health care for almost two-thirds of its enrollees. In Rhode \nIsland, the Children's Health Insurance Program is delivered entirely \nthrough private insurers. As I have displayed here, the children's \nhealth program looks a lot like the health insurance the President has \nand the Senate has, and it doesn't look anything like the socialized \nmedicine Republican opponents of this program have used as a red \nherring.\n  By the way, as a footnote on the public versus private health \ninsurance question, maybe President Bush, who claims to be a fiscal \nconservative, would be pleased to learn that the small group of \nchildren's health beneficiaries who actually are in public insurance \nprograms, cost the Government less than those who are on private \ninsurance. In fact, publicly insured children cost taxpayers 10 percent \nless than privately insured children, and publicly insured adults cost \n30 percent less than privately insured adults.\n  But the President is not persuaded by these facts. It does not matter \nto him that publicly insured children have a much better chance of \nhaving a well child care visit than uninsured children and a much \nbetter chance of having a dental care visit. It does not matter that \npractical Republican Governors across the country support this bill or \nthat it is one of the most bipartisan achievements of this Congress. \nAll that seems to matter to this President is ideology, and in this \ncase, it is a bizarre ideology that doesn't think struggling, working-\nclass families should have health care. In fact, he especially doesn't \nbelieve that struggling, working-class parents should have health care. \nHe threatened to veto this bill based on that feature alone.\n  As recently as last summer at a Finance Committee hearing, his own \nCMS Administrator, Mark McClellan, stated--and this is a quote from the \nBush administration:\n\n       Extending coverage to parents and caretaker relatives--\n\n  Parents and caretaker relatives--\n\n     not only serves to cover additional insured individuals, but \n     may also increase the likelihood that they will take the \n     steps necessary to enroll their children. Extending coverage \n     to parents and caretakers may also increase the likelihood \n     that their children remain enrolled in CHIP.\n\n  Here is a copy of a letter that Administrator McClellan wrote to my \nhome State of Rhode Island on January 13, 2006. It reads:\n\n       We are pleased to inform you that your amendment to the \n     RiteCare section 1115 demonstration, as modified by the \n     special terms and conditions accompanying this award, has \n     been approved.\n\n  It also notes that Rhode Island's request to renew its demonstration \nproject has also been approved.\n  And what exactly did Mark McClellan approve? Here is the next quote:\n\n       Expenditures for expanded SCHIP eligibility to individuals \n     who, at the time of initial application, are custodial \n     parents or relative caretakers of children eligible under the \n     plan.\n\n  Signed Dr. Mark McClellan.\n  The Bush administration approved the program in Rhode Island for \ncustodial parents and relative caretakers. Yet the President is \nshocked--shocked--that this program may cover some adults.\n  President Bush, you authorized the coverage for these adults over and \nover, State by State, through your Cabinet Secretary overseeing this \nproblem. Your argument, sir, is with yourself.\n  All I can say is you were right the first time, before you took this \nshameful ideological U-turn.\n  Setting aside reason, setting aside the security and peace of mind of \ncountless working-class families, driven by ideology, President Bush \nlifted his veto pen for only the fourth time in his Presidency and \nstruck down the Children's Health Insurance Program. His reason this \nweek: Because it costs too much.\n  In other words, the same administration that in 1 year, in 2008, will \nspend $70 billion to pay for the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent of \nincome earners, thinks it is too much to spend half that much over 5 \nyears to provide billions of American children affordable health care. \nSaid another way, the annual cost of Bush tax cuts for the superrich is \n10 times the annual cost of this bill for children's health care, and \nhe says he vetoes it over its cost.\n  The same administration is spending more than $10 billion each month \nin Iraq, with no plan for ending the war and bringing our troops home, \nan administration that is now asking for 200 billion more dollars for \nthe war this coming year, refuses to spend $35 billion over the next 5 \nyears to provide\n\n[[Page S12699]]\n\nmillions of children all over this country affordable health care.\n  Instead, the President sought a funding level that would result in 1 \nmillion American children losing--losing--their health insurance.\n  So where would their families go to get these children health care if \nthey don't have access to this insurance under the President's \nproposal? Well, before an audience in Cleveland on July 10, the \nPresident of the United States revealed his approach:\n\n       People have access to health care in America--\n\n  He said.\n\n       After all, you just go to an emergency room.\n\n  So that is it.\n  Tax cuts for billionaires that explode our national debt and leave \nfuture generations on the hook to pay for it--that is a big priority \nfor President Bush. Billions for Blackwater, for an endless war with no \nplan to end it, for no-bid contracts for Halliburton--that is a big \npriority for President Bush.\n  But health care for children and their struggling working-class \nfamilies, all paid for in the budget after hard-working bipartisan \ncompromise? Nope. That is not a priority. That is a veto.\n  And the kids? ``Send them to the emergency room,'' he says.\n  I am ashamed of the President's decision. His veto was unnecessary. \nIt was wrong. It is now up to Congress to make it right. I ask my \ncolleagues to override the President's veto of children's health \ninsurance.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for voicing his concerns about the veto of the children's health \nbill that is so important to so many children, and I appreciate his \nstrong statement.\n  I think yesterday was a sad day for all Americans. For reasons I \ncan't comprehend, President Bush yesterday decided to veto our \nbipartisan effort to invest in health care for the Nation's children. \nWith no fanfare, behind closed doors, when no one was looking, the \nPresident put his personal politics ahead of increased investment in \nour most precious asset, our children.\n  I was so proud last week when, with bipartisan support in good \nmargins in both Houses of Congress, we passed the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. That bill is an example of how Government ought to \nwork.\n  Leaders in the House and in the Senate, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, worked together to find a compromise that could work for \neveryone at the table. Nobody got everything they wanted, but the final \nproduct was worthy of support and pride on all sides.\n  I had hoped that after seeing the tremendous work that went into this \ncompromise the President would think of the kids in every State of the \nUnion who needed basic health care and reconsider his position.\n  I had hoped he would think about the families who are struggling to \nmake ends meet and reconsider his position.\n  I had hoped that in the end he would reconsider his plan to say no to \nour children and to our families. But yesterday those hopes were \ndashed.\n  All children should be able to see a doctor when they are sick, and \nall children should be able to get the medicine they need to make them \nbetter. When a child gets a cut that requires stitches or comes down \nwith a fever or an earache or with any other imaginable problem, they \nought to be able to get help, period.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, today in America--the richest and most \nsuccessful country ever--that is not the case. In fact, millions of \nAmerican children do not have health insurance, which means millions of \nAmerican kids cannot see a doctor when they are sick, and millions of \nAmerican children don't get the medicine they need to help them get \nbetter.\n  It doesn't matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat, whether you \nare a progressive or conservative, I believe making sure our children \nget health care is the moral thing to do.\n  This veto that the President penned yesterday has real and serious \nimpact on many families in my State and across the country. Because \nPresident Bush vetoed that bill, 3.8 million uninsured children are \ngoing to continue to live without coverage. Let me say that again. \nPresident Bush told 3.8 million children in America they cannot have \nhealth care. To me, that is just shameful.\n  When I came to the floor a couple of weeks ago to talk about this \nimportant bill, I told the story of a woman in my State, Sydney DeBord, \nwho lives in Yakima, WA. She is a young girl who has cystic fibrosis. \nHer mom wrote to me to tell me how important this children's health \ninsurance program was to her family. She said it allowed her daughter, \nSydney, to get and extend her life, and it allowed her to live her very \ntough life to the fullest. I want to quote again from that letter \nbecause I believe she speaks for those more than 3 million children and \ntheir families on this dark day.\n  Ms. DeBord said:\n\n       I know for a fact that without this bit of assistance her \n     life would end much sooner due to the inability to afford \n     quality health care for her. As her parent, it frightens me \n     to even think some day she may be without health care \n     coverage if programs like CHIP are no longer available.\n\n  Today, I share Ms. DeBord's fears, and all other parents do as well.\n  We have another chance. The President doesn't have the final say on \nthis one. Right now, Members of the House of Representatives are \nworking to find the votes to override this veto, perhaps, and hopefully \nend the fears of Ms. DeBord and millions of moms just like her. They \nneed a few more votes. If they get a few more votes, we can tell the \nPresident that investing in families and investing in America is a \npriority of the men and women of this Congress no matter how many \nvetoes he sends our way.\n  It is very troubling to me that the President continues to ignore the \nwishes of the American public. The American people and the vast \nmajority of Congress want to expand stem cell research to find cures \nfor diseases affecting so many in our Nation. The President says no.\n  The American people and the vast majority of Congress want to change \ncourse in Iraq and bring our troops home safely. The President says no.\n  The American people and the vast majority of Congress want investment \nin roads, bridges, medical research, and education. The President says \nno.\n  The American people and the vast majority of Congress want to provide \nhealth care for our young children today. The President says no.\n  So we need a few more Republicans to join us and to join the American \npeople in telling the President he is wrong and he cannot stand in the \nway of progress for our young kids. I hope the disappointment felt by \nkids and their families today is going to be washed away in the weeks \nto come by another bipartisan show of support for this outstanding and \ncritical health care program in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12699-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12699-S12701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR DOMENICI'S RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have all seen the news that our \nfriend and colleague, Pete Domenici, is planning to announce today that \nhe will retire from the Senate at the conclusion of his term. Senator \nDomenici called me yesterday afternoon to tell me of this decision. My \nreaction was one of surprise first, and then that gave way to \nadmiration and appreciation for this man's decision to conclude his \ndistinguished career of public service on his own terms.\n  He and his wife Nancy are traveling to Albuquerque this morning for \nthe announcement this afternoon. This is a great gesture to the people \nof New Mexico, and in New Mexico the Domenicis will be greeted with the \naffection and respect which they richly deserve.\n\n[[Page S12700]]\n\n  When I arrived in the Senate in 1983, Pete Domenici was then a 10-\nyear veteran of this place, and he was here to welcome me at that time. \nIn his 34 years in the Senate, Pete has earned a reputation as a fierce \nand effective champion for New Mexico. While he and I have not agreed \non some issues, I have never questioned his commitment to do what he \nbelieved was right for our State and for this country.\n  Today, and during his entire Senate career, Pete has achieved what \nall of us try to achieve; that is, to be effective in getting results \nin Washington, while also staying close to the people who have sent us \nhere to represent them.\n  Pete and I, of course, have worked together on many issues and \nprojects, but our most productive collaboration has been on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. For the last few years, he has been \nthe most senior Republican, and I have been the most senior Democrat. \nIn the last Congress, when Pete was chairman of the committee and I was \nthe ranking Democrat, we were able to secure passage of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. Pete deserves substantial credit for the passage of \nthat important legislation.\n  Senator Domenici's announcement today is not, I am glad to say, that \nhe is leaving the Senate at this time. His announcement will be that he \nwill serve out his term, but he will not stand for reelection to \nanother term. He has assured me that he expects the remaining 15 months \nof his service in the Senate to be productive and, knowing Pete, I am \nsure they will be.\n  There will be time later for valedictories. For today, we will listen \nto Senator Domenici's announcement and send our thanks and best wishes \nto him and to Nancy.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of our most \ndistinguished Senior Senators, and a personal friend of mine, Pete \nDomenici of New Mexico, who yesterday announced he will retire at the \nend of this Congress.\n  The son of Italian immigrants, Senator Domenici has accomplished many \nthings in his long and distinguished career. Growing up in Albuquerque, \nhe worked in his father's wholesale grocery business. After earning a \ndegree in education from the University of New Mexico in 1954, he \npitched for the Albuquerque Dukes, a farm club of the old Brooklyn \nDodgers. He left baseball to be a teacher, and then earned a law degree \nin 1958.\n  Senator Domenici's life of public service began in 1966, when he was \nelected to the Albuquerque City Commission. In 1972, he was elected to \nthe United States Senate, where he has served with dedication and \ndistinction ever since. Pete Domenici was my home State Senator when I \nclerked for the New Mexico Supreme Court. At the time, I never thought \nthat one day I would have the privilege of calling myself a colleague \nof Senator Domenici.\n  Pete has been a tireless champion for the public land states of the \nWest. He understands the challenges facing an arid climate, including \nwater resources management in the face of drought and the conflicts \nover water allocation, as well as public lands management and issues \nrelating to resource extraction, forest health and grazing.\n  Pete has worked tirelessly to ensure that our Nation has the energy \nresources it will need to meet the growing demand well into the 21st \ncentury. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides the incentives and the \nFederal support required to meet these future energy needs. It also \nencourages energy efficiency and conservation, as well as the \ndevelopment of clean, non-emitting resources.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate, I served on the Budget \nCommittee, which was then chaired by Pete Domenici. I could not have \nasked for a better mentor on the complex issues related to the Federal \nbudget process. I also served on the Energy Committee, where Pete has \nbeen both Chairman and Ranking Member.\n  Senator Domenici has also been a stalwart leader and champion in the \nbattle to provide persons with mental illness equal access to health \ncare services. In 1996, Senator Domenici teamed with then-Senator Paul \nWellstone to pass the first Federal law intended to help persons with \nmental illness acquire protections and access to care.\n  Fortunately, Senator Domenici understood that more could and should \nbe done. So it was with pleasure I was able to work with him to craft \nS. 558, the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007, which has passed the \nSenate. This bill will help ensure that insurance companies begin \ntreating illnesses of the mind on the same level as illnesses of the \nbody.\n  I also want to acknowledge his work to help protect Federal programs \nserving our citizens who battle mental illness. He has, over the years, \nauthored and supported policies improving Medicare and Medicaid for \npersons living with these diseases. His compassion and leadership will \nbe greatly missed by the mental health community, and I personally will \nmiss his insight and knowledge in the U.S. Senate.\n  In closing, let me wish you and your wife Nancy the very best on your \nretirement and return to your beloved State, New Mexico.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I speak about my \nfriend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, who will \nannounce later today he will not seek a seventh term and will return, \ninstead, to his beloved New Mexico at the end of this Congress.\n  Pete was born to Alda and Cherubino Domenici, and he has never \nforgotten where he came from and what he was sent here to do by the \npeople of his State. He grew up learning about the value of hard work \nas an employee each afternoon in his father's wholesale grocery \nbusiness while attending school in Albuquerque during the day. At the \nUniversity of New Mexico, Pete found an early calling for public \nservice and earned a degree in education. He was a remarkable athlete \nas well and became a pitcher, briefly, for the Albuquerque Dukes, the \nfarm team of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and then taught math at junior high \nschool while he earned his law degree.\n  In 1966, Pete was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission, where \nhe served until he was elected to the Senate in 1972. He is now the \nlongest serving Senator in New Mexico history. For some 35 years, he \nhas been an outstanding colleague, admired and respected by all of us \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Pete will be remembered by all Americans as a brilliant and tireless \nchampion for the rights of those with mental illness. His tenacity and \ncommitment led, in 1996, to the passage of the first legislation to end \ndiscrimination against people with mental illness. More than anyone, \nPete understood that such discrimination prevented vast numbers of \npeople with mental illness from receiving the care and treatment and, \nfrequently, the cure they deserved. Over the past 5 years, I have had \nthe privilege of working closely with Pete to improve that original \nlegislation. His passion and perseverance to achieve full equality in \nthe covering of mental and physical illness has never wavered. The \nrecent Senate passage of the Mental Health Parity Act is a tribute to \nPete and the result of his extraordinary dedication and ability.\n  I am sure Pete and Nancy thought long and hard about the decision to \nretire from the Senate and that it wasn't an easy choice to make. But I \nknow they will have much more time to spend with their eight children \nand the wonderful people and breathtaking mountains of New Mexico. We \nare fortunate that we will have at least another year to work together \non the issues we care so deeply about.\n  As we prepare to say farewell to our great friend, I am reminded of \nthe lines of the New Mexico State song:\n\n     O, Fair New Mexico,\n     We love, we love you so,\n     Our hearts with pride o'reflow,\n     No matter where we go.\n     O, Fair New Mexico.\n\n  No matter where Pete goes, we will always love and respect him, miss \nhis leadership, his statesmanship and, most of all, his friendship.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, I have come to the floor every day this \nweek to highlight the plight of the Burmese citizens who have bravely \nprotested for democratic reform. I have also tried to focus attention \non the brutal actions that the ruling military junta, the State Peace \nand Development Council, or SPDC, has taken to crack down on its own \npeople.\n  The whole world watched with horror as Buddhist monks, armed with \nnothing but prayers for peace, met uniformed thugs armed with rifles \nsent to do their Government's bidding. Untold numbers have been \nslaughtered, more are unjustly imprisoned, and the Burmese citizens who \nare left are afraid to step outside of their homes. The SPDC's swift \nand barbaric punishment of the Burmese people seems like a relic from \nanother era. But what we have seen on our television sets is all too \nreal.\n  I thank my fellow Senators for shining a spotlight on the actions of \nthe SPDC this week to reveal them for the despots they are.\n  I was encouraged when, on Monday, my colleagues adopted a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution we offered with Senator Kerry condemning the SPDC \nfor its violent crackdown against the peaceful protesters. And \nyesterday, Senators Boxer and Murkowski held a hearing of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs on the atrocities in Burma. I appreciated the opportunity to be \nover there and testify at that hearing, along with others. Democratic \nreform in Burma is an issue that has received far too little interest \nfor a very long time. But the strong bipartisan support in Congress is \nencouraging.\n  To see significant change in Burma, ultimately the U.N. Security \nCouncil will have to enact meaningful sanctions on the SPDC. Only then \nwill the Government be pressured to move toward peaceful \nreconciliation. And for the U.N. Security Council to move, China must \nbe persuaded to move. Many changes need to happen in Burma, but until \nthey do, I will continue to act and to advocate on behalf of the \nBurmese people on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12701-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12701-S12702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Republicans and Democrats have been \ndebating all year long about the troops. This has not been a debate \nabout who wants to bring them home. Frankly, all of us want to bring \nthem home. It has been a debate about whom do you trust to decide when \nthese troops come home, about who has the authority and judgment to \nmake decisions about how to protect our national security interests in \nthe Persian Gulf. Republicans think it should be the Commander in Chief \nin consultation with his commanders on the ground. We don't think our \nforeign policy should be drafted by MoveOn.org or CODEPINK.\n  However, on one thing we have almost all agreed: When we have forces \nin the field, we ought to fund them. Once they are over there, you do \nnot leave them guessing about whether they are going to eat or be \nclothed or have the equipment they need to do their jobs, and you don't \nleave their replacement units wondering whether they will be trained or \nequipped.\n  In the heat of the first Iraq debate, we passed by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 82 to 16 the Gregg resolution expressing the sense \nof Congress that no funds should be cut off or even reduced for troops \nin the field which would result in undermining their safety or their \nability to complete their mission. We passed, by an overwhelming 96-to-\n2 vote, the Murray resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nno action should be taken to undermine the safety of the Armed Forces \nof the United States or impact their ability to complete their \nmissions. And we repeatedly rejected the Feingold amendment as recently \nas yesterday, once again, that would cut off funds for the troops after \na date certain next June regardless of whether they have completed \ntheir mission.\n  Under the Feingold amendment, which forbids U.S. troops from fighting \nanyone but al-Qaida and its affiliates, we would have to deploy a \nbrigade of lawyers to interview the enemy, and we would lose the \nability to gather the kind of intelligence from Iraqis themselves--\nintelligence that has been an invaluable component of the Petraeus plan \nso far. The Iraqi people are talking to us now because they feel safer \nhaving U.S. troops around. Pulling those troops out of the \nneighborhoods and replacing them with snipers in helicopters would cut \nus off from the very people who are helping us find the targets in the \nfirst place.\n  This Senate has argued for months about Iraq, but on this one point \nalmost all of us have agreed again and again and again: You don't cut \nfunds to troops who are already in the field. Yet now it seems even \nthat may be about to change.\n  All last year, the Democrats complained that the President was hiding \nhis spending requests for the war by leaving them out of the Defense \nspending bill and putting them into a supplemental instead. So earlier \nthis year, he responded to those criticisms in good faith by making his \nrequest in concert with the DOD appropriations bill. He said we would \nneed about $150 billion for 2008.\n  The majority has been sitting on this request for 8 months, and now \nthey have made a conscious decision to leave it out of the Defense \nspending bill altogether. Some of them are arguing that the Defense \nDepartment has the legal authority to sustain the war on its own. That \nis right, they could do that, but what the Defense Department cannot do \nis plan ahead without a future spending commitment from this Congress. \nThey cannot plan for training, equipment, feeding, or protecting our \ntroops until they know the money will be there beyond the immediate \nfuture, and they cannot plan to be ready for any other operations that \nmight arise outside of the current conflicts. This is no way to run a \nDefense Department, it is no way to treat the troops, and it is \nentirely inconsistent with the expressions of support for the troops \nthat we registered with the Gregg and Murray resolutions and which we \nreaffirmed repeatedly, including yesterday, by rejecting the Feingold \namendment.\n\n  All summer, America and its allies waited for GEN David Petraeus to \ncome to the Hill and tell us about the prospects in Iraq. We were \nencouraged when he told us the military objectives of his strategy were \nin large measure being met. We were proud when he told us that in the \nface of tough enemies and the brutal summer heat, coalition and Iraqi \nsecurity forces had achieved real progress toward achieving their \ngoals, in large part because they dealt what he described as a \n``significant blow''--a significant blow--to al-Qaida.\n  General Petraeus recommended that as a result of these early \nsuccesses, we can begin to draw down our troops beginning this year. \nThat drawdown has already begun. Last month, the Marine Expeditionary \nUnit that was deployed as part of the surge left Iraq after a job well \ndone. A combat brigade team will leave in mid-December, with four \nothers and two surge marine battalions to follow in the first half of \nnext year. This was General Petraeus's cautious but expert plan for \nbuilding on the successes we have made in Iraq. The President accepted \nthat plan, and a majority of Americans, including a majority of \nDemocrats, if we are to believe the polls, think it is a good idea.\n  We have a new strategy in Iraq, according to the general in charge. \nIt is working, and we owe it to the men and women in the field, first \nof all, to keep a commitment we have already made to fund them while \nthey are carrying out that strategy. We cannot, we must not close this \nsession without providing the funding these troops need.\n  We also owe it to them to bring them home in a way that reflects the \nbest judgment of their commanders. General Petraeus gave us a rare and \nvaluable glimpse into the minds of our soldiers and marines when he \ntestified on Capitol Hill last month. General Petraeus said:\n\n       None of us want to stay in Iraq forever. We all want to \n     come home. We all have days of frustration and all the rest \n     of that. But what we want to do is come home the right way, \n     having added to the heritage of our services,\n\n[[Page S12702]]\n\n     accomplished the mission that our country has laid out for \n     us.\n\n  That is what General Petraeus had to say. Then he gave us an idea of \nthe caliber of the men and women who are serving our country in Iraq. \nTalking more about the commitment they have to their task, here is what \nGeneral Petraeus said:\n\n       I think that that's a very important factor in what our \n     soldiers are doing, in addition to the fact that, frankly, \n     they also just respect the individuals with whom they are \n     carrying out this important mission, the men and women on \n     their right and left who share very important values, among \n     them selfless service and devotion to duty. And that, indeed, \n     is a huge factor in why many of us continue to serve and to \n     stay in uniform, because the privilege of serving with such \n     individuals is truly enormous.\n\n  The Defense Department is currently revising its spending requests \nfor the current fiscal year, but that is no reason to deny the funds it \nalready said it needs to get through the spring. The fact that we are \nwaiting on a request for more is not an excuse to deliver nothing.\n  The men and women who are serving our country deserve better. Let's \nnot pass up the chance to acknowledge their ``selfless service and \ndevotion to duty'' by giving them exactly what they need--before we \nconclude this session of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12702-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3211) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted and Proposed.''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to present to the U.S. Senate \nthe bill to fund the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and our science \nagencies. I want to thank Senators Reid and McConnell for agreeing to \nbring up the CJS bill, and Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for \nthe CJS Subcommittee's robust 302(b) allocation. This is a bipartisan \nbill. Senator Shelby and I worked hand-in-hand. I thank him and his \nexcellent staff for their partnership.\n  The CJS bill totals $54 billion in discretionary budget authority. \nDid we spend more than the President asked for? You bet we did. We are \nproud that our bill is $3.2 billion above the President's budget \nrequest.\n  Let's talk about how we spent the money. The subcommittee had three \npriorities:\n  Security--keeping 300 million Americans safe from terrorism and \nviolent crime.\n  Innovation--investments in science and technology to create jobs that \nwill stay in the United States.\n  Accountability--fiscal accountability and stewardship of taxpayer \ndollars, standing sentry against waste, fraud and abuse.\n  The subcommittee's first priority is protecting America from \nterrorism and violent crime. The Justice Department is almost 50 \npercent of the CJS bill. Funding for Justice totals almost $25 billion, \n$2.1 billion more than the President's request. The CJS bill funds our \nmajor Federal law enforcement agencies, and our State and local cops on \nthe beat.\n  CJS funds the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI. The FBI is our \ndomestic national security agency. It has a dual mission--disrupting \nterrorism on U.S. soil--tracking and taking down terror cells and \ndismantling dirty bombs, as well as fighting violent crime in our \ncommunities. The CJS bill provides $6.6 billion for the FBI, $150 \nmillion more than the President's budget request. This includes almost \n$4 billion for FBI counterterrorism. Our bill will put 230 new \ncounterterrorism agents on the beat and give agents new tools to \ncollect intelligence to protect Americans here at home. At the same \ntime, the President's budget cut 100 FBI agents dedicated to fighting \nviolent crime. This is outrageous--because for the first time in almost \n15 years, violent crime has increased. Robberies are up 7 percent. \nHomicides are up 2 percent. Nearly every region of the country has been \naffected--from large cities to small communities. We've heard from our \ncolleagues that the FBI needs more agents fighting violent crime in \ntheir communities. The CJS bill rejects the President's irresponsible \ncut. We provide full funding to retain 100 FBI agents that the \nPresident eliminated.\n  The CJS bill also funds the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. The \nDEA is an international agency--in over 60 countries, with significant \nlocal responsibilities. It's fighting a $330 billion annual drug trade \nin over 60 countries around the world. Drugs finance over two-thirds of \nall terrorist activity, including the Taliban. The DEA is in \nAfghanistan fighting narcoterrorism, working hand-in-hand with our \nmilitary to disrupt the poppy trade that funds terrorist networks. And \nthe DEA is in our communities, fighting the scourge of illegal drugs \nlike heroin and meth that destroy our neighborhoods. We were horrified \nto learn that the DEA has a hiring freeze. The DEA can't hire new \nagents. This is outrageous--so we added $50 million to DEA to lift the \nhiring freeze so DEA can hire up 200 new agents to fight drugs at home \nand abroad.\n  The CJS bill funds the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, ATF, which investigates arson and stops illegal firearms \ntrafficking. The ATF is working hand-in-hand with our military to \ndisable the improvised explosive devices, IEDs, that are so perilous to \nour troops on the battlefield. We provide robust support for our U.S. \nMarshals Service, keeping our marshals on the beat to track down \ndangerous fugitives--including sexual predators and drug kingpins--\nprotect\n\n[[Page S12703]]\n\nFederal judges and provide security at terrorist trials here in the \nU.S. and in Afghanistan.\n  The CJS bill is also the most important source of Federal funding for \nthe frontline men and women of our State and local police forces, \nworking tirelessly to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. Our \ncops on the beat are working harder than ever to fight rising violent \ncrime. And our State and local police are often the first to identify \nsuspected terrorist activities in their communities. At the same time, \nState and local budgets are under increased stress. So we were deeply \ntroubled by the President's draconian cuts of almost $1.5 billion from \ngrant funds for State and local police. The CJS bill rejects these \noutrageous cuts. Instead we provide a total of $2.7 billion to give our \ncops the tools they need to fight crime, gangs, drugs, domestic \nviolence, and crimes against children.\n  Our bill provides $660 million for Byrne formula grants. President \nBush eliminated Byrne grants formula grants to States that pay for \npolice and prosecutors, training and technology, and require a 25-\npercent State match. The first President Bush named these grants for \nEdward Byrne, a New York City police officer killed in the line of \nfire. If Byrne grants were good enough for Bush 41, why aren't they \ngood enough for this President Bush?\n  We also provide $550 million for Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, grants. President Bush only asked for $32 million to \nterminate COPS grants. COPS is a competitive grant program that pays \nfor police salaries and overtime, police technology, and equipment like \nsurveillance cameras and interoperable communications equipment. The \nCJS bill makes sure that our cops are not walking the thin blue line \ndrawn through green eyeshades.\n  The CJS bill provides over $300 million to prevent, investigate and \nprosecute despicable crimes against children. This includes: $55 \nmillion for a new national initiative for grants to State and locals to \nlocate, arrest and prosecute child sexual predators; $65 million to \nfight child abduction and exploitation and locate missing children; $9 \nmillion for the FBI's Innocent Images project--for agents and \ntechnology to track the deviants who use the Internet to prey on our \nchildren; $8 million for the U.S. Marshals to apprehend fugitive sexual \npredators and get them off our streets and out of our neighborhoods; \n$10 million for grants to keep kids safe from violence at school.\n\n  Our second priority for the CJS bill is investing in America's future \ncompetitiveness. We added $1 billion above the President's request for \nscience, education and economic development to foster job creation--for \njobs that will stay in this country and to inspire and train our future \nscientists and engineers. We based our funding levels on the best ideas \nfrom outside experts like the National Academy of Sciences. We took the \npolitics out of science. The CJS bill implements the framework of the \nrecently enacted America COMPETES Act. This bipartisan legislation \nrecommended investments in science and education to improve America's \nglobal competitiveness.\n  We provide $6.5 billion for the National Science Foundation, NSF, \n$125 million above the President's budget request. NSF is important \nbecause it funds 20 percent of all federally supported basic research \nconducted by America's colleges and universities in many fields such as \nmath and computer science. NSF is the major source of federal support. \nNSF keeps the U.S. on the leading edge of discovery in areas like \nastronomy and geology. And NSF supports our college and universities' \nefforts to educate our next generation of scientists and engineers, \nincluding at our historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs.\n  We provide $860 million for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST. NIST is important because it sets standards that are \ncritical to successful commerce, and transfers technology to American \nindustry. Our recommendations provide $100 million for the Technology \nInnovation Partnership program, which will replace the Advanced \nTechnology Program to foster the development of the newest \ntechnologies, and $110 for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, \nMEP, which helps U.S. manufacturers to be more competitive.\n  The bill also provides $17.5 billion for NASA, $150 million above the \nPresident's budget request. NASA is our No. 1 innovation agency. No \nother agency has the ability to inspire our future scientists and \nengineers like NASA does. The bill keeps our commitment to human space \nflight. It fully funds the space shuttle at $4 billion and the space \nstation at $2.2 billion. And we provide $3.9 billion to Ares and Orion, \nthe next generation vehicle. The space shuttle will be retired in 2010. \nWe must continue to have safe, reliable space transportation.\n  Later, I will offer an amendment with Senators Hutchison, Shelby and \nLandrieu to finally begin to pay the bill of returning the space \nshuttle to flight after the Columbia tragedy. To ensure that we \ncontinue to have the premier space agency in the world, NASA must have \na balanced portfolio of human space flight, science and aeronautics \nresearch.\n  In the area of Earth science, the bill includes $25 million above the \nbudget request to begin to implement the recommendations of the recent \nEarth Science Decadal Survey, the top priorities of the scientific \ncommunity, and missions we need to accomplish to help us better \nunderstand and predict the Earth's environment and climate.\n  For aeronautics research, we provide $554 million. This is so \ncritical because we must rise to the challenge of our international \ncompetitors. Aeronautics is an area that we would have liked to do \nmore. As our bill moves to conference with the other body, we hope to \nbe able to add funding for aeronautics.\n  A strong patent system is critical to an innovation-friendly \ngovernment. We provide $1.9 billion for the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, PTO--this is full access to all fees. We know there have been \nconcerns that the PTO's fees have been used to pay for other \npriorities. Senator Shelby and I are committed to giving PTO full \naccess to the resources it needs. Our bill will allow the PTO to hire \n1,200 new patent examiners to reduce application backlogs and \nprocessing times. We are livid that it takes almost 3 years for the PTO \nto make a decision on a patent application. Through our oversight, we \nhave required PTO to implement management reforms to reduce the backlog \nof applications, while ensuring quality.\n  The CJS bill also provides $420 million for the International Trade \nAdministration, ITA, to investigate unfair trade practices and enforce \nour trade laws. It includes $48 million for the United States Trade \nRepresentative, USTR, to negotiate trade agreements that protect our \nintellectual property.\n  For the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, the \nbill provides $4.2 billion, $400 million above the President's budget \nrequest. This includes $795 million to implement the bipartisan \nrecommendations of the Joint Ocean Commission. Seventy percent of the \nEarth is covered by oceans, but only 5 percent of the oceans are \nexplored. Our Nation's economy depends on the oceans. Oceans contribute \n$120 billion to our economy and support over 2 million jobs. The bill \nalso provides full funding for the National Weather Service, which is \nso important to saving lives and livelihoods.\n  I think my colleagues would be interested in knowing that the CJS \nbill funds 85 percent of all federal climate change science. That's \nabout $1.6 billion for peer-reviewed basic research at NSF, atmospheric \nweather and climate research at NOAA, and NASA Earth science missions \nstudying. As we look for solutions to this crisis, the CJS bill will \ncontinue to give us sound science to inform our policy decisions.\n  The CJS bill emphasizes oversight, accountability and fiscal \nstewardship. Let me tell my colleagues--there's a new sherriff in town. \nIt's a bipartisan posse against cost overruns, ineffective management \nand mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. The CJS Subcommittee, through \nits oversight, has uncovered enormous cost overruns and schedule \nslippages. NOAA's satellite program was $4 billion over budget. NSF's \nresearch equipment was $25 million over budget. At the appropriate \ntime, I will offer an amendment to prevent this mismanagement and get \nour agencies back to fiscal discipline.\n  Through our oversight, we also uncovered dramatic backlogs at PTO and \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity\n\n[[Page S12704]]\n\nCommission, EEOC. And we required effective, efficient management \nreform. The CJS bill insists on discipline and vigorous oversight. It \nrequires each agency to notify the committee about cost overruns \ngreater than 10 percent, bans funding for lavish banquets, and requires \nthat inspectors general conduct random audits of grant funding.\n  Unfortunately, the President threatened to veto the CJS bill. He \ndoesn't support funding for these additional investments I have \noutlined. The CJS bill reflects bipartisan priorities to make America \nsafer and smarter. I think these investments in fighting terrorism and \nviolent crime, and educating our future scientists and engineers, are \nwise uses of taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me be clear--we didn't overspend; the President under funded. It \nis not lavish to lift the DEA hiring freeze so we starve terrorists of \ntheir financing, or to give our men and women in blue the tools they \nneed to keep us safe.\n  The President should not veto this bill. Instead, together we should \nveto funding for the Taliban and jobs moving overseas. I believe that, \nif necessary, the Senate will stand up for our families, neighborhoods \nand communities by standing up against the President's veto. Let's veto \njobs going overseas; let's veto the Taliban.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Shelby and his staff for their \ncooperation and collegiality. This is a fair and balanced bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it. For the information of our \ncolleagues, Senator Shelby and I intend to move this bill quickly. We \nencourage Members with amendments to come to the floor and offer them \nnow. The bill fully complies with the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation \nso any amendments will need offsets. It also fully complies with the \nrecently enacted Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.\n  Mr. President, in a short time, I will be joined by my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alabama, who is my ranking member. \nHe, too, will be making his opening statement. I thank Senators Reid \nand McConnell for agreeing to bring up this billand Chairman Byrd and \nRanking Member Cochran for a rather robust 302(b) allocation to let \nthis bill go forward.\n  First, let me say to my colleagues in the Senate as they watch this \ndebate that this bill is a bipartisan bill. The Senator from Alabama, \nMr. Shelby, and I worked hand in hand to craft a bill that is in the \nbest interest of the United States of America and not trying to score \npartisan political points. That is what we have done.\n  The Commerce-Justice-Science bill promotes a strong economy, promotes \na safer country, and also promotes U.S. competitiveness in the world.\n  The CJS bill totals $54 billion in discretionary budget authority. \nDid we spend more than the President asked for? You bet we did, and we \nare proud that our bill is $3.2 billion above the President's request \nbecause we put the money primarily into security. We spent the money in \nthis bill on security, keeping 300 million Americans safe from \nterrorism and also fighting violent crime. We also promoted innovation \nand competitiveness by investing in scientific research and technology \nand the scientific education of our people. But we were also strong \nstewards of the taxpayers' money and have promoted accountability, \nfiscal accountability, and stewardship of taxpayers' dollars. We, \nworking on a bipartisan basis, stood sentry against waste, fraud and \nabuse and we have put our language also in the checkbook.\n\n  The subcommittee's first priority is to protect the American people--\nto protect the American people from terrorism, a war without borders, a \nwar without a front. We also want to protect them here at home against \nviolent crime, against murder, mayhem, sexual predators stalking our \nchildren, violence against women, looking out for our children, and \nmaking sure there are enough cops on the beat.\n  The Justice Department is almost 50 percent of the CJS bill. Funding \nfor the Justice component totals over $25 billion. But remember what we \ndo: We fund the Federal law enforcement agencies--the FBI, the DEA, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as our \nMarshals Service. Our major law enforcement count on us. But who else \nalso counts on us? State and local cops on the beat. We have put the \nmoney into the Federal checkbook to say: As you go after the bad guys, \nwe are absolutely on your side.\n  Let us start with our primary responsibility as a Federal government, \nand that is funding the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is \nour premier domestic law enforcement agency. It has a dual mission. One \nis fighting violent crime in our communities, and in that it is well \nknown, well established, and well respected. But after that terrible \nattack on the United States, we had to decide how we were going to have \na domestic agency also focus on terrorism. We didn't create a new \nFederal agency to do that because we didn't want a new bureaucracy. We \nwanted a new and fresh effort against terrorism. So we gave it to the \nFBI. If you read all the British spy novels and so on, the FBI is akin \nto the MI5 in England.\n  This bill provides $6.6 billion for the FBI. That is $6.6 billion for \nthe FBI, which is $150 million more than the President's budget. This \nincludes almost $4 billion for their counterterrorism effort. To make \nsure we are fighting terrorism effectively, our bill also puts 230 new \ncounterterrorism agents out there and gives them new tools to protect \nAmericans at home.\n  At the same time, we want to make sure we are fighting violent crime. \nWe have been very concerned about some of the budget games going on at \nJustice and OMB, where they keep moving agents around, out of their job \nof fighting crime to fight terrorism so those numbers look good; then \nthey eliminate those vacancies, and there we are. We need our FBI doing \nboth. Violent crime in America has increased 2 percent. Homicides are \nup 2 percent and robberies are up 7 percent. Nearly every region of the \ncountry has been affected, from very large cities to small communities.\n  We have heard from our colleagues the FBI needs more agents and more \nhelp fighting violent crime in their communities. The CJS bill rejects \nthe President's cut. We provide funding to retain 100 FBI agents that \nthe President eliminated. Eliminating FBI agents when we are fighting \ncrime and fighting terrorism? I don't think that is a good idea. I \ndon't think that is a good idea at all. On a bipartisan basis, we \nrejected that foolhardy recommendation. So we will be there for the \nFBI.\n  But they are not the only ones fighting terrorism and fighting crime \nin our streets. The other is the DEA. It is an international agency as \nwell as an all-American agency. It is in over 60 countries. Yet, at the \nsame time, has very strong border and local responsibilities. Fighting \na $330 billion international drug trade, they need help. Drugs finance \nover two-thirds of the terrorist activities. It comes out of \nAfghanistan, from the poppy fields of Afghanistan, and they are seeing \none of the biggest crops they have ever had. That money goes to funding \nthe Taliban and funding terrorist activity.\n  The DEA is, right now, in Afghanistan fighting narcoterrorism, \nworking hand-in-hand with the Karzai Government, working hand-in-hand \nwith our military to disrupt that poppy trade. But right now they are \nalso in our streets and our neighborhoods working with our local police \nchiefs, working with our local sheriffs, working with our local FBI, \nfighting to keep the scourge of illegal drugs, ranging from heroin to \nmeth, from destroying our neighborhoods.\n  We were horrified during the committee hearing to learn that DEA has \na hiring freeze. A hiring freeze on drug enforcement agents? Oh, my \ngosh. Foolhardy. Foolhardy. This is outrageous. So, again, working on a \nbipartisan basis, we added a modest $50 million to DEA to lift this \nhiring freeze so they can now hire up to 200 new agents to fight drugs \nat home, drugs in schools, and drugs overseas.\n  We have also funded the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives, which does everything from investigating arson to stopping \nillegal firearms trafficking. They are also working hand-in-hand with \nour military to come up with ways to deal with these terrible \nimprovised explosive devices.\n  We also provide robust support for our Marshals Service, where we ask \nthem to track down everyone from dangerous fugitives to sexual \npredators. They protect our Federal judges,\n\n[[Page S12705]]\n\nthey provide security at terrorist trials, and they are doing a good \njob, so we need to support them.\n  Where we have also made another significant effort, though, when it \ncomes to State and local law enforcement in the CJS bill, is the most \nimportant source of Federal funding for that thin blue line of local \nlaw enforcement that is out there every day working tirelessly to keep \nour families, our schools, and our neighborhoods safe. Our cops on the \nbeat are working harder than ever to fight this rising tide of violent \ncrime. Our local and State police are often the first to identify \nsuspected terrorist activities, but their budgets are under increased \nstress. So we were deeply troubled when the President came in with \ndraconian cuts to the State and local police.\n\n  What did the administration do? Well, first of all, in that famous \nCops on the Beat Program that helped local law enforcement have more \nofficers, they reduced the funding to a skimpy, Spartan $32 million for \nthe whole country to put cops on the beat. One State alone could use \nthat. At the same time, they eliminated the Byrne grants. The Byrne \ngrants are those Federal funds named after Edward Byrne, a police \nofficer from New York killed in the line of duty, and this program was \nto help local law enforcement have the tools, the technology they need \nto protect themselves so they can protect us. That was eliminated.\n  We are spending a fortune on so many other things, such as the war in \nIraq, and yet we eliminated the Byrne grants? Well, this committee \nstepped up to it and we have added $1.5 billion for grants for the \nState and local police. These funds will fight crime, gangs, meth, \nviolence in the schools, and we think it is terrific. Our bill will \nprovide $660 million for the Byrne grant formula. It will pay for the \nimproved technology they need, improved training and police and \nprosecutors.\n  We also added $550 million to the community policing efforts, which \nis a competitive grant program that enables them to bring more police \ninto their department, paying their salaries and their overtime. We \nstand with the frontline. We stand with the thin blue line.\n  We are also protecting ourselves against other threats. We do not \nwant to have a declining economy or a declining ability to compete in \nthe world. So our committee fostered innovation and competitiveness. So \nwhen we look at those things in our legislation, we added more money. \nWe implemented the recently enacted bipartisan bill called the COMPETES \nAct. We added $1 billion to the science and commerce part of this bill, \nand $6.5 billion for the National Science Foundation. We provided $860 \nmillion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We \nprovide close to $2 billion to the Patent and Trademark Office, to make \nsure they are fully functioning and dealing with the backlogs. We fund \nthe ITA and our International Trade Representative.\n  We also have two premier science agencies, one is NOAA, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We provide $4.2 billion for \nthat, which is $400 million above the President's request; and $795 \nmillion to implement the bipartisan recommendations of the Joint Ocean \nCommission. We also provided money to look into Federal climate change. \nThis is not new for this committee. The NSF, NOAA, and NASA provide 85 \npercent of all the Federal research looking at climate change. As we \nwork on policy, as we try to find sensible solutions that are \naffordable to our country, they are going to turn to science, and in \nturning to science, we need to make sure we have funded them.\n  Last, but not at all least, a very important agency--NASA. Today is \nthe 50th anniversary of Sputnik. Fifty years ago, the Russians launched \ninto space a 180-pound satellite that shook the cosmos. It shook the \ncosmos and it said that the Russians were the first in space. Well, we \nknew we couldn't let that lie. So President Eisenhower answered that \ncall with robust efforts in science and particularly the National \nScience Foundation.\n  A few years later, 3 years later, a dynamic President, named Jack \nKennedy, put out a national goal that we were going to go to the Moon, \nwe would be there first and return our astronauts safely. Well, 50 \nyears later, we honor that legacy by providing $17.5 billion for NASA, \n$150 million above the President's request, to keep our commitment to a \nbalanced space program--the space shuttle, the space station, and the \nnext-generation space vehicle.\n  We make significant efforts in science and aeronautics, and I will \ntalk more about that later when I will offer an amendment, along with \nmy colleagues, Senators Shelby, Hutchison, Landrieu, and Nelson, on how \nto help NASA continue to meet its responsibility.\n  In conclusion, let me say this committee has been strongly committed \nto reform, strongly committed to accountability and oversight and \nfiscal stewardship. Through our oversight, we uncovered cost overruns \non the NOAA satellite programs, with $4 billion over budget; the NSF's \nresearch equipment program, $25 million over budget; and dramatic \nbacklogs at the Patent Office and backlogs at the EEOC. We said we were \nnot going to allow that.\n  We also found that some of our funds were going into things such as \nlavish conferences, lobster rolls, and limousines. Well, you are going \nto have an amendment later on that is going to take that right out. \nWhen we give money to these agencies to do the kind of training we want \nthem to do, it is not to sit around sipping chardonnay and eating \nlobster rolls and so on. So if you will pardon the expression, we told \nthem ``to take a cab.'' Our bill continues to do that.\n\n  I hope the President doesn't veto our bill. We will talk about that \nmore in conclusion. Again, this bill is a bipartisan bill. I presented \nit to the Senate and now I compliment my ranking member, Senator \nShelby, and his staff.\n  Our staffs have worked together. I wish the taxpayers could see it; \nthey would be proud of us. They would be proud of our working \nrelationship, and that is why we produced a bill that works for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will not replicate what Senator Mikulski \nwent through. She has done a very thorough explanation of the bill. \nThis is a very complex bill. It funds Commerce-Justice-Science--NASA, \nfor example--and related agencies. I will touch on some things.\n  I chaired this committee before and Senator Mikulski was the ranking \nDemocrat on the committee. Now she chairs it and I am the ranking \nmember. She probably has related on many occasions that we go back to \nour House days. We were on the Energy and Commerce Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives, working together then on a lot of these same \nissues but perhaps manifested in different ways.\n  This bill funds a number of our Nation's most important programs and \ninitiatives, and I am pleased to outline some of the highlights. I \nthank Senator Mikulski, the chair of the committee. She works well with \nus, our staffs work together, and we tried to bring forth a bill that \nreflects our strong bipartisan relationship.\n  This bill was crafted with a tight allocation of $54 billion. Within \nthese limitations, the subcommittee was forced to strike a difficult \nbalance between the competing priorities of law enforcement, terrorism \nprevention, research, space exploration, and U.S. competitiveness \nthrough investing in science.\n  For the Department of Justice, the committee's recommendation is \n$24.3, $2 billion over the request. The President's budget request cut \nover $1.6 billion from State and local law enforcement at a time when \nviolent crime is on the rise. Chairwoman Mikulski and I worked together \nto ensure that law enforcement receives the funding and support it \nneeds to begin to address the increased crime problem and help protect \nour citizens and our communities all over this country.\n  The bill also provides the Department of Commerce with $7.35 \nbillion--$754 million over the budget request. The Commerce Department \noversees some of our Nation's most important business development, \neconomic analysis, and science and research agencies, including the \nEconomic Development Administration, the National Institutes of Science \nand Technology, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA. Our bill provides $4.2 billion for NOAA, an \nincrease\n\n[[Page S12706]]\n\nof $405 million over the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The committee \nbelieves it is critical to the overall health of NOAA to restore \nfunding to programs that suffered over the past year under static \nfunding levels.\n  Also, existing competitive grant programs were given increased \nfunding and new competitive grant programs were created in an effort to \nreduce earmarks. The subcommittee's bill also provides $7.5 billion for \nNASA, an increase of $150 million over the request. This funding will \nallow NASA to move forward with crew explanation and crew launch \nvehicles while also funding the ongoing activities of the space \nshuttle, the International Space Station, and other important research \nactivities.\n  This bill funds the National Science Foundation at $124 million above \nthe request. Nearly all the additional funds go toward investments into \nthe scientific education of our students, from kindergarten to \ndoctorates. Combined with the funding for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, the funding provides more than the request \nfor the American Competitiveness Initiative, ACI, and lays the \ngroundwork to address the concerns laid out in the National Academy of \nSciences ``Gathering Storm'' report.\n  This investment helps keep the competitive edge our Nation holds in \nthe world economy. By focusing on the ingenuity of our people, we will \nremain at the forefront of scientific and technical advancement for \ngenerations to come. In a year when discretionary dollars are scarce, \nChairwoman Mikulski and I have worked together to find ways to ensure \nthat the priorities of our Nation and our States are met. I urge all my \ncolleagues to join with us in supporting this bill and expediting its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83-14, \nthe Senate approved S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act \nof 2007. The President signed the legislation on September 14, 2007. \nThis ethics reform legislation will significantly improve the \ntransparency and accountability of the legislative process.\n  Pursuant to new rule XLIV, it is required that the chair of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction certify that certain information related to \ncongressionally directed spending be identified and that the required \ninformation be available on a publicly accessible congressional website \nin a searchable format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending \nbill. In addition, Members who request such items are required to \ncertify in writing that neither they nor their immediate family have a \npecuniary interest in the items they requested and the committee is \nrequired to make those certification letters available on the Internet.\n  The information provided includes identification of the \ncongressionally directed spending and the name of the Senator who \nrequested such spending. This information is contained in the committee \nreport numbered 110-124, dated June 29, 2007, and has been available on \nthe Internet for 3 months. The Member letters concerning pecuniary \ninterest are also available on the Internet.\n  I am submitting for the Record the certification by the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n  I want to say this bill complies with the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act of 2007, and Senator Byrd certifies that, under Senate \nrules, all this information is available on the congressional Web site.\n  I ask unanimous consent the certification by the chairman of the \nCommittee on Appropriations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Byrd: I certify that the information required by \n     Senate Rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed \n     spending, has been identified in the Committee report \n     numbered 110-124, filed on June 29, 2007, and that the \n     required information has been available on a publicly \n     accessible congressional website in a searchable format at \n     least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this committee now says to our \ncolleagues, if they have any amendments, this is an excellent time to \nbring them down and offer them. We know we have some amendments we are \nworking now to clear, but if someone wants to talk about our bill, this \nis a very good time to come and speak on it. If they have amendments \nthey wish to offer that might require a vote, this is a good time to \noffer them.\n  It will be the intention of Senator Shelby and myself to try to \nfinish this bill today, so this whole idea of let's hang around until 8 \no'clock at night and then come around like little vampires to offer \namendments is not a good idea. Frankly, as we move along and as some of \nthe major amendments will be addressed, if there are no amendments, we \nwill move the bill. It is not a threat. It is for people who know the \nholidays are coming. We are ready.\n  Colleagues, if you have amendments you think can improve this bill, \ncome down and discuss them.\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting for the onslaught of Members \ncoming to the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3215\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3215.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require reporting regarding the costs of conferences held \n                     by the Department of Justice)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 217. (a) The Attorney General shall submit quarterly \n     reports to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice \n     regarding the costs and contracting procedures relating to \n     each conference held by the Department of Justice during \n     fiscal year 2008 for which the cost to the Government was \n     more than $20,000.\n       (b) Each report submitted under subsection (a) shall \n     include, for each conference described in that subsection \n     held during the applicable quarter--\n       (1) a description of the subject of and number of \n     participants attending that conference;\n       (2) a detailed statement of the costs to the Government \n     relating to that conference, including--\n       (A) the cost of any food or beverages;\n       (B) the cost of any audio-visual services; and\n       (C) a discussion of the methodology used to determine which \n     costs relate to that conference; and\n       (3) a description of the contracting procedures relating to \n     that conference, including--\n       (A) whether contracts were awarded on a competitive basis \n     for that conference; and\n       (B) a discussion of any cost comparison conducted by the \n     Department of Justice in evaluating potential contractors for \n     that conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. \nRemember earlier in my remarks I talked about our accountability and \nour stewardship? I will be offering two amendments that will deal with \nthose. This is the first of them. It makes sure the Department of \nJustice is not misusing taxpayer dollars on lavish expenditures and \nconferences. Conferences are meant for training.\n  Our amendment simply requires that Justice do two things: Notify the \ninspector general of any conferences exceeding $20,000 and demonstrate \nwhat steps are being taken to implement the inspector general's \nrecommendations that actually uncovered some of these expenditures at \nlavish conferences.\n  To elaborate, the Justice IG issued a report and said the 10 most \nexpensive conferences had totaled over $6.9 million. Most conferences \nare well organized and the money is spent frugally--which I know is a \nbig issue with the Presiding Officer. What we found was that some of \nthose funds were spent on ``networking.'' They had lobster skewers. At \none conference, each meatball cost $4. That is a lot of money for a \nmeatball. Literally, we believed because we were working so hard to \nmake sure that law enforcement had the tools they needed, we wanted to \nmake sure the taxpayers got a good deal and that we got law enforcement \nfor our money and not $4 meatballs.\n  I don't know if my colleague wishes to speak on the amendment.\n\n[[Page S12707]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I tend to agree with Senator Mikulski. We are trying to \ncheck with a couple of people to clear this amendment. I hope we can \nmove it soon. We are checking with somebody right now. I think it makes \nsense.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move the pending amendment be laid aside subject to \nthe clearance of one of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3216\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3216.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require certain evaluations by the Secretary of Commerce \n  and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget before the \n satellite acquisition program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n                      Administration may proceed)\n\n       After section 113, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 114. LIMITATIONS ON SATELLITE ACQUISITIONS BY THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.\n\n       (a) Certification.--\n       (1) Requirement for certification.--Prior to the date that \n     the certification described in paragraph (2) is made, the \n     Secretary may not--\n       (A) obligate funds provided by this Act or by previous \n     appropriations Acts to acquire satellites; or\n       (B) receive approval of--\n       (i) a major milestone; or\n       (ii) a key decision point.\n       (2) Content of certification.--The certification described \n     in this paragraph is a certification made by the Secretary \n     and the Director that--\n       (A) the technology utilized in the satellites has been \n     demonstrated in a relevant environment;\n       (B) the program has demonstrated a high likelihood of \n     accomplishing the its intended goals; and\n       (C) the acquisition of satellites for use in the program \n     represents a good value--\n       (i) in consideration of the per unit cost and the total \n     acquisition cost of the program and in the context of the \n     total resources available for the fiscal year in which the \n     certification is made and the future out-year budget \n     projections for the Department of Commerce; and\n       (ii) in consideration of the ability of the Secretary to \n     accomplish the goals of the program using alternative \n     systems.\n       (3) Submission to congress.--Not later than the 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     and the Director shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees--\n       (A) the certification described in paragraph (2); or\n       (B) a report on the reasons that such certification cannot \n     be made.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on \n     Science and Technology of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (3) Key decision point.--The term ``key decision point'' \n     means the initiation of procurement for a major system or \n     subsystem of a program.\n       (4) Major milestone approval.--The term ``major milestone \n     approval'' means a decision to enter into development of a \n     system for a program.\n       (5) Program.--The term ``program'' means the programs of \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for which \n     satellites will be acquired.\n       (6) Satellite.--The term ``satellite'' means the satellites \n     proposed to be acquired for the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration, other than the National Polar-\n     orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).\n       (7) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Commerce.\n       (c) Independent Cost Estimates.--\n       (1) Requirement.--The Secretary may not approve the \n     development or acquisition of a program unless an independent \n     estimate of the full life-cycle cost of the program has been \n     considered by the Secretary.\n       (2) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations \n     governing the content and submission of the estimate required \n     by paragraph (1). The regulations shall require that each \n     such estimate--\n       (A) be prepared by an office or other entity that is not \n     under the supervision of the Under Secretary of Oceans and \n     Atmosphere; and\n       (B) include all costs of development, procurement, \n     construction, operations, maintenance, and management of the \n     program.\n       (d) Requirement for Analysis if Unit Costs Exceed 15 \n     Percent.--\n       (1) Requirement.--If the percentage increase in the \n     acquisition cost of a program in which the acquisition unit \n     cost or procurement unit cost exceeds 15 percent more than \n     the baseline cost of the program, the Secretary shall \n     initiate an analysis of the program. Such analysis of \n     alternatives shall include, at a minimum, the following:\n       (A) The projected cost to complete the program if current \n     requirements are not modified.\n       (B) The projected cost to complete the program based on \n     potential modifications to the requirements.\n       (C) The projected cost to complete the program based on \n     design modifications, enhancements to the producibility of \n     the program, and other efficiencies.\n       (D) The projected cost and capabilities of the program that \n     could be delivered within the originally authorized budget \n     for the program, including any increase or decrease in \n     capability.\n       (E) The projected costs for an alternative system or \n     capability.\n       (2) Submission to congress.--The analysis of alternatives \n     required under paragraph (1) with respect to a program shall \n     be--\n       (A) completed not later than 6 months after the date of \n     that the Secretary determines that the cost of the program \n     exceeds 15 percent more than the baseline cost of the \n     program; and\n       (B) submitted to the appropriate congressional committees \n     not later than 30 days after the date the analysis is \n     completed.\n       (3) Clarification of cost escalation.--For the purposes of \n     determining whether cost of the Geostationary Operational \n     Environmental Satellite Program exceeds 15 percent more than \n     the baseline cost under paragraph (1), the baseline cost of \n     the such Program is $6,960,000,000.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It stops the cost overruns on NOAA's weather \nsatellites before they get out of control.\n  The NOAA satellite program is an absolutely crucial program to the \nUnited States of America. It gives us major weather satellites, known \nas NPOESS, polar orbiting, and one called GOES that gives us the \ngeostationary information. They are crucial to our ability to forecast \nweather, measure climate change, and actually pinpoint where disasters \ncould be threatening a community. It saves lives and saves livelihoods. \nThanks to these satellites, we can often get early warnings when a \ndisaster is coming, from a tornado to a hurricane.\n  What has happened is the satellites have grown far beyond their \noriginal estimates. We are concerned that the ideas are good, but they \nare not being properly managed.\n  Let me tell you about these overruns. Two years ago, NOAA's polar \norbiting satellite grew by 25 percent. That is $4 billion, $4 billion.\n  Now, because the Defense Department is a partner in the satellite \nprogram, the Nunn-McCurdy process was triggered. There was a stand-down \nand the processes were reassessed. Nunn-McCurdy acts like a circuit \nbreaker, forcing management reforms and program changes to control \ncosts.\n  But with the next generation of geostationary satellites we are \nbeginning to see early signs of trouble. We have been alerted that the \ncosts may grow substantially. One of our satellite programs has Nunn-\nMcCurdy, but the one that is called GOES does not. Therefore, I am \noffering a commonsense amendment modeled after Nunn-McCurdy that all \nNOAA satellite programs follow essentially this kind of oversight.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary of Commerce to certify the \nsatellite program; requires the Secretary to look at alternatives if \nthe cost exceeds 15 percent of the original estimate; makes sure they \nnotify Congress and keep us informed sooner rather than later; requires \nthe Secretary of Commerce to utilize independent cost estimates.\n  This will act as a circuit breaker to make sure that as these \nsatellites go forward, they are coming up with not only good ideas to \nprotect the Nation but good fiscal stewardship to protect the taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because it will bring \nstrong management, better and stronger management and fiscal discipline \nto the satellite program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think this is a very good amendment that \nSenator Mikulski has proposed. We are checking with some of our \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S12708]]\n\nand hope they will not object. They are on their way to the Senate \nfloor now, I understand.\n  I believe the amendment has merit. But I did tell them that I would \ncheck with them. If we can, let's set this aside temporarily until they \nget to the Senate floor and we see where we are.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with setting aside the \namendment.\n  I also want to say something. I believe I am the bastion of \ncollegiality. I believe conversation avoids confrontation. That is why \nwe have such a great bill. We have a fantastic bill we have arrived at \ntogether.\n  Senator Shelby and I go back a long way, from the House of \nRepresentatives where we served, and we have been appropriators during \nour entire time in the Senate. But in clearing things, we are talking \nabout clearing it with one Senator. That Senator must exercise a lot of \nfiscal responsibility. I am ready to move my bill along. I would like \nhim or his representative to promptly come to the floor.\n  If we have this new kind of arrangement where we have to clear it \nwith this Senator rather than clearing it with the ranking member and \nour leadership, then I would like that Senator to come to the floor. I \nwill be collegial. I will be patient up to a point.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nreturn to consideration of amendment No. 3216.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3216.\n  The amendment (No. 3216) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week the Senate voted on an amendment \nto the Defense authorization bill that designated a portion of the \nIranian Armed Forces as a terrorist organization. I joined 21 of my \nillustrious colleagues in voting against that amendment. It was a \ndangerous, unnecessary provocation that is escalating the \nconfrontational rhetoric between the United States and Iran.\n  In response to the passage of that amendment, the Iranian Parliament \non Saturday designated the U.S. Armed Forces and the Central \nIntelligence Agency as terrorist organizations. Would someone please \nexplain to me what has been achieved by this exchange of international \nverbal spitballs? It is deeply troubling to see the Senate joining the \nchest pounding and saber rattling of the Bush administration. I am no \napologist for the Iranian regime, anymore than I was for Saddam \nHussein, but I fear we may become entangled in another bloody quagmire.\n  We have been down this path before. We have seen all too clearly \nwhere it leads. Four and a half years ago, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell made a speech before the United Nations Security Council \nclaiming to have evidence that proved Saddam Hussein had weapons of \nmass destruction and was an imminent threat to U.S. and international \nsecurity. Others in the administration made the rounds of Washington \nnews programs to pound the drums of war, scaring the public with \nvisions of mushroom clouds and mobile chemical weapons labs. The \nproponents of war compared Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler, warning \nominously of the dangers of Chamberlain-like appeasement. That is a \nseductive analogy, but it is a dangerously specious one.\n  Every foreign adversary is not the devil incarnate. We know now that \nSaddam Hussein was militarily a paper tiger. The intelligence that \nsuggested he was an imminent threat was flat wrong. Saddam Hussein had \nno weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein had not attacked our \ncountry. Saddam Hussein was a ruthless tyrant, but he was not an \nimminent threat to U.S. national security. Now we hear the same scare \ntactics and several analogies trotted out again, this time with Iran. \nAnalogies can be dangerous. They risk oversimplifying complicated \nsituations and can lead to erroneous conclusions. While there may be \nsome superficial similarities between Hitler and Ahmadi-Nejad, it does \nnot mean our only option is to start world war III.\n  We are now more than 4 years into a war that was launched by false \nfears and scary hyperbole, and here we are again being led down a path \nby chest-pounding rhetoric, without a clear idea where that path is \ntaking us.\n  As the philosopher George Santayana once said:\n\n       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \n     it.\n\n  Are we condemned to repeat the colossal blunder that is the Iraq war \nor has the Senate learned the lessons of history?\n  Every day it seems the confrontational rhetoric between the United \nStates and Iran escalates. We hear shadowy claims about Iran's \ndestabilizing actions in Iraq, with little direct evidence offered to \nback it up. The President telegraphs his desire to designate a large \nsegment of the Iranian Army as a terrorist organization--and instead of \ncounseling prudence, the Senate rushes ahead to do it for him. I hope \nwe can stop this war of words before it becomes a war of bombs.\n  We have seen the results when the Senate gives this administration \nthe benefit of the doubt: a war that has now directly cost the American \npeople $600 billion, more than 3,800 American deaths, and more than \n27,000 American casualties; a war that has stretched our military to \nthe breaking point; a war that the commander of our forces in Iraq, \njust 3 weeks ago, could not say had made America safer.\n  I daresay many--perhaps most--in this Chamber wish we had never gone \ninto Iraq. Are we willing to sleep-walk into yet another disastrous \nmilitary confrontation with a Middle East tyrant?\n  We need to talk directly to the Government of Iran without \npreconditions or artificial restrictions and indicate that regime \nchange is not our goal. Unfortunately, the President seems unwilling to \ntake that step. We have held only two talks at a relatively low level, \nand those have focused solely on Iraq.\n  Direct talks with North Korea about the issue we were most concerned \nwith--North Korea's nuclear program--resulted in the first progress \ntoward a denuclearized Korean peninsula in years. And yet with Iran we \ncontinue to refuse to discuss the issue we are most concerned about: \ninsisting that they must first renounce their nuclear program. That is \nnot negotiation; that is dictating ultimatums.\n  I agree that no option should be taken off the table when considering \nhow to deal with any threat posed by Iran. But if the President \nconcludes, after serious diplomacy has failed, that an attack is \nnecessary, he must make the case to the Congress and the American \npeople. Under article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, only the \nCongress--the elected representatives of the people--have the power to \ndeclare war, not the President.\n  The President has stated his belief that previously enacted \ncongressional authorizations to use force give him all the authority he \nrequires to start a new war. I respectfully disagree. It is incumbent \nupon us--it is incumbent upon us--to reassert the powers granted to the \npeople's branch in the Constitution. That is the best way to prevent \nanother colossal blunder in the Middle East. It is the people of this \ncountry who pay the price of such Presidential misadventures. We, as \ntheir representatives in the Congress, must not fail in our No. 1 duty: \nto protect their interests.\n\n[[Page S12709]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3214\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 3214. \nThis amendment would establish a commission to investigate the \ncircumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and deportation \nof Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 to February \n1948.\n  The story of the internment of U.S. citizens is a story that has been \nmade well known after a fact-finding study by a commission authorized \nby Congress in 1980. However, far less known is the story of Latin \nAmericans of Japanese descent.\n  Toward the end of its investigation, the 1980 commission discovered \nthis extraordinary effort by the U.S. Government soon after December 7, \n1941. However, because information surfaced so late in its study, the \ncommission was unable to fully review the facts but found them \nsignificant enough to include in the appendix of its published report \nto the Congress.\n  It appears that soon after December 7, 1941, the Government of the \nUnited States called upon certain governments in Latin America and \nrequested that certain Japanese be sent to the United States to be used \nfor prisoner exchange programs. Approximately 2,300 civilian men, \nwomen, and children--who had committed no crime--were taken from their \nhomes in Latin America. They were stripped of their passports, brought \nto the United States, and interned on American soil. Some were taken \nfrom this camp and used for civilian exchange with Axis countries. You \ncan imagine the anxiety and the fear in the hearts and minds of these \nmen, women, and children not knowing where they were headed for and for \nwhat purpose.\n\n  Despite their personal tragedies, these Japanese Latin Americans were \nnot included in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 because this program \nappears to have been executed outside of Executive Order 9066, and the \ninternees were not citizens of the United States.\n  Under this amendment, nine commission members--three appointed by the \nPresident, three appointed by the Speaker of the House, and three \nappointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate--would have a year \nto report their findings to Congress.\n  This amendment does not authorize any payment for restitution and \nwould not affect direct spending or revenues. It was reported out of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Authorizing Committee \nand was approved by the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee to attach to the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations \nbill.\n  Today I seek your support for this amendment, which would establish a \nfact-finding commission to extend the study of the 1980 commission. I \nbelieve examining the extraordinary program of interning citizens from \nLatin America in the United States would give finality to, and complete \nthe account of, Federal actions to detain and intern civilians of \nJapanese ancestry.\n  As a footnote, when the war was over, and these internees were \nreleased from their camps, they were persons without a country. They \nwere soon arrested for not having a permit or passport to be in the \nUnited States. So they were scheduled for deportation to their supposed \nhome, and these Latin American countries said: Oh, no, we are not \nresponsible. We are not taking them. So there they were not knowing \nwhere to go. This is the subject of my amendment.\n  I think the United States would like to have this clarified. It is a \nblight on our record. I am certain my colleagues will go along with \nthis.\n  I thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear hear.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside for future consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are trying to clear amendments that \nhave been cleared by Senator Shelby and myself. Others are looking at \nthem, so we are proceeding. While those amendments are being cleared, \none of the issues I wanted to bring to our colleagues' attention is how \nwe are making America more competitive with this bill.\n  Earlier in my presentation in which I gave an overview of the bill, I \nemphasized what we were doing in law enforcement, which I am so proud \nof, and of course the Presiding Officer himself as a former attorney \ngeneral knows how important the Federal and local law enforcement \nagencies are. But this bill is called Commerce-Justice-Science.\n  We focused, in our subcommittee--myself and my ranking member, \nSenator Shelby--on three issues this year: security, competitiveness, \nand accountability--the stewardship of the taxpayers' dollar. We \nfocused on competitiveness because it is our subcommittee that funds \nthe major science agencies that come up with the new ideas that help \ncome up with the new jobs, the research that enables the private sector \nto take value and add to it to come up with the new products and very \nhigh-end technology. That provides jobs right in our own country and \nenables us to be competitive.\n  We based a lot of our work on legislation called the America COMPETES \nAct. I know the Presiding Officer was part of that. This year, it was a \nbill that was passed by the House and the Senate to ensure our Nation's \ncompetitive position in the world through improvements to math and \nscience, both a commitment to research and math and science education. \nIt follows through on a commitment to ensure U.S. students, teachers, \nbusinesses, and workers are prepared to continue to lead the world in \nresearch and then taking that research to the private sector so it can \ncome up with those products.\n  In our bill, we don't do anything that picks winners and losers. We \nare not industrial policy people. What we are, though, is American \npolicy people, to do this.\n  This America COMPETES Act was based a lot on recommendations that \ncame from the National Academy of Science report called ``Rising Above \nthe Gathering Storm.'' That report was done at the request of three \nleaders: Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Alexander. \nThen I, after it was published, became part of the group to implement \nit.\n  Well, this is a great day for our colleague from New Mexico. I know \nlast night our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, announced \nthat he is going to retire from the Senate. He is in his home State of \nNew Mexico today sharing his plans for his own future with his \nconstituents. But while he is talking about his own future with his \nconstituents, I want to acknowledge that he worked very hard on a \nbipartisan basis to ensure the future of the Nation. He and Senator \nBingaman and Senator Alexander, again, working together, showed that we \ncan do better so that we can compete in the world and that we compete \nin the world not only to win Nobel prizes--and we will continue to do \nso--but we will also win the markets, for which we must to have a \nstronger economy.\n  So ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which was promoted by those \nthree excellent and wonderful colleagues, led to, with the help of \npeople such as Senator Lieberman and others, the America COMPETES Act. \nIt keeps research programs at the National Science Foundation, the \nNational Institute of Standards, and DOE on a path for doubling the \nmoney for research in these key areas.\n  But, in addition to research, we wanted to make sure we have the \nscientists, the engineers, and the technology experts to do so. We are \nfalling behind in the number of people who choose science as a career \nor people with a science education to go into our classrooms. The \nAmerica COMPETES\n\n[[Page S12711]]\n\nAct puts an emphasis on that into action. They wanted to prepare \nthousands of new teachers and provide current teachers with teaching \nskills in the area of NSF's Noyce teacher scholarship program. They \nalso wanted to enhance undergraduate education for the future science \nand engineering workforce. They also wanted to authorize new \ncompetitive grants at the Department of Education to increase the \nnumber of teachers, so grant programs also help do that.\n  So we passed the America COMPETES Act. But, as my colleagues know--\nwhat is authorizing legislation? It sets the policy, sets the \ndirection, and puts national goals into the Federal lawbooks, which is \na great first step. But now, the legislation we bring before the \nSenate, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, the Mikulski-Shelby \nbipartisan bill, following on the tradition that sparked us, we are \nactually putting money in the Federal checkbook to do that.\n  One of the areas, of course, where we do that is we increase funding \nfor research. We are going to talk later on today about NASA, on the \nanniversary of sputnik, where that little round ball weighing 180 \npounds shook up the cosmos and even the galaxies. But little known is \nsomething called the National Science Foundation. This was an agency \nwhich was created during the Eisenhower administration and has now \nwithstood the test of time. President Eisenhower responded, a warrior--\nand we all saw the great miniseries of Ken Burns on the war. We are so \nproud of Senator Inouye, who was featured in it. But Eisenhower, the \nman who led us in Europe, knew that when sputnik went up, we were in a \nrace for America's future and we could either respond militarily or we \ncould respond in a way that would have many uses.\n  Eisenhower created two things: One, the National Science Foundation, \nand two, something called the National Defense Act.\n  The National Defense Act was to get our young people involved in \nscience and in technology so that they could come up with those new \nideas to make sure that we not only beat the Russians in space but that \nwe beat the Russians in everything--an idea with currency today, I \nmight add. And then, the National Science Foundation. His brother was \npresident of Johns Hopkins University, Milton Eisenhower. Later, what \ndid the National Science Foundation do? We could have put a lot of \nmoney into the military so we could shoot those satellites down, but we \nsaid we were going to develop our own and be better at it. We became \nthe premier country in satellites. Satellites defend the Nation. \nSatellites also give us information on weather. Satellites give us \ninformation and early warnings on things such as solar flares that can \ntake out our power grid. Satellites were one of the greatest inventions \never created. America led the way.\n\n  Eisenhower created this, where we would fund--we, the Federal \nGovernment, working in a unique partnership with universities, not \nGovernment doing the research but the Government putting money out in \nalmost intellectual venture capital to come up with new research in \nphysics, chemistry, biology, and the basic sciences; and then to give \nstipends so young, smart people, such as the people who wanted to do \nthe ``October surprise,'' could come out of the hollows of West \nVirginia and the streets of Baltimore, our communities, to go on to do \nthis.\n  What did we fund? We funded programs that then we're able to do. In \nour legislation, we have now increased our research to $6.5 billion. In \nthis, we have focused on education, K through 12. We have also funded \nother important programs in research, our science programs. We help \nwith minority education.\n  By the way, this is one of the most important agencies that helps \nhistorically black colleges, to make sure they have the financial \nresources they need. An example would be the increased funding for the \nLouis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. We provide $75 \nmillion for math and science partnerships in education. We estimate \nthat our program will have an impact upon over 140 math and science \nteachers. We also have a talent expansion program to begin to recruit \nthem. We are bringing teachers into internships. Over at Morgan \nUniversity and down at the Eastern Shore, we have something called the \nChesapeake Consortium, where our young people are getting paid \ninternships to work on rocket ships that go off--small rockets that go \noff from down on Wallops Island.\n  If you came with me to the Eastern Shore, to Somerset County, where \nprimarily the lifestyle is that of watermen and agriculture--these \npeople work hard and have dirt under their fingernails and big dreams. \nOne of the largest employers is our prison. This is an area the \nSenators from Virginia share, where the facility is called Wallops \nIsland. Our young people at the Chesapeake Consortium are working at \nWallops to develop these small rockets and also work with UAV research. \nIf you went down there with me to that county that has one of the \nhighest poverty rates, in terms of cash income, in my State, and you \nsaw these young men and women with the Chesapeake Consortium shirts on, \nwhere they had worked at historically black colleges with our talented \nscience team instead of flipping hamburgers, they had a paid \ninternship, they are flipping ideas. Each and every one of them is a \ngraduate and they have jobs in major technology agencies in our \ncountry. This is what we are doing.\n  I want my colleagues to know we are increasing funding in research. \nWe are investing in education. We are investing in and implementing the \nAmerica COMPETES Act, and we are making sure we are truly rising above \nthe gathering storm.\n  I hope Senator Domenici will be here today. I will personally pay my \nrespects to him for being the leader he is. When he returns, he will \nfind we passed this bill. It is a tribute to what bipartisanship means, \nfinding that sensible Senator, and we are going to build a stronger \ncountry because of this. I wished to bring this to our colleagues' \nattention as we clear these amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Law of the Sea Treaty\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Mikulski, for allowing me to speak for 2 or 3 \nminutes.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing \non the Law of the Sea Treaty, and we will hold another hearing. The \ncommittee may be holding another hearing today. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee when the Republicans were in the \nmajority, I held several hearings in March of 2004. We also had \nhearings before another committee on which I serve, which is the Senate \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Proponents of the ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty will tell \nyou that the treaty will be a great asset to the military by allowing \nour Navy the freedom of movement to and from any point on and under the \nocean, unencumbered by the need to send requests to foreign governments \nfor permission to enter territorial waters or to pass through straits. \nWhile this treaty does maintain that this is true, it is subject to \nseveral caveats that really do concern me.\n  Under the terms of our treaty, our naval warships must pass by the \ncoast and not engage in any type of exercise, ground all aircraft, and \nnegate the use of any defensive devices. The issue of passage not only \napplies to ships but also to aircraft, both commercial and military.\n  This is interesting because when we had our hearing, one of the Under \nSecretaries, I believe his name was Turner, appeared before the \ncommittee. He was promoting the ratification of this treaty.\n  I said: As I read this, it is not just 70 percent of the Earth's \nsurface, water, but also the air above it. He said that could very well \nbe. He could not respond or deny that fact.\n  Another issue of concern is the effect the Law of the Sea Treaty will \nhave on the President's Proliferation Security Initiative, PSI, with \nwhich we are all familiar. It was designed to combat the transfer of \nweapons of mass destruction. Advocates of the treaty assure us that the \ntreaty in no way damages the effectiveness of PSI because countries \nthat want to participate in these open ocean inspections to assure \nnuclear weapons are not being traded illegally voluntarily sign on to \nthe President's PSI agreement.\n  However, under the treaty, boarding a vessel is allowed under four \ncircumstances: One, if there is suspicion of piracy; second, engaging \nin slave trade; third, unauthorized broadcasting--I am not sure what \nthat is, Mr. President--and fourth, whether it is unwilling to show its \nnationality.\n  Taken literally, as most countries will, a U.S. warship would not be \nallowed to stop a vessel with a shipment of nuclear energy materials if \nit is flying a State flag on purportedly legitimate business.\n  The Law of the Sea Treaty creates--and this is, I think, the worst \npart of it--this international seabed authority. There is a mentality \naround Washington that unless you have some great big international \nbody, we shouldn't have any sovereignty, and that is exactly what this \ntreaty does. It has an international seabed authority which actually \nwould have jurisdiction over 70 percent of the area of this globe.\n  They also have taxing authority. I think a lot of us--and I have to \nadmit I have been critical of the United Nations, and they are the ones \nbehind this issue. If they are able to have this taxing authority, then \nthose of us--and most of the Members of this Senate have done this at \none time or another--when it gets to the point where they are not doing \na good job with something or the U.N. has something with which we \ndisagree, we send a resolution that says: If you don't stop doing this, \nthen we are going to withhold some of our dues. The way they overcome \nthat is with global taxation so that the U.N. would not have to be \naccountable to anyone.\n  With all these problems, this is a treaty on which we should be able \nto have hearings. I would like to have a hearing, as I did in 2004, and \nhave some of the same people testify because nothing has happened since \nthen. I am talking about in both the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and in the Senate Armed Services Committee because this is a \nnational security issue. I am putting that request in, and, hopefully, \nwe will be able to do it.\n\n[[Page S12713]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I have an amendment which I wish to send \nto the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Shelby, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3233.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Office on Violence \n                             Against Women)\n\n       On page 70, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 217.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title--\n       (1) the amount appropriated in this title under the heading \n     ``General Administration'' is reduced by $10,000,000;\n       (2) the amount appropriated in this title under the heading \n     ``violence against women prevention and prosecution \n     programs'' under the heading ``Office on Violence Against \n     Women'' is increased by $10,000,000; and\n       (3) of the amount appropriated in this title under the \n     heading ``violence against women prevention and prosecution \n     programs'' under the heading ``Office on Violence Against \n     Women''--\n       (A) $60,000,000 is for grants to encourage arrest policies, \n     as authorized by part U of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796hh et seq.);\n       (B) $4,000,000 is for engaging men and youth in prevention \n     programs, as authorized by section 41305 of the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043d-4); and\n       (C) $1,000,000 is for the National Resource Center on \n     Workplace Responses to assist victims of domestic violence, \n     as authorized by section 41501 of the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043f).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward \namendment. What it does is add $10 million to the Office of Violence \nAgainst Women.\n  October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and we wanted to be \nsure that, in our legislation, one of the things we were going to be \nclear about was that there would be enough resources for our local \ncommunities to really deal with the growing issue of domestic violence.\n  It might come as a surprise that many local law enforcement people \nare injured in the line of duty when responding to domestic violence. \nYou might say: Well, aren't they hurt when they are responding to \nrobberies and burglaries? The answer is yes. But when a police officer \nresponds to a domestic violence call and he walks into a home--or she--\nthe police officer usually does not have a weapon drawn because they \nwant to de-escalate the situation. This is often happening behind \nclosed doors where someone is being battered, and the perpetrator could \nvery likely feel threatened and, in turn, use the officer's weapon or \nanother lethal object on the police officer. So the police officers are \nin danger, the spouse or the child being battered is also in danger, \nand we want to make sure the funding is not also in jeopardy.\n  I strongly support the Office of Violence Against Women that was \nestablished by our colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden. My amendment \nsimply increases the money, for a total of $400 million. It has an \nappropriate offset, and it will provide more funding for the training \nof police officers and prosecutors. It would also continue the funding \nfor battered women shelters and at the same time have a very strong \neffort in reducing rape, and also prosecution of rape.\n  The amendment is noncontroversial. We have several cosponsors, \nincluding my colleague, Senator Shelby, and also Mrs. Murray of \nWashington State. So I hope my colleagues would accept this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Mikulski for offering \nthis amendment. I am a cosponsor of it, and many of us believe what she \nis doing is the right road to go down. I believe we should adopt this \namendment as soon as possible.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for supporting \nthis, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate on \nthe amendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3233) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his support.\n  It will not be our intention to adjourn for lunch. We are going to \nkeep on working and keep on hearing our amendments, and then somewhere \naround 2 p.m. we will be offering an amendment to deal with NASA \nfunding, which we think will take a considerable amount of time. With \nour colleagues' cooperation in bringing their amendments to the floor \nand the NASA amendment, we really do believe, with those who are \nworking to clear these amendments, we can finish up late this \nafternoon. So we are not going to take a break for lunch; we are going \nto keep on working. To any colleagues who wish to speak on our bill or \nbring amendments to us, this is the time. With their cooperation, we \ncan cooperate with all those who would like to be able to call it a day \ntoday and get back to their districts for the recess period.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I admire our two floor managers and their \ndiligence and perseverance in moving the legislation forward. I have a \nfew small items I think are of some importance, but I don't want to \ninterrupt the process or the consideration of the amendments. So I will \nproceed, but if the managers find there is an amendment that needs \naddressing, I will be glad to withhold. I don't intend to take very \nlong, but I would like to be able to make these comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in response to the shocking news \nreported on the front page of the New York Times that the Department of \nJustice gave legal advice authorizing the use of extreme interrogation \ntechniques not only in 2002 and 2003 but also at least two more times \nin 2005. This revelation shows that the Justice Department has fallen \neven lower than we had realized and that it is up to Congress to take a \nfirm stand against torture because this Executive cannot be trusted to \ndo so.\n  We have been here before. Before this morning, we already knew about \nan earlier opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel that authorized the \nuse of torture. When this ``torture memo'' came to light, the Bybee \nmemorandum, it inspired worldwide outrage and condemnation. America \nlost its moral high ground in the fight against terrorism, possibly for \nyears to come. This memo and others like it violated the values we hold \ndear, undermined our intelligence gathering, and encouraged our enemies \nto respond in kind. But the opinion was not only morally wrong, it was \nalso legally wrong. After the public outrage over the opinions broke, \nthe Office of Legal Counsel took the extraordinary step of withdrawing \nit, and as far as we know, this is the first time an OLC opinion had \never been overturned within a single administration.\n  Today's New York Times story tells us that this disgraceful episode \ndid not end when the torture memorandum was withdrawn. At the same time \nthe Justice Department was publicly claiming it had put things right, \nthe Office of Legal Counsel was secretly issuing two new opinions. The \nfirst opinion authorized harsh interrogation techniques together, in \ncombination, to create a more extreme overall effect. In other words, \ninterrogators\n\n[[Page S12714]]\n\ncould withhold food at the same time they subjected detainees to \nfreezing temperatures. The second opinion declared none of the CIA's \ninterrogation methods violated the ban on cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment that Congress was getting ready to pass. This was at a time \nwhen the CIA was using waterboarding and other foreign techniques \ncopied from the Soviets and other brutal regimes.\n\n  So how did the Justice Department go from secretly authorizing brutal \ninterrogation techniques in 2002 and 2003 to withdrawing some of that \nauthorization in 2004 to once again secretly reauthorizing such \ntechniques in 2005? The answer, we now know, is that the White House \noverruled all those pesky officials who told them what they didn't want \nto hear--who told them that torture is wrong and illegal.\n  James Comey told his colleagues at the Justice Department that they \nwould all be ashamed when the world eventually learned of these \nopinions. He was sidelined by the White House. Jack Goldsmith met the \nsame fate. These were conservative Republicans and loyal patriots who \nwere simply trying to uphold the law.\n  It is clear why President Bush wanted Alberto Gonzales to run the \nJustice Department--he wanted to install his personal lawyer, not a \nguardian of the rule of law. Mr. Gonzales approved these two memos and \neverything else the President needed for legal cover.\n  It would be bad enough if this administration had disgraced itself \nand this country by engaging in cruel and degrading treatment of \ndetainees. It is worse still that it enlisted the Justice Department in \nan attempt to justify and cover up its activities.\n  Today's revelations give new urgency to the need for congressional \naction. I am the sponsor of a bill that responds to this need--the \nTorture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act. The bill makes one \nbasic reform: to apply the standards of the Army Field Manual to all \nU.S. Government interrogations, not just the Department of Defense \ninterrogations.\n  When Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, we \nrecognized that the Army Field Manual represents our best effort to \ndevelop an effective interrogation policy. The Senate voted 90 to 9 to \napply its standards to all Department of Defense personnel. By enacting \nthe Detainee Treatment Act, Congress tried to ensure that our \nGovernment honors its commitment to the basic rights enshrined in the \nGeneva Conventions, which protect both the values we cherish as a free \nsociety and the lives of our service men and women overseas.\n  We now know, however, that the 2005 Act falls short of our goals. We \nleft open a loophole that undermines the basic safeguards against \ntorture and cruel and degrading treatment. We applied the reform to the \nDepartment of Defense, but not to the CIA. And as today's New York \nTimes story shows, it is the CIA that we need to be most worried about.\n  Last year, in the Military Commissions Act, Congress left it to the \nPresident to define by Executive Order the interrogation practices that \nwould bind all government interrogators, including the CIA.\n  The President's Executive order took maximum advantage of this \nloophole. It is vague and fails to prohibit many of the most flagrant \ninterrogation practices. Combined with these new OLC opinions that have \njust come to light, this Executive order makes clear that the President \nbelieves these interrogation practices to be perfectly acceptable.\n  The Torture Prevention and Effective Interrogation Act closes the \nloophole left open by the Detainee Treatment Act. It follows the \nwarning of General Petraeus that brutal interrogation methods are both \nillegal and immoral, and that ``history shows that they also are \nfrequently neither useful nor necessary.''\n  This bill is an opportunity to restate our commitment to the security \nand ideals of our country. It is an opportunity to repair some of the \ndamage done to our international reputation by the Abu Ghraib scandal \nand the abuses at Guantanamo. It is an opportunity to restore our \nnation's role as a beacon for human rights, fair treatment, and the \nrule of law. And it is an opportunity to protect our brave servicemen \nand women from similar tactics.\n  It is a simple measure that is long overdue.\n  Once again, this morning, Americans and people all over the world are \nrevolted by what they have learned about this administration's refusal \nto reject cruel and degrading treatment. It will be up to the next \nAttorney General to restore the Justice Department to integrity. It is \nup to Congress to restore the rest of the government to the principles \nof law and justice that make this country great.\n  Mr. President, I will make a brief comment on an item that I think \nneeds addressing.\n\n\n                               Chip Veto\n\n  Yesterday the President vetoed the CHIP program. I mentioned at that \ntime that it was the most intolerable, inexplicable, and \nincomprehensible veto I have seen in the Senate. I think today the \nAmerican people are beginning to understand why.\n  This is President Bush's quote, when he was Governor of Texas. This \nis from President Bush's Web site when he was Governor.\n\n       Governor Bush and the Texas legislature worked together to \n     implement the CHIP program for more than 423,000 children. . \n     . .\n\n  Taking credit for the CHIP program in Texas when he was Governor. \nThis is what he went on to say in 2004.\n\n       America's children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the Government's health insurance program. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention or information to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  We read that the President only yesterday had vetoed this program \nbecause, as he pointed out, he believed it was a government health \ninsurance program, and his allies have called it socialized medicine. I \nwas here in the Senate when we passed Medicare, and that was called \nsocialized medicine. Those who called it socialized medicine were \nsuccessful the first time, and then 9 months later we were successful \nin passing that program. It was in 1964, and it was passed in 1965. The \nintervening event was a Presidential election.\n  They said Medicaid was socialized medicine. They said the \nprescription drug program was a socialized program, and it was passed. \nThey said the veterans health programs are socialized medicine \nprograms.\n  We have found the President stated that Social Security, he believes, \nought to be privatized--and that has been resisted by Democrats and \nRepublicans--and that Medicare ought to be privatized. Let's make no \nmistake about it across this country: The President has now selected \nthe CHIP program for the beginning of the privatization of these health \nprograms and Americans ought to be very much aware--children today, \nseniors tomorrow, veterans the next day. Let's understand that.\n  Americans want practical solutions to these issues. The practical \nsolution was the CHIP program. Even the CBO says if you are interested \nin ensuring uninsured children, the CHIP program is the way to go. The \nadministration's own agency has stated that. Americans want the \npractical, not the ideological, which the President resorted to \nyesterday.\n  Finally, Americans want investment in America and American \npriorities. The No. 1 priority for Americans is American children, \nrather than the sands in Iraq--pouring billions and billions of dollars \ninto the sands of Iraq. Americans want to invest in the children. That \nis what this debate is about. That is what this discussion is about, \nRepublicans and Democrats coming together for practical resolution and \ndecision on this issue of the CHIP program.\n  When we recess briefly now and return to our States, hopefully the \nAmerican people are going to speak to their representatives and say: On \nthis issue, do what is right for the children. Put children first. Put \nAmerican children first and vote to override the veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts\n\n[[Page S12715]]\n\nleaves the floor, I thank him for his leadership in so many areas but \nnone more important than advocating for health care and for the \nchildren of this country. As he has said numerous times, we are \nspending $330 million a day in Iraq and we have come together in a \nbipartisan way to say children should be receiving $19 million for \nhealth care; $19 million for children's health care in the United \nStates for working families versus $330 million for Iraq.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his voice. There is no one \nstronger or more passionate or more effective on this issue.\n  Also, before speaking further about health care, I thank our leaders \non this very important appropriations bill in front of us, our \nCommerce-Justice-Science bill which Senator Mikulski has led so \neffectively, along with her ranking member, Senator Shelby. When we \ntalk about changing the direction of the priorities of this country, \nthis particular appropriations bill does that. Under the leadership of \nthe chairwoman, we are investing in community policing, we are beefing \nup the FBI, we are dealing with drug enforcement, we are doing those \nthings to keep our communities safe every day. I am very proud to \nsupport her efforts in changing the direction of this country, to \nfocus, among other things, on keeping Americans safe and investing in \nscience and research and opportunities for jobs for the future.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  I particularly come to the floor today to speak about affordable, \naccessible health care--quality health care for Americans. Access to \naffordable health care is one of the most critical issues facing \nfamilies of America, facing businesses of America. There is not a \nmeeting I go to--whether it is with seniors, with families, with those \nadvocating for children, with small businesses, big businesses--the No. \n1 issue folks want to talk about is the skyrocketing cost of health \ncare, health insurance premiums going up, and the difficulty in getting \nhealth insurance. They want us to come together, our Federal \nGovernment, our Congress, our President, and find a solution to \nsomething that is a national crisis.\n  Health care should not be a commodity. It should not be just an \nissue. It is a public issue, a public service, a public health issue. \nWe are all paying the price for not having addressed this sooner.\n  According to a recent study by ``Families USA,'' approximately 90 \nmillion Americans have gone without health insurance for all or part of \nthe last 2 years. These numbers are even higher than we had thought. \nCertainly in my home State of Michigan, where we are seeing the middle-\nclass families across Michigan being squeezed on all sides--folks who \nhave worked in manufacturing and continue to work in manufacturing, the \nindustries that created the middle class of this country--they find \nthemselves being squeezed, being asked to take less pay in order to \ncontinue to have health care for themselves and their families; more \nand more people falling into the category of those losing their jobs, \ntherefore losing their health insurance. What is most amazing and \nimportant for us to understand, of the 90 million people who have not \nbeen able to get health insurance for all or part of the last 2 years, \n70 percent of them are working full time.\n  This is a crisis and it is not acceptable in the greatest country in \nthe world. To add insult to injury, we in America pay twice as much of \nour GDP for health care as any other industrialized country. We are \npaying twice as much, and 90 million people in the last 2 years were \nwithout health insurance for part or all of that time. This has to \nchange. It is long past needing to change. This has to change soon.\n  That is why I am so pleased to be joining a bipartisan group of \nSenators in making a commitment to universal health coverage. I am very \nproud to be cosponsoring the Healthy Americans Act, which has been \nchampioned by Ron Wyden, my friend and colleague from Oregon, and his \npartner, Senator Bennett from Utah. It is important that we tackle this \nissue in a bipartisan way so both parties, so all of us, are invested \nin making the changes we need to make the health care system work for \neverybody, for all Americans--for our businesses, for our families, \nindividuals, small towns, big cities. We have to get a handle on this. \nI am so appreciative of the focus and the leadership Senator Wyden is \nproviding, in bringing all of us together to do that.\n  There is a sense of urgency that is needed and we are coming together \nto provide that sense of urgency, to say we hear it from those around \nthe country and we are rolling up our sleeves and getting to work. This \nlegislation is a good place for us to start, for us to develop a real \nsolution to the health care crisis. The bill's main goal is making sure \neach American gets health insurance that is equal at least to what \nevery Member of Congress gets. I would think as employees of the \nAmerican people, the employer should be asking for nothing less.\n  It creates a strong insurance regulatory system that protects \nfamilies against discrimination based on preexisting conditions. This \nis absolutely critical. If we are talking about a universal system that \nis privately administered, then you cannot have insurance companies \ncherry picking, covering only certain people, saying if you have some \nkind of a preexisting condition, you cannot get insurance. That is not \ngoing to work and this bill changes that.\n  It is critical that there be accountability and oversight and the \nregulation that is needed to make sure everyone can afford to get the \ninsurance they need for themselves and their families. This is the goal \nall of us as Members of the Senate should be behind. I do understand \nthis is a work in progress. I come to this bill with important \nimprovements that I believe need to be done in order for me to \nultimately support a final bill. As the process moves forward, it is \nimportant that certain critical improvements be made, such as people \nwho currently have good insurance plans and want to keep them should be \nable to do so. We should not do anything to undermine employer-\nsponsored health insurance for those who choose to keep it.\n  Second, and this is so important, we are seeing with so many people \nin Michigan now, and others in the auto industry, any voluntary \nemployee benefit association, or so-called VEBA, that results from a \ncollective bargaining agreement must get the same tax treatment they do \nunder current law.\n  Three, I believe there should be a choice of a public plan for health \ninsurance, such as Medicare, to compete with private sector plans. When \nwe are talking about a choice of private plans or keeping what you \nhave, we should also add to that a public choice, so people have real \ncompetition and real choice. That is something I am advocating for.\n  I mentioned earlier that we need to make sure whatever is done \ninvolves the best possible consumer protections; that whatever we are \ndoing in terms of private sector insurance, they should need to take \nallcomers. They should not be able to pick and choose who gets \ninsurance based on preexisting conditions. There are other important \nregulatory mechanisms that need to be in place.\n  Finally, it is critical that there be a real safety net for low-\nincome families who are now on Medicaid or similar programs. I strongly \nbelieve we cannot keep the status quo when it comes to health care. We \ncannot do it anymore. We cannot do it. It is affecting every part of \nour economy.\n  Rapidly growing health care costs are literally costing us jobs in \nAmerica. When we look at good-paying manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry, I invite you to come to Michigan and talk to people who have \nworked hard all their lives, who have built a good life for their \nfamily, who are now, because of health care costs, losing their jobs.\n  American businesses are at a serious disadvantage in competing with \nbusinesses around the world that do not have to pay the same costs for \nhealth care. Our workers are being asked to take pay cuts in order to \nkeep their coverage. Too many Americans find themselves without basic \nhealth insurance in the greatest country in the world. Shame on us. It \nis time to get this right.\n  It is past time for every American to have access to the health care \nthey need and deserve. Let me say as part of that, we have shown what \nwe can do as a Senate, in a bipartisan way, when we\n\n[[Page S12716]]\n\ncome together and we have a focus on the goal of covering children and \nworking families with health insurance.\n  Despite the President's veto, which is, to me, unexplainable, given \nthe overwhelming need and support of American families, and even from \nbusiness and labor, and health care providers coming together on a \nbipartisan basis here, it is mind boggling to me that the President \nwould veto that bill. We have shown what we can do together.\n  I am so pleased to be working with my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, as well as with Senator Wyden, certainly Senator Bennett, \nbut I want to particularly say I am proud to be coming to this process \nand this legislation at the same time as my good friend, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, who has shown such courage. He and Senator Hatch are heroes \nin terms of advocating for children's health care and showing the \ncourage to stand up to their President. It is not an easy thing to do. \nBut to stand up and tell the truth, to debunk what has been said as \ninaccurate, it is something that truly everyone in this Chamber and \naround the country respects and admires.\n  Coming to this legislation with Senator Grassley is also something \nthat is important to me. I believe in addition to making sure that 10 \nmillion children have health insurance they need, it is time to then \ntake the next step--universal health care for every person in America. \nI believe health care should be a right in the United States of \nAmerica, not a privilege.\n  It is time to get this done. I am hopeful this legislation will serve \nas a starting point for Democrats and Republicans to accomplish what \nthe vast majority of Americans want: to be able to afford good health \ninsurance for themselves and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that Senator Bennett \nand I are thrilled to be able to welcome Senator Stabenow to this \nbipartisan coalition, the first bipartisan coalition in 13 years that \nhas been designed to try to finally fix American health care and ensure \nthat all of our citizens have good quality affordable coverage.\n  Four Senators joined us this week. I want to say just a little bit \nabout each one of them. First, Senator Stabenow has put decades into \nthis cause of improving health care. Again and again, she has spoken \nfor seniors, for kids, for holding down costs, for prevention. We sit \nright next to each other in the Senate Finance Committee. And to have \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Grassley who have pulled out all of the \nstops once again to try to bring together a bipartisan coalition for \nour children, when I think about having Senator Stabenow and Senator \nGrassley join those of us in this coalition and to have their support \nin the Senate Finance Committee, this is an enormously important day.\n  As Senator Stabenow said, she represents constituents facing one of \nthe great challenges in American health care; that is, how to make the \ntransition for so many of our key workers and companies in basic \nindustries. When you open a business today in the State of Michigan or \nMontana or Oregon or anywhere else, you spot your foreign competition \nabout 18 percentage points the day you open your doors. Those \nbusinesses in our States see premiums go up 10, 12, 14 percent a year. \nAnd they are competing in global markets against people who have State-\nfunded health care.\n  So as Senator Stabenow has said, and as we have seen just in the last \ncouple of weeks with the new UAW agreement, there is going to be change \nin the air. The question is how we shape it. And to have people such as \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Grassley, who have been leaders for years \nand years in this cause, it is of enormous benefit.\n  Senator Bennett and I are very appreciative. We are also glad to have \nSenators Landrieu and Coleman join us. Senator Landrieu, of course, is \nwrestling with the great challenge of how to reform health care in the \nState of Louisiana. She has looked at a number of innovative reforms \nthat we support.\n  Senator Coleman, coming from Minnesota, which has been a huge tech \ncenter that has contributed to an area that Senator Stabenow has a \ngreat interest in, which is health information technology--Senator \nColeman's involvement will be very helpful as well.\n  It seems to me this Congress has the chance to deliver a bipartisan \none-two punch for health care this year. Punch No. 1 is to try to make \nsure our kids are covered. Americans are watching the back and forth \nbetween the Congress and the President with respect to children's \nhealth care.\n  Clearly, it is a moral abomination that so many of our youngsters in \nAmerica do not have health care. The American people want action. They \ncannot understand the bickerfest going on in Washington, DC, over this \nissue.\n  I am very hopeful that the White House will continue to work, pick up \non the model set out by Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, working \nwith Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller, and we will resolve this \nissue quickly.\n  It is clear to me that covering kids is a moral issue, but it is also \na financial issue. If these youngsters do not get good health care, \nAmerica plays catch-up ball for years and years in the aftermath. \nBecause they cannot get the preventative services they need, they pick \nup illnesses, and we are already seeing the great problems with \nchildhood obesity and chronic illnesses setting in at a very early age.\n  So punch No. 1 is covering the kids, and punch No. 2, as Senator \nStabenow suggested, is moving on to the broader reform issue of making \nsure all Americans have quality, affordable coverage. What is promising \nabout this period that we have not had in the past is that both \nRepublicans and Democrats have been willing to search for common \nground.\n  In our conversations, Senator Bennett, Senator Grassley, and I, and \nothers, have talked about the need to cover everybody. Certainly, back \nin 1993, that was something that was a bit of a show stopper. People \nsaid: You cannot afford it. Today, many Republicans share the view of \nSenator Stabenow and myself that the country cannot afford not to cover \neverybody because what happens today is people who are uninsured shift \ntheir bills to people who are insured, and not only do they shift the \nbills, they shift the most expensive bills: those hospital emergency \nroom bills and expensive treatment bills for acute illnesses.\n  So I very much credit Republicans such as Senators Bennett and \nGrassley and Gregg and all of those who have joined us from the other \nside of the aisle by being willing to search for common ground around \nthe proposition of getting everybody covered.\n  But Democrats have also been willing to look at new approaches to \nmake sure we could address this issue in a bipartisan way. Senator \nStabenow has said the Healthy Americans Act focuses on a private \ndelivery system, a private delivery system which is, of course, what we \nenjoy. When we all go home, we go home to Montana or Michigan, and \neveryone says: We would like coverage like you people have back in the \nCongress.\n  Well, we have private coverage. I have a Blue Cross card in my \npocket. A couple of Wyden twins in a few weeks are going to get their \nhealth care through that Blue Cross card. Nancy is at home in Oregon, \nand we are going to have those kids in a few weeks. They are going to \nbe covered with private health insurance.\n  So we want to make sure everyone in this country has private choices \nlike Members of Congress have. As Senator Stabenow has mentioned, \nDemocrats who might have said, well, we ought to be looking at a \nGovernment program, are willing to reach out and work with Republicans \nto say: If we can cover everybody, if we can get everybody in America \ngood, quality, affordable coverage, we are willing to make sure there \nare private choices, which is something our colleagues on the \nRepublican side have talked about as well. We also have responsible \nways to pay for this program that covers all Americans.\n  As the Lewin Group has indicated--and the report is on our Web site \nso folks can see it--by redirecting the\n\n[[Page S12717]]\n\nmoney in the Tax Code, which now disproportionately favors the most \naffluent and rewards inefficiency, you get substantial funds in order \nto pay for the transition to a program that covers everybody.\n  Why in the world would we want to continue to say, if you are a high-\nflying CEO, you can go out and get a designer smile put on our face and \nwrite the cost of that off your taxes, while a woman of modest means at \nthe neighborhood furniture store, with no employer coverage, gets \nvirtually nothing out of the Tax Code. So Senator Stabenow and Senator \nGrassley and Senator Bennett and the other co-sponsors and I are going \nto work to redirect that Tax Code money to the people in the middle-\nincome brackets and the lower middle-income brackets so we make better \nuse of that money, which now is well over $200 billion.\n  We are also going to create, in our effort, significant \nadministrative savings. We are going to get some, as Senators Stabenow \nand Whitehouse and others have talked about, through better use of \nhealth information technology. I support that. We are also going to get \nthe savings, as the Lewin Group reported in looking at our legislation, \nby making sure that after you sign up once under the Healthy Americans \nAct, you are not going to have to go through a sign-up ever again if \nyou wish.\n\n  From that point on, everything will work through the world of \nelectronic transfers. And all of those folks who are low income, on \nMedicaid, who have to dive through all of these different boxes in \norder to be eligible, they will get choices like Members of Congress \nhave. And once they sign up, they are done. No more dehumanizing, \nwasteful kinds of programs where you have to sign up again and again \nand again. And you waste money and take dollars that ought to go, as \nSenator Stabenow has talked about, to make sure that every poor person \ndoes not fall between the cracks of the American health care system.\n  Our coalition is going to be talking a fair amount about this effort \non the floor of the Senate in the days ahead. We now have nine Senators \nas part of this effort. We are going to be talking about the ways this \nproposal modernizes the health system and how we make the changes from \nwhat we have today to what we will have in the future.\n  One other area that I would like to just touch on briefly is that I \nthink under the Healthy Americans Act we can respond to something that \nAmericans are talking about all over this country; that is, making the \nhealth care system portable. Right now, so many folks are pretty much \nlocked in their jobs and just hoping that their employer is not going \nto find health coverage unaffordable in the days ahead.\n  I cannot tell you how many times people in their late fifties have \ncome to me and said: Ron, I just hope my employer can hang on until I \nam 65 and I will be eligible for Medicare. We ought to make coverage \nportable so that if you change your job, in Michigan or Montana or \nanywhere else, your health care coverage goes with you.\n  Andy Stern, the President of the Service Employees Union, points out \nthat the typical worker today changes jobs about eight times by the \ntime they are 35. Let's come up with a system that ensures coverage is \nportable, and that even if you fall on hard times, even if you lose \nyour job, even if your company goes down, you are in a position to take \ngood, quality, affordable coverage--with choices like we have in \nCongress--with you.\n  I see a number of colleagues on the Senate floor. I think I would \njust like to wrap up by expressing my appreciation to Senator Stabenow \nfor coming today. She has appropriately singled out Senator Grassley as \nwell. I want to thank all of the members of our coalition. Health \nreform is a top issue. Everybody remembers what happened in 1993 and \nall of the ads and the shrill rhetoric.\n  It seemed every time you turned around in 1993, the decibel level \nwent up and up. Now what we are seeing, as Senator Stabenow touched on, \nis a group of Senators coming together on a bipartisan basis who want \nto roll up their sleeves, take out a sharp pencil, and go to work. This \nis going to be a lot of work. If Senator Stabenow and I got 100 Members \nof the Senate to be cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act today, it \nwould still be a lot of work because we are going to have to look at a \nvariety of issues and walk the country through all of these choices, \nthrough hearings and town meetings and forums, so we can pick up on all \nof the wisdom and suggestions that are out there across this land. But \nwe are making a very important start. We have received a huge boost \nthis week with the four additional Senators who have joined us.\n  To my friend from Michigan, for all her knowledge and passion and \nyears of effort, I want her to know how much I am looking forward to \nteaming up with her on this issue in the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3215\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We are making slow but steady progress. I, therefore, \ncall up amendment No. 3215. It is a Mikulski- Shelby amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3230 to Amendment No. 3215\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I also call up a second-degree amendment offered by \nSenator Coburn of Oklahoma, amendment No. 3230.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Coburn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3230 to amendment No. 3215.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure Department of Justice conference spending does not \n   fund excessive junkets, lavish meals, or organizations linked to \n                               terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATIONS ON FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CONFERENCES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, not more \n     than $15,000,000 of all funds made available to the \n     Department of Justice under this Act, may be available for \n     any expenses related to conferences, including for conference \n     programs, travel costs, and related expenses. No funds \n     appropriated under this Act may be used to support a \n     conference sponsored by any organization named as an \n     unindicted co-conspirator by the Government in any criminal \n     prosecution.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask that the second-degree amendment be agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3230) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Parliamentary inquiry: Did we agree to amendment 3215, \nas amended by Coburn, or did we just agree to the Coburn second degree?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We agreed to the Coburn second \ndegree.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now ask that amendment 3215, as amended by the Coburn \namendment, be agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3215, as \namended.\n  The amendment (No. 3215), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n\n[[Page S12718]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on the challenge posed by \nIran to our national security and the interests of our friends and \nallies, how the United States should best address the challenge posed \nby Iran and its leader Ahmadi-Nejad.\n  This has been much in the news lately. The Iranian President visited \nNew York to the United Nations general assembly last week and delivered \na controversial address at Columbia University. During the very same \nweek, the Senate approved a resolution condemning Iranian activity that \nhelped destabilize Iraq and called upon the administration to take \nactions to deter future Iranian meddling in Iraq and other places. It \nis no surprise that the debate over how to handle Iran occurs very much \nin the shadow of the Iraq war.\n  Five years ago, Congress voted to give the President the \nauthorization to go to war against Saddam Hussein based upon Iraq's \nalleged weapons of mass destruction programs. The shocking failure to \nuncover those so-called WMD programs and the fatally flawed manner in \nwhich the President took our Nation to war must weigh upon all of us \nnow as we debate the right course of action against Iran.\n  Let me be clear from the outset: Through its refusal to halt \nprohibited nuclear activities in the face of multiple United Nations \nresolutions, its support for extremist groups across the region, and \nits harsh crackdown in recent months on human rights and civil society \nleaders, the Government of Iran has demonstrated why it should be \nisolated from the international community. The United States must take \nthe lead in a concerted campaign to coerce Iran into changing course, \ndrawing upon all facets of American power, in close coordination with \nfriends and allies. We must always remember that while the Iranian \nGovernment may be hostile to our interests and values, it does not \nspeak for the Iranian people. While the Iranian clerical regime, in \npower since the 1979 resolution, has remained reliably anti-American, \nthe Iranian people, led by a younger generation born after the \ntraumatic events of the last 1970s, are remarkably open to American \nideals. Two-thirds of the Iranian population is below the age of 30. \nThese Iranians view the United States as a potential friend, not as an \nimplacable enemy.\n  Few Americans remember that a candlelight vigil was spontaneously \norganized in Tehran shortly following the 9/11 attacks, attended by \nthousands of ordinary Iranians to honor the memory of those who \nperished in those terrible attacks. I can think of no other Muslim \nnation where such a public expression of sympathy and solidarity \nemerged in the grief- stricken days following September 11. So in \narticulating our response to Iran's recent provocations, we must always \ndistinguish between the oppressive clerical regime and the Iranian \npeople.\n  The mullahs in Tehran would love nothing more than a perception that \nthe United States, and the broader West, by extension, is hostile \ntoward Iran itself. It would spark an instant boost in popularity for \nthe regime. Accordingly, any U.S. policy to diffuse Iran's nuclear \nprogram and halt its support for extremist groups elsewhere must be \nundertaken in a careful fashion, emphasizing that our quarrel lies with \nthe clerical regime, not the people of Iran.\n  Let me first address Iran's nuclear program. The Iranian regime has \nforfeited the goodwill of the international community by engaging in a \nsecret program over the past two decades to develop the key components \nof a nuclear fuel cycle--uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing. \nThese activities can constitute the elements of a peaceful civilian \nnuclear program, but the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to which Iran \nis a signatory requires that nations fully disclose such activities in \nan open and transparent fashion. That Iran went to such lengths to \nconceal its activities and continues today to refuse to provide a full \naccounting of the history of this program leads a reasonable observer \nto suspect that the program was intended not just for a civilian \nnuclear program but also to enable the production of fissile material \nfor nuclear weapons.\n\n  This crisis came to a head in 2003, when reports from an Iranian \nexile group prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, the \nU.N. nuclear watchdog, to open an investigation. Despite initial \nefforts by an alliance of European powers to persuade Iran to come \nclean with the IAEA, Tehran continued to work on its uranium enrichment \nprogram, spurning offers of economic and trade benefits.\n  Last year the United Nations Security Council took action, passing an \ninitial resolution calling upon Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment \nactivities. Iran ignored that resolution. The Security Council passed \ntwo successive resolutions imposing a set of limited sanctions. Yet \nagain, the Iranian regime chose to ignore a clear message from the \ninternational community. Today the United States is in talks with other \nU.N. Security Council members on a third and potentially more far-\nranging round of sanctions. To its credit, the Bush administration has \nmade very clear to Iran that the United States is willing to join a \ncomprehensive dialog with Iran and the so-called EU-3 nations--meaning \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Germany--once Iran verifiably suspends \nits uranium enrichment activities. Iran has refused to do so, and so it \nis on pace to operate as many as 3,000 uranium centrifuges by the end \nof the year. Under a worst-case estimate, if Iran were to eject all \ninternational inspectors and operate these 3,000 centrifuges around the \nclock, it could produce sufficient fissile material for one nuclear \nwarhead within a year.\n  An armed Iran that has a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapons would be \nemboldened to intimidate its neighbors, export Islamic extremism \nthroughout the region, and deter the United States and others from \ndefending their core interests. A regime with leaders who have openly \ncalled for the destruction of the State of Israel by ``wiping it'' off \nthe face of the Earth cannot be allowed to possess the means to achieve \nthat goal. Furthermore, we cannot abide the risk, however small, that a \nnuclear Iran may one day decide to share its nuclear technology and \nmaterial with a client terrorist group such as Hamas or Hezbollah.\n  Iran's nuclear program also poses a genuine danger to the future of \nthe nuclear nonproliferation treaty, so-called NPT, an agreement that \nhas helped prevent the nightmare vision of President Kennedy of a world \nwith 20 nuclear powers from coming to fruition. The NPT is based upon a \nfundamental premise. A nonnuclear weapon state is entitled to a \ncivilian nuclear program in exchange for committing to verification and \ninspections to ensure it does not produce nuclear weapons. Yet Iran \nthreatens to demonstrate a backdoor option for future nuclear \naspirants. Here is what it is: build a civilian program, with a \ncomplete nuclear fuel cycle, in open view to acquire the basic \nknowledge to produce nuclear fissile material.\n\n  After achieving that goal, a nation can then withdraw from the NPT \nand, utilizing the knowledge gained from its civilian program, build \nnuclear weapons. This so-called virtual nuclear weapon threatens to \nundermine the NPT and lead to a world where multiple states are poised \non the thin line between civilian nuclear power and weapons programs. \nFor that reason, the international community must demonstrate a united \nfront to compel Iran away from that path through diplomatic and \neconomic pressure.\n  The threat posed by an Iranian nuclear weapon is very real. However, \nwe cannot afford to panic and blindly accept worst-case scenarios, as \nwe did with Iraq to such tragic ends. Iran has made great strides in \nits nuclear program over the past 3 years, but it must do much more if \nit seeks a nuclear weapon. We do not know to what extent those Iranian \ncentrifuges already produced are operationally active and whether they \nhave been linked together in a required ``enriched cascade.'' We do not \nknow whether the Iranian regime has begun work on warhead design so any \nhighly enriched uranium that may eventually be produced can be \nfabricated into an actual nuclear weapon.\n  It is those uncertainties, and the recognition that any ``crash \nprogram'' to build a nuclear weapon will encounter inevitable \ndifficulties, that explain\n\n[[Page S12719]]\n\nwhy our intelligence community has judged that Iran is not likely--not \nlikely--to acquire a nuclear weapon until the early to middle part of \nthe next decade. This conclusion is spelled out in the most recent \nNational Intelligence Estimate.\n  Based upon what the International Atomic Energy Agency has been \nreporting with regard to the Iranian nuclear program, and what our own \nintelligence community is telling us, we have time--we have time--to \nresolve this very complex, serious challenge. That does not mean we \nhave the luxury to relax or postpone difficult choices, but, rather, \nthat we can exercise a methodical approach that gradually escalates the \ndiplomatic and economic pressure against Iran in a unified manner.\n  We must present a very clear choice to the Iranian regime--it is \nthis--one that will be visible to the people of Iran: End all illicit \nnuclear activities, come back into compliance with IAEA safeguards, and \nprovide full transparency. That is one choice. In return, the United \nStates and our European partners will be prepared to return to the \ntable and discuss potential economic and trade benefits. If Iran \nchooses the path of continued defiance--the path they have been on--we \nmust show that the international community is prepared to deny Iran the \nbenefits of the global economy, including trade in key energy products, \nfacilitation of essential financial transactions, and investment in key \neconomic sectors.\n  Iran's nuclear program is not the only threat that emanates from \nTehran today. Just as critical is Iran's ongoing support for extremist \nmovements across the region, ranging from Hamas in the Gaza Strip and \nHezbollah in Lebanon to Shiite militia forces in Iraq. Unfortunately, \nIran's leadership today has made the strategic decision to support \nthese forces, promoting chaos and instability across the Middle East.\n  The Iranian Government has placed itself on the side of those who are \nundermining democratically elected governments, fomenting violence and \nanarchy, and contributing to attacks against U.S. forces. So long as \nthe Iranian Government continues to bankroll and supply weapons to \nterrorist groups and insurgent militias, we cannot expect any semblance \nof constructive dialog between Tehran and Washington.\n  The evidence surrounding Iranian involvement in Iraq is particularly \ndisturbing. Iran has interests in Iraq. We know that. The Shiite \nmajority that now has power for the first time in Iraq shares vast \ncultural, religious, and political links with the Iranian people. \nHowever, Iran and Iraq are two different nations, and the Shiite \npopulation in Iraq does not and should not serve as a proxy for the \nmullahs in Tehran. When the Iranian Government provides weapons and \nfinancing to sectarian militias battling other Iraqis as well as U.S. \nforces in Iraq, it is only exacerbating the violence that currently \nplagues Iraq.\n  The administration in Washington, supported by our military \nleadership, has alleged that the Iranian Government has directly \nsupplied insurgent groups in Iraq with mortars, rocket-propelled \ngrenades, and, most dangerous of all, the explosive formed penetrators \nthat have served as the most lethal of roadside bombs killing American \ntroops.\n  The evidence the administration has provided--serial numbers on the \nweapons linking them to Iranian sources and eyewitness testimony--is \ncompelling. It remains unclear to what degree this assistance has \nproceeded with the direct knowledge of Iran's senior ruling leadership. \nRegardless, the Iranian Government must be held responsible for all \nactivities--all activities--emanating from its territory or carried out \nby its agents. Iran must work with the United States and the \ninternational community in supporting a stable Iraq and deemphasizing \nsectarian conflict there.\n  The question that we, as Senators, must answer is how best to \npersuade and, if necessary, compel Iran to change its behavior both in \nterms of its nuclear program and its support for extremist groups. What \nare the tools available to us to persuade Iran that its current course \nof action will only further isolate it from the international \ncommunity? How can we promote fissures inside the Iranian regime \nbetween the hard-line elements associated with President Ahmadi-Nejad \nand more pragmatic figures?\n  I believe the United States should implement a strategy of \ncontainment to deny the Iranian regime any benefits from its nuclear \nprogram and support for extremist forces, while laying out potential--\npotential--incentives if and when the regime changes its behavior. Let \nme be clear: Military force is always an option, but it is not an \noption that makes sense under the current circumstances.\n  Instead, the United States should pursue a three-pronged strategy \nagainst Iran's nuclear program and its support for extremist groups.\n  First, the United States should continue its campaign to \ndiplomatically isolate Iran at the United Nations Security Council. The \nSecurity Council has condemned Iran's evasion and deceit of the IAEA \nand called on Iran, in order to restore the world's confidence in the \nostensibly peaceful aims of its nuclear program, to halt all work--to \nhalt all work--on its uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing \nactivities.\n  While some may view that action as insignificant, it is important to \nremember that Iran never expected Russia or China--its two primary \nbenefactors--to sign onto such resolutions. Yet the State Department \nhas carefully brought along Moscow and Beijing at every step so that \nthe international community is speaking in a united voice to Tehran. \nToday, the Iranian regime is viewed as a pariah state at the \ninternational level, with sanctions imposed by the Security Council and \nkey officials linked to the nuclear program prohibited from \ninternational travel.\n\n  Now it is time for the United States to further isolate Iran \ndiplomatically. Washington can encourage other nations to avoid contact \nwith Mr. Ahmadi-Nejad, who should be shunned first and foremost for his \nnoxious anti-Semitic remarks. The United States should propose, as one \nelement--as one element--of the next sanctions resolution, to impose a \ncomplete prohibition on arms exports to Iran. To the extent we can make \na clear linkage between Iran's defiance on its nuclear program and its \nfurther diplomatic isolation, more and more Iranians, including \ninfluential officials in the Government and military, will question the \nwisdom of proceeding with its nuclear program.\n  Second, the United States should take action in concert with other \nnations to apply substantial pressure on Iran's energy sector. Although \nIran boasts the world's second largest oil reserves, its oil production \nhas been falling in recent years, as its oilfields suffer from a lack \nof investment. More importantly, as Iran's population continues to grow \nby a half a million people every year, demand for oil and other energy \nresources is beginning to outstrip domestic supply. Iran will soon be \nforced to confront a choice between diverting petroleum exports to its \ndomestic needs, thus surrendering much needed foreign currency, or \nfacing increasing shortages at home.\n  There are concrete steps the Congress can take. S. 970, the Iran \nCounter-Proliferation Act of 2007, of which I am proud to serve as a \ncosponsor, would close existing loopholes in the Iran Sanctions Act \nthat currently allows subsidiaries of multinational firms to escape \nU.S. sanctions when they invest in Iran's energy sector. I agree with \nRepresentative Tom Lantos, who has pushed forward similar legislation \non the House side, when he says the ultimate U.S. goal should be zero--\nzero--foreign investment in Iran's energy sector until it changes \ncourse on its nuclear program.\n  Iran exhibits a particular vulnerability when it comes to gasoline. \nIt is still suffering from the after effects of the Iran-Iraq war of \nthe 1980s, when much of Iran's capacity to refine gasoline was \ndestroyed. In recent years, U.S. sanctions have limited the ability of \nIran to rebuild its refining capacity through foreign investment. \nAccordingly, Iran is forced to import as much as 40 percent--40 \npercent--of its annual consumption of refined gasoline, despite its \nvast oil riches.\n  This imbalance between supply and demand for refined gasoline is \nexacerbated by Iran's practice of subsidizing gasoline prices for its \ncitizens, which only artificially boosts demand. Today, Iran ensures \nthat refined gasoline is available to Iranian citizens at the \nsubsidized price of 38 cents per gallon. It is\n\n[[Page S12720]]\n\nno wonder, then, that Iran, early this year, was forced to take the \ndraconian step of rationing gasoline, limiting the owners of private \nvehicles to no more than 26 gallons of fuel per month. This decision \nproduced a backlash in the country, with more than 50 petrostations in \nIran burned to the ground by angry mobs and plummeting support for the \nIranian President, who largely ascended to power in 2005 on the basis \nof his promise to improve Iran's economy.\n  Iran's growing shortages of refined gasoline is a golden opportunity \nfor the international community as it tightens the screws on Iran's \nleadership.\n  The average Iranian will question why Iran's leadership continues to \npursue an illicit nuclear program at the cost of gasoline shortages and \neconomic unrest. For that reason, I am working on legislation to expand \nthe scope of the Iran Sanctions Act to crack down on all foreign \nexports of refined gasoline products to Iran until the leadership there \nchanges course on its nuclear program.\n  I wish to now go to the third and final pillar of a comprehensive \nU.S. strategy to coerce Iran into ending its defiance of the \ninternational community.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CASEY. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much longer does the Senator intend to talk? We \nknow the Senator from Wisconsin needs to talk, and we need to clear \nsome of our amendments and get ready for a NASA amendment. Of course we \nwant the Senator to finish his third pillar.\n  Mr. CASEY. If I could have about 3\\1/2\\ to 4 more minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator could contain his remarks, it would be \nuseful to us.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator.\n  The third pillar, just like the first two, should be to take prudent \nsteps in this strategy.\n  The third and final pillar of a comprehensive U.S. strategy to coerce \nIran into ending its defiance of the international community is to lay \nthe groundwork for financial sanctions that make it increasingly \ndifficult for Iranian companies and banks to do business with the \nglobal economy. The steps taken by the Treasury Department under the \nleadership of Secretary Paulson and his deputy, Stuart Levey, are a \ngood first step. Utilizing existing U.S. law, such as the Patriot Act, \nthe Treasury Department has convinced a series of major financial \ninstitutions in Western Europe and Asia to suspend business with \nIranian financial institutions such as Bank Saderat and Bank Sepah by \ncutting off the access of these institutions to the U.S. financial \nsystem. The United States can pursue these measures outside the United \nNations Security Council, as they involve U.S. laws and regulations. As \na result, Iranian firms are increasingly forced to finance their \ntransactions in Euros, not dollars, and find that conducting routine \nfinancial transactions to be more difficult and costly. Once again, we \nmust demonstrate to the average Iranian that they are the ones who pay \na price for the unwise decisions of the Iranian regime--which will only \nserve to heighten domestic unrest and dissatisfaction with the regime's \ncurrent course.\n  It is for this reason I am so pleased to cosponsor the Iran Sanctions \nEnabling Act, introduced by my colleagues Senators Obama and Brownback. \n This legislation would call upon the Treasury Department to publicly \nidentify all companies that invest in a minimum level of funds in the \nIranian economy, giving pension funds and individual investors an \ninformed choice on whether to continue to direct funds to those firms \nthat do business with Iran. In addition, the legislation would grant \nunfettered legal authority to State and local governments to divest \ntheir investment holdings of any such firms that do business in Iran. \nIf the State of Pennsylvania, for example, wishes to wash its hands \nclean of any firms that directly or indirectly support Iran's pursuit \nof a nuclear program, this legislation ensures that it can do so free \nfrom any lawsuits.\n\n  I wish to conclude this statement by briefly discussing what we \nshould not do. If we are to convince the Iranian regime that a nuclear \nweapons program and support for extremist groups are not in their best \ninterests, then we should strive to remove any plausible excuse they \nhave for engaging in such behavior. That means the United States should \nde-emphasize the threat of regime change. When people associated with \nthe Vice President drop hints on their desire to overthrow the Iranian \nregime and the advantages of using military force, they only reinforce \na strong nationalist streak within Iran and serve to rally the Iranian \npeople around an otherwise unpopular government.\n  The Iranian people rightly aspire for democratic change. To the \nextent that the U.S. Government can support such aspirations in an \neffective manner, we should do so through quiet assistance to forces \npromoting civil society and the rule of law inside Iran. People-to-\npeople exchanges can help bring young Iranians to the United States and \ndemonstrate the benefits of a democratic culture and a government \ninformed by the consent of the people. Credible public diplomacy, \nincluding the transmission of accurate and unbiased news into Iran, is \nanother necessary pillar. But, as Iraq has so painfully taught us, \nimposing democracy at the spear of bayonet is not a realistic option, \nespecially when our military is already so overstretched.\n  So the United States should talk less about regime change and talk \nmore about behavior change when it comes to Iran. We should make clear \nthat Washington is prepared to engage an Iran that ends its illicit \nnuclear activities and ceases support for Hamas, Hezbollah, insurgent \nforces in Iraq, and other extremist groups across the region. Laying \nout a credible choice to the Iranian regime represents our best hope \nfor defusing the crisis over Iran's nuclear program and persuading Iran \nto end its support for antidemocratic groups throughout the Middle \nEast.\n  The tentative success achieved in North Korea gives us a model for \nwhich to aspire. During the President's first term, his administration \nraised the desirability of regime change in Pyongyang at every \nopportunity. Since 2005, under the leadership of Assistant Secretary \nChris Hill, the United States has substituted patient diplomacy for \nfiery rhetoric and we may finally achieve real success in containing \nand rolling back North Korea's nuclear program.\n  Iran today represents one of the greatest national security \nchallenges to the United States. It is incumbent that we respond to \nthis threat with hardheaded diplomacy and an appropriate set of \nfinancial sanctions to squeeze the Iranian economy, putting aside for \nnow ill-advised talk of hasty military action. Iran's leaders must be \npresented with a fundamental choice: end your defiance of the \ninternational community or face growing isolation.\n  I think we have an opportunity to get this policy right, but this \nwill require bipartisan work. It will require cooperation in this body \nand the other body, and it will require the administration to work with \nthe Congress to get this policy right. We cannot afford to get our \nIranian policy wrong and make the same mistakes we made--this country \nmade--leading up to the war in Iraq. So for that reason and all of the \nreasons I outlined in my statement, it is imperative that we do this \ncarefully and thoughtfully to get this policy right, to prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining nuclear capability which threatens the Middle East and \nthreatens the United States and threatens the entire world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask that the pending Inouye \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3213, As Modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3213, as \nmodified, by Senator Domenici of New Mexico and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3213, as modified.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S12721]]\n\n                    amendment no. 3213, as modified\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEPUTY UNITED STATES MARSHALS.\n\n       (a) Increase Positions.--In each of the fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012, the Attorney General, subject to the \n     availability of appropriations, may increase by not less than \n     50 the number of positions for full-time active duty Deputy \n     United States Marshals assigned to work on immigration-\n     related matters, including transporting prisoners and working \n     in Federal courthouses.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Attorney General such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012 \n     to carry out subsection (a).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle, and as an act of respect for our colleague, I ask \nfor its immediate adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3213), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are continuing to clear our \namendments, and at or about 2 o'clock, we will begin our debate on the \nNASA amendment, which we expect will take roughly about 2 hours. At the \nconclusion of that, we want Senators who have amendments to have either \nbrought them over for consideration, to have either worked with us to \nclear the amendments, to be either offering the amendments or \nwithdrawing the amendments, so that we can meet our goal to be done in \nthe early evening. We believe we can meet that goal with cooperation. \nWe are in the business of clearing amendments. We hope to have several \ncleared before we begin the NASA debate, which we expect to be \nextensive.\n  I note the Senator from Wisconsin wants to speak at this time. I am \ngoing to need about 10 or 15 minutes to actually do the work of the \nbill. I understand both of my colleagues wish to speak. I am more than \nhappy to cooperate, but at about 10 of 2, we have to move to cleared \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                      Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is no secret that Africa has not been \nhigh on Congress's priority list historically. This is due to a number \nof reasons including that African issues have not generated the same \nkind of public passion and constituent attention as closer-to-home \nsubjects like health care or education. But this is beginning to \nchange. Interest in Africa is at its highest level in recent memory--\nperhaps ever.\n  I am concerned, however, that because the bulk of this attention is \nfocused on humanitarian tragedies and grave violence we are depicting a \ncontinent caught in a downward spiral, which offers little motivation \nfor long-term U.S. engagement. Funding relief efforts in response to \ncrises--while an important element of U.S. policy--does not address \nfundamental issues such as the development of democratic institutions \nand civil society, good governance, security and justice sector reform, \nand regional security arrangements. We must provide more focus on these \nunderlying concerns--and to do so requires consistent, long-term \nengagement, collaboration, and commitment from national governments, \nregional and international organizations and, of course, bilateral \ndonors like the United States.\n  Sporadic engagement that is devoid of a long- term strategy is like \nsticking a band aid on a gaping wound instead of taking a trip to the \nhospital. The abundant potential that exists in so many parts of \nAfrica, and which the United States and others should be more actively \npromoting, is being stalled or even undermined by our quick-fix \napproach to problem-solving on the continent. Without identifying and \ndeveloping the possibilities for more serious engagement, we may end up \ndoing more harm than good.\n  At the end of our August recess I traveled to the Democratic Republic \nof Congo and Uganda, two countries that have made impressive gains \nsince I was last there 7 years ago. But today I want to talk about the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo primarily, because the situation is \ngravely deteriorating and urgent steps much be taken to stop it from \ndevolving further and threatening the region writ large.\n  Last year's historic elections in the DRC injected hopeful momentum \ninto the war-torn country, thanks in large part to generous funding \nfrom the U.S. and others and with critical support from a strong United \nNations peacekeeping mission--the largest in fact in the world. During \nmy visit, however, I was troubled to learn of the new government's \nfailure to consolidate and build upon this historic progress. A lack of \ncapacity, political will, and democratic experience is reversing early \ngains and increasingly destabilizing an already fragile political \nsituation. The local population is growing disenchanted with the \ngovernment's inability to follow through on its election promises as \ndecisions on key issues--including those on decentralization and the \nillegal exploitation of natural resources--are slow-rolled.\n  One of the first promises President Kabila made after his election \nwas to restore order in the war-ravaged provinces of his country. But \nviolence in eastern DRC has only gotten worse in recent months, not \nbetter. More than 120,000 people--many of whom voted in favor of \nKabila--have been forced from their homes because of increased \nfighting, with little attention or assistance from the capital.\n  There is no easy solution to the rapidly unfolding conflict in the \nrestive east, but it is clear that the underlying drivers for this \ncontinued violence must be addressed at the same time that the more \nimmediate emergency needs are dealt with.\n  On my trip, I visited a camp for internally displaced in eastern DRC. \nOne Congolese man, living in a camp nestled in the rolling hills \noutside Goma spoke for many others when he told me: We want to restart \nour normal agricultural work and resume our lives. We want it to be \nstable enough so we can do that.\n  I met with a group of displaced Congolese women who had been sexually \nabused and in many cases raped. Extreme sexual violence and rape in the \nDRC is so pervasive because it is committed by all actors and with \nlittle consequence. Sadly, afraid I am afraid it is not getting any \nbetter. Just 2 days after I left, tens of thousands more civilians were \nforced to flee their homes because of renewed fighting between the \nCongolese army and dissident General Laurent Nkunda's rebel forces, \nwhose ammunition, weapons, and fighters are likely supplied by Rwanda.\n  In early September, U.N. peacekeepers secured an informal, and I \nmight add, already violated truce between the government and a main \nrebel leader. The U.N. Security Council has appealed for more dialogue \nbetween the two warring parties but this appeal needs to be \nsignificantly amplified and backed by incentives for peace. Neighboring \ncountries--and particularly Rwanda--need to be part of this \nconversation, to ensure the current situation does not worsen while \nalso effectively addressing longstanding regional tensions.\n  In contrast, on a recent trip to Uganda, the U.S. Assistant Secretary \nfor African Affairs signaled that the U.S. would support regional \nefforts for a more militarized policy towards all rebel groups. In fact \nAssistant Secretary Frazer said: We feel we have the basis to assist in \nefforts to mop up the LRA and to get them out of Congo, out of Garamba \nPark. And so we will not sit still and just let them live in Garamba \nPark and cultivate land and kill animals. This is not the time to start \ntalking about our support for a military solution to these conflicts.\n  Instead, we should seek to build upon current diplomatic \ninitiatives--both in the region as well as at New York last week at the \nopening of the U.N. General Assembly.\n  We should work to expand existing forums such as the Tripartite Plus \nCommission to become genuine opportunities for political solutions. The \nUnited States, a proud champion of building strong and independent \ninstitutions that create the space for lively debate and discussion, \nshould be advocating for enriched dialogue and diplomacy to address the \nentrenched problems that have allowed these conflicts to fester--or \nworsen. We should not be\n\n[[Page S12722]]\n\nencouraging military operations if there are other legitimate avenues \nopen--or if they have not yet been explored. Military action should be \nthe path of last resort, period.\n\n  The Great Lakes region is at a critical moment in its history and we \nrun the risk of contributing to events that could have far-reaching and \nlong-term repercussions if we do not engage responsibly. With its vast \nresources, the DRC could be an anchor of stability in an area that has \nbeen plagued by violence and destructive activity for decades. The \nchanging nature of global threats could render sub-Saharan Africa--and \nthe Great Lakes region in particular--ripe for exploitation by any \nnumber of rogue actors. We can stop this before it begins if we work to \nensure stability for the long term.\n  Our National Security Strategy states:\n\n       We will work with others for an African continent that \n     lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.\n\n  We must help strengthen Africa's fragile states and help build \nindigenous capability secure porous border.\n  I know the United States has many priorities that compete for \nattention and resources, but if done right, and as part of a \ncomprehensive long-term strategy, a little can go a long way towards \nachieving these lofty goals in Africa. The United States should \nincrease engagement in and expand assistance to the eastern DRC.\n  We should work in concert with other allies and press all regional \ngovernments--and in particular Rwanda--to adopt a renewed focus on a \npolitical solution for peace. It must be clear that the United States \nsupports peaceful conflict resolution, and that we\nare not a war-mongering country that prioritizes quick military fixes \nover more protracted, but also more likely to be sustainable, political \ndialogues.\n  First, we must increase our support for the DRC's security sector \nreform initiatives by working with the Congolese government to \ndownsize, discipline, and further transform its military. The national \narmy must no longer be allowed to commit grave human rights abuses with \nabandon as this only contributes to the rampant impunity and public \nlegitimacy deficit indicative of a weak state. Justice sector reform, \nwithin and outside the security sector, is essential in this regard.\n  Second, while Ambassador Bill Swing is doing an incredible job in the \nDRC as the Secretary General's special representative, we must augment \ndiplomatic attention to the east part of the country by calling for the \nappointment of a U.N. special envoy who will work in conjunction with \nthe current special envoy for northern Uganda--former Mozambique \nPresident Chissano. Such an initiative will jump start a regional \nprocess for political engagement that can help to reverse the current \ndeterioration and work towards resolving longstanding grievances \nbetween a number of actors in the region. Time and time again on my \nrecent trip I was pleased to learn of the credibility and integrity \nPresident Chissano has injected into the northern Uganda peace process; \nwe need to see the same thing for eastern Congo.\n  Third, we need to significantly augment U.S. government efforts in \nthe region. The U.S. government needs to be fully engaged to bring \nabout stability in eastern Congo and to establish conditions for a \nsustainable peace throughout the region. The dearth of U.S. personnel \nin the DRC means we have little choice but to outsource our diplomacy \nto others, which should not become the norm. In the face of a steadily \nincreasing conflict that could ignite tensions throughout the region, \nwe should be looking to robustly increase our on-the-ground presence \nbefore it is too late.\n  It is the grim truth that our mission in Kinshasa is not equipped to \nhandle the looming instability in the east and that we are limited in \nour engagement because we have no diplomatic presence in the conflict-\naffected areas.\n  I do not wish to insinuate that this is due to lack of interest, \nconcern, or dedication from the committed embassy team we have on the \nground in Kinshasa. On the contrary, I got to know those individuals on \nmy recent visit and was very impressed with both their capacity \nand resourcefulness with the limited means available to them. It is \nbecause of this administration's myopic focus elsewhere that we are not \nadequately able to respond in places like the Democratic Republic of \nCongo.\n\n  As a first step, the Secretary of State should dispatch a ``booster'' \nteam to help prepare the embassy to deal with the diplomatic, \nhumanitarian, and security work needed in order to exercise our \ninfluence and to participate in a broader international effort to \nprevent eastern DRC from deteriorating into complete chaos. At the same \ntime, we need to begin looking at serious infrastructure change that \nwill enable our front line diplomats to have the resources and \nflexibility they need not just in Africa, but throughout the world.\n  The United States has much to offer beyond public statements to \nensure that violence in the DRC does not escalate further and that \nthose who have been displaced can look forward to returning home sooner \nrather than later.\n  We in Congress need to send a strong signal that we are not going to \nturn a blind eye to the deteriorating situation in the east--or to the \nadministration's inadequate response. In eastern DRC, as in other parts \nof Africa, we must take steps today to promote political solutions that \ntruly address the underlying causes of conflict, or else we will be \ngrappling with these vicious crises for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Wisconsin \non his comments and his compelling defense for the oppressed, and \nparticularly his eloquent and poignant description of what is happening \nto women there in the Congo, which should motivate us more to action.\n  I am happy to report we are getting momentum here and are clearing \nour amendments. We have some right now that I wish to clear. In a few \nminutes, we will be going to the NASA amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank everybody on both sides of the aisle, and \nespecially Senator Shelby and his team for being great in helping us \nwith this. Many Senators are being cooperative.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3222\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment has got a rollcall of \ncosponsors. Of course, it is cosponsored by my very able ranking \nmember, Senator Shelby; Senator Hutchison of Texas, another strong \nadvocate of space and one of the original architects; Senator Landrieu \nof Louisiana; Nelson and Martinez of Florida--Nelson is an astronaut--\nSalazar of Colorado; Lieberman; and strong bipartisan support from \nSenators Bennett and Vitter. Senator Clinton of New York is included, \nas well as Senator Brown of Ohio.\n  This amendment will increase funding for NASA. It is unique and \nhistoric\n\n[[Page S12724]]\n\nthat we offer this amendment right at this minute. This is the 50th \nanniversary of Sputnik. Fifty years ago, that 180-pound piece of round \nmetal went into space and changed the destiny of mankind. When Sputnik \nwent up, we didn't know what the intent of the Russians was, but a \nwonderful Republican President by the name of Eisenhower knew we had to \nget into the space race. We have been in it ever since. But it has \nnever been for predatory purposes or military purposes. Our NASA has \nalways been to go where no man or woman has ever gone before, to be \ninvolved in discovery, to also come up with the science to protect our \nown planet and to further our national agenda in aeronautics.\n  Joining us today, as we offer this amendment, in the gallery are the \nastronauts from the space ship Endeavor. They have spent 14 days in \nspace, continuing the work to assemble the International Space Station, \nwhich is our lab in the sky, which will also be a gateway to go back to \nthe Moon and stay there when we do, and then on to Mars; after that, \nwho knows where. We welcome them today to watch this debate because, \njust as we want to keep space free of politics, we want them to see \nthat here on the Senate floor we can work on a bipartisan basis to put \nthe money in the Federal checkbook to do what NASA needs to do to keep \nthis mission.\n  What this amendment does is adds $1 billion to NASA's budget. It \ncovers the cost of repairing and upgrading the safety of its space \nshuttle fleet. It comes in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia \naccident in 2003. The funding was declared an emergency and they \nreceived full funding to return to space.\n  Our amendment follows the precedent set after the 1986 Space Shuttle \nChallenger accident, when Congress made a special appropriation to get \nthe shuttle flying again. So this amendment follows the precedent set \nin 1986 after the Challenger accident. A one-time amount of $3 billion \nwas given to NASA to get the shuttle flying again--not only to simply \nget it flying, but to make sure our astronauts were safe when they did \nfly.\n  By contrast, after the Columbia accident in 2003, NASA only received \n$100 million in special appropriations. Let me be clear, our goal is \nnot to increase the NASA space budget but to restore the funding that \nwas forced to get after the Columbia accident.\n  This funding is necessary for three reasons: First, since 2003, when \nthat terrible melancholy event occurred, it has cost NASA over $2 \nbillion to comply with the recommendations of Admiral Gehman to fix \nwhat it would take for the remaining shuttles and to fly them safely. \nAdmiral Gehman was asked by the Nation to chair a commission to see \nwhat it would take to restore the shuttle's ability to fly again, but \nalso to protect those astronauts. It had engineering solutions, \ntechnological solutions, and management recommendations. It was a great \nreport and it was expensive, and do you know what. It was worth it. Is \nthe shuttle flying safely today? You bet it is, and we are all \nthankful.\n  At the same time, though, the shuttle has become more expensive to \nmaintain and fly safely. The shuttle is a bit old. It has been hit by \nunforeseen events, from a hurricane to damage in space. We need the \nshuttle to maintain our commitment to the International Space Station, \nwhere we have treaty obligations.\n  Second, another reason to support this amendment is the shuttle will \nbe retired in 2010, and we are faced with the challenge of developing a \nnew, reliable, safe human flight vehicle. But the costs of returning \nthe shuttle to flight have forced NASA to cut funds for the next \ntransportation vehicle by almost $500 million. This cut contributes to \nthe gap of over 5 years between when the shuttle retires in 2010 and \nwhen we get a brandnew vehicle in 2015.\n  This is not acceptable. We cannot let China get to the Moon before \nthe United States does. We also need to make sure we keep our \nastronauts safe for the remaining time they use the shuttle. Also we \nhave to keep that excellent talent down there of scientists, engineers, \nand mechanics, to keep our shuttle flying safely.\n  Third, NASA has had to forage for funds in other programs to pay to \nfix the shuttles. Since 2003, science and aeronautics have been cut by \nalmost $100 million.\n  Science on the space station has been drastically cut. This has a \nripple effect within the scientific community. It affects our future \nability to understand and protect changes in our planet and in other \nissues. The National Academy of Sciences says we need more space \nscience, not less.\n  The consequences of not doing this amendment are clear. It \ncontributes to the delay of our next space transportation vehicle. No \none wants that. We do not want to be grounded for an extensive period \nof time. It reduces our commitment to our international treaty \nobligations on the space station.\n  The goals of the amendment are clear. It maintains our commitment to \nsafe, reliable, and robust human spaceflight. It keeps us on track for \nthe next reliable space transportation vehicle and maintains our \ncommitment to scientific discovery.\n  We didn't leave NASA with an unpaid bill 20 years ago, and we \nshouldn't do it now. Twenty years ago, our colleagues, Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens, provided $2.7 billion out of the defense budget to buy \na replacement space shuttle. We did not cut NASA's budget after the \nChallenger accident. We shouldn't do it after the Columbia accident.\n  We recommend this amendment because it is $1 billion. It follows the \nprecedent from the Challenger accident. It does not add to the base. It \nfulfills important national goals which were set by our President to \nlay the groundwork for space exploration to Mars. But if we are going \nto do that, I believe we have the national will to do that, I believe \nwe need the national wallet to do that.\n  So 50 years after the birth of our great Apollo Program, we need to \nmake sure we keep our commitment to exploration and discovery. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on an amendment \nSenator Mikulski and I have worked on for a long time. After we lost \nthe space shuttle Columbia over Texas and we were so involved in the \ncleanup of that tragic accident, all of us--Senator Shelby, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Nelson from Florida, many of us--did try to make sure \nwe had the funding that was needed, first of all, for a comprehensive \nreview of what happened. We did have an incredibly good product from \nthe Commission that was put together that did determine the cause. We \ndid fund that at $100 million. But the added safeguards and safety \nmeasures that were required by that study and the Commission report \nwere not funded.\n  As Senator Mikulski said, we are about $2 billion to $3 billion in \nthe hole. We cannot allow that to happen because here we are on the \n50th anniversary of Sputnik and it is another sputnik moment. When all \nof us in America were shocked that Russia had put up the first \nspaceflight, we were left to say: Why weren't we first?\n  Today, 50 years later, we are looking at a 5-year gap from the end of \nthe space shuttle before the crew-return vehicle will be on line to put \nAmerican astronauts back in space. That is another Sputnik moment.\n  Are we going to rely on Russia after 2010 to put American astronauts \nin space? I hope not. I hope America never loses its commitment to be \nthe first in technology, in knowing what can be done, in exploring \nissues we haven't even thought about because we know how much that \nexploration has already done for our country.\n  In fact, what has happened is exactly as Senator Mikulski just \nexplained. The accounts for NASA have been drained. We have drained \nfrom science, we have drained from the Hubble telescope, and we have \ndrained from other aeronautics research to fund the Columbia accident \nreport and safeguards, and we have not moved forward for the crew-\nreturn vehicle.\n  It is estimated that if we can get this billion dollars and if we can \nfully fund the accounts that have been bled, we could chop at least 2 \nyears off that gap.\n  We are talking about a technological and educational issue at a time \nwhen India and China are doing more and more exploration into space, \nand we\n\n[[Page S12725]]\n\nare talking about a national security issue that the United States \nwould not have the capability for 5 years to put an American astronaut \nin space.\n  Who can forget the beginning of the war against terror when we were \nputting missiles, guided through satellites, into windows from 2 miles \naway because we have that capability we have gained from the \nexploration in space. In addition, if we look at the science and \ninnovation we must continue to pursue to make the investment in the \nspace station worthwhile and to keep our commitment to our \ninternational partners, we have to be willing to put the amount that is \nrequired from America with our international partners into the space \nstation. That, too, has been robbed.\n  Just think, last month Senator Mikulski and I went to a signing \nbetween the National Institutes of Health and NASA of an agreement that \nthe National Institutes of Health would be a partner in the \ninternational space station lab, that it would begin to do some of the \nfar-reaching medical research that could only be done in the space \nstation because of the microgravity conditions, and NIH signed the \nagreement. Are we going to continue to rob the accounts for scientific \nresearch at a time when we are on the cusp of doing the research about \nwhich we have been talking--research into breast cancer, research into \nosteoporosis--where we can see the cells grow because there is no \ngravity that is pulling against the growth?\n  What about Dr. Samuel Ting, the Nobel laureate from MIT who testified \nbefore our committee? I am the ranking member--former chairman--of the \nNASA, space, and science subcommittee. He came to our committee and \nwowed all of us with the potential for scientific research on the space \nstation. He is a Nobel laureate in physics. He said cosmic rays are the \nmost intense in space. On the space station, we can begin to find what \ncosmic rays do in that intensity and perhaps even begin to find a new \nenergy source from being able to harness those cosmic rays and create a \nform of energy which he says can only and best be done on the space \nstation.\n  I ask my colleagues, in a time when we are all trying to find ways to \ncut back on expenditures that are not necessary, to look at this \namendment carefully because it is an investment in the future. It is an \ninvestment to make sure our technology transfers are continued. As an \nexample, look at the items on Earth that have been discovered or \nenhanced by space research: international TV broadcasts, pacemakers, \nautomatic insulin pumps, car phones, CAT scans, infrared thermometers, \nlong-range weather forecasting which has revolutionized not only our \nagriculture industry but the ability to predict hurricanes. We have so \nmany quality-of-life issues that have been enhanced or discovered \nbecause we were willing to do this research.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at this investment. Do we want to see \nthis go to the Chinese or to India or to Russia, or do we want to \ncontinue to make sure that America is the creator, America is the \ninnovator, that it is Americans who take the discoveries and turn them \ninto products that can change our lives, especially in medical science?\n  I ask my colleagues to look at what we have gained in superiority in \ndefense because we have invested in space. Yet, at a time when we are \nat war, when we know we have used the satellites to the most effective \npoint they have ever been used for intelligence gathering, for the \nability to do intelligence gathering without harming Americans, without \nputting Americans in a plane because we can take from the satellites \nthe information so that the pilot is not in danger of being shot down \nbecause there is no pilot. We can gather intelligence, we can retain \nour superiority and technology and creativity, but it will take the \ninvestment. If we are going to pay for an emergency out of operating \nfunds, we are eating our seed corn.\n  Madam President, surely America and our Congress and this Senate \nunderstand that issue. The leadership of the appropriations and \nauthorizing committees, Senator Mikulski, Senator Shelby, myself, and \nSenator Bill Nelson of Florida, are the four chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the relevant committees. All of us have asked to meet with \nthe President to talk about this priority that we must continue \nexploration in space and determine how we would go forward in a \nbipartisan way to assure America's leadership in this important \nendeavor. I hope the President will support this amendment, will meet \nwith us to have a joint effort to do this amendment.\n  The President himself has already laid out the vision. He has said we \nare going to put people on the Moon again, we are going to establish a \nbase on the Moon, and from there we are going to go to Mars. The \nPresident has laid out the vision, but we must have the capability to \nfulfill the mission by having the scientific research that will keep us \nin the technological lead by continuing to make sure we are looking at \nall of the energy sources we can use, by creating the medical \ncapabilities that can only be done in the microgravity conditions.\n  I join with so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nasking that we adopt this amendment, that we get 60 votes, if that is \nwhat we need, to assure that this goes forward, not as another \nappropriation but as an investment to assure that America's leadership \ncontinues.\n  Madam President, I wrote a piece for the Hill, which is one of the \nlocal Capitol magazines. It goes into more detail about why this is so \nvery important.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Oct. 3, 2007]\n\n                    Maintain U.S. Supremacy in Space\n\n                     (By Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison)\n\n       On Oct. 4, 1957--almost 50 years ago to the date of this \n     publication--the Soviet Union launched the world-famous \n     Sputnik satellite, setting off alarm bells throughout \n     Washington that America was falling behind in space \n     technology. But America's ingenuity was dramatically \n     mobilized by President Eisenhower, who passed The National \n     Defense Education Act, which provided massive investments in \n     science, engineering, and technology. Those investments paid \n     off when we safely landed a man on the Moon, fulfilling \n     President Kennedy promise. The research program we created \n     spawned some of the most significant technologies of modern \n     life, including personal computers and the Internet.\n       Today, we are on the verge of another Sputnik moment. In \n     November, China will launch its first lunar orbiter--a major \n     milestone in its rapidly-developing space program. In fact, \n     China's progress has been so substantial they're planning on \n     landing a man on the moon by 2020. A decade or so from now, \n     the Red Flag may be flying on the lunar surface.\n       In this ominous environment, you would think Washington \n     would be trying to recharge America's commitment to space \n     exploration. In fact, the opposite is happening. Right now, \n     NASA is planning to retire the Space Shuttle in 2010. Until \n     its replacement is ready--not expected until 2015--the U.S. \n     will have no way to launch humans into space.\n       During this five-year time gap, we will have to rely on \n     Russia to get our own scientists and astronauts to the \n     International Space Station. As the world's leader in space \n     technology, it is simply unacceptable that we will be in this \n     position technological dependency. Our national security \n     depends on our ability to explore space without relying on \n     nations who may not always have our best interests at heart. \n     Thankfully, there is still time to prevent this frightful \n     scenario from becoming reality.\n       Congress should provide NASA with the added funds it needs \n     to narrow or close the gap in our human spaceflight \n     capability, by accelerating Ares and Orion--the shuttle \n     replacement vehicles--providing increased support to \n     potential commercial vehicles, and, if necessary, keeping the \n     space shuttle flying longer than 2010. This will ensure that \n     America stays in control of its space destiny.\n       Since NASA was created in 1958, the research that has gone \n     into the space program has also spurred innovations that have \n     greatly improved our lives--from car phones to heart \n     monitors, from ultrasound scanners to laser surgery. \n     Recently, NASA has been implementing my plan to use the U.S. \n     segment ofthe ISS as a ``National Laboratory,'' which means \n     that even more breakthroughs can be expected once that lab is \n     fully operational. On Sept. 12, NASA and the National \n     Institutes of Health signed the first of what should be \n     several inter-agency agreements to facilitate ISS research in \n     the future.\n       We want the U.S. to be the global leader in space research \n     because the unique environment of outer space enables \n     scientists to conduct many experiments not possible on Earth. \n     For example, NASA is considering placing a sophisticated \n     particle detector on the ISS to learn more about cosmic rays. \n     This research must be carried out in space where researchers \n     can collect data without the hindrance of Earth's dense \n     atmosphere\n\n[[Page S12726]]\n\n     and gravity. The results could lead to breakthroughs in our \n     fundamental understanding of matter, and possibly new sources \n     of energy.\n       There is a strong, symbiotic relationship between space \n     research and national security. For example, by using space-\n     based navigation systems, we can guide a missile to within \n     meters of its intended target. This not only allows our \n     military to more effectively hit a target, it also saves \n     civilian lives and limits collateral damage.\n       The Chinese are gaining ground in technological areas. For \n     example, China recently surpassed the U.S. as the world's \n     largest exporter of information-technology products (and the \n     U.S. has become a net importer of those products). The \n     Chinese are now turning their attention to space technology--\n     and they are determined to use it as a means of strengthening \n     their military. We cannot allow other countries to acquire \n     new weapons technologies while America does not keep up.\n       On the day before he was tragically assassinated, President \n     Kennedy remarked, ``This nation has tossed its cap over the \n     wall of space, and we have no choice but to follow it. \n     Whatever the difficulties, they will be overcome.''\n       As we mark the 50th anniversary of Sputnik, let's renew our \n     commitment to overcome those difficulties once again. We've \n     worked too hard, and accomplished too much, to willfully \n     forfeit our leadership in space. Let's make the necessary \n     adjustments to maintain our supremacy. Our future depends on \n     it.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nMikulski-Hutchison amendment that has bipartisan support of all of the \nfour members of the relevant committees' leadership. I hope together we \ncan take this step to assure America's leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I join with my colleagues, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Hutchison, and Senator Nelson from Florida, in asking \nall Senators to support this amendment.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have worked hard with the others to craft a \nbill that addresses the priority of our Members, but despite our \ngenerous allocation, the funding necessary for NASA to aggressively \npursue the President's ``Vision for Space Exploration'' cannot be \naccommodated without this amendment.\n  Since the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Columbia breaking up during \nreentry in February of 2003, NASA has spent $2.7 billion to make the \nshuttle program as safe as possible to ensure our Nation continues to \nbe the leader in space exploration. Unfortunately, as has been pointed \nout by Senator Mikulski and Senator Hutchison, the NASA budget requests \nhave not adequately restored the necessary resources in their \nsubsequent requests. Instead, the costs have been absorbed from within \nNASA.\n  Science funding has been cut significantly, and programs not directly \nassociated with the exploration vision are being deferred, delayed, or \ncanceled. By slowing down the cutting-edge science carried out by NASA, \nwe are mortgaging our future. The foundation for technological \nleadership and the successes of tomorrow are built on the investments \nthat we make in NASA today.\n  NASA's research in cutting edge technological advancements have \ndriven science and innovation in this country since the dawn of the \nspace age. We are shortcoming our future by not fully funding science \ninnovation and space exploration. This critical knowledge will be \nneeded in the years to come to make human exploration of the Moon and \nother planets a reality. These effects cannot be ignored any longer if \nwe are to maintain our leadership and our presence in space.\n  With the burden of correcting the dramatic Presidential budget cuts \nin critical justice programs and in NOAA, it is increasingly difficult \nfor the committee to find the resources necessary to keep NASA on the \nright track. In order to balance the lack of support for NASA's science \nand aeronautics programs in the budget requests, there are few options \nleft to consider.\n  The adoption of this amendment, offered by Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Hutchison, will not only respond to the pressing needs brought \nabout by a tragic accident, but will also send a clear signal that \nCongress is serious about ensuring that the U.S. retains its leadership \nposition in space exploration. I would urge all my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment. It is sorely and direly needed now.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, Senator Nelson will be coming out to \nspeak shortly, an astronaut Senator who will speak eloquently about \nthis. We also hope, for those who would like to challenge our thinking, \nthat they will use this as a time to come to the floor so that we can \nhave an ongoing and continuous debate. We would certainly like to vote \non this within the hour, in the interest of moving our bill forward. So \nwe would ask our colleagues to come and speak.\n  Before I yield the floor, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Boxer be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we are observing the 50th \nanniversary of the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite \nthat was launched by humans. In that time, 50 years ago, it shocked the \nentire world that the Soviet Union had become sufficiently \ntechnologically proficient that they could suddenly seize the high \nground--a high ground that heretofore had not been achieved but that \nmankind had always longed for--to soar into the heavens.\n  As a result of that significant technological achievement, the United \nStates got shocked out of its lethargy, out of its willingness to just \ngo along with the thinking that we were that good, but in fact we were \nfalling behind. As Senator Shelby said, we suddenly became shocked at \nthe fact that we were falling behind in math, in science and \ntechnology, and that, lo and behold, with the symbolic value of the \nSoviet Union--at that point our mortal enemy in the Cold War--having \nachieved that first.\n  Finally, we got Explorer into space, the first American satellite, \nand we started to take comfort that this Yankee ingenuity of America \nwould suddenly screw up its determination to achieve and that we would \nnot be passed by. And then, lo and behold, as we are preparing Alan \nShepard to go into space--not into orbital space, really, but only into \nsuborbit--suddenly the Soviets surprised us again and they sent Yuri \nGagarin into one orbit to achieve what no earthbound nation had done.\n  I remember years ago, Madam President, as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives--and I had already flown on the space shuttle--as I was \nsitting on the floor of the House, the then-Speaker of the House, Tip \nO'Neill, beckoned me over.\n  He said: Billy, I want to tell you a story. He said: When I was a \nyoung Boston Congressman, I remember I was down at the White House--\nPresident Kennedy was the President--and I had never seen the President \nso nervous. He was just pacing back and forth like a cat on a hot tin \nroof. He said: I leaned over to one of his aides, and I asked what in \nthe world is wrong with the President?\n  What was happening was we were getting ready to launch Alan Shepard \non the Redstone rocket, which only had enough lift power to go into \nsuborbit. Here we were, 3 weeks behind the Soviet Union, which had just \nput up Gagarin into one complete orbit. And, of course, we know what \nhappened. Alan Shepard made that first suborbital flight successfully.\n  We didn't even have a rocket at that point that would get us into \norbit with that mercury capsule. We flew a second time in suborbit with \nGus Grissom. In the meantime, the Soviets now send another cosmonaut, \nTiteuf, and he goes into several orbits, and here we are struggling to \nget up for the first time in orbit. Well, they said, we are going with \nthat Atlas rocket, which was an intercontinental ballistic missile. And \nso there, among those first seven astronauts, they chose John Glenn. We \nknew\n\n[[Page S12727]]\n\nthat we had a 20-percent chance that rocket was going to fail.\n  It is hard for me even to tell this story without getting a lump in \nmy throat, but John Glenn is in orbit for three orbits when there is an \nindication that his heat shield is loose, which would mean, upon \nreentry, that John Glenn and the capsule would burn up. And on that de-\norbit burn, as he is starting to plunge back into the fiery reentry of \nEarth's atmosphere, before we lost radio contact, John Glenn was heard \nhumming the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic.''\n\n  Of course, his flight was successful, and we continued on. But \nbecause that President said we were going to go to the Moon and return \nwithin the decade, and because the Nation put its mind to it and put \nthe resources to it, we achieved what was almost unbelievable--sending \n12 Americans to the Moon and returning them safely, including the crew \nof Apollo 11, which was one of the greatest rescue ventures ever in all \nof mankind, with Jim Lovell and his crew, when they lost all of their \npower en route to the Moon on that crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft.\n  They shut down the Apollo Program in the early 1970s, with massive \nlayoffs, and it was a long time from that last flight in 1972 to the \nMoon and a follow-on 1975 flight linking a Soviet Soyuz with an \nAmerican Apollo. And for days, in the midst of the Cold War, two mortal \nenemies, two cosmonauts and three Americans, were docked together in \nspace, lived and worked and enjoyed each other and communicated to the \nworld as peaceful partners. Because of the disruptions in the space \nfamily, it was not until 1981 that we got back into space, with humans, \nin the space shuttle.\n  Now, there is a lesson in what I have just discussed about our \nhistory in space that would teach us not to repeat that now. What is \nthat lesson? First of all, one of the great lessons of that era is the \nfact that we got excited about science and technology and mathematics \nand engineering and space flight. We produced a generation of \nexceptionally talented and educated young people who were told to go to \ntheir limit. As a result, we had, in a space program that had to have \nlimited volume, light in weight, and highly reliable systems, a \ntechnological revolution of micro-miniaturization that had come \ndirectly out of the space flight. This watch is a direct spinoff of the \nspace program. So many of the modern medical miracles and medical \ntechniques are a direct spinoff of the American space program.\n  In fact, one example in our daily lives is the communications we take \nfor granted. We can go anywhere on Earth and know precisely where we \nare by the global positioning system, GPS, which is now in our cars, \nand we can have a hand-held unit and go out on a boat, and if we get \nlost or stranded, with no motor in the ocean, the Coast Guard knows \nexactly where to come because we have a GPS to tell us exactly where we \nare. So, too, spinoff after spinoff: enhancement of our Nation's \neconomy; the educated workforce. About that workforce, need I remind \nyou now that China is graduating five times the number of engineers \nthat the United States is and India is graduating three times the \nnumber of engineers?\n\n  I want to return to that era, where we can get young people excited \nagain about science and technology, and there is nothing like the space \nprogram that will rivet and ignite those little imaginations.\n  Right now we are at a critical point because NASA has been starved of \nfunds. That is part of the reason why Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby have brought this amendment to the floor. It is not like the \nloss of Challenger over two decades ago, when emergency funds funded \nthe recovery to flight, the investigation, the designing of new \nsystems, the repair of old systems that got us into safe flight again--\nnot this time. NASA had to pay for this out of its operating \nexpenditures, to the point of $2.8 billion. It was already a tight \nbudget to begin with, not helped by the inability of us last year in \nthe Congress to meet agreements, and we had to operate under an \nappropriation called a continuing resolution, that left us at last \nyear's funding levels--not the increase.\n  As a result, what we have is that NASA is desperately short of funds, \nto the point that when it shuts down the space shuttle in October of \n2010, with the paucity of funds, the next vehicle, called the \nConstellation System, with a capsule called Orion and a rocket called \nAires, will not be able to fly with humans until after a 5-year gap.\n  That is not good for our educational system. It is not good for our \ntechnological prowess and achievements.\n  The amendment of Senator Mikulski will help correct it; not with the \n$2.8 billion NASA lost but only a third of that, that we are asking \nthat this Senate will appropriate out of emergency funds.\n  There is not a young person in America who does not get excited about \nspace flight. There is not an old person in America whose heart does \nnot quicken when they think of the daring adventures and the \nexploration. There is not a scholar or academic who does not appreciate \nwhat manned and unmanned space flight has done by putting up the \nHubbell Space Telescope, which has opened up the vistas into the \nbeginnings of the universe and understanding where we came from and how \nall of it came about and what is the order in the universe. Yet we only \nknow 4 percent of all that we can know about the universe. We still \nhave 96 percent, still to learn.\n  That is what our space program can do for us. It can ignite the \nimaginations and the desire to achieve in those young people. It can \nquicken the hearts of all Americans. It can lead to great new \ntechnological achievements that will spin out and affect our daily \nlives. It will open the new areas of knowledge about what we are as a \npeople who populate a planet called Planet Earth in a solar system that \nrevolves about one star that we call Sun, in a galaxy that is ours in a \nuniverse that is so large our human minds cannot even contemplate it.\n  These are the worlds we want to explore. It is our nature, it is our \ncharacter as Americans that we are, by that nature and that character, \nexplorers and adventurers. At the beginning of this country, we had a \nfrontier and it was westward. The great leaders of our country at the \nfounding of the country said: Go and explore. Today those frontiers are \ndifferent. Those frontiers are upward and those frontiers are inward. \nThe great leaders of today ought to be saying: Go forth and explore.\n  I am hoping the great leaders in this body called the Senate will \nsupport Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby in approving this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nMikulski amendment and to echo the comments of my good friend and \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Nelson. The Senator and I both have had \nthe great privilege, not only of representing the great State of \nFlorida but also both of us grew up within a short car ride from where \nall this excitement was happening, as we were young people growing up. \nCape Canaveral, the excitement of flights to space, the heroics of our \nearly astronauts and then later the flights to the Moon and the touch \nof the tragic that, from time to time, have been a part of any \ndangerous endeavor, have been a part of our daily lives. Of course, my \nsenior Senator from Florida took it a step further. He himself donned \nthe suit and went into space on the space shuttle on what was, I know, \na life-changing event for him.\n  I know the excitement with which he speaks of the space program is \nnot something I can speak about firsthand as he does, because he has \nbeen a part of it, but I can certainly speak to it as a person who has \nseen the benefits of it to our communities, through research, through \nimprovements to so many things that have been derivative from our space \nprogram.\n  As we go to the Kennedy Space Center these days and we talk to these \ngreat scientists, these great engineers, these people who are so \nenthusiastic, who are so competent in what they do, they speak with \ngreat commitment to completing the space shuttle flights that are \npending. They speak with great commitment about our space lab and the \ngreat advancements in science and technology that are taking place in \nthe space lab--now a new component in biomedical research that will \nhopefully be opening the doors to the cure\n\n[[Page S12728]]\n\nof many illnesses. All of these things have been a part of our space \nflight, of our tradition, and our history.\n\n  The 5-year gap Senator Nelson spoke of, where we will have no manned \nspace flight, is something I do not think most Americans understand. As \nit is right now, because of shorting the space program year after year, \nwhat we have is a situation in which there will be a 5-year gap from \nthe last space shuttle flight until the next vehicle is ready for \nmanned flight.\n  I think, as the American people would know about this, it would raise \nconcerns for them in the area of science and technology, of \nadvancement, of exploration, which has been such a part of our country \nwhere we have led the world without a doubt.\n  But there is something else about it which troubles me greatly and \nwhich I think the American people also ought to be made aware of, which \nis the fact that in order for an American to fly into space for those 5 \nyears, we would be completely and totally at the mercy of Russia. We \nhave had a very good and cooperative relationship. The Americans and \nRussians and, frankly, many other citizens of other countries, have \nbeen a part of the space shuttle and more particularly of the space \nlab. We have modules there--obviously the space shuttle arm from \nCanada, modules that have come from Japan and from Italy and many other \ncountries. Each of those countries with great pride has had one of \ntheir crew members go on the space shuttle and go to the space lab. Our \ncooperation with the Russians has been fantastic, even back to the days \nof the Soviet Union.\n  But in an ever-changing world, should not we wonder if it is safe for \nAmerica to totally be reliant upon an increasingly undemocratic Russia \nfor our space flights? I do not necessarily want to create enemies \nwhere none exist. But it does concern me to see these Russian bombers \ncoming into areas where they know very well are our waters, our \nairspace, and repeatedly now over the last month or so coming into what \nis U.S. airspace and challenging us to intercept them. Why are they \ndoing that? What is the purpose behind that? What could happen over the \nnext 3 years as we conclude the space shuttle, and then the next 5 \nwhere we are without the ability to put a man in space, if our \nrelationship with Russia is not as strong as it is today in 8 years, 5 \nyears, 6 years? It certainly isn't as positive and strong as it was 3 \nyears ago.\n  It behooves us, for the sake of our independence, our sovereignty, \nour ability to be in control and the destiny of this magnificent \nlaboratory up in space, that we could accelerate the time where this \ngap was going to exist. It is going to be there no matter what we do, \nbut we can shorten it. I believe if we shorten it by a couple of years, \nthat would be in our best interests.\n  When we look at the totality of our expenditures, when we look at the \ncost-benefit ratio of what we get from our space program, how it \ninspires our young people at a time when we are falling behind in \ncompetition with the world in science and technology, when we know the \nworld is moving faster than we are as it relates to the education of \nour young people and science and technology, what could be better than \na vibrant space program to continue to imbue our young people with the \ndesire to explore, the desire to invent, the desire for all he things \nthat the space program has been to our country?\n  Our technological edge was never finer honed than when we had a \nvibrant and strong space program in the late 1950s and on into the \n1960s. That was our finest and best time when it comes to science and \ntechnology.\n  We have, in many ways, been living off that for the last 25 years. \nNow we can have the dawning of a new age of space exploration into \nareas that have so far eluded us completely--well beyond the moon. This \ncan all happen. This is a small downpayment into a very important part \nof America's future. It is certainly a very strong and important issue \nas we look also at very practical issues like our workforce.\n  The workforce at Kennedy Space Center is a well-trained workforce. It \nis a workforce that has, over the years, developed and over the years \nimproved its skills. If we were to tell these people over the next 5 \nyears there is no work for you, they will go into other pursuits. These \nare sharp, talented people. It is not like they are going to be unable \nto get a job, but it is going to be our loss when those people are not \nengaged in the continuation of the U.S. space flights.\n  NASA is a good investment for America. We are not talking about \nbreaking the bank. We are talking about a very small investment for \nwhat I believe would be a great return. I am very pleased to join with \nmy colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, who is my expert when it \ncomes to these issues. We both have great affection for the Cape. He \ngrew up a very few miles south of it. I grew up a very few miles to the \nwest of it. This is our backyard. We know it, we love it, and we know \nwhat it has meant to our country. We know the future of it can be very \nbright and we certainly do support this effort to improve funding for \nNASA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment have \nhad a very thorough discussion of why we support this amendment. We \nhave spoken for about an hour. We certainly want to be sure that those \nwho might have pause or flashing yellow lights about it bring their \nconcerns to the floor so we can engage in a discussion, maybe even a \ndebate, so we could move this debate forward and dispose of the \namendment no later than 4:00 and earlier if possible.\n  I want to give everyone warning, if there is nobody here, we will \nmove the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12728-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12728-S12737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BAN ASBESTOS IN AMERICA ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 321, S. 742, the Ban \nAsbestos in America Act of 2007; that the amendment at the desk be \nconsidered and agreed to, the committee-reported substitute amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the title \namendment be agreed to and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill to amend the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act to reduce the health risks posed by asbestos-\ncontaining products, and for other purposes, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Environment and Public Works, with an amendment \nto strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the \nfollowing:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ban Asbestos in America Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance; and\n       (B) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has \n     classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;\n       (2) many people in the United States incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (3) the United States Geological Survey reported that, in \n     2006, the United States used 2,000 metric tons of asbestos, \n     of which approximately--\n       (A) 55 percent was used in roofing products;\n       (B) 26 percent was used in coatings; and\n       (C) 19 percent was used in other products, such as friction \n     products;\n       (4) the Department of Commerce estimates that the United \n     States imports more than $100,000,000 of brake parts per \n     year;\n       (5) available evidence suggests that--\n       (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products \n     are increasing; and\n       (B) some of those products are imported from foreign \n     countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;\n       (6) there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos;\n       (7) even low levels of exposure to asbestos may cause \n     asbestos-related diseases, including mesothelioma;\n       (8) millions of workers in the United States have been, and \n     continue to be, exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos;\n\n[[Page S12729]]\n\n       (9) worker deaths from noncancerous lung disease can occur \n     at levels of exposure to asbestos below the levels allowed by \n     the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) families of workers are put at risk because of \n     asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, \n     skin, and hair of the workers;\n       (11) approximately \\1/3\\ of mesothelioma victims were \n     exposed to asbestos while serving the United States on Navy \n     ships or shipyards;\n       (12) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress \n     in 2006 that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, \n     diagnose, and treat;\n       (13) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many \n     as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from \n     mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n       (14)(A) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional \n     chemotherapy; and\n       (B) although new combination treatments for mesothelioma \n     have demonstrated some benefits--\n       (i) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 \n     year after diagnosis of the disease; and\n       (ii) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 \n     years of diagnosis of the disease;\n       (15) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the \n     example of asbestos was used to justify the need for \n     comprehensive legislation on toxic substances;\n       (16) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);\n       (17) in 1989, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency promulgated final regulations under title \n     II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et \n     seq.) to phase out asbestos in consumer products by 1997;\n       (18) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     5th Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the \n     Federal Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme \n     Court;\n       (19) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were \n     banned, asbestos is still being imported and used, and is \n     otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and \n     industrial products in the United States;\n       (20) the National Cancer Institute recognizes a clear need \n     for new agents to improve the outlook for patients with \n     mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n       (21) the National Institutes of Health should continue to \n     improve detection, treatment, and management of asbestos-\n     related diseases, such as mesothelioma, including by \n     providing continued support for the pleural mesothelioma \n     treatment and research program and peritoneal surgical \n     initiatives;\n       (22) the Department of Defense should study diseases \n     related to asbestos exposure in the military and veteran \n     population, including by conducting research in coordination \n     with the National Institutes of Health on the early detection \n     and treatment of mesothelioma;\n       (23) with some exceptions relating to certain uses, \n     asbestos has been banned in 40 countries, including \n     Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the \n     Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, \n     Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the \n     Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, the \n     Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       (24) asbestos was banned throughout the European Union in \n     2005;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ban Asbestos in America Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance; and\n       (B) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has \n     classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;\n       (2) many people in the United States incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (3) the United States Geological Survey reported that, in \n     2006, the United States used 2,000 metric tons of asbestos, \n     of which approximately--\n       (A) 55 percent was used in roofing products;\n       (B) 26 percent was used in coatings; and\n       (C) 19 percent was used in other products, such as friction \n     products;\n       (4) the Department of Commerce estimates that the United \n     States imports more than $100,000,000 of brake parts per \n     year;\n       (5) available evidence suggests that--\n       (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products \n     are increasing; and\n       (B) some of those products are imported from foreign \n     countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;\n       (6) families of workers are put at risk because of asbestos \n     brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and \n     hair of the workers;\n\n[[Page S12732]]\n\n       (7) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress \n     in 2006 that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, \n     diagnose, and treat;\n       (8) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many \n     as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from \n     mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n       (9)(A) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional \n     chemotherapy; and\n       (B) although new combination treatments for mesothelioma \n     have demonstrated some benefits--\n       (i) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 \n     year after diagnosis of the disease; and\n       (ii) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 \n     years of diagnosis of the disease;\n       (10) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the \n     example of asbestos was used to justify the need for \n     comprehensive legislation on toxic substances;\n       (11) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);\n       (12) in 1989, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency promulgated final regulations under title \n     II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et \n     seq.) to phase out asbestos in consumer products by 1997;\n       (13) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     5th Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the \n     Federal Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme \n     Court;\n       (14) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were \n     banned, asbestos is still being imported and used, and is \n     otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and \n     industrial products in the United States;\n       (15) the National Cancer Institute recognizes a clear need \n     for new agents to improve the outlook for patients with \n     mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n       (16) the National Institutes of Health should continue to \n     improve detection, treatment, and management of asbestos-\n     related diseases, such as mesothelioma, including by \n     providing continued support for the pleural mesothelioma \n     treatment and research program and peritoneal surgical \n     initiatives;\n       (17) the Department of Defense should study diseases \n     related to asbestos exposure in the military and veteran \n     population, including by conducting research in coordination \n     with the National Institutes of Health on the early detection \n     and treatment of mesothelioma;\n       (18) with some exceptions relating to certain uses, \n     asbestos has been banned in 40 countries, including \n     Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the \n     Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, \n     Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the \n     Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, the \n     Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United \n     Kingdom;\n       (19) asbestos was banned throughout the European Union in \n     2005; and\n       (20) banning asbestos from being used in or imported into \n     the United States will provide certainty to manufacturers, \n     builders, environmental remediation firms, workers, and \n     consumers that after a specific date, asbestos will not be \n     used, added, or allowed to be knowingly present as a \n     contaminant in new construction and manufacturing materials \n     used in this country.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues in the \nSenate for taking a moment this afternoon to pass a very important \npiece of legislation. What the Senate did was pass the Ban Asbestos in \nAmerica Act of 2007. This is a piece of legislation I have been working \non now for almost 7 years.\n  When I heard about Americans and people who were dying from asbestos, \nI thought to myself, my gosh, I thought asbestos was banned many years \nago. How can this be?\n  Well, the fact is asbestos has never been banned. In fact, today \n2,500 metric tons of asbestos are being imported every year. It is in \nproducts such as hair dryers, ceiling tiles, it is in brake pads, and \nover 3,000 other products Americans are using and being exposed to \nevery day.\n  I began, with Senator Paul Wellstone, 6 years ago to try and pass \nthis legislation. Of course, I lost my friend Senator Wellstone in an \nairplane crash. I thought to myself: Wow, how am I ever going to get \nthis out of the Senate without his passion?\n  Well, I was very fortunate because I found another partner who was \njust as passionate, and he is here with us today, Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia, who took up this banner with me, who has worked this bill \nthrough every way possible, because he too looked in the eyes of those \nfamilies who were losing loved ones, members of their families today, \nbecause asbestos was exposing them to deadly diseases, and they were \ndying of mesothelioma.\n  I could not have done it without him. I thank him from the bottom of \nmy heart for working this bill through every nook and cranny, every \ndifficult challenge we have had, every difficult sentence.\n  For anybody out there who thinks legislation passes without anybody \nlooking at it, we can tell you that every ``T'' has been crossed, every \n``I''\n\n[[Page S12735]]\n\nhas been dotted, and this legislation, when it passes, is going to make \na real difference in the lives of Americans.\n  I thank Senator Boxer, the chair of the EPW Committee, who, when she \nheard us working on this bill 7 or 8 months ago now, said: Senator \nMurray, Senator Isakson, this bill is in my jurisdiction. I am going to \nwork with you to get it passed. She has worked every single day through \nall of the challenges we have had, to this moment now, and what a \nmoment it is.\n  When I began this battle, I began it with two men I met who were \ndying of mesothelioma as a result of being exposed to asbestos: Fred \nBiekkola and Brian Harvey. I told them I would stand with them every \nstep of the way until this bill was passed, sent to the President, and \nsigned into law.\n  I lost both Brian and Fred, because they died of mesothelioma. But I \nhave met many others along the way too. Today I stand here on the floor \nof the Senate and I tell everyone, when you believe in something, and \nyou work hard, and you find good people to work with you, you can make \na difference.\n  Because of the Freds and the Brians and the many other people I have \nmet, and my great colleagues on the floor of the Senate, today we are \nmaking a difference. We are well on our way to banning the use of \nasbestos.\n  It goes now to the House. We are working to make sure the House gets \nthis passed and to the President's desk. I can tell everyone in \nAmerica, when that bill is signed, we will no longer be exposed to the \nimportation and use of asbestos in this country. You can pick up your \nhair dryer, or know that the ceiling tiles you buy, or the brake pads \nthat are in your car, or the mechanic who is exposed to it accidentally \nwill no longer be exposed to it, and we will have made a major step \nforward in the health of all Americans.\n  I thank Senator Isakson, Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe, all of the \npeople who have worked with us. But as we all know, we are doing this \nbecause we want America to be a safer place. I thank everybody for this \nmajor step forward.\n  I yield to my colleague who has worked so hard with me on this.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today this body will pass comprehensive, \nbipartisan legislation to permanently ban the production, manufacture, \nand distribution of asbestos, a deadly carcinogen that is still legally \nused in the United States.\n  It was my honor and pleasure to work with Senator Murray on this \nlegislation. I have nothing but the highest regard for the Senior \nSenator from Washington State. The Senator and her staff have worked \ntirelessly on this issue for several years, and I am eager to continue \nto work with her to assure passage of this important legislation.\n  We also received invaluable cooperation and assistance from the Chair \nand Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe.\n  When inhaled, asbestos is known to cause diseases including \nmesothelioma, a cancer that occurs when malignant cells develop in the \nprotective lining around the lungs. Despite this hazard, the substance \nis not banned.\n  The EPA initially proposed a ban of most asbestos-containing \nmaterials in the late 1970s. The rule was not finalized until 1989. \nOnly 2 years later, however, the Fifth Circuit struck down the rule, \nfinding that the EPA had ``failed to muster substantial evidence'' in \nsupport of the ban.\n  Today, the U.S. consumes about 2,000 tons of asbestos yearly, down \nfrom almost 800,000 tons consumed in the mid-1970s. Our bill will \nestablish a permanent ban of asbestos that will be enforced by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  The bill also mandates the most thorough Government study of asbestos \nto date. The study will ensure the best experts from the National \nInstitute of Occupational Safety & Health, the National Academy of \nSciences and the EPA examine all aspects of asbestos, including its \nnatural properties, its geographic distribution across the United \nStates, and its effects on the human body.\n  The bill also calls for a national mesothelioma registry and a public \ninformation campaign about the hazards of asbestos-containing \nmaterials.\n  For the few areas where asbestos is still used in the United States, \nthis bill provides narrow exemptions or reasonable transitions to other \nalternatives.\n  This bill is the culmination of months of bipartisan work to find \ncommon ground on this issue. With a sweeping bill such as this one, \nmany issues were difficult to resolve.\n  One difficult issue to resolve involved the treatment of \nnonasbestiform minerals. These so-called ``cleavage fragments'' are \nminerals that appear naturally and more abundantly than asbestos, are \nin land and dirt and are mined all across Georgia and in significant \nareas of the Nation. They are similar to asbestos in chemical makeup \nbut differ significantly in structure and many other respects. The \nFederal Government has in the past through two decisions--one by OSHA, \n1992 rulemaking, and one by CPSC, 1988 decision--spoken to the lack of \nhealth risk from nonasbestiform minerals, and many published, peer-\nreviewed studies confirm those findings.\n  Our bill makes no presumption as to the health effects of \nnonasbestiform minerals but rather enlists the Nation's best scientists \nto study nonasbestiform minerals and elongated mineral particles, a \nterm that includes, but is not limited to, asbestos and other \nbiopersistent elongated mineral particles. It will be important in \nthese studies to both differentiate these minerals according to the \nasbestos-related health risks, and distinguish between these minerals \nas they are identified in the natural, mixed dust environment.\n\n  Asbestos, the path of its deadly health effects, the identification \nand differentiation of asbestos from other minerals especially in the \nnatural, mixed dust environment, are all complex areas of science and \nit is time for the Federal Government to pool its expertise scattered \namong a half-dozen agencies, to better understand the risks and how to \nproperly identify the fibers of risk.\n  Senator Murray is to be complimented for her skill in crafting a bill \nthat provides what we intend to be a level playing field that will \nproduce a better understanding of the why's and how's of life-\nthreatening exposure to asbestos, how to accurately identify and \nmeasure it in the natural and mixed dust environments, and how to \nseparate it from common everyday dirt and rocks critical to farming, \nhomebuilding, construction and our everyday society.\n  Our bill provides for research by Government agencies including the \nworld-renowned National Academy of Sciences, calling on their input \ninto their input into the Federal studies, to assure peer review and \nconsideration of the best science and studies available. It is \nessential that we bring the best science possible to bear on this most \nimportant issue.\n  Another difficult issue involved asbestos-based filters used in the \nproduction of chlorine. Our bill includes a reasonable compromise that \nprotects the safety of the workers at these facilities and empowers the \nEPA to review the installations to ensure that the filters pose no \nunreasonable risk to workers.\n  Lastly, I want to commend the hard work of our staff on this issue. \nSpecifically, Bill Kamela with Senator Murray, Mary Anne Dunlap with \nSenator Inhofe, Grant Cope with Senator Boxer, Ed Egee from my staff, \nand Colin Campbell with the Office of Legislative Counsel.\n  Banning asbestos is simply the right thing to do. This bill provides \nthe framework for how this country must go about achieving this goal. I \nplan to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see it to \nthe President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, for her kind remarks.\n  But I tell everyone in this Chamber and everyone who reads about this \nevent, without her championing this issue over the last 7 years, it \nwould not have happened. She has been a marvelous champion on behalf of \nthose who have suffered from asbestos-related diseases, in particular \nmesothelioma.\n  I have watched her encounter countless hurdles on what is a very \ncomplex issue and a very complex piece of legislation. She has done a \nmarvelous job. Her staff member Bill Kamela has been a tremendous help, \nas has my staff member Ed Egee. It would not have happened without the \ntwo of them.\n  As was mentioned by Senator Murray, Senator Boxer has been the real \nchampion and given us the platform, the framework, and the latitude in \nthe\n\n[[Page S12736]]\n\ncommittee to work this through this day.\n  When I entered the Congress in 1999, I had the privilege of meeting a \ngentleman by the name of Bruce Vento, a Congressman from the State of \nMinnesota. I only got to know Bruce for a short period of time, because \na couple of years later his life was taken by mesothelioma. That was my \nfirst experience with it. His wife Sue has been an advocate, in \ncountless appearances before the Congress, working toward a ban on \nasbestos. Today in Washington, Renee Hansen from my State of Georgia, \nWatkinsville, who suffers from mesothelioma, is here today by chance \nadvocating on behalf of those who suffer from that dreaded disease, and \nseeking the Congress of the United States to take the action this \nSenate has just taken.\n  This country started 37 years ago by banning asbestos. But through \ncourt cases, through regulatory rulings, the ban never took place. \nAlthough the use of it has been restricted, as was stated by Senator \nMurray, it is used in countless products. This bill puts an end to \nasbestos. In those narrow exceptions of national defense, the space \nprogram, and a chlorine filter in a contained filter system, those are \ngrandfathered, but with a system where they go out of business as \nreplacements that can substitute for them come in.\n  Instead of taking legislative descriptions, we took scientific \nevidence and declared scientific studies in the future to make the \ndeterminations to see to it that Americans are no longer exposed to \nlife-threatening fibers known as asbestos.\n  It has been a privilege for me to work on many things in my \nlegislative career, both back in Georgia and in the Congress, but I do \nnot know that I have ever had a more rewarding experience than looking \nin the eyes of those whose families and lives who have been touched by \nmesothelioma, and tell them the Congress today is going to do something \nabout banning asbestos and take the step that is long overdue.\n  I am very proud to have walked in that march with Senator Murray and \nwith Senator Boxer. I thank Senator Inhofe and his staff for their \ncooperation, who in the end made all of this possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before Senator Boxer speaks, I want to \nthank all of my staff who have been involved in this. I will insert \ntheir names in the Record. Bill, Crystal, Alex, in my press shop, Mike, \nPete, previous staff members have put in countless hours on this. \nWithout them we would never do this. I certainly know that working with \nSenator Isakson's staff and the staff from EPW and Senator Boxer's \nstaff. It takes a lot of people to get something done. A tremendous \namount of people have worked on this. I thank them. Because of their \nwork, we are going to ban asbestos, we are going to dramatically expand \nresearch and treatment, and we are going to launch a public education \ncampaign so all Americans understand how they can protect themselves \nfrom the deadly asbestos products that may be in their home.\n  With that, I thank our chairwoman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nallowing us these few minutes to mark a very, I think, emotional moment \nfor all of us and a very important moment for the health and the safety \nof the people of our Nation.\n  The work of Senator Murray, that of Senator Wellstone in the past, \nand that of Senator Isakson, cannot be overstated. Because when the \nbook is written on how a bill becomes a law, what you learn is that on \nsomething that has just a hint of controversy to it, you have to go \nthrough so many hurdles and so many late-night meetings and so many \nhours, and that is why the staffs deserve so much credit. In the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Bettina Poirier, Grant Cope, \nand Erik Olson are very important, and from the HELP Committee, Bill.\n  Let me say, many countries have banned asbestos. As Senator Murray \nsaid, if you would ask a person in the street: Is asbestos banned? They \nwould say, yes. But there was a court case many years ago which \noverturned that ban. So we have seen a tremendous amount of asbestos in \nthe workplace, in consumer products, and the like. We still have more \nwork to do. We have to get this through the House. We think there are \nfriends in the House, remembering the wonderful Congressman Vento whom \nSenator Isakson mentioned, in his memory.\n  Certainly we feel very good that the beloved Congressman will get \nthis honor after his death. We want to say, his wife has been an \nextraordinary person in pushing this through.\n  Today Senators Murray and Isakson got a standing ovation from the men \nand women who are suffering either from mesothelioma or their families \nwho were there representing them or some whose families are here, \nalthough their loved one has perished. In this press conference I read \na poem written by a beautiful woman, a Californian who lost her \nhusband, and her agony as she watched her husband literally disappear \nbefore her eyes. I met a woman today whose son died at age 33 from \nmesothelioma. They can't figure out exactly where the exposure came \nfrom. I saw his picture when he was 31, a vibrant, beautiful young man, \nhis emaciated face, still handsome a couple years later, and then he \nwas gone. This bill is so important, that we join the nations of the \nworld who have already banned asbestos and say, there are moments here \nyou feel proud of, you feel kind of proud of, you feel not so proud of. \nToday I am so proud of my colleagues. The day I learned I had \njurisdiction over this matter in committee was a joyful day for me, \nbecause I knew we could pull it off because we had Johnny Isakson on \nthe Republican side who would take the lead. We worked across party \nlines. And to Patty Murray, I would say: There is a snag, call Johnny. \nAnd they would talk.\n  So we are here this day. It is emotional. It is a wonderful moment. I \ncongratulate Senators Murray and Isakson. I am so proud I was in the \nright place at the right time to help them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. When I went to law school, I can only remember one woman in \nmy law school class. I went to George Washington. It was a large class. \nWomen didn't go to law school much in those days. A few years later, I \ntook the bar. It was a small group of men studying for the bar in \nNevada. There may have been a couple women, but that was it. When I \ncame to the Senate, Mikulski was the woman. She still is. Since that \ntime, we have had the good fortune of having a significant number of \nwomen elected to the Senate. Fortunately, most of them are on this side \nof the aisle. The Senate is a much better place because of women being \nhere. The legal profession is a better profession now because of women \nbeing in it. Because as much as we joke about it, men and women are \ndifferent. They think differently. I can testify to that as a result of \nhaving served in the Senate with a meager number of women and now with \na significant number. The Senate would only be better if there were \nmore women.\n  I extend my appreciation to Patty Murray, a woman of great stature, \nsomebody who has persevered on an issue that when she started it, she \nwas alone. She stood up during our battles we had here in recent years \non asbestos liability, with her eyes pointed toward one thing this \ncountry should do, and that is not allow the importation of asbestos. \nThat now has happened.\n  Barbara Boxer, a kind, thoughtful person she is, with a heart as big \nas anybody's heart in the Senate. I knew from the very beginning this \nwas something she wanted to do as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. It has been done.\n  Johnny Isakson is a conservative Republican from the State of \nGeorgia. But he is a person who is mindful of the need to work together \nand get things done. I so admire his ability to work across party \nlines. As tenacious and hard working as these two women I have \nmentioned are, it couldn't have been done without Senator Isakson. This \nis a very important day.\n  I can remember so clearly Bruce Vento. Two examples, then I won't \ntake any more time of Chairman Mikulski. I was a brand new House \nmember, walking across Independence Avenue. He said: You should have a \nnational park in Nevada. Because of him,\n\n[[Page S12737]]\n\nwe got a national park in Nevada. The Great Basin National Park is in \nNevada. Bruce Vento pointed me in the right direction and that is what \nwe did. The most significant legislation I have ever offered has been \nsomething in Nevada we call a negotiated settlement which involved two \nendangered species, two Indian tribes, 100-year water war between the \nStates of California and Nevada. Wetlands had dried up from 100,000 \nacres to probably 1,000 putrid areas. It involved irrigation districts, \nthe cities of Reno and Sparks.\n  Bruce Vento was on the floor in 1993, and by unanimous consent in the \nHouse worked his magic. It was late in the session, and it was the next \nto the last thing that passed that session. As happens over there late \nat night when they are trying to get things done, there was a lot of \nconfusion going on, but he got it done.\n  This is a wonderful day for the American people. We will get this \nthrough the House and this will be signed by the President. I feel so \nhappy that this is done for so many different reasons.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her efforts to \nend the use of asbestos in the United States. America should join the \nmore than 40 other countries that have banned its use. This is an issue \nwhere the devastating health effects of asbestos far outweigh the \neconomic benefits of its continued widespread use. It is surprising to \nme that there is any significant debate in light of what we know about \nthe deadliness of this substance, and the tremendous suffering of so \nmany Americans.\n  Nearly 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-related disease. \nAsbestos is among the most lethal substances ever to be widely used in \nthe workplace. Between 1940 and 1980, more than 27.5 million workers \nwere exposed to asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million of them had \nhigh levels of exposure over long periods of time. We even know of \nfamily members who have suffered asbestos-related disease from washing \nthe clothes of loved ones. The ravages of disease caused by asbestos \nhave affected tens of thousands of American families. Given what we \nknow about asbestos, we should not permit the immense suffering its use \nhas caused to continue any longer.\n  Senator Murray's bill is a step in the right direction toward a more \ncomprehensive solution to this problem. I am glad this bill contains \nprovisions for increased research and education concerning asbestos. \nPreventing future exposure is a good thing, but we must do more to \naddress the terrible suffering that continues in the United States and \nwe owe it to those who have been affected to enact an effective system \nfor their care and compensation.\n  Although I would have preferred to have retained the more extensive \nprovisions contained in the comprehensive bipartisan bill then-\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Specter and I proposed in the 109th \nCongress, I believe that if enacted, this legislation will save many \nlives in the future. We owe it to all Americans to do everything we can \nto end the use of asbestos and to confront the terrible legacy this \ndeadly substance has left behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before my three colleagues who have accomplished this \nsignificant feat leave the floor, I, too, wish to salute them. Dear \ncolleagues, what an emotional day. First, our good friend Senator \nWellstone embarked on that with you, Senator Murray, many years ago. \nPaul is no longer with us. His legacy lives on. There is a saying I \nlearned in Catholic girls school: exegi aani perrenius. I will build a \nmonument in lasting bronze. And when one thinks about a monument to \nPaul Wellstone, the kind of wise guy he was, he wouldn't be a marble \nguy or want some bronze statue. He would want this as a memorial that \nothers might live. As a Senator from Maryland, my State is a \nmanufacturing State. In my shipyards, there was so much asbestos. To \nthis day, the shipyard workers of Baltimore and Fairfield, Bethlehem \nSteel, people who built the liberty ships, the ones who helped win the \nbattle of the North Atlantic, the ones who every day would go to work \nwith their lunch pail, now go to the senior citizen meetings carrying \nan oxygen tank, and not only have they suffered but their spouses \nsuffer. Most of the guys in those days would come home and they would \nwash their clothes and take care of them. The women were exposed to \nthis as well. It is not only secondhand smoke, but it was secondhand \nasbestos.\n  For me today to know that when we talked about better things through \nchemistry, the answer was yes, but what we did without realizing it was \nsubject our American citizens to such unbelievable pain. So for the \nguys at the shipyards, we say to Murray, to Boxer, and to Isakson: \nAnchors aweigh, my boys and girls, anchors aweigh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and our floor staff \non both sides of the aisle who helped us. They know that Senator \nIsakson and I dogged them every single day, every single minute of the \nway until we got this done. Without their help we couldn't be here \neither. I will end by saying I have looked in the eyes of too many \npeople who have lost a loved one to a product that contained asbestos \nbecause they went to work and didn't know they were being exposed. To \nall of those people who have stuck with us and worked with us and \nfought with us--some of them are here in the Senate with us today--we \nwouldn't be here without you and your passion. Because of that, we are \nchanging the world to a better place.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12737-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12737-S12753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE AND JUSTICE AND SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me tell you where we are right now, because the \npending amendment is the Mikulski-Hutchison-Shelby-Nelson, et al. \namendment on expanding funding for NASA. We also understand the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, intends to come over rather shortly to offer \nhis amendment. We have had a lot of talk, a little bit in morning \nbusiness, but we are making great progress. We invite all who might \neither want to speak on our amendment or in opposition to the NASA \namendment, please come to the floor now because we will be moving \ntoward a vote. We are also waiting for the Senator from Oklahoma to \ncome.\n  I know a lot of time has been used with morning business, but at the \nsame time we are making a great deal of progress behind the scenes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a few minutes \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Free Trade\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me congratulate Senator Murray, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Isakson for their very important work on this asbestos issue.\n  What I wish to focus on is a front-page story that appeared in the \nWall Street Journal. The headline reads: ``Republicans Grow Skeptical \non Free Trade.'' What it says is:\n\n       The new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll posed two statements \n     to voters. The first was, ``Foreign trade has been good for \n     the U.S. economy because demand for U.S. products abroad has \n     resulted in economic growth and jobs for Americans here at \n     home and provided more choices for consumers.''\n       The second statement was, ``Foreign trade has been bad for \n     the U.S. economy because imports from abroad have reduced \n     demand for American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and \n     produced potentially unsafe products.''\n       Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59 \n     percent of Republicans named the second statement, while 32 \n     percent pointed to the first.\n\n  Back to the headline, ``Republicans Grow Skeptical On Free Trade.'' \nThat is the Republicans.\n  In terms of the Democrats, earlier in the article:\n\n       Other leading Democrats have been harshly critical of trade \n     expansion, pleasing their party's labor union backers. In a \n     March 2007 WSJ/NBC poll, before recent scandals involving \n     tainted imports, 54 percent of Democratic voters said free-\n     trade agreements have hurt the U.S., compared with 21 percent \n     who said they have helped.\n\n  So what do we have? We have the overwhelming percentage of \nRepublicans who are now telling us that unfettered free trade is not \nworking for American workers.\n\n[[Page S12738]]\n\n  We have the overwhelming percentage of Democratic supporters telling \nus free trade has not been working for the American people. Yet despite \nthose numbers, and a growing consensus among working families in this \ncountry, what we continue to see is people in the White House, people \nin the Senate and the House who keep telling us how great free trade \nis.\n  Well, let me be very clear. Free trade is very good for the large \nmultinational corporations who can throw American workers out on the \nstreet, move abroad to China and other low-wage countries, hire people \nthere for pennies an hour, and bring their products back into this \ncountry. For those people, we concede--for the CEOs of large \ncorporations--unfettered free trade has been a very good thing. But for \nthe middle-class and working families of this country, for working \nfamilies and poor people in Mexico and in other low-wage countries, \nunfettered free trade has been an unmitigated disaster.\n  Now, there are a lot of reasons the middle class in America is \nshrinking. There are a lot of reasons nearly 5 million Americans have \nslipped into poverty since George Bush has become President. There are \na number of reasons. Certainly, one of the processes by which we as a \nNation are engaged in a race to the bottom has been the unfettered \nfree-trade agreements negotiated by the President of the United States \nand passed by the Congress. And by that I mean NAFTA. I mean permanent \nnormal trade relations with China.\n  The reality of those trade agreements, plus other economic decisions \nbeing made by the U.S. Government, is not just that poverty is \nincreasing, it is that median income for working-age families has \ndeclined by about $2,400 since the year 2000. It is that personal \nsavings rates in this country are below zero, and have been below zero \nfor eight consecutive quarters--something that has not happened since \nthe Great Depression.\n  Unfettered free trade has a lot to do with the fact that over 8 \nmillion Americans have lost their health insurance since 2000, and we \nare now up to 47 million Americans without any health insurance.\n  Hunger in America is growing. The cost of college education is \nbecoming harder and harder for middle-class families to afford. It is \ninteresting to note that a few months ago, in a poll done by, again, \nthe Wall Street Journal, more than two-thirds of the American people \nbelieve the U.S. economy is either in a recession now or will be in a \nrecession next year. That is a poll from August done by Wall Street \nJournal/NBC News.\n  In my view, it is imperative that our country trade. Nobody I know of \nbelieves we should place a wall around this country. Trade is a good \nthing. But what we must begin doing is negotiating fair trade \nagreements that reflect the interests of working families in America, \nworking families in other countries, and not just large multinational \ncorporations and the CEOs who help write these trade agreements.\n  I just returned the weekend before last from a trip to Costa Rica, \nwhere I witnessed something that was really quite extraordinary. Costa \nRica will be the first country in the entire world to actually have a \nreferendum to vote up or down whether they want to enter these CAFTA \nagreements. I have no idea who is going to win that referendum. It \nlooks as if it is going to be very close.\n  But on one side you have all of the moneyed interests. What I heard \nis, the ``yeses,'' the people who want that free-trade agreement, \nCAFTA, are spending 100 times more than the people who are in \nopposition. You have a media which is almost universally supportive in \nCosta Rica of this CAFTA agreement.\n  On the other side you have students, you have environmentalists, you \nhave trade unionists, you have environmentalists, you have an \nextraordinary grassroots movement such that in a nation of fewer than 4 \nmillion people, a week ago, 150,000 people came out in a rally--150,000 \nin a nation of less than 4 million people--to express their opposition \nto the CAFTA agreement.\n  We have--especially with the fact that fast track is no longer in \nexistence--the opportunity as a Congress to begin rethinking our trade \npolicies, to create trade policies which create good jobs in the United \nStates and good jobs in the countries of our trading partners, policies \nwhich benefit all of the people and not just the people on top.\n  So I conclude by saying, if some of my Republican friends think it is \njust progressives or people who are concerned about the needs of \nworking people on this side who are concerned about trade, I suggest \nyou go to the Wall Street Journal today, and what you will find is the \nvast majority of Republicans now have serious concerns about our \ncurrent trade policies because they see those trade policies as being \nharmful to the middle class and working families of this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the poll from the Wall \nStreet Journal be printed in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 4, 2007]\n\n                Republicans Grow Skeptical on Free Trade\n\n                           (By John Harwood)\n\n       Washington.--By a nearly two-to-one margin, Republican \n     voters believe free trade is bad for the U.S. economy, a \n     shift in opinion that mirrors Democratic views and suggests \n     trade deals could face high hurdles under a new president.\n       The sign of broadening resistance to globalization came in \n     a new Wall Street Journal-NBC News Poll that showed a fraying \n     of Republican Party orthodoxy on the economy. While 60% of \n     respondents said they want the next president and Congress to \n     continue cutting taxes, 32% said it's time for some tax \n     increases on the wealthiest Americans to reduce the budget \n     deficit and pay for health care.\n       Six in 10 Republicans in the poll agreed with a statement \n     that free trade has been bad for the U.S. and said they would \n     agree with a Republican candidate who favored tougher \n     regulations to limit foreign imports. That represents a \n     challenge for Republican candidates who generally echo Mr. \n     Bush's calls for continued trade expansion, and reflects a \n     substantial shift in sentiment from eight years ago.\n       ``It's a lot harder to sell the free-trade message to \n     Republicans,'' said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who \n     conducts the Journal/NBC poll with Democratic counterpart \n     Peter Hart. The poll comes ahead of the Oct. 9 Republican \n     presidential debate in Michigan sponsored by the Journal and \n     the CNBC and MSNBC television networks.\n       The leading Republican candidates are still trying to \n     promote free trade. ``Our philosophy has to be not how many \n     protectionist measures can we put in place, but how do we \n     invent new things to sell'' abroad, former New York City \n     Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in a recent interview. ``That's the \n     view of the future. What [protectionists] are trying to do is \n     lock in the inadequacies of the past.''\n       Such a stance is sure to face a challenge in the 2008 \n     general election. Though President Bill Clinton famously \n     steered the Democratic Party toward a less-protectionist bent \n     and promoted the North American Free Trade Agreement, his \n     wife and the current Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton, has adopted more skeptical rhetoric. Mrs. Clinton \n     has come out against a U.S. trade deal with South Korea.\n       Other leading Democrats have been harshly critical of trade \n     expansion, pleasing their party's labor union backers. In a \n     March 2007 WSJ/NBC poll, before recent scandals involving \n     tainted imports, 54% of Democratic voters said free-trade \n     agreements have hurt the U.S., compared with 21% who said \n     they have helped.\n       While rank-and-file Democrats have long blasted the impact \n     of trade on American jobs, slipping support among Republicans \n     represents a fresh warning sign for freemarket conservatives \n     and American companies such as manufacturers and financial \n     firms that benefit from markets opening abroad.\n       With voters provoked for years by such figures as Pat \n     Buchanan and Ross Perot, ``there's been a steady erosion in \n     Republican support for free trade,'' says former Rep. Vin \n     Weber, now an adviser to Republican presidential candidate \n     Mitt Romney.\n       One fresh indication of the party's ideological crosswinds: \n     Presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas, who opposes the \n     Iraq war and calls free-trade deals ``a threat to our \n     independence as a nation,'' announced yesterday that he \n     raised $5 million in third-quarter donations. That nearly \n     matches what one-time front-runner John McCain is expected \n     to report.\n       In a December 1999 Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 37% of \n     Republicans said trade deals had helped the U.S. and 31% said \n     they had hurt, while 26% said they made no difference.\n       The new poll asked a broader but similar question. It posed \n     two statements to voters. The first was, ``Foreign trade has \n     been good for the U.S. economy, because demand for U.S. \n     products abroad has resulted in economic growth and jobs for \n     Americans here at home and provided more choices for \n     consumers.''\n       The second was, ``Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. \n     economy, because imports from abroad have reduced demand for \n     American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced \n     potentially unsafe products.''\n\n[[Page S12739]]\n\n       Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59% of \n     Republicans named the second statement, while 32% pointed to \n     the first.\n\n\n                             Rocky Outlook\n\n       Such sentiment suggests a rocky outlook for trade \n     expansion. Early in his term, Mr. Bush successfully promoted \n     a number of new free-trade pacts, but the efforts have \n     stalled, particularly after Democrats took control of \n     Congress last November.\n       Even relatively small deals are facing resistance. While \n     trade pacts with Peru and Panama have a strong chance of \n     passing in the current congressional term, deals with South \n     Korea and Colombia are in serious jeopardy. Some legislators \n     believe South Korea isn't opening its market wide enough to \n     American beef and autos.\n\n\n                              `Fast Track'\n\n       Presidential ``fast track'' trade negotiating authority has \n     lapsed. Without such authority, which requires Congress to \n     take a single up-or-down vote on trade deals, the next \n     president would have trouble pursuing large trade agreements, \n     particularly the stalled global Doha Round.\n       Julie Kowal, 40 years old, who works in a medical lab and \n     is raising five children in Omaha, Neb., said she worries \n     that Midwestern producers face obstacles selling beef and \n     autos abroad. ``We give a lot more than we get,'' she said. \n     ``There's got to be a point where we say, `Wait a minute.' ''\n       Beyond trade, Republicans appear to be seeking a move away \n     from the president. Asked in general terms, a 48% plurality \n     of Republicans said the next president should ``take a \n     different approach'' from Mr. Bush, while 38% wanted to \n     continue on his path.\n       In the poll, Mr. Giuliani maintained his lead in the \n     Republican field with support from 30% of respondents. Former \n     Sen. Fred Thompson drew 23% in the survey, to 15% for Sen. \n     John McCain, 10% for Mr. Romney and 4% for former Arkansas \n     Gov. Mike Huckabee. The telephone survey of 606 Republican \n     voters, conducted Sept. 28-30, has a margin of error of \n     four percentage points.\n       A clear majority of Republicans want more tax cuts, but \n     among Republicans who identify themselves as moderate or \n     liberal--about one-third of the party's primary voters--a 48% \n     plurality favored some tax increase to fund health care and \n     other priorities.\n       In part, the concern about trade reflected in the survey \n     reflects the changing composition of the Republican \n     electorate as social conservatives have grown in influence. \n     In questions about a series of candidate stances, the only \n     one drawing strong agreement from a majority of Republicans \n     was opposition to abortion rights.\n       Post-911 security concerns have also displaced some of the \n     traditional economic concerns of the Republican Party that \n     Ronald Reagan reshaped a generation ago. Asked which issues \n     will be most important in determining their vote, a 32% \n     plurality cited national defense, while 25% cited domestic \n     issues such as education and health care, and 23% cited moral \n     issues. Ranking last, identified by just 17%, were economic \n     issues such as taxes and trade.\n       John Pirtle, a 40-year-old Defense Department employee in \n     Grand Rapids, Mich., said he drifted toward the Republican \n     Party in large part because of his opposition to abortion, \n     but doesn't agree with the free-trade views of leading \n     candidates.\n       ``We're seeing a lot of jobs farmed out,'' said Mr. Pirtle, \n     whose father works for General Motors Corp. Rankled by \n     reports of safety problems with Chinese imports, he added, \n     ``The stuff we are getting, looking at all the recalls, to be \n     quite honest, it's junk.''\n\n\n                              Bush's Veto\n\n       Mr. Bush lately has sought to elevate the importance of \n     economic issues. Yesterday he vetoed a bill passed by \n     Congress that would expand funding for a children's-health \n     program by $35 billion over five years. He slammed what he \n     described as the Democrats' tax-and-spend approach during a \n     speech in Lancaster, Pa.\n       Economic advisers to Republican presidential hopefuls \n     acknowledge the safety scandals have made defending free \n     trade more difficult. ``Americans are right to be angered at \n     companies that take shortcuts'' in importing goods, said \n     Larry Lindsey, once the top economic aide in the Bush White \n     House and now an adviser to Mr. Thompson's presidential bid. \n     ``The next president has to promote free trade by playing \n     hardball, and to be seen doing so.''\n       In the Republican campaign so far, elevating populist trade \n     concerns has been left to the long shots. ``The most \n     important thing a president needs to do is to make it clear \n     that we're not going to continue to see jobs shipped \n     overseas. . . . and then watch as a CEO takes a $100 million \n     bonus,'' Mr. Huckabee said at a debate earlier this year. \n     ``If Republicans don't stop it, we don't deserve to win in \n     2008.''\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3250\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to those who might be watching the \nactions of the Senate in either the gallery or on C-SPAN--because we do \nfunction in an open and transparent way--they might wonder: What is \ngoing on there? Well, I will tell you what is going on. We are debating \nthe appropriations subcommittee report that funds all of the Commerce, \nall Justice, and good, significant aspects of America's science \nprograms--the National Science Foundation, the space agency, the agency \nthat does research on oceans.\n  In the course of debating this appropriations bill, there have been \nothers who have asked to speak on other matters. When you see the \nChamber is empty, what we are doing is clearing amendments offered by \nour colleagues. We are waiting for another colleague to come to offer \nan appropriations amendment. For us, we are trying to make sure America \nremains premier in space.\n  I will reiterate, the Mikulski-Shelby-Hutchinson-Bill Nelson-Mel \nMartinez bipartisan amendment is to restore the funding that it took \nwhen the Columbia accident occurred to return our astronauts to space \nsafely and swiftly.\n  I will elaborate on that later, but I note the Senator from Rhode \nIsland is here, who also wishes to speak on the amendment, as does the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am here today to speak on the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science appropriations bill, and I begin by thanking the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Mikulski, and the ranking member, \nSenator Shelby, for an extraordinarily well-crafted appropriations bill \nwhich responds to the needs of the country and responds particularly to \nthose areas which were neglected in the initial submission by the \nPresident.\n  This bill will protect our citizens and support law enforcement, \nwhich is a critical aspect of our engagement to provide security and \nsafety for all of our citizens. It will strengthen America's \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. And it will also go a long way \nto begin to properly husband and conserve our oceans and coastal \ncommunities.\n  Once again, let me commend Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for a \njob well done. I hope as we go forward the President will work with the \nSenate and the House to enact this legislation, to sign it, to fund it \nappropriately, and to continue to strengthen our country in so many \ndifferent ways.\n  This bill will restore $1.5 billion in funding cuts to State and \nlocal law enforcement programs. We have seen, shockingly in my mind, an \nincrease in the statistics of violent crime in this country. That tears \nat the fabric of every community in America. We need these funds. I am \npleased to see the chairman and ranking member respond to that need by \nproviding additional resources.\n  Since 2001, budgets for these law enforcement programs have been \ndecimated, and many in law enforcement believe these cuts have \ncontributed to this very rise in violent crime. To reverse this \ntroubling trend, the bill provides $2.66 billion in funding for the \nOffice of Justice programs, which includes Justice assistance, State \nand local law enforcement assistance, community-oriented policing \nservices, and juvenile justice programs.\n  The $550 million for the COPS Program will help local law enforcement \nagencies combat crime and respond to terrorist threats. There is \nanother dimension. When we enacted the COPS Program years ago, we were \nthinking of law enforcement at the local level simply being an agent to \nstop those perpetrators of crime. Now we have to deal, and they have to \ndeal, with terrorists, and they have to be prepared to do that.\n  In Rhode Island, the COPS Program has provided nearly $30 million in \nFederal funding and helped over 395 police officers--it has helped that \nmany--since its inception. We would have literally hundreds of police \nofficers absent from their place on the streets of Rhode Island if this \nprogram had not been adopted, and if this bill does not continue to \nsupport it. I have been pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Biden's \namendment, which I think was one of the foundations of the proposal we \nsee today in the appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S12740]]\n\n  This bill also provides $7.35 billion for the Department of Commerce. \nThis is a diverse agency. It has a significant impact in Rhode Island. \nIt supports, in Rhode Island, ocean exploration. We have the University \nof Rhode Island School of Oceanography, which is one of the best in the \ncountry, and it depends significantly on support from NOAA and the \nDepartment of Commerce. Coastal protection: We are the ``Ocean State.'' \nWe have, per area, the longest coastline of any State in the \ncountry. We have a fisheries program. We are an active fishing state, \nand we need that help and support.\n\n  I am excited about the opportunities, particularly for increased \nresearch with respect to our oceans. Oceans, through fishing, through \ntransport, through recreation, contribute an estimated $120 billion a \nyear to our economy, and they support over 2 million jobs. Yet we do \nvery little to research the ocean. We do little to stimulate \naquaculture, commercial fishing, tourism--all of these things which are \nhuge economic drivers to our economy in Rhode Island and in many parts \nof the country. This bill will begin to pick up the pace when it comes \nto supporting these important endeavors.\n  There is a Joint Oceans Commission that has been charged with looking \nat oceans policy, and they have given our country a grade. In 2006, it \nwas a C-minus. It was a little bit better than 2005--that was a D-\nplus--but we want to get A's when it comes to ocean policy. That means \nsupporting this legislation and putting the money in to help NOAA \nparticularly. This bill provides $4.2 billion for the National Ocean \nand Atmospheric Administration, including $795 million to fund the \nJoint Ocean Commission's recommendations for ocean research, education, \nobservation, and exploration.\n  Let me commend again Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for making \nthis a part of this important legislation. The world is basically \ncovered by ocean. We spend a very small fraction on ocean research \nrelative to major research programs for the atmosphere, for space. We \nhave to start looking within the oceans, not only for scientific \nanswers but for commercial opportunity.\n  The bill also strengthens U.S. innovation and competitiveness. \nFollowing the recommendations of the National Academy of Science's \nreport ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' the bill invests in \nresearch and technology that will pay dividends for our future. \nSpecifically, the bill provides over $5.1 billion for basic research \nthrough the National Science Foundation, including $117.5 million for \nthe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research--the EPSCoR \nProgram. This EPSCoR Program has been very critical in my home State of \nRhode Island. It has provided a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment, academic agencies, schools, universities, and State \ngovernment to stimulate research. It is a valuable catalyst for \nresearch going forward.\n  Now, with more than 50 percent of NSF's funding going to seven \nStates, this EPSCoR Program makes sure that the other States--the other \n43 States--get a little attention and a little cooperation and a little \nsupport. It is incredibly important to Rhode Island, and I particularly \nthank the chairman and the ranking member for their support.\n  Let me mention something else about NSF funding, something else about \nresearch funding. It is not just the foregone experiment, the foregone \nprogram research; without robust funding for the National Science \nFoundation and other areas of academic endeavor, we are losing a whole \ngeneration of researchers, of academics.\n  I went to the laboratory at Brown University, the neuroscience lab--\nterribly sophisticated, doing remarkably good work. I talked to a young \nresearcher, a Ph.D., a woman in her early thirties. She said not only \ndid she need additional support, but she looked back at her class of \nYale graduates, Ph.D. scientists, and she is the only one of about \nseven of those Ph.D.s from Yale who has the money to do the research. \nShe pointed out that if you don't get that money at 30 years old to do \nthis fundamental research and establish yourself, you will not get \ntenured at 39, and as a result, you quickly decide you are leaving the \nfield. You can go to a pharmaceutical company; you can go to an \ninvestment bank and use your skills in terms of analyzing portfolios \nand investments. You won't be doing basic research, expanding the \nknowledge, teaching other scientists and other young students. That is \nwhat is so critical about this, in addition to simply making sure we \ncontinue to do the research, and I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Let me also mention another program, and that is the manufacturing \nextension program. All of my colleagues, without exception--and I \ninclude myself--come to the floor and talk about the decline of \nAmerican manufacturing, the fact that we used to have, particularly up \nmy way in the Northeast, communities that revolved around manufacturing \nplants at every corner. Growing up in Rhode Island, when you drove \nthrough communities such as Pawtucket in the 1950s on a Saturday, all \nyou could hear was click, click, click. Those machines were working \novertime. There was no air-conditioning; the windows were open until 11 \no'clock at night. It is silent there now. We are losing manufacturing.\n  This manufacturing extension program is the only real money we put in \nto directly aid manufacturing. It gives them new techniques, new \ntechnology. It gives them suggestions about how they can be competitive \non a global basis. It helps the small manufacturer. It is critical. It \nis the last support for many of these individual companies, the last \nsupport they get to face a very competitive world. I again appreciate \nso much how this money has been included in this appropriation.\n  This bill also provided $283 million to the Economic Development \nAdministration. EDA is one of those critical agencies of the Federal \nGovernment that will allow local communities to fulfill their plans for \nlocal economic development. We have used this program repeatedly to \njump-start progress at the local level. They have gone in and they have \nfunded, and they have a rather wide mandate that they can justify as \neconomic development, but they have funded programs that have allowed \ninvestments by States and cities and private entities to really give us \na leg up in terms of providing employment, providing new economic \noppor-\ntunities for my communities in Rhode\nIsland. Again, it is a very valuable \nagency.\n  Of this funding, $15 million is for trade adjustment assistance for \nfirms, and this is targeted to medium-sized manufacturers and \nagricultural companies that experienced loss from foreign imports.\n  Again, related to the struggle of our manufacturing companies, we are \nseeing so much that used to be produced in America is now imported, and \nwhat is lost in the balance is many jobs, and this money will help, at \nleast a bit, to ease that transition. It allows people really to retool \nthemselves for a new economy. It gets them off the unemployment rolls \nmore quickly than otherwise and gives them something more important \nthan just a check; it gives them new hope. For many of my constituents, \nit is particularly distressing when you reach midlife, you have worked \nvery hard, you got out of high school in the 1960s and thought you \ncould have a whole career based on a high school diploma, and guess \nwhat. Now the company is gone. You have to have new skills. Where are \nyou going to turn? This helps these individuals, not just with the \nmonetary compensation, not just with a little bit of assistance, but \nwith a new hope that they can get on with their lives. It is very \nimportant.\n  So much of this bill is commendable, and it is the work of not only \nthe hands but the hearts of both Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby \nthat have made this such a worthwhile piece of legislation. I am proud \nto support it. I hope we can move it forward quickly, and I hope the \nPresident will sign it. I believe it will be a victory for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island. He has raised several \nimportant initiatives: the ocean initiative, basic research and \ndevelopment, the disparity between some of our research dollars to a \nfew universities and\n\n[[Page S12741]]\n\nleaving out so many other good and fine universities, and many of those \nuniversities in the South. It has been a program where I have supported \nmore equitable funding. We are proud of our southern universities. I \nknow the Senator from Alabama most certainly is. That is one way his \nbill, along with the Senator from Maryland, is helping many of our \nuniversities.\n  I rise today to give support to the amendment that is under \nconsideration now, the $1 billion amendment to add funding to the NASA \nbudget. When people think about New Orleans and Louisiana, they think \nabout good food and Mardi Gras and fishing and maybe even wetlands and \nother things, but they might not think of space and space programs and \nhigh tech, but we are all of the above.\n  In New Orleans east, particularly, there is a great national asset \ncalled Michoud, which has been there since 1961, which has done some of \nthe basic research and manufacturing for the space program, which also \nhas parts, of course, in Texas and in Houston, in Huntsville, AL, where \nI have had the pleasure of visiting, in parts of Florida and along the \ngulf coast of Mississippi. Senator Mikulski honored me and honored our \nState by coming to visit the Michoud facility several years ago and \nwalked through--actually, I think we might have skated or rode carts \nthrough.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator will yield, I have been on thin ice, but \nI didn't skate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator was not on skates--strike it from the \nrecord--but we were on carts, and some people were on bicycles because \nthis facility is so large. It is 43 acres under roof, air-conditioned, \nemploying 4,000 people, committed to our space program.\n  Right down the road in our neighboring State of Mississippi, there \nare another 4,000 people employed at the Stennis Space Center--of \ncourse, named after our former colleague, Senator Stennis himself.\n  But the reason I bring this up is not only because this is important \nto Louisiana and to the gulf coast area of Mississippi and to the State \nof Alabama, our sister States, but it is important to the Nation. When \nthe Columbia accident happened, as the leaders have so eloquently said, \nNASA had to scramble and take a lot of money from other parts of its \nbudget to cover the battle back to space, to support back-to-flight \nmissions. We have not ever reimbursed them appropriately for that. \nTheir program is quite challenged because of it. So that is why this \namendment is so important. It is a great boost to the rebuilding of our \nregion.\n  Let me say, for the employees at Michoud, they have been back at work \neven though they had no houses in which to live. They were back at work \nbuilding levees around this facility even though there was water all \naround. They kept this program and this building open and operating, \nand there was not a stop, even during some of the worst parts of this \nstorm. That is how committed this workforce is to this program.\n  So I want to support this amendment. I thank the Senator for her \nleadership, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the $1 billion \namendment to add much needed revenue to the NASA budget. Again, I am \nvery proud of this work in New Orleans Parish, in St. Tammany Parish, \nas well as along the gulf coast of Mississippi.\n  If I might, before I yield the floor, also thank the leaders of this \ncommittee for already approving an amendment I offered, and it has been \naccepted by voice earlier today. It is a small amendment, but I \nactually think it can help in a very timely situation in the country \nright now.\n  As my colleagues are aware, we have had a terrible series of events \nin Louisiana commonly referred to as the Jena 6. There have been many \nallegations made on all sides about events that occurred on and off the \nschool grounds in Jena, LA, a small town I represent.\n  Looking into the situation and talking with many people involved, it \ncame to my attention that there were really very little resources that \nthe Federal Government had to bring to bear early on that could have \npotentially avoided some of the conflict that occurred, some of the \nattention that rose up about these incidents.\n  The more I looked into it, the more I became concerned because I \nfound out that the Community Relations Service does exist within the \nDepartment of Justice. The service's mission, when appropriate, is to \nserve as a mediator during and after periods of racial tension in our \ncountry. This was created some years ago. I read its mission and its \nstatement, and it seems as if that would be a very good way for us to \nspend a very small portion of money that is allocated to help because, \nof course, the American dream is for all of us from different races to \nbe able to live and work together and to prosper. It has not really \nbeen done in any other country as well as it is being done here in the \ncourse of human history, so it is something we should be proud of, \nalthough we do have problems. But we need all parts of our Government \ncoming forward and committing to making this happen.\n  It occurred to me--and I learned--that this is a very excellent \nservice. The problem was, there were only three people employed in the \nservice for the 31 million people who live in New Mexico, Texas, \nLouisiana, and the two other States in our region. So it occurred to me \nthat it might be a good use of taxpayer money to add some money to this \nCommunity Relations Service, specifically directing some of the new \nhires to this region, to keep money in the field--not here in \nWashington but pushed out into the field so when these incidents \nhappen, maybe a well, trained mediator from the field could show up, \nwork with the community leaders, work with the attorneys general, maybe \nwork with some local elected officials, and prevent some of the harsh \nthings that were said and done over the course of this time.\n  This is in no way saying who was right and who was wrong. I think it \nis a very good service that our Justice Department could do. I was \npleased to offer this amendment. I understand it has been accepted. It \nwill be most certainly a help to us as we try to reconcile and heal \nthis community, Jena and LaSalle Parish in Louisiana, and bring the \ncommunity back together after a series of very unfortunate events.\n  Finally, let me say I thank the Chair, and I can either call up now--\nor it can be accepted later--another amendment regarding the COPS \nProgram, which will help some of the disaster areas that are still \nstruggling with law enforcement challenges. If it is appropriate, I \nthink both sides have cleared this amendment No. 3223.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, there is no objection to this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3223\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3223 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3223.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To waive certain matching requirements for counties and \n parishes in which the President declared a major disaster in response \n        to Hurricane Katrina of 2005 or Hurricane Rita of 2005)\n\n       On page 57, line 23, after ``Office:'' insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That the Attorney General \n     shall waive in whole the matching requirement under section \n     1701(g) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n     1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(g)) for any grant recipient located in \n     a county or parish in which the President declared a major \n     disaster (as that term is defined in section 102 of the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)) in response to Hurricane Katrina of \n     2005 or Hurricane Rita of 2005:''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. There is no objection to the Senator's amendment on \neither side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3223) was agreed to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the leaders for their work on \nthis bill and for continuing to support NASA, as we clean up our \ncriminal justice system and bring some reconciliation to Jena and \nLaSalle Parish.\n\n[[Page S12742]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for the cooperative \nway in which they have worked with us. I also wish to comment on \nSenator Landrieu's amendment that was accepted, which eliminated a \ncopay for a matching portion for the COPS Program in areas that don't \nhave the money to match. It is a smart thing that we are doing. It is \nright. It will come to an end at some time, but until they get back on \ntheir feet, we ought to do it.\n  I wished to spend a few minutes talking about the bill overall. I \nthink even though the chairwoman and ranking member have done a great \njob with the bill in terms of priorities, I am concerned at the overall \nspending level, and I think the administration probably will be too. \nInflation, last year, was less than 3 percent. In title I, the Commerce \nportion of the bill, it grows by 13.88 percent, which is 4\\1/2\\ times \nthe rate of inflation. In title II, the Justice portion, it grows 6.1 \npercent, which is over two times the rate of inflation. In title III of \nthe bill, in the Science portion, it grows by 8.1 percent over last \nyear's actual appropriation, which is almost three times what the rate \nof inflation was.\n  That probably would not be a problem if we didn't borrow $454 billion \nfrom our kids last year. It would not be a problem if everybody else \nhad an 18-percent or 13-percent or a 10-percent increase. But the fact \nthat this bill has grown this much says we are going to go down the \nroad again of borrowing additional money.\n  This is a rationalization, and I admit it. What we are doing is \nfunding this increase this year on the backs of our grandchildren, \nbecause if it goes through this way and coming out of conference, and \nif the President signs it, the increase in spending for the Commerce, \nJustice, and State Departments will come on the back of future payments \nof debt for our kids.\n  The contrast I wish to show is that the average family's income rose \nless than 4 percent last year. Their taxes aren't going to rise much \nmore than 4 percent, but the taxes on their grandkids are going to rise \ndisproportionately more than that, probably 12 or 13 percent, because \nwe cannot get hold of this Government. That is no reflection on the \nleaders of this committee. They are given a number, and they have \nrequests out the kazoo from individual members. They have programs that \nneed to be funded, which is very different than the administration. I \ndidn't compare it to the administration's request. I compared it to \nwhat we approved last year.\n  I think it behooves us to look at the overall growth in this bill, \nand if you applied it to the rest of Government, we grew the Government \nby about $700 billion this year. We cannot do that. We cannot do it. So \nI have asked for a recorded vote on the bill because I want to be \nrecorded as voting against this appropriations bill--not because it is \nnot important to fund these items but because we cannot continue to \nhave these kinds of increases in funding when we have grown the \nGovernment by 62 percent over the last 7\\1/2\\ years. That does not \ncount Medicare and Medicaid spending. So I wanted to make that point.\n  I have a couple of amendments, again, which are directed at directed \nspending--what we call earmarks. The programs are not bad programs--the \nvery things I am going to outline that I think we ought to transfer \nmoney from to something else. But I think people will have a tough time \njustifying spending on these programs, these directed earmarks, when we \nshould not be spending as much as we are and could be spending it on \nsomething that would give us better value for the dollars we spend.\n  I ask unanimous consent to bring up amendment No. 3243 and make it \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I said \nto the Senator, the Senator has every right to bring that amendment up. \nWe are looking at it and trying to come up with a UC. Maybe we can get \nto your two amendments and we can vote back to back.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am absolutely fine with that. I will take no more than \nprobably 25 minutes on both of these amendments. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be given 25 minutes to cover both of the amendments, \nreserving the remainder of the time if I don't use it, and allowing any \nopposition the same amount of time, and I will probably not consume \nthat amount of time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator will withhold, I am still reserving the \nright to object while I get clarification. Rather than doing it this \nway and knowing we are in alignment, can we have a quorum call?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3243\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment number 3243.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3243.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide $1,680,000 to investigate and prosecute unsolved \n civil rights crimes in a fiscally responsible manner by prioritizing \n                               spending)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In February 2006, the United States Attorney General \n     and the FBI director announced a partnership with the NAACP, \n     the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban \n     League to investigate unsolved crimes from the civil rights \n     era.\n       (2) Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has pledged that \n     ``The Justice Department is committed to investigating and \n     prosecuting civil-rights era homicides for as long as it \n     takes and as far as the law allows--because there is no \n     statute of limitations on human dignity and justice.''.\n       (3) In February 2006, the FBI enacted an initiative to \n     identify hate crimes that occurred prior to December 1969, \n     and resulted in death.\n       (4) The Bureau's 56 field offices have been directed to \n     reexamine their unsolved civil rights cases and determine \n     which ones could still be viable for prosecution.\n       (5) The FBI has partnered with a number of State and local \n     authorities, civic organizations, and community leaders to \n     reexamine old files.\n       (6) Since the initiative began, the FBI has received nearly \n     100 such referrals.\n       (7) The FBI is continuing to assess each referral for its \n     investigative and legal viability and, given the updated \n     investigative and forensic tools, move forward in \n     investigating these cases.\n       (8) The United States national debt is nearly \n     $9,000,000,000,000.\n       (9) Rather than adding to this debt, Congress should offset \n     any new spending from lower priority spending.\n       (10) Bringing justice to those who have committed ghastly \n     civil rights crimes in a fiscally responsible manner that \n     does not add to the United States national debt should be a \n     higher priority for Congress than funding parochial pork \n     barrel projects.\n       (b) Increased Appropriations.--Amounts provided in this Act \n     for the Civil Rights Division within the Department of \n     Justice are increased by $1,680,000 for the prosecution of \n     civil rights crimes.\n       (c) Decreased Appropriations.--Appropriations in this Act \n     for the following accounts are decreased by the amount \n     indicated:\n       (1) Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes research by $450,000.\n       (2) Ocean and Coastal Management, National Ocean Service, \n     by $500,000.\n       (3) Local Warnings and Forecasts, National Weather Service, \n     by $300,000.\n       (4) National Aeronautics and Space Administration by \n     $800,000.\n       (5) Education Program, NOAA, by $500,000.\n       (d) Prohibition on Funding.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, there shall be no funding for fiscal \n     year 2008 for the following:\n       (1) Advanced Undersea Vehicle, Mystic Aquarium-Institute \n     for Exploration, Mystic, Connecticut.\n       (2) Maritime Museum, City of Mobile, Alabama.\n       (3) Eye-On-The-Sky, Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium, St. \n     Johnsbury, Vermont.\n       (4) Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois.\n       (5) U.S. Space and Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama, for \n     an update for the museum and exhibits.\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\n       (6) John Smith Water Trail, installation of buoys marking \n     the John Smith National Water Trail on the Chesapeake Bay, \n     the Conservation Fund, Arlington, Virginia.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. There \nis a bill in the Senate that I am presently blocking from a unanimous \nconsent request, which means I am not necessarily opposed to it; but I \ndon't think the bill ought to come to the floor without being voted on \nor amended. It is the Emmett Till civil rights bill. This bill is \ndesigned to increase the emphasis on unsolved civil rights cases.\n  A year and a half ago, the Department of Justice initiated a new \nprogram for that exact purpose. They put staff on it, funded it, and \nhave since gotten 100 referrals from 42 different offices on unsolved \ncivil rights cases that are 50 years old and older. It is something we \nshould be doing and the Justice Department is doing. I don't think we \nneed another piece of legislation and another law to make us do that. \nThe Justice Department has actually shown they didn't need a law. They \nwere actually doing it.\n  What this amendment does is transfers from six directed spending \nitems--earmarks--to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division \n$1.680 million to augment that process. What it will do is allow them \nto hire additional people to further define and further investigate \nthese older civil rights cases.\n  This bill has 600 earmarks in it. This relates to only six earmarks. \nThe total for the earmarks is $458 million. Many of the earmarks in \nthis bill don't do anything to advance the priorities or the mission \nstatements of the three agencies we are funding. What are they? A \nmaritime museum in Mobile, AL; Eye on the Sky Fairbanks Museum and \nPlanetarium in St. Johnsbury, VT; Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL; \nU.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL. I have been there; it \nis a tremendous place. Lastly, the installation of buoys marking the \nJohn Smith National Water Trail on the Chesapeake; undersea vehicle for \nthe Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration in Connecticut.\n  Let's start with the first one. There is $500,000 in this to \nconstruct a maritime museum in Mobile, AL. It is probably a great idea, \nalthough there are two other maritime museums right now in Mobile. \nShould we spend $500,000 now, when we are borrowing the kind of money \nthat we are borrowing from our grandchildren, when we are fighting a \nwar we are not paying for and charging to our grandchildren? Should we \nspend that money now or should we spend the money upholding the law and \ngoing after people who violated other people's civil rights? Which is a \nbetter value? Which is a better purpose? Which is a better core \nprinciple?\n  I will not go into the details, although I am prepared to do it in \nrebuttal. There are now 35 maritime museums in the gulf coast region, \nincluding two in Mobile. There are funds for this earmark through the \ncompetitive grant system. So it is not that this may not even get \nfunded, because it might have to compete with the rest of the museums \nin the country. Instead, we have directed it.\n  Earmark offset 2 is for the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium in \nVermont for the Eye on the Sky Program. It is a $300,000 earmark. It is \nprobably a great idea. But is it a priority when we are borrowing money \nfrom our grandchildren? Again, this is another program. There is grant \nmoney out there for museums. You would have to compete based on the \npriorities. There is oversight on the grants. On these earmarks, there \nis no oversight. It can still be funded, on a competitive basis, \nwithout an earmark.\n  The Adler Planetarium in Chicago has net assets right now in excess \nof $34 million, and we are going to send them $300,000. They have \nrevenues every year in excess of $11 million. There is no reason for us \nto send that money there now if we are borrowing it from our grandkids. \nI will limit my debate on that.\n  One of the things I will tell you--and I will put up a chart. Here is \nwhat the Administrator of NASA said about directed spending for \nearmarks:\n\n       The growth of these Congressional directives is eroding \n     NASA's ability to carry out its mission of space exploration \n     and peer-reviewed scientific discovery.\n\n  We are taking away the core mission of one of our premier scientific \ninquiries in this country when we send money. The redirections as a \nresult of congressional earmarks included half of NASA's education \nbudget, one-twentieth of the exploration budget, and one-twenty-fourth \nof their science budget. So it is not a small amount with which we are \nimpacting NASA.\n\n  The fourth earmark: Spies and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL. We \nshould know that the State of Alabama is going to have in excess of a \n$2 billion surplus this year. Let me say that again. The State of \nAlabama is going to have in excess of a $2 billion surplus this year. \nThey had a $1.7 billion surplus last year. I would think that maybe \nthey ought to fund this instead of our grandchildren.\n  This is a $500,000 earmark for the Space and Rocket Museum. I have \nbeen there. It is a great thing. You ought to go see it. It is well \nworth your time. But it is something I believe should not be in the \npriority when we are borrowing the money.\n  There is $500,000 for an interpretive buoy system. It is a great idea \nwith great historical significance but probably not right now. Should \nwe be spending this money if we are borrowing it against our grandkids? \nShould we be spending this money when we are growing the budget, this \nappropriations bill by 11 percent? I don't think so.\n  Finally, $450,000 for an undersea vehicle in Mystic, CT. This is part \nof the Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, CT. They could apply for a \ncompetitive grant with all the rest of the States and probably get it. \nIt is not a bad idea. It is probably a good idea. It probably promotes \ntourism, probably enhances the experience at that museum. But, again, \nis it a priority when we are not funding the war and we are not paying \nfor our excesses and, in fact, probably the greatest moral issue of our \nday is stealing the future from our grandkids? It is not any of the \nother social issues. They wane in comparison to taking opportunities \nfrom our next generation.\n  I also advise that the State of Connecticut, according to \nConnecticut's Comptroller, Nancy Wyman, has a $350 million surplus. So \nthey are not running a deficit; they have a surplus. They could easily \ngrant $500,000 for this museum.\n  The point of this amendment is let's put dollars where they ought to \ngo and let's stop spending money on lower priorities. It is about \npriorities. It is not about what is a good program and what is a bad \nprogram. It is about what is the greatest priority.\n  The greatest priority is to ensure people of their civil rights. It \nhas to be greater than these. There cannot be a greater priority than \nsecuring the future for the next generations, except we are not going \nto do that with this bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time I have under the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, I \nadmire his tenacity and consistency in being a steward of the \ntaxpayers' purse, as well as being concerned about future generations. \nAlso, he has often raised issues from which I have benefited. I assure \nhim that both my colleague from Alabama and I have stood squarely on \nthe side of reform as well.\n  When we did our opening statements today, we said that we were for \nsecurity, which is helping our law enforcement, innovation, and \ncompetitiveness, as well as accountability. We had two reform \namendments--one on the NOAA satellite programs that are already running \n$4 billion in overruns--that is ``B'' as in Barb, not ``M'' as in \nMikulski. So we are instituting reforms and actually bringing to the \ncivilian side a Nunn-McCurdy framework for early warnings. So that was \none.\n  The other, as the junior Senator from Oklahoma is aware, the IG at \nthe Department of Justice said we have had some conferences, what we \ncall the ``lavish conference situation.'' One conference had meatballs \nat $4 a meatball, lobster rolls, limousines. That is not about the kind \nof training that is supposed to go on at law enforcement conferences. \nWe have had two of those amendments.\n  Then when we come to Congress--so we have come up with some reforms, \nand there are others in the bill, but\n\n[[Page S12744]]\n\nthose are two big ones. There are others in the bill related to \ncongressionally designated projects.\n  I say to my colleague also that we, meaning Senator Shelby and \nmyself, said that any congressionally designated project must meet \ncriteria to even be considered. We were not going to have a bridge to \nnowhere. We were going to, if you will, have bridges to somewhere. They \nhad to be not only for the political benefit, but they had to be tied \nto mission. They had to have mission and merit and matching funds, the \nM: mission, merit, and matching funds.\n  Let's take the Department of Justice. We would not even think about a \ncongressionally designated project unless it was for prevention, law \nenforcement or prosecution. There had to be local funds or nonprofits \nand no construction money.\n  In the area of Commerce, we said it had to be related to coastal and \nmarine resources. It had to foster understanding of the Earth's \nenvironment. It had to create jobs or keep jobs in America. Or it had \nto enhance the America COMPETES Act, which means science, technology or \neducation.\n  I could also go through the NASA criteria which, again, was science \nand research, education to promote the engagement of science and \nengineering, as well as aeronautics research, and, again, no private \nfacility construction.\n  I will not go through justification of each and every one of those \nprojects. I know the Senator from Connecticut will speak to his. I will \nspeak to mine in a moment.\n  We have buoys--not like boys and girls, but buoys, such as b-u-o-y-s, \nbuoys on the Chesapeake Bay. They are NOAA buoys. We have to have them \nanyway, and they give important navigation information, as well as \nreadings on temperature, tides, and so on, that is so important to keep \nour commercial shipping lanes open and are great aids to the commercial \nand sports fishing industry.\n  We had the commemoration of Jamestown, and in the commemoration of \nJamestown, they celebrated CAPT John Smith's voyage on the Chesapeake \nBay by mapping it. What we did, working with the National Geographic \nSociety that actually raised the money for this project, was add items \nto these buoys that would also tell the history, when you got up close \nto it, of what occurred in that geographic area. These buoys provide \nimportant navigation, and now they add value to history.\n\n  Why is that important? It is important, first of all, for navigation \nreasons. It is important to also help us for weather reasons because if \nwe know our tides and temperatures, it will help.\n  I will tell my colleagues what gets people interested in science and \nengineering in my State. It is kids working hands on in science, not \nreading books about science but hands on, doing the science. That is \nwhy they love to come to our aquarium or to our Maryland Science \nCenter. Teachers all over the Delmarva, including the great State of \nJohn Warner, whom we salute today and wish him well, they get into \nscience, and that is what promotes their interest in wanting to be \nscientists and engineers. If they don't want to be scientists or \nengineers, maybe they want to be doctors, nurses or lab techs. There \nare so many ways people now come into science in addition to \nengineering and Ph.D.s, and we need them.\n  Many of these projects that are listed here--and we know we will hear \nabout planetariums, we will hear about the grand and spectacular work \nof Dr. Ballard that is exciting so many people, and we salute him \nbecause Captain Ballard found the Titanic. We have to make sure science \nand education is not a sinking ship hit by the iceberg of chilling cuts \nin our programs.\n  I know my metaphors are going too far, but what I want my colleagues \nto know that we were not cavalier and said: Just give us any request \nand we will fund it. We screened them. We scrutinized them. They had to \nbe mission and merit and have matching funds. We believe we have met \nthis criteria. That is on the earmark reform.\n  On the issue of civil rights, I salute, again, our colleague from \nOklahoma on the issue of wanting to investigate these cold cases but \nassure him that throughout our bill, we have a vigorous civil rights \nenforcement. I thank my colleague from Alabama for being such a \nstalwart ally on this issue.\n  First of all, we actually have money in the bill, close to $378 \nmillion for the EEOC. While we are not only looking at cold cases, we \nare looking at hot cases right here and now and dealing with a terrible \nbacklog.\n  We also funded $9 million for the Commission on Civil Rights. But \nalong with that, $116 million went to the Civil Rights Division at \nJustice to pay for 760 attorneys and support staff. Also, money went to \nthe U.S. attorney to investigate crimes, including hate crimes and \ncivil rights violations.\n  We also put in $370 million for the FBI for over 270 agents to \ninvestigate civil rights violations, those that have occurred now and \nalso those very sad cold cases. So $370 million, $116 million, and it \ngoes on and on. The totals, actually when we count what we fund for \nU.S. attorneys, my staff tells me it is $3 billion. Those U.S. \nattorneys do other things as well.\n  We think we did a good job dealing with the backlog at EEOC, \nreforming them, getting them refocused, funding the FBI, funding the \nCivil Rights Division, funding the Commission on Civil Rights, funding \nthe Legal Aid Corporation, and so on. We funded those enforcement and \nprosecution issues related to cold cases but also current cases where \nwe want to see justice done.\n  I oppose the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first, I say to Senator Mikulski, she \nshould be unrestrained in her metaphorical employments. I thought they \nwere both creative and inspirational, as is the bill she brings before \nthe Chamber, with Senator Shelby as well.\n  I rise to speak against the Coburn amendment. I will file some \nstatements in the Record, but I say to Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby, I thank them, before I get to the amendment, for the \nextraordinary work they have done and particularly on matters of local \nlaw enforcement which are so critical to the safety and well-being of \nour communities and our people. They stood up together in a bipartisan \nway. These programs have worked to reduce crime in our neighborhoods. I \nwanted to take this opportunity to thank them.\n  Why do I oppose the Coburn amendment? Because the amendment would \nprohibit any funding of a program that happens to be located in \nConnecticut, in Mystic, CT, but is a program of real national \nsignificance run by Dr. Bob Ballard, who is a national asset. He is an \nextraordinary visionary, explorer, scientist, public servant, really an \nAmerican patriot in the best sense of the term.\n\n  Generally speaking, when I sought reelection last year and my \nopponent attacked me about earmarks, I said there are good earmarks and \nthere are bad earmarks. A lot of what we do here has to do with \nearmarking, to either add or subtract to the budget or to authorization \nbills, and I think people understand that.\n  I rise to say that it would be a terrible result if, in pursuit of \nthis amendment, which I know the Senator from Oklahoma offers for \nreasons that are fiscal, he eliminated the funding of the advanced \nundersea vehicle at the Institute for Exploration, which happens to be \nlocated at the Mystic Aquarium.\n  Now, the first thing I want to say is that the Institute for \nExploration is run by Dr. Bob Ballard, who, as Senator Mikulski said, \nis not only nationally famous but probably world famous as the man who \ndiscovered the Titanic and who went on to discover the Bismarck in 1989 \nand the USS Yorktown in 1998. These are remarkable historic \nachievements. He is a kind of ocean archeological explorer. I am sure \nmost people hearing my voice have seen Dr. Bob in one or another TV \nprogram describing his extraordinary work, but let me first say it \nhappens to be located at the Mystic Aquarium. It was a major \nachievement when we convinced Dr. Ballard to locate there--the State \ndid. How do I compare it? In this time of baseball playoffs, without \ndemeaning either side here, it would be like the Yankees acquiring A-\nRod or the Red Sox getting Josh Beckett. When Dr. Bob Ballard agreed to \nbring his Institute for Exploration to Mystic, CT, we were thrilled. \nAnd I do want to\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\nstress that it is a separate institute that happens to be located \nalongside and at the aquarium site. Tourists have some access to part \nof its educational aspects, but it is separate. It is not just part of \nthe aquarium.\n  This $450,000 is not a lot of money in a budget the size of our \nbudget, but it is going to be used to improve the sonar on the unmanned \ntechnology for undersea mapping. In other words, there is an advanced \nundersea vehicle that Dr. Ballard and his team use for undersea \nmapping, and this money will help him upgrade the sonar to chart \ncurrently unexplored regions of the world's oceans.\n  Dr. Ballard does this out of his general sense of inquiry, of \nscientific inquiry, to use the extraordinary tools of modern technology \nto teach us things about most of the globe that is underwater that we \nhave never known much about. But he does it also in the aftermath of a \ncareer in the U.S. Navy, 30 years both Active and in the Reserve as an \noceanographer and a naval intelligence officer. During his long career, \nhe has been called upon to use his advanced underwater systems to carry \nout a number of highly classified missions for the U.S. military.\n  The sonar mapping technology that this $450,000 will help facilitate \nis very important to the Navy, and its development has been supported \nby the Office of Naval Research because of its military applications in \nsupport of submarine warfare and countermine measures. The money is in \nthis bill because it is strongly supported also by the National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, part of the Department of \nCommerce, part of the jurisdiction of this subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, and NOAA supports it because of its enormous \npotential to explore the uncharted regions of the oceans for many \nreasons, including in search of precious natural resources.\n  So what I am saying is the project, to our great pride, has a \nConnecticut address, but it is a technology that is critical for \nnational security and even international scientific research.\n  I wish to go one step further here about a bonus. I have been to \nvisit this institute of Dr. Ballard's in Mystic several times. It is a \nremarkable place. I would urge anybody who is in Connecticut to go see \nit. But one of the things he has done, because he is a real educator, \nhe has set up a system, an educational program where he can actually \nbring his scientific work to students around the country. It is called \nImmersion Presents--an afterschool program. He actually has the \ncapability to project his expeditions, including the mapping \nexpeditions that would be improved by this $450,000, via the Internet \nto over 140 Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs across the country. For 7 \nconsecutive days, Dr. Ballard's research mission has broadcast live to \nthousands of students. So he will use the money for this, as he has in \n10 previous expeditions, to continue this Immersion Presents Program. \nThis is a tremendous educational device. If you want to excite American \nkids about going into science, what a thrilling way to do it.\n  So with all respect to my colleague, and I respect what he is trying \nto do, I think he has hit something here that ought not to be hit. If \nit loses its funding, it will not just be a loss for the institute or \nDr. Ballard or the State of Connecticut, it will really be a loss for \nour Nation, both in terms of scientific inquiry for our Nation and \nalso, I would suggest, national security. So I thank Chairman Mikulski \nand Senator Shelby for including this in their recommendation to the \nSenate, and for that reason I would urge the rejection of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I would concede the value of \nwhat Dr. Ballard has done. But the question isn't whether this should \nget funded; the question is, Who should fund it?\n  National Geographic made $15 million last year. They are a nonprofit \norganization. They had revenues of over $1 billion. The State of \nConnecticut is going to have over a $300 million surplus. I don't doubt \nthat this is a very worthy cause. The question is and what the American \npeople are asking this body to do is to start making priorities out of \npriorities.\n  I think this is a very valid project. He is one of 11 resident \nscholars for National Geographic. I have studied the issue. It is not \nabout whether it is a priority for them. The question is, Who ought to \nbe paying for it? In a time when we don't have any money, when the \ndollar is sinking, when we are spending more and we are already funding \na war and charging the war to our kids, what we are setting up is we \nare going to continue to do things that don't have to be done by us \nwhen somebody else could do it. Consequently, we are going to borrow \nthe money.\n  There is half a billion dollars worth of earmarks in here, I would \nsay to my friend from Connecticut, and all of them have some merit. The \nquestion is, Who should be paying for some of these? There are \ncompetitive grants on museums that are run well by this Government. \nThey are very competitive. They can get the $450,000 through a \ncompetitive grant. They can apply for that. There is oversight on that. \nThere is a competition among priorities when we do that and run it. \nWhen we put it in directly, we, No. 1, consign our kids to paying for \nit, and No. 2, we don't put the responsibility on anybody else.\n  Now, if this is really necessary, National Geographic will stand up \nand put the $450,000 into it, or if it is important to the education \nand instruction in the State of Connecticut, with a $300 million \nsurplus, they can put in the $450,000. But our choice here today is, we \nare just going to charge it to our grandkids.\n  We don't have this money. This bill has grown by almost 10 percent \nover what we funded last year. If you took all the directed earmarks \nout of it, we would be growing by about 4\\1/2\\ percent. So it is \nimportant for the American public to see the impact when we direct \nspending.\n  The purpose of this exercise--and I will continue to do this as long \nas I am in the Senate--is to try to force us into making the hard \nchoices we really don't want to have to make. I believe this committee \ndid a good job of setting the parameters and trying, but there is a new \nstandard, and the standard has to be, would you put in your own money? \nThat is the standard we ought to go by because what we are really doing \nis transferring the cost of all these things to two generations, and it \ngoes completely opposite of the heritage of this country.\n  D-day starts January 1, 2008. You know what D-day is? It is the first \nyear of the baby boomers. It is the first year we start going down the \ntubes on Medicare and Social Security. And we can't even bring a bill \nto the floor that constrains spending to 4 percent or 5 percent--1\\1/2\\ \ntimes inflation. The American public doesn't have that option with \ntheir budgets because they do not have an unlimited credit card. We \njust increased the debt limit on this country by $950 billion. Five \ntimes since 1997 have we done that. When a child is born today, not \ncounting that debt, which is $30,000 per man, woman, and child, there \nis $400,000 worth of unfunded liabilities lying on each of those \nchildren.\n  My point is, and I will quit talking about it--and I am not going to \noffer the second amendment--we need to wake up and see that we can't do \neverything we would like to do. We ought to be doing what is absolutely \nnecessary and we ought to be paying for this war. We ought to be making \nthe hard choices and paying for the war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to respond briefly to my friend \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  I respect what he is about. I think we all understand we have to \nbring spending under control. In fact, earmarks are down generally in \nthe appropriations process this year. But, again, there are good \nearmarks and bad earmarks. It is part of what the people elect us to \ndo, and I came to the floor to defend this earmark.\n  I do want to say to my friend from Oklahoma that I am pretty sure, \nthough I haven't had a chance to check it exactly, that the State of \nConnecticut is supporting some of Dr. Ballard's programs. I hadn't \nthought about National Geographic. Maybe you and I should go to Dr. \nBallard and try to get some money from him for what----\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be on the next airplane with you.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. --for what he is doing. But I do want to say this is \nnot the Mystic Aquarium; this is the Institute of Exploration, which \nhappens to be at the Mystic Aquarium. This really does serve a national \npurpose and really an international purpose but a great one for \nAmerica--mapping the ocean floor for the use and the potential \ndevelopment of precious natural resources, and it is supported by the \nNavy because it is of direct use to the Navy.\n  Now, I know my friend from Oklahoma is very principled in his fight, \nso what I am about to say will not affect him. But my staff just told \nhim there are a bunch of students in Oklahoma who get to watch Dr. \nBallard--I know, you love him--and his undersea immersion work, and \nthis $450,000 will make that even better than it already is.\n  There are times when I will support the Senator from Oklahoma in some \nof his efforts because overall they are right. I think all of us know \nthere is a larger problem beyond earmarks in dealing with our fiscal \nimbalances. But today, because I think he has struck some targets here \nthat don't deserve to be struck, I respectfully urge rejection of his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the underlying \nbill, and I will just take a few minutes to do so.\n  Today, the Senate is debating a bill that ensures our homes and \ncommunities are safe, it keeps us a world leader in scientific \nresearch, it promotes economic development across the Nation, and it \nfunds our national census. I am here today because I strongly support \nthe bill and I wanted to commend Chairman Mikulski for her work, as \nwell as the ranking member.\n  It reflects many of our Nation's top domestic priorities: putting \nmore police on our streets through the COPS program, ensuring the FBI \nhas the tools it needs to fight domestic terrorism, providing the DEA \nwith resources to win the war on drugs, and protecting our children \nfrom sexual predators. I am proud to say there is much in this bill to \ncelebrate. And it comes not a day too soon.\n  Last week the FBI released its latest report on crime in America. The \nnews was not good: crime is up for the second year in a row.\n  It is no coincidence that this rise in crime follows years of \nrepeated cuts to the COPS program by the Bush administration and the \nRepublican Congress.\n  In 1994, COPS put more than 100,000 new officers on the streets. \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, every dollar spent \non COPS stopped 30 crimes from happening--every dollar stopped 30 of \nour neighbors, friends and family from being victimized. In my opinion, \nthat is a dollar very well spent.\n  Take a look at this chart. The red line indicates the number of \nhomicides per 100,000 citizens. The blue line indicates the number of \npolice officers. Every time the number of police officers on patrol \ndecreased, the number of homicides increased. This is simple \ncommonsense: more police means less crime. Yet the Bush administration \nchose to kill funding for the very program that is responsible for \nhiring more police officers to protect our communities. And \npredictably, as this chart clearly illustrates, the results have been \ndisastrous.\n  It is time to reverse that course. This bill provides $2.7 billion \nfor State and local law enforcement--$1.6 billion more than the \nPresident's request. With this money, our police will be able to \nprevent gang violence, to combat drug crimes, and to catch child \npredators. This bill also adds 100 FBI agents whose specific purpose is \nfighting the rising threat of violent crime. It lifts a hiring freeze \non DEA agents and puts 200 new agents on the beat.\n  But, while this bill does a lot to ensure the safety of our \ncommunities, there is still work to be done. That is why I am pleased \nthat Chairman Mikulski and the ranking member supported our amendment, \nan amendment that doubles the funding for juvenile mentoring programs. \nThey care about that effort.\n  It is no secret that juvenile crime--particularly juvenile gang \nactivity--is a serious problem in this country. That is why Senator \nFeinstein and I worked so hard to pass the Gang Abatement and \nPrevention Act of 2007. One of the biggest problems contributing to \ngang activity and gang crime is a lack of direction and lack of \nsupervision in the lives of teens.\n  Nor is it a secret that providing good role models and more structure \nin the lives of teens has a significant impact in reducing gang \nactivity and violence. That is why we need to beef up our juvenile \nmentoring programs.\n  The Juvenile Mentoring Program was established in 1992 with the \nspecific goals of reducing juvenile delinquency and gang participation, \nimproving academic performance and reducing school drop out rates. \nPrograms funded under the Juvenile Mentoring Program initiative link \nat-risk children, particularly those living in high-crime areas and \nthose struggling in school, with responsible, working adults. These \nchildren receive the structure and support that is otherwise missing in \ntheir lives. They learn about the dangers of drug use, the perils of \ngang involvement, and the importance of staying in school. In other \nwords, programs like these provide children with the tools they need to \navoid the pitfalls of gangs and violence, to rise above the situation \nthey were born into, and to make a better life. I can think of no other \nprogram more deserving of increased funds and commend my colleagues for \nrecognizing this need and passing my amendment.\n\n  I want to mention the one difference I have with this bill, one that \nhas to do with a policy known around here as the Tiahrt Amendment.\n  No matter how many great programs we fund in this bill, no matter \nthat we doubled funding for the Juvenile Mentoring Program, we will \nnever successfully stop violence unless we work to combat the illegal \nuse of guns. Gun violence is one of the most serious problems facing \nour Nation. Every day on average, 81 more Americans will be shot dead--\nmany of them innocent victims, including children. This is \nunacceptable. But, it is even more unacceptable for us, as legislators, \nto allow it to continue.\n  But that is exactly what a provision in this bill does with its \nTiahrt provision. This provision could prevent the sharing of gun trace \ndata among law enforcement agencies. It will prevent the ATF from \nproviding trustworthy national data about the flow of crime guns. It \nwill make it harder to figure out where illegal gun activity is most \nprevalent and what we can do to stop it. Without this data, our state \nand local law enforcement will have a much harder time combating \nviolence in our communities and making us safe.\n  It should be a priority for all of us to better understand gun crime, \nso we can better prevent it. But with the Tiahrt provision, data that \nis essential to understanding gun trafficking and violence will be \nconcealed from law enforcement, concealed from lawmakers, and concealed \nfrom the public. There is simply no way to make good policy without \nhaving good information, good data to base it on.\n  When convicts get released from prison, we keep their fingerprints on \nfile. But when a gun gets confiscated, information about it gets \ntreated like a State secret. Police can share fingerprint data across \nstate lines, because criminals move across State lines. But under this \nbill, gun data has to be kept within a small geographic area.\n  I am very disappointed that this language has been included in the \nbill. But, it is a battle I will seek to fight with others on another \nday. And, be assured, I will.\n  As I said before, there is much for us to celebrate in this bill. And \nthere is more to celebrate having accepted my amendment to double the \nfunding for Juvenile Mentoring programs.\n  I look forward to supporting the Appropriations bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the junior Senator from Oklahoma. One of the items he seeks \nto eliminate funding for is the Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy \nSystem. This system has support from both the President and the \nCongress. To develop the system, the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office \npartnered with the National Park Service, National Geographic Society, \nConservation Fund, the Chesapeake Bay\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\nFoundation, Sultana, Verizon, and others to determine the requirements \nfor the interpretive buoy system.\n  These requirements defined needs for a new type of buoy, capable of \ncollecting environmental data--winds, waves, and currents--for users; \nwater quality data for monitoring the health of the bay; and a system \nfor communicating historical and cultural information through cell \nphone technology and shore-based computer networks to the public and \ninto the classroom.\n  These buoys are an innovative component of the U.S. Integrated Ocean \nObserving System, IOOS, a NOAA priority, which supports safety and \nefficiency of marine operations, public safety, studies of climate \nchange and variability, and protection and restoration of healthy \nmarine ecosystems. In addition to providing interpretive information--\nenvironmental, geographical, historical--to citizens of the watershed, \nthis system is part of the NOAA Education Program, developing and \ndelivering new science curriculum based on real-time environmental \nobservations to Chesapeake Bay classrooms, thus serving as a pilot for \nsimilar national programs.\n  The interpretive buoy system is a part of IOOS. IOOS is a priority \nboth in the President's Ocean Action Plan and for NOAA. CBIBS is a \ncomponent of the Chesapeake Bay Observing System, part of IOOS, \nproviding water quality measurements such as dissolved oxygen, \nsalinity, temperature, clarity, and chlorophyll content; wind speed and \ndirection, wave height and direction, air temperature, barometric \npressure, and relative humidity; and current velocity and direction \nfrom the surface to the bottom.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, being \n200 miles long. The width of the bay varies from 3.4 miles across to 35 \nmiles across, near the mouth of the Potomac River. The shoreline of the \nChesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries, including all tidal wetlands \nand islands, is over 11,600 miles. Until these buoys were deployed, \nNOAA weather forecasters only had one platform, Thomas Point Light, \nproviding measurements for daily forecasts for the bay. With these \nadditional real-time data sets, forecasters can better predict weather \nand water conditions on the bay supporting safety and efficiency of \nmarine operations, public safety, and marine navigation.\n  This congressionally designated project is not just a merit-based \nprogram. It is an especially economical one. We get multiple benefits \nfrom this single science platform in the bay. It is a worthwhile \nprogram and warrants our strong support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 3243 and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3240\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment. I have \nspoken at some length with the managers, and I will withdraw the \namendment, but I want to offer the amendment and talk about it because \nI have received from them assurances of cooperation on this issue. It \nis a very important issue. What I would like to do is ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside so that I might offer \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I call up amendment No. 3240 which is at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Tester, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n     Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 3240.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for crime control and methamphetamine \n              abuse projects for Indians, with an offset)\n\n         On page 27, line 8, strike ``$104,777,000'' and insert \n     ``$84,777,000''.\n         On page 54, strike lines 15 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n         (A) $25,000,000 shall be available for grants under \n     section 20109(b) of the 1994 Act (42 U.S.C. 13709(b));\n         On page 54, strike lines 20 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n         (C) $10,000,000 shall be available for demonstration \n     projects relating to alcohol and crime in Indian Country, of \n     which $5,000,000 shall be used to address the problem of \n     methamphetamine abuse in Indian Country;\n         On page 59, line 11, strike ``$35,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$40,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senators \nBingaman, Tester, Baucus, Cantwell, and Thune. This amendment deals \nwith the issue of the criminal justice systems on Indian reservations. \nBefore I talk about the amendment itself, I thank Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Shelby for the bill they have put together. The legislation \nthey bring to the floor from the Appropriations Subcommittee is an \nimportant and marked improvement on what the President has requested.\n  Let me describe what the President requested with respect to law \nenforcement activities on Indian reservations. Why is this important? \nBecause we have a trust responsibility on Indian reservations, and we \nare not meeting it. For the tribal jails discretionary grants program \nin the year 2000, there was $34 million; the President requested zero \nthis year. My colleagues, Senators Mikulski and Shelby appropriated $15 \nmillion. Tribal courts assistance, the same thing; tribal COPS, $40 \nmillion in the year 2000, zero in the Administration's 2008 request. \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Shelby restored that to $35 million. The \nlist goes on.\n  The question is this: Do we or do we not have a responsibility to \nfund these\n\n[[Page S12748]]\n\nlaw enforcement responsibilities that we have on Indian reservations? \nLast week my committee, the Indian Affairs Committee, heard testimony. \nLet me describe a bit of that testimony. A recent report shows that 34 \npercent of Indian women will be raped or sexually assaulted during \ntheir lifetimes. One-third of Indian women will be raped or assaulted \nduring their lifetimes. We heard from one retired Bureau of Indian \nAffairs police officer who worked on one of the Indian reservations: \n``We all knew they would only take cases with a confession. We were \njust too loaded down. We were forced to triage our cases.''\n  When this type of violence becomes commonplace, so commonplace that \nthe police have to triage rape cases, something is wrong. Somebody \nneeds to take action.\n  We had other testimony that the call to the police in an emergency, \nin a circumstance where there is a violent crime being committed or \njust was committed, in some cases it takes an hour or an hour and a \nquarter to receive a response from a law enforcement official.\n  There are fewer than 2,000 Federal and tribal law enforcement \nofficers who patrol more than 53 million acres of land. In North and \nSouth Dakota we have four police officers patrolling the 2.3 million \nacres of Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. Survivors of violent \ncrimes report waiting hours--in some cases days--for the police to \nrespond to their urgent calls.\n  The other issue is the lack of jail space, the lack of places to \nincarcerate violent criminals. Tribal jails face a $400 million backlog \nin funding. I have been to tribal jails. I have seen young kids lying \non the floors of these jails. The detention centers are unbelievably \ndeplorable, in many cases. One Federal official said that the lack of \ndetention facilities means that this whole system is a catch-and-\nrelease jail system. The law enforcement officials of the tribe catch \nthe criminals, and they are forced to release many of them right back \ninto the community to commit another crime.\n  We also heard testimony last week about the Indian reservations \nbecoming soft targets for criminal organizations because of this \nneglect. That is not the choice of the Indian tribes. The fact is, they \ndon't want this happening on the reservations. In May 2006, Federal \nofficials seized a methamphetamine business plan. It outlined how the \norganization wanted to replace alcohol abuse with meth abuse on the \nIndian reservation because these are the most vulnerable citizens. It \noutlined how non-American Indians should handle the drugs, and it \nexplained that tribal police couldn't arrest them while they are on the \nreservation. These stories are unbelievable. Again, a report that says \none-third of Indian women during their lifetime will be raped or \nsexually assaulted, and we don't have adequate law enforcement \nprotection.\n  We have a couple million American Indians living on reservations. The \nsystem that was established over a century ago was that the Federal \nGovernment was going to have the basic law enforcement responsibility, \nand we have not met it. We have not met our responsibilities in health \ncare, in education, in housing, and we have not met them in law \nenforcement.\n  I have described on this floor ad nauseum the situation with health \ncare. We have responsibilities for two groups of people for health \ncare. We have responsibility for every one we throw into a Federal \npenitentiary. They are our prisoners. We provide for their health care. \nWe have a trust responsibility for medical care for American Indians. \nThat is because that is a decision our country made a long time ago. We \nspend twice as much per person providing health care for Federal \nprisoners than we do to meet our obligation to provide health care for \nIndians. Many of these kids, many of the elders go wanting for health \ncare in a country like ours.\n  I am talking now not about health care or housing or education where \nwe have a full-blown crisis. I am talking about law enforcement, the \nbasics. If your life is not free from violence, you are always afraid. \nThe fact is, we have circumstances where we have inadequate jail space. \nWe have in many cases circumstances where violent crimes are committed, \nand yet they must be investigated by the FBI. They must be investigated \nby the U.S. Attorney's Office and prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. The fact is, resources do not exist. That is the problem.\n  My proposal is simple. My amendment was to increase the funding in \nthis legislation in two areas: one dealing with detention centers, and \nthat is an urgent situation that is in need of a response. In the \nsecond area we provide a grant program to be increased, as it properly \nshould, to deal with the issue of alcohol and methamphetamine. \nMethamphetamine is a scourge on Indian reservations. They are being \ntargeted by gangs and by organized crime. They are being targeted by \nnon-Indians. They don't have the law enforcement capability to take \ncare of it. The question is, are we going to do that?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3240, Withdrawn\n\n  My colleagues from Maryland and Alabama have been very helpful in \nsaying they are willing to work with me to increase these accounts and \nfind ways to fund these things. As a result, I will ask that my \namendment be withdrawn because we have made progress in commitments \nfrom those two legislators. I thank them. I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I look forward to working with them. In the next 5 or 6 \nmonths we are going to make some real progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from North Dakota. \nI have found his comments about those women being raped to be \ndevastating, and I know we are going to continue to work with him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3250\n\n  I now ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3250 be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3250) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby for the work they have done on the amendment that just passed. \nThis is a major step in the right direction to assure that America \nstays in the forefront of space technology, of the research, of the \nquality of life that we have gained from being the first in space. I \ncommend Senator Mikulski--I have so enjoyed working with her--and \nSenator Shelby for working with us in support of the amendment that was \njust added to the bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3233, as Modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the \nadoption of amendment No. 3233, it be modified with changes at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 70, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 217.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title--\n       (1) the amount appropriated in this title under the heading \n     ``General Administration'' is reduced by $10,000,000;\n       (2) the amount appropriated in this title under the heading \n     ``violence against women prevention and prosecution \n     programs'' under the heading ``Office on Violence Against \n     Women'' is increased by $10,000,000; and\n       (3) of the amount appropriated in this title under the \n     heading ``violence against women prevention and prosecution \n     programs'' under the heading ``Office on Violence Against \n     Women''--\n       (A) $5,000,000 is for grants to encourage arrest policies, \n     as authorized by part U of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796hh et seq.);\n       (B) $4,000,000 is for engaging men and youth in prevention \n     programs, as authorized by section 41305 of the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043d-4); and\n       (C) $1,000,000 is for the National Resource Center on \n     Workplace Responses to assist victims of domestic violence, \n     as authorized by section 41501 of the Violence Against Women \n     Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043f).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that all first-degree\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\namendments to H.R. 3093 must be filed at the desk by 2:30 p.m. Monday, \nOctober 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to say thank you to my \ncolleagues. I am so grateful. We have worked this thing pretty hard. It \nis right that NASA be given some of these funds they had to expend on \nan emergency basis for the recovery to flight of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia. I want the chairman and the ranking member to know how \nprofoundly grateful I am for their leadership in making this happen.\n  Now we have the challenge of going to the conference committee to \nmake it stick. I am so grateful for your leadership.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. We had this pressing amendment we needed to get \ndone, but the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Ohio have \nbeen very patient. I will now yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank you and commend the work of our \nsenior Senator from Maryland on this bill and so many others. I \nappreciate her hard work on this bill and giving us this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3256\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I call up amendment No. 3256 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Casey], for Mr. Biden, \n     for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kerry, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Casey, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cardin, \n     Mr. Reed, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3256.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $110,000,000 for community \n   oriented policing services and to provide a full offset for such \n                                amount)\n\n       On page 57, line 7, strike ``$550,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$660,000,000''.\n       On page 60, line 2, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through ``Funds'' on line 3, and insert the following:\n       (12) $110,000,000 is for grants under section 1701 of title \n     I of the 1968 Act (42 U.S.C. 3796dd) for the hiring and \n     rehiring of additional career law enforcement officers under \n     part Q of such title, notwithstanding subsection (i) of such \n     section; and\n       (13)\n       On page 97, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       Of the unobligated balances made available for the \n     Department of Justice in prior fiscal years, $110,000,000 are \n     rescinded.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator Biden, who \ncannot be here today, and I join him in offering an amendment to \nprovide funding for hiring more officers for the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services Program, or what is known popularly as the COPS \nProgram.\n  Joining us on this amendment are Senators Mikulski, Kohl, Bingaman, \nClinton, Kerry, Levin, Kennedy, Bayh, Cantwell, Boxer, Schumer, Dodd, \nCollins, Cardin, Reed of Rhode Island, and Nelson of Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senators Lautenberg \nand Klobuchar be added as cosponsors, as well as Senator Whitehouse \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CASEY. I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like the Senator from Vermont to \nalso be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Leahy, be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the COPS Program was created in 1994, known \nthen as the Biden crime bill, in response to historically high rates of \ncrime. Over 100,000 community policing officers were hired to work the \nstreets of communities across America.\n  This successful program not only increases the number of police \nofficers on the street to fight crime but also emphasizes building \ncollaboration and partnership between the community and law enforcement \nso we can prevent crime in addition to fighting crime. Crime was driven \ndown from all-time highs to historic lows. It stayed low until about 2 \nyears ago, when budgetary cuts by this administration began to show up \nin rising crime statistics.\n  Data released this week from the FBI shows that violent crime has \nincreased again for the second year in a row. Philadelphia is one of \nseveral cities that is experiencing severe problems with violence. \nAlthough the crime increases of the past 2 years may be characterized \nby some as minor, they are alarming because they follow a steady 10-\nyear decline in crime rates across the country.\n  Why is this alarming increase in effect? Well, some researchers and \nexperts predict that the uptick in crime rates are in part due to the \nadministration's budget cuts. In recent years, billions in Federal \nfunding for State and local law enforcement have been cut--including \nthe near complete elimination of the COPS hiring program.\n  As a result, once again crime is rising across the Nation. The latest \nFBI crime reports showed a 1.9-percent increase in violent crime. This \nis the first 2-year increase in crime rates since the COPS Program was \nfirst created and hiring was funded. It is no coincidence that when \nCongress funded COPS, crime went down, but when the administration \neliminated the COPS hiring program, crime began to rise.\n  I would argue that if the President of the United States can find \nbillions for tax breaks for wealthy Americans, he should be able to \nfind funds for putting police on the streets of America.\n  Independent studies have verified the effectiveness of the COPS \nProgram. The GAO found a statistical link between the COPS Program \ngrants and reductions in violent crime. The Brookings Institute \nreported that COPS is one of the most cost-effective options for \nfighting crime. They found it saves lives and saves money.\n  So it is critical that Congress funds not only priorities overseas \nbut here at home. Rising crime is an alarming and complex problem. \nThere is no one solution, but having more cops on the street is part of \nthe solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Biden and our numerous \ncosponsors in increasing funding for this critical program that will \nprovide us with more law enforcement on the streets and greater safety \nin our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3218\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Limitation on Negotiating Trade Agreements.--None \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this \n     Act may be used in a manner that is inconsistent with the \n     principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws to preserve the ability of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to enforce vigorously its trade laws, including \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) to avoid agreements that--\n       (A) lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international \n     disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping and \n     subsidies; or\n       (B) lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international \n     safeguard provisions, in order to ensure that United States \n     workers, agricultural producers, and firms can compete\n\n[[Page S12751]]\n\n     fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of reciprocal \n     trade concessions; and\n       (3) to address and remedy market distortions that lead to \n     dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, \n     cartelization, and market-access barriers.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland for her work, especially today, on much of what she has \ndone, but especially for what she did on NASA earlier today that will \nmatter to northern Ohio, my whole State, and to much of the rest of \nthis country.\n  I rise, quickly, to offer an amendment that will help America's \nmanufacturers compete on even terms with foreign manufacturers.\n  American manufacturing, for generations, has been a tremendous source \nof pride for our country and a ladder to the middle class for our \nworking families.\n  American manufacturing fuels our economy and supplies our national \ndefense infrastructure. It would be dangerous, on many levels, for our \ncountry to ignore the anticompetitive forces that are buffeting our \nmanufacturing sector. It would be, and it is.\n  Over the last several years, American manufacturing has faltered and \nmillions of jobs have been lost. In my home State of Ohio, well over \n200,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the last half decade or \nso--from Steubenville to Lima and from Cleveland to Dayton.\n  Workers and manufacturers in all our States find it increasingly \ndifficult to compete in today's global markets, where the odds are \nstacked against them because of unfair trade practices.\n  American industry can compete with anyone in the world when it is a \nfair fight.\n  Our international trade laws are intended to secure a level playing \nfield, but, unfortunately, some of our trading partners have repeatedly \nfound ways to circumvent these laws to gain an unfair advantage against \nworkers in the United States. This has led to recordbreaking trade \ndeficits, which threaten the long-term health of our economy, and \nmassive job losses, which have wreaked havoc on the middle class.\n  Some foreign governments, for example, have unfairly and illegally \ndoled out massive subsidies to their own companies and others willing \nto reestablish offshore, contributing to the migration of manufacturing \njobs overseas and artificial price advantages for imported products.\n  Despite evidence that something is very wrong, you can look at job \nloss figures, deficit figures, outsourcing figures or offshoring \nfigures. Our Government has chosen not to aggressively enforce U.S. \ntrade remedy laws. It has also failed to successfully advocate for U.S. \ninterests in the multilateral dispute settlement setting.\n  The WTO has issued a series of decisions striking down the practice \nknown as zeroing in U.S. antidumping proceedings. Zeroing is a \nmethodology employed for measuring and remedying unfair foreign \ndumping--the practice of selling products in the United States at below \n``fair value,'' which corrupts free market competition and undermines \nU.S. industries.\n  Zeroing, a practice our Government has used for more than 80 years, \nhas been upheld by U.S. courts and the GATT and is recognized as good \npolicy because it combats unfair dumping.\n  The WTO's decisions threaten to create an enormous loophole in trade \nlaw enforcement. This affects industries and local economies throughout \nour country--not just steel, not just paper, so many things. The WTO \ndecisions on issues such as zeroing is an overreach.\n  The USTR must work harder to overturn the recent European and \nJapanese zeroing decisions in negotiations and delay full \nimplementation of the Japanese decision until, at a minimum, other \nmethodologies are in place to capture 100 percent of dumping.\n  If the WTO continues to target U.S. trade remedy laws, we need to \nfight back. The administration's lack of backbone is unacceptable. This \namendment is a modest reminder to the administration that we need to \nvigorously enforce our trade laws.\n  I urge my colleagues to give it their support.\n\n\n                          Aeronautics Research\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Mikulski, in a colloquy about the importance of \naeronautics funding. The chairwoman is aware that both Senator Warner \nand I have serious concerns about decreased funding for aeronautics. \nTogether we look forward to working with the Appropriations Committee \nto ensure adequate funding for important aeronautics research programs \nin Virginia.\n  Aeronautics research programs have been essential to our economic and \nmilitary security for decades. Think about the millions of people who \nfly every year and the countless jobs and communities that have been \naffected by this research. From the days of the first flight of the \nWright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, NC, to the modern-day aviation industry \ntoday that represents millions of jobs and contributes billions of \ndollars to our economy, our country has been served well by the \ninvestments we have made in aeronautics research. That history, \nhowever, and our present are at a crossroads.\n  The advances made possible by Government-funded research in emerging \naeronautics technologies have enabled long-standing military air \nsuperiority for the United States in recent decades. The vast majority \nof military aircraft design the U.S. military currently flies \nincorporate advanced technologies developed at NASA Research Centers. \nAs a result, it is important for NASA's cooperative research efforts \nwith the Department of Defense regarding military aviation technologies \nare maintained at a healthy funding level. A national effort is needed \nto ensure that NASA can meet the civil and military needs in the \nfuture.\n  This issue came up when the Senate debated the budget for the 2008 \nfiscal year. In 2007, Congress provided $717 million for aeronautics \nresearch, in cost-adjusted numbers. I know Senator Warner and I are \nvery thankful that the Appropriations Committee was able to provide \nthis funding. Yet the administration proposed, in their fiscal year \n2008 budget, only $554 million for aeronautics. In an age of increased \nglobal competition from Europe, China, and other nations, this decision \nis alarming.\n  We appreciate the demands faced by Chairman Mikulski and Ranking \nMember Shelby on funding all the programs under their subcommittee's \npurview. However, as I noted in March during the budget debate, and I \nrepeat that message today, aeronautics research is essential for the \nUnited States to maintain its advantage in aeronautics technologies and \nair superiority within the military. It is essential to inspiring a new \ngeneration of children who one day might make a career in aviation, \nengineering, computer modeling and simulation.\n  It is also important that Congress supports NASA Administrator's \nobjective of 10 Healthy Centers, especially ensuring the well-being of \nits four research centers, which are scheduled to face significant \nbudget decreases in the outyears. These research centers have cutting-\nedge facilities that are operated and maintained by highly respected \nscientists. Over the years, they have produced outstanding basic \nresearch, especially in aeronautics, which is then utilized by the \nprivate sector to make significant advancements in the space and \naeronautics industries.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The committee recognizes the importance of aeronautics \nresearch and NASA's 10 Healthy Centers effort. We share your concern \nabout the steady decline in budget requests for aeronautics research. \nWe will work with you to ensure this critical and historical strength \nof NASA is funded at a level sufficient to maintain our country's \ncompetitive edge in aeronautics.\n\n\n                     Plant Genome Research Program\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the distinguished chair of the subcommittee \nand I have long been strong supporters of plant genomics in general and \nthe Plant Genome Research Program undertaken at the NSF in particular. \nThe Plant Genome Research Program produces basic scientific research by \nproviding for peer-reviewed competitive research grants to qualified \ninstitutions. Maintaining significant support for fundamental research \nin crop systems is more important than ever as agriculture is trying to \nmeet the demands of consumers worldwide by providing a safe and secure \nsupply of resources for human and animal nutrition, fiber, green \nproducts, bioenergy,\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\nand plant-based nutraceuticals and other leading edge applications. \nThis initiative has had strong backing over the years from the broad-\nbased science community in conjunction with farmers and those up the \nfood supply chain.\n  Together, as leaders of the VA/HUD and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee, we began this initiative in 1997. It remains critical \nthat we protect the integrity of the program and ensure its remains a \npriority at the NSF.\n  Is it the expectation of the subcommittee that the Plant Genome \nResearch Program is funded at no less than $100 million?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Further, is it the expectation of the subcommittee that \nfunding for the Arabadopsis 2010 program continue to be financed \nthrough the BIO directorate, yet separate from funds provided for the \nplant genome project as it has in the past?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, that is my expectation. I appreciate \nyour long standing support of plant genomics and will work to see that \nthese important programs continue to receive support as they have in \nthe past.\n\n\n                         Electronic Prescribing\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \ndistinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and \nScience Appropriations, Ms. Mikulski, in a colloquy concerning the e-\nprescribing of controlled substances. Would the chairman and manager of \nthe bill entertain a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. As she knows, I \nam a profound believer in the potential of health information \ntechnology to revolutionize the way we deliver health care in this \ncountry. The potential for better coordinated care, reduced medical \nerrors, increased patient satisfaction, and enhanced patient peace of \nmind is enormous. It is also worth noting that several well-respected \norganizations estimate annual savings near $80 billion.\n  Unfortunately, we have been unable, as a nation, to develop an \ninteroperable, integrated health information infrastructure the way we \nwere able to do with our highway system or our railroad tracks. This is \nthe result of a variety of barriers that we, as legislators, have a \nresponsibility to tackle if we are going to take this necessary step to \nimprove health care in this Nation. One of those barriers is the \ncurrent prohibition by the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, on the \nelectronic prescribing of controlled substances.\n  This ban requires physicians who e-prescribe to maintain two separate \nsystems: an electronic system for noncontrolled substances and a paper \nsystem for controlled substances. This is an excessive encumbrance for \ndoctors who are trying to do the right thing for their patients--an \nencumbrance that has unfortunately led many overburdened doctors to \ngive up electronic prescribing altogether. This is a travesty.\n  As a former attorney general and a former U.S. attorney, I am \nsensitive to the prosecutorial concerns of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration. But CMS has been working without success for years with \nthe DEA to resolve their differences on this issue. Apparently, the DEA \nrefuses to budge. I would like to know why. Billion-dollar transactions \nare done electronically; highly classified national security \ninformation travels electronically; military attack aircraft are \ntargeted electronically. I would say to the DEA: Please do not tell me \nwe cannot figure out a way for a doctor to prescribe Vicodin \nelectronically. I think we need to demand a joint report from CMS and \nthe DEA laying out a way, or ways, to overcome this hurdle, to be \ncompleted at the earliest practicable date but no later than 1 month \nafter the date of enactment. In the absence of the DEA changing the \nrules, we must seek a statutory solution to this problem. Considering \nthe extraordinary potential of e-prescribing, we have to break this \nlogjam.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the chairman if she would work with me to \nensure that CMS and the DEA will work together to propose a reasonable \napproach soon to allow the electronic prescribing of controlled \nsubstances?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland that it is my intention to do just that. I agree that a joint \nreport between the DEA and CMS will help us move forward in this \ncrucial area of health information technology and bring down a serious \nbarrier to improved patient care.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of Senator \nMikulski in ensuring appropriate funding for the many critical \nactivities under the auspices of the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nspending bill.\n  I also commend my colleagues, Senators Whitehouse and Kennedy, for \ntheir leadership in the critically important arena of health \ninformation technology, IT. Without their diligent work, the promises \nof health IT to reduce costs and improve quality of care would be very \ndistant indeed.\n  Even with their dedication and that of many other colleagues, we have \nour work set out for us as we seek to accelerate the adoption of health \nIT. The Democratic steering committee heard yesterday from leaders on \nall aspects of health information technology--representing consumers, \nhealth care providers, business, insurers, labor, and others. All share \nan appreciation for what health IT can do to manage costs and ensure \nthat patients get the care they need, at the right time, and in the \nbest setting.\n  Yet they also expressed a shared sense of the need for Federal \nleadership and legislation to remove barriers to the adoption of health \nIT. These barriers include a misalignment of incentives and inadequate \nfunding, the lack of standards adoption, and privacy and security \nconcerns. Some of these barriers are large and will take all of us \nworking together to find solutions. I am committed to doing so and look \nforward to working with my colleagues this Congress toward that goal.\n  There are also some barriers that should be easy to remove, and we \nmust do so this year. One of those is the current U.S. Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, prohibition on the electronic transmission of \nprescriptions for controlled substances, schedules II-V.\n  We know that e-prescribing saves lives, prevents injury, improves \npatient care outcomes, is more efficient, and saves health care \ndollars. One amazing statistic: According to the Center for Information \nTechnology Leadership, CITL, e-prescribing systems with a network \nconnection to pharmacy and advanced decision support capabilities can \nhelp avoid more than 2 million adverse drug events, ADEs, annually--\n130,000 of which are life-threatening.\n  It is important to note that some of the most dangerous drug \ninteractions can occur with and between controlled substances. \nPreventing them from being processed electronically also prevents a \nphysician's ability to do a computer drug interaction check to avoid \nwhat could be a fatal interaction.\n  Additionally, although the schedule II-V drugs account for only 12 to \n15 percent of all prescriptions, the prohibition affects a much larger \npercentage of prescriptions for a very simple reason: of the relatively \nsmall number of physicians who have tried to move to electronic \nprescribing, some are giving it up entirely because they are prohibited \nfrom using it for all drugs. Physicians need to be able to use one \nmeans to write all prescriptions. If they must shift from electronic to \npaper depending on the patient or depending on which drug a particular \npatient needs, the confusion and extra time become too large a barrier \nto electronic prescribing. The result is a return to paper prescribing, \nand increased costs, increased errors, and worse health outcomes.\n  The prohibition on e-prescribing of controlled substances not only \nhas a ripple effect in that it deters e-prescribing of all medicines, \nbut it may deter adoption of electronic medical records in general. \nElectronic prescribing is the first step to adoption of full electronic \nmedical records; if doctors can't efficiently adopt the process of \nwriting prescriptions electronically, they are less likely to adopt \nelectronic medical records.\n  The widespread adoption of electronic medical records could save up \nto $100 billion annually. Given the fact that health care will soon \nconsume 20 percent of our country's gross domestic\n\n[[Page S12753]]\n\nproduct, and yet we have 47 million uninsured Americans and the highest \ninfant mortality and lowest life expectancy of any other industrialized \nnation, we must do whatever we can to encourage adoption of electronic \nprescribing and electronic medical records, not keep in place policies \nthat deter adoption.\n  I understand and appreciate that the DEA has a very important law \nenforcement function and needs to have the tools to enforce the laws \nand prosecute law breakers. However, electronic prescribing is not a \nbarrier to that. The systems that have been used for years to transmit \nprescriptions electronically are secure and auditable. In fact, \nelectronic prescribing will not only help enforcement but will create \nnew opportunities to prevent abuse of controlled substances. Existing \ne-prescribing processes are actually more secure than written \nprescriptions. Banking transactions have been conducted for years \nelectronically, and authorities have been able to prosecute people who \nmisuse the technology. I am confident we can do the same with respect \nto any misuse regarding controlled substances.\n  I know that the DEA has acknowledged that e-prescribing offers many \nbenefits and has considered ways to allow the electronic transmission \nof controlled substance prescriptions. And I know that DEA and Health \nand Human Services held a public meeting last year to begin to address \nthis issue. That was a great first step, but progress has been very \nslow and now we need to solve this problem in a way that realizes the \nbenefits of health IT, is secure, scalable within the industry, and \nthat protects the DEA's interests.\n  One relatively easy fix may be to simply amend the Controlled \nSubstances Act to permit electronic prescribing. There may be other \nways to address the problem, and I am open to discussing those. What is \ncritical is that we find a way to allow e-prescribing for all \nmedications soon--every day we delay, the cost in dollars and lives \ngrows. We need incentives to encourage adoption of e-prescribing, not \nroadblocks to adoption. Increased use of electronic prescribing will \nincrease patient compliance, improve health outcomes, reduce medication \nerrors, and reduce health care costs.\n  It is my sense that DEA should not invest additional resources in \npursuing plans to allow e-prescribing of controlled substances through \nmeasures that are unnecessarily high in cost and complexity.\n  I join my colleagues in urging DEA to quickly adopt rules allowing \nelectronic prescribing of controlled substances that rely on the high \nlevel of security built into the existing e-prescribing infrastructure \nand are deemed workable by all stakeholders.\n  Absent a timely adoption of such DEA rules, I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to find a solution to the prohibition on electronic \nprescribing of certain medicines this year.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions is here, and I would appreciate his \ncomments on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \ndrawing our attention to this barrier in the advancement of electronic \nprescribing. The use of electronic prescribing technologies offers an \nopportunity to improve health care outcomes by reducing medication \nerrors and improving patient compliance with physician orders and \nscreening for dangerous drug-drug interactions. Physicians and \npharmacies in Massachusetts have begun to adopt e-prescribing and \npatients are benefiting. Massachusetts was recently recognized as the \nState with the highest volume of electronic prescriptions per capita. \nElectronic prescribing systems offer security advantages beyond those \navailable through a paper-based system by requiring user authentication \nand generating an audit trail of prescriptions submitted to pharmacies. \nCreating a method by which controlled substances can be safely and \nsecurely prescribed electronically will encourage physicians' adoption \nof the technology. I support the Senator from Rhode Island's proposal \nfor a joint report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to evaluate how electronic \nprescribing of controlled substances can be safely achieved. I also \nurge the Drug Enforcement Agency to adopt rules allowing controlled \nsubstances to be electronically prescribed and in the absence of such \nrules look forward to working with my colleagues to address the issue \nlegislatively.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am committed to working with the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the Senator from Michigan, and the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee to solve this problem.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and all my \ncolleagues for their help on this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted to table an amendment offered \nby Senator Coburn to H.R. 3093, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008, which would have shifted \nfunding to the Civil Rights Division within the U.S. Department of \nJustice for the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil rights \ncases.\n  I share Senator Coburn's fervent and sincere desire to solve these \nghastly crimes. However, I do not believe that his amendment would \nachieve this important task. Instead, the Senate should consider and \npass S. 535, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. I am a \ncosponsor of this bill, which would commit the resources of the U.S. \nGovernment to investigating and prosecuting racially motivated murders \nthat occurred on or before December 31, 1969. The bill designates an \nofficial within the U.S. Department of Justice, and another within the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, to investigate, prosecute, and \ncoordinate the investigations of civil rights violations that occurred \nprior to 1970 and resulted in a death.\n  There is an urgent need for the Congress to enact this measure. Given \nthe advanced age of defendants and potential witnesses, there remains \nonly a small window of opportunity in which to solve these cases. \nUltimately, the purpose of this bill is to provide justice to the \nfamilies of those who were murdered for racially motivated reasons \nprior to 1970. The bill expresses the sense of Congress that all \nauthorities with jurisdiction, including the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and other entities within the U.S. Department of Justice, \nshould expeditiously investigate unsolved civil rights murders, and \nprovide the resources necessary to ensure timely and thorough \ninvestigations in the cases involved.\n  The families of the victims of these heinous crimes deserve no less. \nIt is my hope that this bill, which has been approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, will soon be voted upon and passed by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12753-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12753-S12761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JENNIFER WALKER ELROD TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 302, as under the \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jennifer \nWalker Elrod, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes \nunder the time of Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination Of Richard A. Jones\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored to come to the floor today \nto speak on behalf of Richard Jones. He is a distinguished lawyer and a \nKing County Superior Court judge from my home State. He is a man who \nenjoys broad bipartisan support, and he deserves a seat on the Federal \nbench.\n  President Bush nominated Judge Jones to be a district court judge for \nthe Western District of Washington State. He is an excellent choice. I \nam very proud to be here this afternoon to support him, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support him as well.\n  If you were to ask lawyers or judges in my home State about Judge \nJones,\n\n[[Page S12754]]\n\nsome of the descriptions you would hear are, ``He is admired by \neveryone in the justice system.'' ``He gives respect, and he gets \nrespect.'' ``The test of one's performance is the way they handle the \nsmaller cases. Richard displays precisely that same degree of \nsensitivity to all who appear before him.''\n  The Seattle Times described this nomination by saying:\n\n       This is a lifetime appointment with no room for mistakes, \n     and we believe there is no mistake here.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Judge Jones has handled some of the most \ndifficult cases in western Washington in the past decade and he has won \nthe respect of everyone who has come before him. He presided over the \nsentencing of Gary Ridgway, who was known as the ``Green River \nKiller.'' Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated first-\ndegree murder in 2003 and is one of the most prolific serial killers in \nAmerican history. That would be a tough case for any judge, but Judge \nJones earned praise for the sensitivity and dignity he showed for the \nvictims of the Green River killer.\n  As a result of that case--and in recognition of his long service to \nWashington State--in 2004, Judge Jones received the ``Judge of the Year \nAward'' from the Asian Bar Association of Washington, from the King \nCounty Bar Association, from the Washington State Bar Association, and \nfrom the Washington State Trial Lawyers Association.\n  Judge Jones has also been praised by his peers for handling cases far \nout of the media spotlight with the same care and attention. Both \nSenator Cantwell and I assisted the President in choosing Judge Jones \nfrom a list of very qualified candidates. When I met him, I was so \nimpressed with his sensitivity, his professionalism, and his overall \nsense of fairness. Throughout his career, Judge Jones has won high \npraise for his judicial demeanor and for the respect he shows all \nparties.\n  In the courtroom, Judge Jones is known for making articulate and \npowerful statements that make clear where he stands. He clearly meets \nthe standards of fairness, evenhandedness, and adherence to the law we \nall expect from our Federal judges.\n  In his personal background, he graduated from Seattle University and \nthe University of Washington School of Law. In private practice, \nRichard Jones successfully represented both plaintiffs and defendants \nin a variety of civil cases. As a State and a Federal prosecutor, he \nhad extensive experience prosecuting criminal cases. Most recently, as \na full-time King County Superior Court judge, Richard Jones has \ndistinguished himself and won broad support.\n  In addition to all of those professional responsibilities, Judge \nJones also has been deeply involved in community activities. He served \nas a YMCA board member and mentored minority youths. He has worked in \nthe community to expand opportunities for students to pursue legal \ncareers by supporting youth-oriented legal programs. Judge Jones has \nshown a commitment to the people of his community, and that is one of \nthe reasons why they have shown a commitment to him. Since he was first \nappointed in 1994, the voters of King County have reelected him three \ntimes. I know I speak on behalf of a large number of people in my \nState's legal and law enforcement community in saying that our Federal \nbench will be stronger with Richard Jones.\n  It is my pleasure to be here on the floor this afternoon to support \nhis nomination. He has garnered bipartisan support in my State, and I \nam confident that his record of fair and unbiased service will earn him \na bipartisan vote on the floor of the Senate today. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have nominations before us for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench of Jennifer Walker Elrod of the Fifth \nCircuit, Roslynn Renee Mauskopf for the Eastern District of New York, \nRichard Jones for the Western District of Washington, and Sharion \nAycock for the Northern District of Mississippi.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered on any of these, have they?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the nomination of Ms. Elrod has been \nreported.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But no request has been made for the yeas and nays; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the interest of my colleagues, I do not \nanticipate--I do not intend to ask for the yeas and nays on any of \nthese. I have discussed this with the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, and I believe I am authorized to speak \nfor him that he is not going to be requesting the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Would my distinguished chairman yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. As you know, I am going to be opposing the nomination of \nJennifer Walker Elrod, but I will not be seeking a record vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland. I know he is going to be speaking on that nomination and \nstating his reasons for opposition, but I wanted it known by both \nleaders that I will not be requesting a rollcall vote on any of these. \nI see the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi is on the floor \nand I have advised him of that also.\n  The Senate continues, as we have all year, to make progress filling \njudicial vacancies when the White House will work with us. The \nnominations before us today for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench are Jennifer Walker Elrod for the Fifth Circuit, Roslynn Renee \nMauskopf for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Jones for the \nWestern District of Washington, and Sharion Aycock for the Northern \nDistrict of Mississippi. They each have the support of both home State \nSenators. I thank Senators Murray, Cantwell, Cochran, Lott, Hutchinson, \nCornyn, Schumer and Clinton for their work in connection with these \nnominations.\n\n  The progress we have made this year in considering and confirming \njudicial nominations is sometimes lost amid the partisan sniping over \nthe most controversial nominations.\n  If the nominations we consider today are confirmed, the Senate will \nhave already confirmed 33 nominations for lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench this session alone. That is more judicial nominations \nthan were confirmed in all of 2005 or 2006 with a Republican majority. \nIt is 16 more confirmations than were achieved during the entire 1996 \nsession, nearly doubling that session's total of 17, when Republicans \nstalled consideration of President Clinton's nominations.\n  Judge Elrod would be the Fourth Circuit court nominee confirmed so \nfar this year. That is more than the number of President Clinton's \ncircuit court nominations confirmed by this time in 1999 with a \nRepublican-led Senate and four more than the Republican-led Senate \nconfirmed in the entire 1996 session. That was the session in which not \na single circuit court nominee was confirmed. That is more than were \nconfirmed in all of 1993 and equals the total in 1983.\n  If the nominations are confirmed today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 21 circuit court nominations and 133 total Federal judicial \nnominees in my tenure as Judiciary chairman. During the Bush \nPresidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--more total \njudges--have been confirmed in the first 24 months that I served as \nJudiciary chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the two \nRepublican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  Today, we consider a nominee to the Fifth Circuit. During the Clinton \nadministration several outstanding nominees to the Fifth Circuit were \npocket filibustered. They included Judge Jorge Rangel of Texas, Enrique \nMoreno of Texas and Alston Johnson of Louisiana. They were pocket \nfilibustered without a hearing or committee consideration. In contrast, \nthe Judiciary Committee has proceeded with this nomination.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 44 judicial \nvacancies after today's confirmations. The President has sent us only \n20 nominations for these remaining vacancies. Twenty-four of these \nvacancies--more than half--have no nominee. Of the 16 vacancies deemed \nby the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President \nhas yet to send us nominees for half of them. Of the 15 circuit court\n\n[[Page S12755]]\n\nvacancies, 6--more than a third--are without a nominee. If the \nPresident would decide to work with the Senators from Michigan, Rhode \nIsland, Maryland, California, New Jersey, and Virginia, we could be in \nposition to make even more progress.\n  We have helped cut the circuit vacancies from a high mark of 32 in \nthe early days of this administration, to as few as 13. Contrast that \nwith the Republican-led Senate's lack of action on President Clinton's \nmoderate and qualified nominees that resulted in increasing circuit \nvacancies during the Clinton years from 17 to 26. During those years, \nthe Republican-led Senate engaged in strenuous and successful efforts \nunder the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a \nRepublican President.\n  More than 60 percent of current circuit court judges were appointed \nby Republican Presidents, with the current President having appointed \nmore than 30 percent of the active circuit judges already.\n  Two of the vacancies being filled today are categorized by the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts as judicial emergency \nvacancies. With these confirmations we will have proceeded to fill 18 \nsuch vacancies this year.\n  Jennifer Walker Elrod is a judge on the 190th District Court for \nHarris County, TX, a position she has held since 2002. A native of Port \nArthur, TX, and a graduate of Baylor University and Harvard Law School, \nJudge Elrod clerked for Judge Sim Lake on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Texas and spent 8 years in private practice at \nBaker Botts before joining the bench.\n  Roslynn Renee Mauskopf has served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York since her 2002 appointment by President Bush. Ms. \nMauskopf received her B.A. from Brandeis and her law degree from \nGeorgetown before spending 13 years as assistant district attorney in \nthe New York County District Attorney's Office and serving a stint as \nNew York State's inspector general.\n  Richard Anthony Jones has been a judge on the King County Superior \nCourt since 1994. Previously, Judge Jones, a graduate of Seattle \nUniversity and the University of Washington School of Law, served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Western District of Washington, staff \nattorney for the Port of Seattle, and deputy prosecuting attorney for \nKing County, also spending 6 years in private practice at Bogle and \nGates.\n  Sharion Aycock has been a state trial judge on the First Circuit \nCourt District in Tupelo, MS, since 2003. A native of Tupelo, MS, Judge \nAycock, who received her B.A. from Mississippi State University and her \nJ.D. from Mississippi College School of Law, served for 8 years as \nItawamba County prosecuting attorney, and spent time in private \npractice in Mississippi as a solo practitioner and at law firms.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday.\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported dozens of measures to the Senate \nthat await action, from privacy legislation to war profiteering \nlegislation to court legislation, all on a bipartisan basis. Yet we are \nstalled on several important matters.\n  I have spoken before of the Republican objection to our going to \nconference to finish work on the Court Security Improvement Act, S. \n378, which the committee reported to the Senate back in March. We had \nto overcome a filibuster just to consider it. It ultimately passed the \nSenate 97 to zero. We are being prevented from going to conference to \nresolve differences with the House by Republican objection.\n  I have spoken before about the War Profiteering Prevention Act, S. \n119, what has been stalled for months by unspecified Republican \nobjections.\n  I have spoken before about the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrimes Act, S. 535. It was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee, yet a Republican Senator objected to Senate passage this \nweek.\n  Similarly there is a modest bill to extend temporary judgeships in \nfive districts, S. 1327. That simple bill is likewise being prevented \nfrom passage by a Republican objection.\n  Today, I want to focus on another important measure, the School \nSafety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act.\n  Two months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee originated the School \nSafety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007, a legislative \npackage that responds to the tragic deaths that occurred this past \nApril on the campus of Virginia Tech. We tried to show deference to \nGovernor Kaine and the task forces at work in Virginia and to \ncomplement their work and recommendations. Working with several \nSenators, including Senators Boxer, Reed, Specter, Feingold, Schumer, \nand Durbin, the Committee originated this bill and reported it before \nthe commencement of the academic year in the hope that the full Senate \ncould pass these critical school safety improvements this fall.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, Senator Schumer and I have tried separately to \npass the component of the bill designed to fix flaws in the Nation's \nbackground check system. Regrettably, our efforts were blocked by a \nsingle Senator.\n  I do not think the Senate should continue to stand by and wait for \nthe next horrific school tragedy to make the critical changes necessary \nto insure safety in our schools and on our college campuses. Risks of \nschool violence will not go away just because Congress may shift its \nfocus. In just the last few weeks we have seen tragedy at Delaware \nState and Memphis, as well as incidents in California and New York. I \nurge the Senate to move aggressively with the comprehensive school \nsafety legislation.\n  It includes background check improvements together with other \nsensible yet effective safety improvement measures supported by law \nenforcement across the country. Accordingly, I urge the Senate to take \nup and swiftly pass S. 2084. If we are prohibited by objection from \ndoing so by unanimous consent, then let us move to it and let those \nwith objections seek to amend those provisions to which they object.\n  There are too many incidents at too many colleges and schools \nnationwide. This terrorizes students and their parents. We should be \ndoing what we can to help. Just this past week, a troubled student \nwearing a Fred Flintstone mask and carrying a rifle through campus was \narrested at St. John's University in Queens, NY, prompting authorities \nto lock down the campus for 3 hours.\n  The next day, an armed 17-year-old on the other side of the country \nin Oroville, CA, held students hostage at Las Plumas High School, which \nalso resulted in a lock-down. The students in these situations escaped \nwith their lives.\n  University of Memphis student Taylor Bradford was not so lucky. He \nwas killed on campus this past Sunday morning in what university \nofficials believe was a targeted attack. He was 21 years old. Shalita \nMiddleton and Nathaniel Pew were not so lucky. They were both wounded \nduring an incident at Delaware State and are still hospitalized from \nthe gun shot wounds with Ms. Middleton still in serious condition. They \nare each only 17 years old.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act responds \ndirectly to incidents like these by squarely addressing the problem of \nviolence in our schools in several ways. The bill enlists the States as \npartners in the dissemination of critical information by making \nsignificant improvements to the National Instant Background Check \nSystem, known as the NICS system. The bill also authorizes Federal \nassistance for programs to improve the safety and security of our \nschools and institutions of higher education, provides equitable \nbenefits to law enforcement serving those institutions, and funds pilot \nprograms to develop cutting-edge prevention and intervention programs \nfor our schools. The bill also clarifies and strengthens 2 existing \nstatutes--the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act--which are designed to improve public safety.\n  Specifically, title I would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level, and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced in April, and I want to thank \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this issue. The improvements include \nincreased funding for much-needed infrastructure changes to improve \nsecurity as well as the establishment of hotlines and tip-lines, which\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\nwill enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to \nschool administrators before they occur.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety, title I also creates a \nmatching grant program for campus safety and security to be \nadministered out of the COPS Office of the Department of Justice.\n  The grant program would allow institutions of higher education to \napply, for the first time, directly for Federal funds to make school \nsafety and security improvements. The program is authorized to be \nappropriated at $50,000,000 for the next 2 fiscal years. While this \namounts to just $3 per student each year, it will enable schools to \nmore effectively respond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  Title II of the bill seeks to improve the NICS system. The senseless \nloss of life at Virginia Tech revealed deep flaws in the transfer of \ninformation relevant to gun purchases between the States and the \nFederal Government. The defects in the current system permitted the \nperpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain a firearm even though a \njudge had declared him to be a danger to himself and thus ineligible \nunder Federal law.\n  Seung-Hui Cho was not eligible to buy a weapon given his mental \nhealth history, but he was still able to pass a background check \nbecause data was missing from the system. We are working to close gaps \nin the NICS system. Title II will correct these problems, and for the \nfirst time will create a legal regime in which disqualifying mental \nhealth records, both at the State and Federal level, would regularly be \nreported into the NICS system.\n  Title III would make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits, and for funds administered under the \nByrne grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program.\n  Providing this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. I \ncommend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area.\n  Title IV of the bill makes improvements to the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act of 2003. These amendments to existing law will \nstreamline the system by which qualified retired and active officers \ncan be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we permit qualified \nofficers, with a demonstrated commitment to law enforcement and no \nadverse employment history, to protect themselves and their families \nwherever they may be.\n  Title V incorporates the PRECAUTION Act, which Senators Feingold and \nSpecter asked to have included. This provision authorizes grants to \ndevelop prevention and intervention programs for our schools.\n  Finally, title VI incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of \n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  Let us go forward and act now on this important bill. The Virginia \nTech Review Panel--a body commissioned by Governor Tim Kaine to study \nthe Virginia Tech tragedy--recently issued its findings based on a 4-\nmonth long investigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill \nwould adopt a number of recommendations from the Review Panel aimed at \nimproving school safety planning and reporting information to NICS.\n  We must not miss this opportunity to implement these initiatives \nnationwide, and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety of our \nkids.\n  I recognize that there is no panacea to end the sad phenomenon of \nschool violence. The recent tragedies should prompt us to respond in \nrealistic and meaningful ways when we are presented with such \nchallenges. I hope the Senate can promptly move this bill forward to \ninvest in the safety of our students and better support law enforcement \nofficers across the country.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for my voice. We seem to \nhave enough matter in the air to affect it. I look forward to the fact \nthat in a couple of days I will be in Vermont where the air is much \nnicer, although I do love this area. I once had a longtime resident of \nWashington, DC, sitting on the front lawn of my farm in Middlesex, VT, \nlooking out over miles of valleys surrounded by mountains. You don't \nsee another person, just this magnificent view. It was a clear day.\n  I said to him: There, what do you think of that view?\n  He said: I don't like it.\n  I said: What do you mean? You came here from Washington, and you are \nseeing one of the most beautiful views anywhere in the State of \nVermont, and you don't like it? What don't you like about it?\n  He said: I don't trust air that I cannot see.\n  Well, we cannot see the air there, but, boy, we can breathe it. I \nenjoy that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi and then 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland following that.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Judge Sharion Aycock\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nJudge Sharion Aycock and recommend her confirmation as U.S. district \ncourt judge for the Northern District of Mississippi.\n  Judge Aycock is exceptionally well qualified by reason of her \neducation, her experience, and her temperament to serve as a U.S. \ndistrict court judge. As a lawyer, she was highly respected, and as a \njudge on our State court that has general, civil, and criminal \njurisdiction, she has served with competence and distinction and with a \nkeen sense of fairness. She will reflect great credit on the Federal \njudiciary, in my opinion. Judge Aycock has earned the respect and \nadmiration of her fellow lawyers, as well as the judges who have worked \nwith her. She has been selected to serve in many professional and \ncommunity positions of trust and responsibility.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously concluded that she is ``well qualified'' to serve \nas a Federal district court judge. This is the highest rating a \njudicial nominee can receive from the American Bar Association.\n  She was born and raised in the northeast Mississippi town of Tremont \nin Itawamba County, where she graduated from high school with honors \nand was elected President of the student body.\n  She also graduated with honors from Mississippi State University in \n1977, studying economics and political science. While a student there, \nshe was selected for membership in Phi Kappa Phi, the Nation's oldest \nand largest honor society. She was inducted into the Mississippi State \nUniversity Hall of Fame, the university's highest undergraduate honor. \nShe also served as President of her social sorority.\n  She received her law degree from the Mississippi College School of \nLaw, where she served as co-editor in chief of the Law Review and as \ntreasurer of the Student Body Association. She graduated second out of \na class of 146 and was admitted to practice law by the Mississippi \nState Bar.\n  After graduating from law school, Ms. Aycock returned to Itawamba \nCounty and started her own practice in 1984. During her 12 years of law \npractice, she represented the Itawamba County Board of Supervisors and \nthe Board of Education, the town of Tremont, the city of Fulton, and \nthe Northeast Mississippi Natural Gas District. She served as the \nItawamba County prosecuting attorney from 1984 to 1992 and was honored \nas the State's most distinguished juvenile justice professional.\n  Judge Aycock was elected circuit court judge for the First Circuit \nCourt District of Mississippi in November 2002. She was unopposed when \nshe sought reelection 4 years later, in November 2006.\n  Except for statewide elected officials, trial judges have the largest \ngeographic areas of responsibility in our State under their \njurisdiction. The fact that she was unopposed when she was reelected in \n2006 means that many people respected and appreciated the tremendous \njob she had done as a trial judge. Her court's docket is one of the \nbusiest in the State of Mississippi, and\n\n[[Page S12757]]\n\nit is also one of the largest districts, encompassing seven counties.\n  During her tenure on the circuit court, Judge Aycock has had the \nopportunity to hear numerous criminal and civil cases, covering a broad \nrange of subjects. She has expedited the work of the court, both on the \ncivil and criminal dockets. She led the court in disposing of civil \ncases and the collection of fines and criminal cases.\n  She has contributed substantially to the improvement of the \nadministration of justice in our State and in the betterment of her \ncommunity.\n  She has been an active member of local and State bar associations. \nShe served as First Judicial District secretary and president and was \nthe first woman to serve as president of the Mississippi Bar \nFoundation, an organization dedicated to the improvement of the \nadministration of justice in our State. She is also a fellow of the \nMississippi Bar Foundation.\n  She served as president of the Itawamba County Development Council, \nas a member of the Itawamba County Hospital Foundation, and as cochair \nof the Itawamba County March of Dimes.\n  Senator Lott and I recommended the nomination of Judge Aycock in \nDecember of 2006. I am pleased that the President nominated Judge \nAycock and that the Senate Judiciary Committee has recommended the \napproval of her nomination.\n  I urge Senators to vote to confirm this well-deserved nomination.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to have this opportunity \nto speak on behalf of Judge Sharion Aycock in advance of her \nconfirmation vote. Judge Aycock is the first female jurist from \nMississippi to be nominated to a position on the Federal bench, and I \nam delighted that the President has chosen her to serve on the United \nStates District Court for North Mississippi.\n  Judge Aycock was born and raised in Tremont, MS. After graduating \nwith honors from Tremont High School, she went on to attend Mississippi \nState University where she graduated with a degree in political \nscience. Judge Aycock then earned her law degree from the Mississippi \nCollege School of Law, where she served as Co-Editor-in-Chief of the \nMississippi College Law Review and finished 2nd in her class.\n  Following law school, Judge Aycock was employed by the A.T. Cleveland \nLaw Office in Fulton, MS, and later opened her own practice. While in \nprivate practice, she represented the Itawamba County Board of \nSupervisors, Itawamba County Board of Education, Town of Tremont, City \nof Fulton, and the Northeast Mississippi Natural Gas District. She also \nserved as the Itawamba County Prosecuting Attorney from 1984 to 1992.\n  Judge Aycock has been extremely active in her local community serving \nas Past President of the Itawamba County Development Council, a Member \nof the Itawamba County Hospital Foundation, a Member of the Three \nRivers Area Health Services, Inc., Co-Chairman of the Itawamba County \nMarch of Dimes, and Chairman of the Prairie Girl Scouts Capital Fund \nDrive for Itawamba County. She was chosen as the ``Itawamba County Good \nCitizen of 2000'' and selected as one of the Mississippi Business \nJournal's ``Top 40 Under 40.''\n  In addition to being heavily involved in her local community, Judge \nAycock has been an active member in the Mississippi Bar Association. \nShe served as First Judicial District President and Secretary, and was \nhonored as a Fellow of the Mississippi Bar Foundation.\n  During her professional career, she has also received several \ngubernatorial appointments, including appointments to the Board of the \nMississippi Home Corporation; Board Member and Past Chairman of the \nMississippi State Personnel Board; and a Member of the Governor's \nCommission on Youth and Children.\n  Judge Aycock is currently Circuit Court Judge of the First Circuit \nCourt District of Mississippi, a position she was elected to in \nNovember of 2002. During her tenure, Judge Aycock has had the \nopportunity to hear numerous criminal and civil cases covering a broad \nrange of subject matter and complexity. She has presided over countless \ncriminal cases, including capital murder, murder, manslaughter, and \nnumerous drug offenses. Civil cases have included medical malpractice, \ncontracts, fraud and misrepresentation, personal injury, and other \nsuits for monetary damages.\n  I believe that Judge Aycock will serve as a credit to both the \nFederal bench and to the State of Mississippi. I look forward to her \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n               Nomination of Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am reminded of a quote from Daniel \nWebster when he said that ``justice is the greatest aspiration of man \non earth.'' I think the reason we take these judicial nominations so \nseriously is because the judiciary--the people who wear the black \nrobe--is the personification of that aspiration for justice.\n  Today, it gives me great pleasure to speak in support of the \nnomination of Judge Jennifer Elrod of Houston to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. In a few moments, the Senate will vote \non her nomination.\n  As Judge Elrod's career makes clear, she is well qualified for a seat \non the Federal appellate bench. She has demonstrated the legal acumen, \nthe judicial temperament, and dedication to public service which the \nSenate wisely requires of all judicial nominees.\n  Since 2002, Judge Elrod has been a State district court judge, \nserving on the 190th District Court in Harris County, TX. As a trial \njudge, she has presided over more than 200 jury and nonjury trials. \nBefore that, Judge Elrod practiced law in Houston, TX, in the trial \ndepartment of Baker Botts, a top national law firm.\n  Judge Elrod is known for her outstanding intellect, her strong work \nethic, her integrity, and her courteous demeanor. She has an \noutstanding record as a practicing attorney and as an active State \ncourt judge. She has demonstrated an impressive commitment to public \nservice and pro bono work throughout her career.\n  Both while in private practice and while serving the people of Texas \nas a trial judge, Judge Elrod has dedicated much of her free time to \nimproving the lives of those less fortunate in the community.\n  Even with the demands of a career in the law, she also found time to \nserve as a board member and chairwoman of the Gulf Coast Legal \nFoundation, now called Lone Star Legal Aid. This organization serves \nmore than 1 million low-income Texans, making it the fourth largest \nlegal aid program in the Nation. She also served as general counsel to \nCommunities in Schools in Houston and as the cochair of the Houston \nVolunteer Association's Legal Hotline.\n  As a judge, she assisted the Houston Bar Association with numerous \nfundraising activities aimed at providing scholarships for diversity \nand equal access to justice. Judge Elrod dedicated her time to hosting \nand mentoring legal interns from less-privileged backgrounds, opening \nher courtroom to them and teaching these young men and women valuable \noral advocacy skills. She has been an active participant in the Texas \nAccess to Justice Commission, helping young lawyers to provide legal \nservices to indigent clients.\n  Mr. President, I know of few lawyers, much less judicial nominees, \nwith such an outstanding record of consistent commitment to pro bono \nservices and public service.\n  While my colleagues undoubtedly will acknowledge the importance of \nJudge Elrod's career achievements and dedication to her community, we \nalso recognize that the most important attributes of a judicial nominee \nare their temperament and commitment to the rule of law. Above all \nelse, a judge must faithfully interpret and apply the law as written \nand not as they wish we in Congress should have written it. I am \nconfident Judge Elrod has demonstrated her ability to fairly and \nimpartially resolve cases before her.\n  Her demonstrated fairness and respect for all is a key reason why her \nnomination is supported across the Houston legal community. She has the \npersonal endorsement of the past and current presidents of the Houston \nBar Association, the Hispanic Bar Association of Houston, and the \nMexican American Bar Association of Houston, which are just a sampling \nof the broad base of her support. By all accounts, Judge Elrod has \nexercised her judicial\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\nduties with nothing but neutrality and a commitment to fundamental \nfairness for every litigant before her.\n  In sum, Judge Elrod is an accomplished lawyer and judge of high \ncharacter and uncommon integrity. I am honored to enthusiastically \nrecommend to the Senate that it vote to confirm her to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I am confident she will serve this \nNation with honor and distinction.\n  Let me say in closing how much I appreciate the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for giving Judge Elrod a timely \nhearing and for putting it on the markup on the Judiciary Committee \nschedule. I appreciate the majority leader, Senator Reid, for allowing \nthis nomination to come forward to the floor so we can give this good \njudge a vote very soon, I hope.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and \nChairman Leahy asked that I chair the nomination hearings, the \nconfirmation hearings on the three judges whom we are considering \ntoday.\n  I agree completely with our colleagues from the State of Washington \nand the State of Mississippi. I think Richard Jones is well qualified \nand should be confirmed for the U.S. District Court in the Western \nDistrict of Washington.\n  I think Sharion Aycock is well qualified, and I strongly support her \nconfirmation to the District Court in Mississippi.\n  In regard to Jennifer Walker Elrod, for the U.S. Circuit Court for \nthe Fifth Circuit, I opposed her nomination in the Judiciary Committee, \nand I take this time to explain to my colleagues why I believe she \nshould not be confirmed.\n  Let me begin by saying that I agree with my friend from Texas about \nJudge Elrod's commitment to pro bono legal services. She served as \nchair of the board of the Gulf Coast Legal Foundation, now known as \nLoan Star Legal Aid, the largest provider of pro bono services in \nsoutheast Texas. That is important to me because I think all lawyers \nhave a responsibility to help out to make sure our system is available \nto all.\n\n  After serving 8 years in private practice as an associate of Baker \nBotts in Houston, TX, she was appointed to the bench by the Governor in \n2002 as a judge, the 190th District Court in Houston, TX. She was \nreelected to the bench in 2006.\n  However, no one is entitled to a circuit court judgeship. In the vast \nmajority of cases, these courts are the final law of the land for the \nStates in their circuit when it comes to interpreting complex Federal \nstatutes and our Constitution. These judges have lifetime appointments \nand are second only to the Supreme Court Justices in terms of their \npower and authority.\n  I think we need to exercise a higher standard when we look at the \nconfirmation of our appellate court judges. In many cases, they will be \nthe final arbitrators of disputes among the people of our States.\n  In meeting with Judge Elrod, chairing her nomination hearings, and \nreviewing her written responses to additional questions I posed to her, \nI am not convinced Judge Elrod has the experience for this position.\n  I start with the undisputed fact about Judge Elrod's record. By her \nown admission, Judge Elrod has never written a single judicial opinion. \nIn response to the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire asking for her \nopinions as a judge, she stated: ``I do not write opinions, I sign \norders.'' She provided over 6,000 orders to the committee, but most are \none-page documents that do not contain any discussion of substantive \nlaw. Indeed, Judge Elrod said that most questions in our committee \nquestionnaire about her judicial opinions were not applicable to her \nbecause certiorari was not granted in any of her cases; appellate \nopinions or orders rarely reviewed her orders and decisions; she had no \nlist of unpublished opinions; and she never sat on a judicial panel \nwith other colleagues deciding cases. In short, we have no record of \nher ability to write opinions or the rationale for her decisions.\n  A nominee for circuit court judge should have experience in writing \nsubstantive judicial opinions. Judge Elrod does not have this requisite \nexperience.\n  Judge Elrod, by her own admission, has very little experience in \ncriminal cases. When she litigated at Baker Botts for 5 years, she \nresponded that her practice involved ``100 percent civil proceedings'' \nand ``0 percent criminal proceedings.'' Her current job as a judge on \nthe 190th District Court of Houston, TX, involves almost exclusively \ncivil cases.\n  A nominee for circuit court judge should have broad experience in \nboth criminal and civil cases. Her work in a handful of pro bono cases \ndoes not give me confidence that she has sufficient understanding of \nthe criminal justice system and the rights of defendants. In fact, her \nmajor initiative in criminal issues involved the amicus brief in the \ncase of Texas v. Cobb before the Supreme Court, in which she argued \nthat the sixth amendment only applies to ``charged offenses'' and \ntherefore a police interrogation without counsel about a subsequent \noffense was admissible. She did not further explain her views about \nthis case in her written responses to our committee.\n  Judge Elrod, by her own admission, has very little experience in \nFederal court. In response to the committee questionnaire, she stated \nthat her private practice involved ``80 percent state court'' cases and \n``20 percent federal'' cases. Her current job as a State district court \njudge involves almost exclusively State issues.\n  A nominee for circuit court judge should have broad experience on \nFederal court issues and in the complex questions, often of first \nimpression, of Federal law, statutory law, and constitutional \ninterpretation that are routinely raised.\n  Judge Elrod, by her own admission, has very little experience in \nappellate litigation, with exception of the Cobb case noted above. Her \ncurrent job as a State district court judge involves exclusively trial \nlevel proceedings.\n  A nominee for the circuit court--this is our appellate court, our \nsecond highest court--who handles these types of cases should have \nsignificant experience in appellate work.\n  Judge Elrod, by her own admission, does not ``write opinions.'' She \n``signs orders.'' Given that circuit court judges are often the final \nsay on law of the land in a given circuit--due to the low rate of \ngranting certiorari by the Supreme Court--a circuit court judge has an \nunusual amount of authority and decisionmaking power.\n  We do not have any track record by which to weigh Judge Elrod's views \non substantive legal issues, such as civil rights, civil liberties, \nworkers' rights, reproductive freedom, environmental protection, \nconsumers' rights, or employees' rights.\n  The speeches Judge Elrod provided for the record did not shed any \nmore light on her opinions on substantive legal issues. She stated she \ndid not have notes for many of her speeches. She also has not written \nany substantive legal or journal articles on complex legal or policy \nissues. Judge Elrod does not meet my test for Federal judicial nominees \nsince she does not have the requisite experience for an appellate \njudge.\n  I want to talk about a separate issue. I talked about experience, \nwhich I think is important for a nominee who wants to serve on our \nappellate courts. I also think the issue of diversity is an important \nissue that needs to be talked about in this Chamber.\n  I wish to talk about the issue of diversity in the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich includes Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, presides over the \nlargest percentage of minority residents, 44 percent, which includes \nAfrican Americans and Latino citizens, of any regional circuit courts \nof appeal in this country outside of Washington, DC.\n  Mississippi has the highest African-American population, 36 percent, \nof any State in the country. Louisiana has the second largest African-\nAmerican population, at 32 percent, of any State in this country. It is \ndisappointing that none of President Bush's 10 nominations to the \nFederal bench in this circuit were African American. Of the 19 Federal \njudges who now sit on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, only one is \nAfrican American.\n  We all agree that diversity at all levels of our judicial system is \nimportant. Most recently, we have seen mass protests over double \nstandards in our\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\ncriminal justice system used to treat African American and White youths \nin Jena, LA. Surely, in 2007 we can do better.\n  I take this time to point out that when the President submits a \nnominee for the appellate court, our second highest court, I expect \nthat nominee will have the type of experience that is appropriate for a \njudge to be on the appellate court. I certainly am disappointed by the \nPresident's nominations on this circuit as it relates to diversity. I \nwanted to make sure that was included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Texas \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  I certainly respect the right of the Senator from Maryland to express \nhis views. I do want to put this in some context.\n  I don't know if it is a unique experience currently in the Senate, \nbut perhaps it is currently that I am the only Member of the Senate who \nactually served for 13 years as a State judge, both on our State trial \nbench and the supreme court. That does not give me any particular \nqualifications other than to say what it means to have served in those \ncapacities, as Judge Elrod has for 5 years. She worked also as a clerk \nfor a U.S. district judge, Judge Sim Lake, for 2 years.\n  I hope we are not saying that it is a prerequisite for confirmation \nto the job of an appellate judge that one actually has to have served \nas an appellate judge. Of course, rarely do any of us have experience \nin the jobs to which we are assigned or to which we are elected or to \nwhich we are hired until we have actually had a chance to perform that \njob. What we look at is not whether they have actually done that job \nbefore, but whether they have done a good job of everything they have \ntaken on previously.\n  By that standard, Judge Elrod not only has an impressive resume for a \nlawyer of her age, but she has demonstrated her competence, indeed, her \nexcellence as a State district court judge.\n  I have some sensitivity to the suggestion that she does not have \nlengthy enough experience, alluding to her relative youth. I remember \nwhen I became a State district judge, I was 32 years old. But, more \nimportantly, of the 19 judges currently serving on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, 10 were in their forties or younger when appointed; \nthree were 41--Judge Elrod's age--or younger. Judge Edith Jones, the \nchief judge of the Fifth Circuit, was 36 when confirmed by the Senate.\n  Judge Higginbotham, to whose vacancy Judge Elrod is nominated, was \n44, and Judge Sim Lake, with whom Judge Elrod clerked, was 44 when he \nwas appointed.\n  I also think of the members of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate \nwho have been elected to important positions of responsibility. My \nrecollection is--and I have to rely on the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland to remind me--but I think he was one of the youngest, if I am \nnot mistaken, speakers of the Maryland House ever elected. He was \nelected at a young age, and that is to his great credit.\n  The fact is, age alone should not determine competence for these \njobs. I think the demonstrated public service and record of excellence \nis sufficient.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Maryland acknowledging her tremendous \nrecord of pro bono service. That is a record of service above and \nbeyond the call of duty which I think demonstrates Judge Elrod's \ncommitment.\n  Finally, on the issue of diversity, I note that Judge Higginbotham, \nwho currently occupies the seat to which Judge Elrod has been nominated \nand will serve, is somebody who looks like me. He is a White male. I \nthink we ought to celebrate the fact that a woman of Judge Elrod's \ncapability and experience has been deemed qualified by the President of \nthe United States and by the Senate Judiciary Committee to serve in \nthis important position. I think that counts for some diversity.\n  I do share the concerns of the Senator from Maryland that too few \nAfrican Americans are attending law school. It reduces the pool of \npotential applicants for people to serve in positions on the judiciary, \nand we need to do more to try to encourage and facilitate that \nsituation. But I certainly would not hold it against Judge Elrod that \nshe is not an African American. I think she is qualified on the merits.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania, the distinguished ranking \nmember, giving me a few minutes to explain, perhaps, another side of \nthe story.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nTexas was also an attorney general of his State. I wonder if in that \ncapacity the staff who served the appellate function in the attorney \ngeneral's office, a solicitor general, are separate and he recognizes \nappellate practice, in many ways, is a specialized skill in that \ncontext, and I wonder what appellate argument experience the candidate \nfor the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the distinguished questioner, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, is himself a distinguished lawyer and a former \nattorney general with whom I served as a State attorney general. He \nknows as well as I do that a trial judge and a trial lawyer have to \ncraft written and legal arguments the same way as an appellate lawyer \ndoes. Those are the same basic skills that Judge Elrod brings to her \njob.\n  It is true, when I became attorney general of my State, I created an \nOffice of Solicitor General, recognizing the increasingly specialized \nnature of appellate practice.\n  Again, I believe Judge Elrod, by virtue of her extensive trial \nexperience, the fact she graduated at the top of her class from law \nschool and undergraduate school, served with one of the premier law \nfirms in the Nation and with distinction as a trial judge, more than \nadequately qualifies her for this new responsibility.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Judge Jennifer Elrod to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Back in July, I was proud to introduce Judge Elrod, a fellow Texan, \nat her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  Judge Elrod is a highly accomplished judicial nominee, with a \ndistinguished record as a state court judge and as a practicing \nattorney. I am confident she will capably serve as a federal appelate \njudge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Judge Elrod has shown her judicial capability in the 190th District \nCourt in Houston, TX, where she currently presides. At present, she \nmanaages a docket of over 1,000 cases, and leads all Harris County \ncivil district judges in the number of jury cases tried to verdict \nsince 2005.\n  Prior to serving on the bench, Judge Elrod practiced at Baker Botts \nLLP, a top national firm, where she worked for 8 years on litigation \nmatters including antitrust, employment law, commercial litigation, \ntoxic tort, general civil litigation, and personal injury defense. She \nalso served as a law clerk to the Honorable Sim Lake in the Southern \nDistrict of Texas.\n  Judge Elrod's outstanding intellect is evidenced by her exceptional \nacademic credentials, graduating cum laude from Harvard Law School, and \nmagna cum laude with distinction from Baylor University in Texas.\n  Judge Elrod has long been dedicated to pro bono service and \ncharitable causes, and she is the former chair of the Gulf Coast Legal \nFoundation, the largst provider of pro bono legal assistance to \nindigent people in the Texas gulf coast region. She was recently \ncommended by the Texas Access to Justice Commission for her service in \nfacilitating the advocacy skills of lawyers who represent poor and low \nincome Texans.\n  Judge Elrod has also been an active member in both the Texas State \nBar and the Houston Bar Association, with particular service in the \nareas of Continuing Legal Education and the Administration of Justice.\n  She is two-time recipient of the President's Award fo Outstanding \nService to the Houston Bar Association, and she was awarded the \noutstanding Young Lawyer of Houston in 2004 by the Houston Young \nLawyers Association.\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\n  I am honored to support the confirmation of Judge Jennifer Elrod \nbecause she meets the high standards to which we hold all judicial \nnominees.\n  She has an impressive record of public service, work ethic, \nintegrity, and she will bring great honor to the Federal bench.\n  I encourage my colleagues to approve her nomination.\n  We must also fill the other two vacancies on the Fifth Circuit.\n  The President has nominated two highly accomplished individuals, \nCatharina Haynes, and Leslie Southwick, to fill those vacancies--and \nthey deserve a fair and speedy confirmation process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Jennifer \nWalker Elrod for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. She has an \nexcellent academic record: magna cum laude from Baylor, where she was \nPhi Beta Kappa and cum laude from Harvard Law School. She has served as \nan adjunct faculty member at the University of Houston Law Center. She \nhas been in the practice of law for some 15 years, spending 8 years at \nthe law firm Baker Botts. She has done extensive pro bono work \nincluding as general counsel for the Communities in Schools in Houston. \nShe has extensive participation in the bar association. She's a member \nof the Mexican-American Bar Association of Houston and the Houston Bar \nAssociation. I believe her record qualifies her for the circuit court, \nnotwithstanding the considerations of age and experience.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for one \nclarification on that point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I want to make it clear for the record that I have never \nat all challenged this nominee for the appellate court on age. I have \nnever raised the issue of age, and I would never raise the issue of \nage.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Maryland for that statement.\n  Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod was nominated to a seat on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals on March 29, 2007, and a hearing was held on \nher nomination on July 19, 2007. Her nomination was reported favorably \nto the full Senate on September 20, 2007.\n  Judge Elrod received her B.A., magna cum laude, in economics from \nBaylor University in 1988, where she was Phi Beta Kappa and was named \nthe ``Outstanding Graduating Senior in the Honors Program.''\n  In 1992, she received her J.D., cum laude, from Harvard Law School. \nAt Harvard, she was a senior editor and the assistant business manager \nfor the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, and she was a \nfinalist in the James Barr Ames Moot Court Competition.\n  After law school, Judge Elrod served as a law clerk to Judge Sim Lake \nof the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n  Following her clerkship, Judge Elrod practiced law in the litigation \ndepartment of Baker Botts in Houston, TX.\n  In 2002, Governor Rick Perry appointed Judge Elrod to the 190th \nDistrict Court in Harris County, TX, a State trial court.

While working at Baker Botts, the firm gave \nher the Thomas Gibbs Gee Award for outstanding pro bono work. She also \nreceived the President's Award from the Houston Bar Association for \nOutstanding Service to the Bar.\n  While in private practice, Judge Elrod served as a board member and \nthe chair of the board of the Gulf Coast Legal Foundation, now Lone \nStar Legal Aid, which is one of the largest providers of legal aid \nservices to the poor in Texas.\n  The vacancy to which she is nominated is considered a ``judicial \nemergency'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Elrod \n``qualified.''\n\n\n                     Nomination of Richard A. Jones\n\n  Richard Jones comes to the Senate with an extraordinary record.

Again, a fine academic \nrecord, with 27 years of law practice, with her bachelor's degree from \nMississippi State University and a member of two honor societies, and \nCo-Editor in Chief of the Mississippi College Law Review. She has been \na judge on the First Circuit Court for the District of Mississippi for \nthe last 4 years, was the board attorney for the town of Tremont, and \nprosecuting attorney for Itawamba County. Judge Aycock brings \nsubstantial qualifications and the American Bar Association rated her \nunanimously ``well qualified.''\n  Judge Sharion Aycock was nominated to be a U.S. District Court Judge \nfor the Northern District of Mississippi on March 19, 2007.

In 1990, they dissolved the \npartnership, and Judge Aycock resumed her former sole practice.\n  While working as a sole practitioner, Judge Aycock represented a \nvariety of government entities on a part-time basis.\n  She served as the board attorney for her hometown, Tremont, MS, from \n1980 until 2002 and for the city of Fulton from 1998 to 2002. She was \nelected to serve as the prosecuting attorney for Itawamba County in \n1984 and served until 1992.\n  Judge Aycock also served as the attorney for the Board of Supervisors \nfor Itawamba County from 1993 to 2002, the board attorney for the \nItawamba County School District from 1984 to 1999, and the attorney for \nthe Board of Commissioners for the Mantachie Natural Gas District from \n1986 to 2002.\n  In 2002, Judge Aycock was elected as Circuit Court Judge for the \nFirst Circuit Court District of Mississippi.

She has \nexperience as an assistant district attorney in New York County. She \nwas New York State Inspector General for 7 years and chair of the \nGovernor's Moreland Act Commission on the New York City schools for 3 \nyears.\n  Roslynn R. Mauskopf was nominated in the last Congress, but her \nnomination was not acted upon prior to its adjournment. She was \nrenominated on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on her nomination on \nApril 11, 2007, and the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination \nfavorably on July 19.\n  Ms. Mauskopf is a highly qualified nominee with excellent credentials \nand a distinguished record of public service.\n  In 1979, she received her B.A. degree from Brandeis University, \ngraduating magna cum laude. In 1982, she graduated cum laude from \nGeorgetown University Law Center.\n  After law school, Ms. Mauskopf served as an Assistant District \nAttorney for New York County until 1995.\n  Between 1995 and 2002, she served as New York State's Inspector \nGeneral, leading the State office responsible for investigating \ncorruption, fraud, criminal activity, conflicts of interest, and other \nmisconduct in State executive branch agencies.\n  Between 1999 and 2002, she also chaired the Governor's Moreland Act \nCommission on New York City Schools, which examined the operations and \nfiscal affairs of the New York City Board of Education and the New York \nCity School Construction Authority.\n  Since 2002, Ms. Mauskopf has served as United States Attorney for the \nEastern District of New York.\n  The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she has dedicated herself to \npromoting Holocaust remembrance. Her mother, at age 90, attended her \ndaughter's nomination hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Ms. Mauskopf \n``Qualified.''\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wanted to come back to Judge Elrod and \ncomment on some of the points Senator Cornyn raised in his statements \non the floor.\n  As I explained to Senator Specter, at no time do I raise at all the \nissue of age. I don't even know Judge Elrod's age, nor should that ever \nbe a factor in our consideration on a confirmation, and it was not in \nmy judgment; nor do I think there is a mathematical formula as to what \nis an appropriate amount of experience to be qualified to be an \nappellate court judge; nor do I think there is a specific path that one \nmust follow in order to become an appellate court judge.\n  But with Judge Elrod, just look at her background and record. You \nwould think, for an appellate court judge, you would want a nominee to \nhave appellate court experience. She does not have it. You would think, \nfor a Federal appellate court judge, you would want someone who has \nexperience in our Federal courts. She doesn't have that. You would \nthink, for a Federal appellate court judge, you would want someone who \nhas experience in criminal law. She doesn't have that. You would \nexpect, for someone who is going to be a nominee confirmed for the \nappellate court, that we would be able to evaluate her ability to \nexpress herself through opinions. We don't have that. You would expect, \nfor an appellate court judge, we would have her speeches or articles \nthat would explain some of her philosophy on life. We don't have that. \nYou would expect, for an appellate court judge, you would have some \nother way of being able to evaluate her approach to interpreting the \nConstitution of the United States. She will be confirmed to sit on the \ncourt that will do more interpretation of our Constitution than any \nother court; that is, the appellate court because so few cases get to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. And she doesn't have that \neither.\n  So it was that point that I thought the Members of this body should \nbe aware of, not that she didn't follow a particular course to become \nan appellate court judge or her age. It has to do with having something \nto evaluate for a person who is going to be on the appellate court with \na lifetime position. And that is how I drew my conclusion.\n  I appreciate the courtesy to be able to share that with our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I don't know that anybody else is seeking \nrecognition. Senator Leahy has already said he was not going to ask for \nthe yeas and nays, and I do not intend to. Senator Cardin says he is \nnot going to.\n  So I yield back my time.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Jennifer Walker \nElrod, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Washington?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12761-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF ROSLYNN RENEE MAUSKOPF TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the \noutstanding work of Clear Path International, a nongovernmental \norganization based in Dorset, VT. Since 2000, they have worked to \nlocate and remove landmines and other unexploded ordnance in Vietnam, \nCambodia, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and more recently have \nfocused on helping the innocent victims of these indiscriminate weapons \nwith medical, rehabilitation, and vocational assistance. As someone who \nhas fought for years to rid the world of landmines, I am proud that \nClear Path is based in my home State.\n  Clear Path recently expanded its work to Afghanistan. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a September 15, 2007, article in the Rutland Herald about \nClear Path's work be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Rutland Herald, Sept. 11, 2007]\n\n   CPI Continuing To Grow Its Reputation as a Force for Humanitarian \n                                 Relief\n\n                          (By Patrick McArdle)\n\n       Dorset.--Clear Path International is continuing to grow its \n     reputation as a force for humanitarian relief with new \n     developments this year in Afghanistan and Slovenia.\n       For the first time, Clear Path is operating a program in \n     Afghanistan in partnership with an American company and the \n     Department of State.\n       Clear Path, which has offices in Dorset and Seattle, has \n     also received a promise of almost a quarter million dollars \n     from a nonprofit organization in Slovenia which will allow it \n     to continue and expand their work in Vietnam.\n       Martha Hathaway, the executive director of Clear Path, said \n     it was important for the organization to get the kind of \n     wider recognition that leads to expansions like the one it \n     has recently undertaken.\n       But Hathaway is much more interested in talking about the \n     work Clear Path is doing and the need in the countries it \n     operates than in congratulating Clear Path on its efforts.\n       In Afghanistan, Clear Path will be creating victims' \n     assistance programs which has been part of its mission for \n     some time.\n       Hathaway founded Clear Path in 2001 with her husband, \n     James, Kristen Leadem of Dorset, and Imbert Matthee of \n     Washington, as a land mine removal organization. Now, the \n     group works primarily in assisting victims and raising \n     awareness.\n       In Afghanistan, Clear Path will be working as a \n     subcontractor to DynCorp International which has a contract \n     with the Department of State's Office of Weapons Removal and \n     Abatement. Hathaway said the Clear Path office in Kabul, \n     which has been operatig since April, is staffed partially by \n     Americans, working to engage Afghanis in the process.\n       The State Department is worried about projects that are not \n     self-sustaining,'' Hathaway said.\n       Hathaway said because the government of Afghanistan already \n     had a national strategy for helping victims of land mines, \n     who not only have to deal with their injury but access issues \n     and loss of income, Clear Path would look for ways the State \n     Department can assist the local agencies. That is likely to \n     include things like organizing a national workshop on \n     victims' assistance or creating a system for building \n     ramps and making schools accessible.\n       While Clear Path has already had some success with similar \n     programs in Cambodia and along the Thailand-Burma border, \n     Hathaway said that didn't necessarily make things easier when \n     they expanded into a country like Afghanistan that has \n     suffered greatly from the use of land mines.\n       ``Every country impacted by land mines is different but we \n     can take the bits and pieces of institutional knowledge we've \n     gained over the years and apply it where it makes sense,'' \n     she said.\n       According to Clear Path, an average of 90 people are \n     injured by land mines or explosive remnants in Afghanistan \n     every month and about half die before they can be treated.\n       The grant from the Slovenia-based International Trust for \n     Demining and Mine Victims Assistance also presents new \n     opportunities for Clear Path.\n       Under the agreement, the trust will raise $230,000 from \n     among its 27 government and private-sector donors to match \n     what Clear Path raises from the United States government and \n     donors.\n       Hathaway said this is the first time Clear Path has \n     received funds from the trust and marks the trust's first \n     efforts in Southeast Asia.\n       The trust was founded about 10 years ago to assist people \n     in the Balkans but Hathaway said as land mines became less of \n     a threat in Europe, charitable organizations there have begun \n     to look at ways they can help victims in other places.\n       According to Hathaway, Clear Path will use the money to \n     assist ongoing efforts in Vietnam through capital purchases \n     and the hiring of new staff rather than to create new \n     programs.\n       Despite Clear Path's successes, which have led to more \n     contracts and funding, the need is still great and money \n     remains an issue.\n       The problem of land mines, especially those which remain \n     after a war is over and injure civilians, gained \n     international attention more than 10 years ago through the \n     support of several well-known figures, primarily England's \n     Princess Diana.\n       Land mine removal is expensive, however, and organizations \n     like Clear Path, which assist with rehabilitation and the \n     development of resources so victims can earn their own \n     living, are in it for the long-term.\n       ``Donor fatigue is a real problem,'' Hathaway said.\n       While Clear Path is raising more money than it has in the \n     past, it comes from fewer donors, primarily the large \n     donations like\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\n     the ones from the trust, rather than the numerous pledges of \n     $50 or $100 they received in the past.\n       Clear Path also has the disadvantage of being based in \n     Seattle and out-of-the-mainstream Dorset, far from the \n     significant donors based in New York City or Washington, DC.\n       Clear Path has raised money through benefit concerts and a \n     music CD. Its next concert will be on Oct. 13 at the Long \n     Trail School in Dorset with performers Sarah Lee Guthrie and \n     Johnny Irion, introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12763-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke last week in this Chamber about the \npolitical crisis in Burma where thousands of Buddhist monks, joined by \nan estimated 100,000 other Burmese citizens, peacefully protested for \nan end to military dictatorship.\n  Despite appeals for restraint by governments around the world, as \nwell as the U.N. Secretary General, they were met with brute force. \nSoldiers firing live bullets and wielding clubs killed and injured an \nundetermined number of unarmed civilians, including at least one \nforeign journalist, and there are reports that hundreds, and possibly \nthousands, of monks have been beaten, killed or jailed.\n  The atrocities perpetrated by the Burmese generals are crimes against \nhumanity. They should be indicted and prosecuted by the International \nCriminal Court.\n  Sooner or later they will be made to pay for the appalling brutality \nthat has been witnessed on television by hundreds of millions of people \naround the world.\n  The United States has imposed economic sanctions on the Burmese \ngovernment for many years, thanks in large measure to the tireless \nefforts of Senator McConnell who, for the better part of two decades, \nhas called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's rightful \nleader.\n  Additional sanctions were announced, belatedly, by President Bush \nlast week. But far more pressure is needed, particularly to convince \nBurma's trading partners, like China, India and Thailand, to cut their \neconomic ties to Burma. It is thanks in large part to them that the \nBurmese generals owe their power and wealth.\n  The crisis in Burma today tarnishes any government that values its \nfinancial interests over freedom for the Burmese people. For two \ndecades, they have chafed under the iron grip of a clique of corrupt \ngenerals who have shown, year after year, that they belong in the \ncategory of ruthless despots who will stop at nothing, including mass \nmurder, to perpetuate their control.\n  Lasting economic, social and political stability in Burma can only \nbegin once the Burmese generals relinquish power. How that comes about \nis their choice. We have seen the results of peaceful protest. Not even \ncivil disobedience, just peaceful protest. Time and again it has been \nmet with deadly force.\n  Those Nations that continue to do business with Burma make a mockery \nof their own professed commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. There is no truer test of their commitment to those fundamental \nprinciples than how they respond to the slaughter of unarmed monks and \ncivilians by a regime that is apparently unconcerned that their crimes \nare being televised to the world.\n  Whether this year, next year, or thereafter, the Burmese junta's days \nare numbered. Where do Burma's trading partners want to be then--on the \nright side of history, or having propped up an illegitimate regime \nuntil its last gasps?\n  No government can claim perfection in its respect for human rights, \nincluding my own government. We have made mistakes, and it has damaged \nour credibility as a nation that was instrumental in the creation of \nthe Universal Declaration.\n  But our own shortcomings are no excuse for other governments' actions \nto block U.N. resolutions condemning the crackdown in Burma or their \nrefusal to join us in imposing economic sanctions that could deal a \ndeath blow to a tyrannical regime.\n  And it is certainly no excuse for continuing to do lucrative business \ndeals with a government whose officials pocket the profits for \nthemselves while they starve, imprison and murder their people.\n  It is a testament to the spirit of the Burmese people, and to the \ncourage of Aung San Suu Kyi, that despite so many years of repression, \nthey remain as defiant and as dedicated to the ideals of democracy as \never. Our moral responsibility, the world's responsibility, is to \nsupport them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12763-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12763-S12764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE HOMEOWNERS' MORTGAGE AND EQUITY SAVINGS ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I want to say a \nfew words about S. 2133, the Homeowners' Mortgage and Equity Savings \nAct, which I introduced yesterday. This legislation addresses the very \nsevere problem of the many homeowners who are now in default on their \nmortgage payments. This problem has arisen largely because of the many \nhomeowners with adjustable rate mortgages who face increased interest \nrates and unexpected increases in their mortgage payments.\n  This is a complex matter, but in many cases, I think there is a real \nquestion as to whether lenders made adequate representations to \nborrowers. Regardless of whether the representations were adequate or \nnot, many borrowers are now confronted with interest rates they had not \nanticipated and mortgage payments that they can't afford. In the past \nyear, the percentage of homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages who \nare seriously delinquent either 90 days past due or in foreclosure--has \nnearly doubled. In my home State of Pennsylvania, the number of those \nwho are seriously delinquent has gone up by some 40 percent. The \nproblem is particularly severe among borrowers who had weak credit or \nlow incomes and obtained mortgages at subprime rates. The Center for \nResponsible Lending projects that some 2.2 million Americans with \nsubprime loans originated between 1998 and 2006 have lost or will lose \ntheir homes to foreclosure.\n  Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code currently give debtors breathing \nspace by imposing a stay on collection of debts, including mortgages, \nand prevents lenders from foreclosing for a period of time. During that \nperiod debtors are given the opportunity to get caught up on their \nmortgage payments. However, the current Code does not permit any \nmodification of mortgages.\n  Now with many homeowners facing possible bankruptcy due to their \nmortgages, some relief is necessary.\n  The legislation which I have introduced will provide a number of \nremedies. With respect to adjustable rate mortgages, it will allow \nbankruptcy judges to prevent or delay interest rate increases and to \nroll back interest rates that have already reset. This will enable the \nhomeowner to continue to pay down the principal amount that they took \non when they bought their house, but will give them relief from \nincreases in their payments due to resetting interest rates.\n  The bill also will allow the bankruptcy judges to waive early \nprepayment or prepayment penalties. Many of the borrowers face the \nsituation where they could refinance and get less risky mortgages with \nmanageable payments, but the penalties in their current mortgage \ncontracts are so stiff that they cannot refinance.\n  Now, the bill does not give bankruptcy judges the latitude to reduce \nthe principal on a mortgage. Senator Durbin introduced a bill yesterday \nthat goes beyond the bill I have introduced; it allows bankruptcy \njudges to reduce or ``cram down'' the principal on a mortgage in \naccordance with what the bankruptcy judge determines is the value of \nthe property. My bill would only allow the reduction of principal if \nthe lender and the homeowner agree.\n  I think there is a very significant risk in allowing cram down. If we \nallow cram down, lenders will factor the risk of having the principal \nvalue of their loan reduced into the interest they charge to future \nhome buyers. In other words, people who borrow in the future are going \nto pay more in interest if the lenders don't have the certainty that at \nleast the principal value of their loan will be recognized and not \nreduced. Under current circumstances, I think it is fair, on these \nadjustable rate mortgages--which really are the problem if delinquency \nrates are any indication--to allow judges to modify interest rate \nincreases which in many\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\ncases have been significant and in some cases the mortgage terms may \nhave been fraudulent or just basically unfair. But when it comes to \nreducing the principal, then I think we go too far.\n  Many of the consumer groups would prefer to see the bankruptcy judge \nhave the latitude to reduce the principal, and that might help those \nwho are in default now, but that will make it more difficult for those \nwho borrow in the future. That is because--to repeat--lenders will have \nto charge more interest to take into account this additional risk.\n  I have discussed the differences in our bills with Senator Durbin. We \ntried to come to terms and find an accommodation so that we could \nsupport the same legislation. However, it appears we do support \nlegislation directed at the same problem. The legislation I introduced \nis aimed at helping those caught up in the current crisis without \nmaking it harder on those Americans to own a home in the future.\n  The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction on bankruptcy. The Committee \nhas jurisdiction on the Durbin bill and on my bill, S. 2133. My \nposition is not set in concrete. However, I am opposed to what Senator \nDurbin seeks to accomplish and I am disinclined at this state based on \nthe investigation which my staff and I have made to support his bill.\n  It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee will have hearings on this \nimportant issue and bring in mortgage bankers, consumer groups and \ninvestors to give us a better idea as to the intensity of the problem \nand what really ought to be done. Perhaps at that point we can meld our \nideas into a common solution to the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12764-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nDisability Employment Awareness Month, NDEAM. Designated by Congress, \nthis month is observed every October to increase the public's \nunderstanding of issues involving individuals with disabilities and \ntheir role in America's workforce. It is a time for us to reflect on \npast gains and goals for the future as well.\n  Seventeen years ago, I commended the passage of the landmark \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, ADA, to help ensure the rights of \npeople with disabilities throughout various sectors of society. \nTogether with other Federal laws like the Vocational Rehabilitation Act \nand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the ADA has been \nkey to the progress made toward the full inclusion of people with \ndisabilities in daily life. We see reasons to cheer today, as more \npeople with disabilities succeed in school, enter the workforce, and \nparticipate in their communities.\n  More remains to be done, however. When Nevadans with disabilities \nshare their experiences with me, I hear many of the same struggles and \nchallenges in their stories. Employment is an issue especially foremost \non their minds, as it is for any person who wants to pursue the \nAmerican dream. And like all Americans, individuals with disabilities \ndeserve a fair shot to achieve as much success as their abilities and \ndetermination will allow.\n  I am heartened that this sense is spreading throughout the general \npublic, beyond those of us who see the positive contributions that \nAmericans with disabilities make as employees and coworkers every day. \nMuch of the increase in awareness is due to local organizations, such \nas Nevada JobConnect, Opportunity Village, the Southern Nevada Center \nfor Independent Living, SNCIL, and the Northern Nevada Center for \nIndependent Living. This year for example, SNCIL is partnering with the \nCity of Las Vegas to sponsor the 16th Annual Disability Awareness Day \non October 20. Similar events are expected to be held across the \ncountry in observance of National Disability Employment Awareness \nMonth.\n  While improving awareness is critical, especially for dispelling \nfalse stereotypes about people with disabilities, it isn't enough. \nDisparities on a wide range of economic and social dimensions point to \nsignificant barriers that remain for people with disabilities who want \na good job to give them not just an income, but also dignity and \nindependence. From listening to my constituents in Nevada, I also know \nthat the incentives between employment, health care benefits, and \neligibility for government-sponsored programs can interact in very \nproblematic ways.\n  I supported the passage of new laws to address these issues, such as \nthe Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act to give people \nwith disabilities greater access to Medicaid or Medicare coverage when \nthey go to work. I was also pleased when Congress passed the Family \nOpportunity Act to allow more children with disabilities to enroll in \nMedicaid, thereby alleviating an unfair pressure on their parents to \nforgo better jobs just to keep their family health coverage. Looking \nahead to the future, I will continue working to make sure that people \nwith disabilities can access the health care they need, especially as \nthey seek to move to economic self-sufficiency. We should not lose \nsight of other key priorities as well, including opening more doors to \neducation and expanding employment opportunities for those able to \nwork.\n  As we observe National Disability Employment Awareness Month this \nyear, let us reaffirm the importance of its ideals and goals. From \nemployers to policymakers, family members to people with disabilities \nthemselves, all Americans can join in the effort to ensure that \nindividuals with disabilities make the most of their potential--in the \nworkplace and in all areas of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12764-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12764-S12765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, since returning to session, much of our \ndiscussion has once again been dominated by Iraq. Given the tragedy of \nthe administration's Iraq policy and the need to change course, this is \nunderstandable. Yet Iraq's dominance has meant that many other critical \nforeign policy issues have been ignored or marginalized. From Latin \nAmerica to Russia, this administration has failed to develop or \nimplement any kind of coherent strategy.\n  Similarly, the crisis in Darfur demands more attention. For 4 years, \nthe world has watched this tragedy. That is right--for 4 long years. \nSadly, during this time the world has mostly stood by while yet another \ngenocide unfolded before its eyes. Many of us on both sides of the \naisle and in the international community have repeatedly called for \ngreater U.S. and global action.\n  President Bush has rightly called the situation in Darfur genocide. \nNew British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said that, ``Darfur is \nthe greatest humanitarian crisis the world faces today.'' Yet, despite \nthese statements, ultimately we have not done enough.\n  Today, we are at a critical juncture in Sudan. The genocide in Darfur \nhas increasingly become a complex conflict between many factions. \nRefugees have spilled into neighboring countries and humanitarian \nworkers are increasingly at risk. And just the other day, a rebel group \nbrutally killed 10 African Union peacekeepers in a surprise raid. \nSadly, the cost in lives, destruction, and human misery has been \nimmeasurable.\n  In late July the U.N. Security Council voted to implement a \nsignificantly increased United Nations-African Union peacekeeping \nforce. This peacekeeping force is desperately needed, and the United \nStates should work with the U.N. and the global community to make sure \nit is implemented as soon as possible. We in the Senate should also \nensure that adequate funds are available to help pay for this critical \nmission. But the peacekeepers are only one important step. Sudan also \nneeds a long-term political agreement among its many factions.\n  Upon taking office in January of this year, U.N. Secretary General \nBan Ki-moon said that ending the violence in Darfur was going to be one \nof his top priorities. I spoke to him in July about our shared concern \nand commend him for advancing the peacekeeping and diplomatic efforts. \nI believe his tireless work has made an important difference. In early \nSeptember, his efforts resulted in the announcement of formal peace \ntalks to begin later this month between the various factions and the \nSudanese Government.\n  These negotiations will be a critical step and deserve our strongest \nsupport. As Secretary Ban said during his recent trip, ``there must be \na peace to keep.''\n  Finally, we must hold Sudanese President Bashir to his commitment to\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\nallow peacekeepers and participate in the peace talks.\n  Early statements by the Government of Sudan said that it would \n``contribute positively to secure the environment for the \nnegotiations'' and ``facilitate the timely deployment'' of the 26,000 \nmember peacekeeping force. But we have heard these commitments before \nand then watched as President Bashir has continued fostering violence.\n  I, therefore, think it is critical that we maintain pressure on the \nSudanese Government to honor its commitments. The administration should \ncontinue its diplomatic efforts, and at the same time the Congress \nshould advance bipartisan legislation that I and others have introduced \nto increase economic pressure on the regime.\n  I commend Chairman Dodd and the Banking Committee for holding a \nhearing yesterday that focused on how best to apply such pressure, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to prepare legislation \nthat would impose sanctions on, bar Federal contracting with, and \nauthorize divestment from organizations that support the regime.\n  It is critical that the Sudanese Government understand that a lack of \ncooperation with the peacekeepers or the upcoming peace negotiations \nwill increase the possibility of such legislation being enacted.\n  Sadly, we have every reason to be skeptical of the regime's \nintentions.\n  For example, after agreeing to the peace talks, the Government of \nSudan brazenly appointed former Interior Minister Ahmad Harun one of \ntwo Sudanese officials wanted by the International Criminal Court for \nwar crimes--to lead a committee to investigate human rights abuses. As \nInterior Minister, Mr. Harun helped fund, recruit, and arm the \njingaweit militia which was directly involved in perpetuating the \ngenocide in Darfur. Mr. Harun's place is on trial in The Hague, not \ninvestigating violence he helped perpetuate.\n  Equally troubling are continued attacks on international aid workers \nas well as recent indications that Sudan has started placing \nrestrictions on early efforts to deploy U.N. forces.\n  Mr. President, the stakes are too high and the humanitarian crisis \nhas dragged on too long to allow any further backsliding by the \nSudanese Government. We must see the immediate deployment of the \npeacekeeping force and a concerted global effort at supporting a long-\nterm political settlement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12765-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12765-S12766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nprogram that is important to me and to the low-income children in this \ncountry: the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and want the program to cover all uninsured, lower income \nchildren. I fully support a reauthorization of this program, but I also \nsupport the President's decision to veto the flawed SCHIP bill sent to \nhim by Congress.\n  The SCHIP legislation that was vetoed by the President yesterday \nincludes frivolous spending, expands coverage to children already \ncovered by private insurance and neglects the original intent of the \nprogram--to provide health coverage for low-income children. While I \nsupport the reauthorization of SCHIP, I do not support legislation that \nexpands the program and serves as an initial step towards government-\nrun health care.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program works! It has enrolled \nlow-income eligible children in a health coverage program to ensure \nthat they have adequate access to coverage and services. While the \nprogram is certainly a success, there are some oversights that need to \nbe addressed. Congress has been given the opportunity to tackle these \nissues with the reauthorization of the program. In Colorado we have yet \nto enroll all of the currently eligible children of low-income families \ninto the SCHIP program. We should focus our attention on enrolling \nthese children instead of fighting over an expansion of the program. \nExpanding eligibility requirements would only make it harder for the \nneediest children in Colorado, and the Nation, to receive coverage.\n  I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and want the program to cover all uninsured, lower income \nchildren. I support giving Americans the opportunity to access health \ncare, and giving them the ability to purchase affordable suitable \nprivate coverage. I support the effort by many Members of this body to \nspend in a fiscally responsible way, without increasing taxes or using \nbudget gimmicks. More importantly, I support putting children first.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program was put in place to \ncover low-income children who would otherwise not have access to health \ncoverage. The SCHIP agreement that passed the House and Senate not only \ndisregards the original intent of the program, but also reauthorizes \nthe program in a fiscally irresponsible manner that will end up costing \nthe taxpayers $12.5 billion in the final year of the authorization. For \nexample, the revenue source for the reauthorization is being sold as a \ntax increase on cigarettes which is expected to reduce the number of \npeople smoking, but this is an unstable revenue source. I don't agree \nwith paying for a program as important as the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program with an unsustainable income.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program can be reauthorized in \na way that increases the number of enrolled children who are currently \neligible for the program. While I oppose the expansion of the program, \nI do not oppose reauthorization and therefore I am cosponsoring the \nSCHIP Extension Act of 2007, S. 2086, which will fully fund the current \nprogram for 18 months, and give Congress more time to discuss the best \nway to reauthorize the program. SCHIP was scheduled to expire on \nSeptember 30 and it is imperative that Congress reauthorize the current \nprogram to ensure that children of lower income families still receive \nhealth coverage. I will also be cosponsoring the Kids First Act, as an \nalternative proposal for the reauthorization of the SCHIP program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12766-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12766-S12767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Gerald J. Cassidy\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Carmel, \nIN. Gerald Cassidy, 31 years old, died September 21 in Fort Knox, KY. \nGerald was on medical hold after sustaining injuries in Iraq from a \nroadside bomb. With an optimistic future before him, Gerald risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Gerald was a dedicated and longtime member of the Army. In 1992, \nGerald enlisted in the Army Reserve after spending his summers at \nCulver Military Academy in northern Indiana, where he was named an \nadjutant commander in charge of 85 other academy goers and was a member \nof the Black Horse Troop, an elite equestrian group. In 2003, Gerald \njoined the Indiana National Guard where he was assigned to the 152nd \nMechanized Infantry. He served in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2004 and in \nHurricane Katrina Operation Vigilant Relief in 2005. Sgt. Cassidy \nreceived the Humanitarian Service Medal for his stateside service.\n  Known at ``G.J.'' to his family, Gerald was a natural leader. He \nvolunteered to serve in Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard, who had \nan opening in their team. He was assigned to Battery C, 2nd Battalion, \n150th Field Artillery in Lebanon. For his great service and sacrifice, \nGerald's family was presented with the Purple Heart, the Combat Action \nBadge and the Indiana Distinguished Service Award. Gerald is survived \nby his wife Melissa Castillo Cassidy; his daughter Abbey, 5 years old; \nhis son Isaac, 3 years old; his mother and stepfather John and Kay \nMcMullen; his father Gerald J. Cassidy; his sister Lisa Hignite; and \nhis brother Darrin Cassidy.\n  Today, I join Gerald's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Gerald, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief. Today and always, \nGerald will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made \nwhile dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Gerald's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot\n\n[[Page S12767]]\n\ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave \nmen, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far \nabove our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor \nlong remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did \nhere.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years \nago, as I am certain that the impact of Gerald's actions will live on \nfar longer that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Gerald J. Cassidy in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Gerald's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Gerald.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12767-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12767-S12768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a challenge \nfacing our military forces on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. These \nforces are facing an urgent need for a precision indirect fire munition \norganic to the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams and Stryker Brigade Combat \nTeams.\n  In the last 3 months there have been two Operational Needs Statements \nsubmitted by the units deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. I have \nincluded these statements for the Record. Both of these documents \nhighlight the urgent need to field a precision capability for the 120mm \nmortar: the main, and in some cases the only, indirect fire support \navailable to our infantry in the close fight.\n  The commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps wrote in July:\n\n       This capability is critically needed within the next 12 \n     months. As troop levels in theater begin to drop, our units \n     can not afford to miss any opportunities to kill the enemy \n     due to lack of organic precision indirect fire. Without it, \n     IBCT's must resort to: slower reinforcing fires; committing \n     soldiers to an assault; or missing the opportunity \n     altogether.\n\n  In August the Commander of Joint Fires in Afghanistan described the \nproblem starkly:\n\n       The Rules of Engagement for the Afghanistan Theater of \n     Operations limits the use of conventional artillery and \n     mortar projectiles in support of combat operations. Recently, \n     COMISAF restricted all preparatory fires and pre-assault \n     fires to precision guided munitions and systems. Currently, \n     Afghanistan requires two Light Brigade Combat teams with no \n     organic surface precision strike capability. Our enemy takes \n     advantage of that gap by hiding among the local populace. \n     Additionally, the COIN environment in Afghanistan requires \n     the minimization of collateral damage.\n\n  Both of these field commanders specifically call for the fielding of \nprecision guided mortars for the existing 120mm mortar system as \nquickly as possible.\n  It is my understanding that since the precision guided mortar \nmunition, PGMM, fell prey to the Army budget cutters, the program has \ndemonstrated remarkable test results. In fact, I thank the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee for rejecting the Army's request to \nreprogram additional funding away from PGMM.\n  I ask that the subcommittee continue to carry this item forward to be \nconsidered as part of a final conference report or supplemental, \npending the results of ongoing Army reviews of the program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the two documents which I \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                    Fort Bragg, NC, July 19, 2007.\n     Memorandum thru Commander, United States Army Forces Command \n         (AFCS), 1777 Hardee Ave, SW., Fort McPherson, GA 30330-\n         1062.\n     For Headqurters, Department of the Army (DAMO-RQ), 400 Army \n         Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0400.\n     Subject: Operational Needs Statement (ONS) for Organic \n         Precision Indirect for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams \n         (IBCT).\n       1.

Problem: Termination of the Precision Guided Mortar \n     Munition (PGMM) has left IBCTs without the organic precision \n     indirect capability. In our current environment, our enemy \n     takes advantage of that gap by hiding among the local \n     populace. The tasks of finding, fixing, and killing or \n     capturing the enemy must be executed in rapid sucession or \n     the opportunity is lost. Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) \n     and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) have organic option \n     (Excalibur) available; the IBCTs do not.\n       5. Justification:\n       a. The IBCTs' requirement for organic precision indirect \n     munitions is well documented. There is an approved \n     requirement for PGMM. The Army Field Artillery School is now \n     writing a requirement document for a precision guided 105mm \n     munition. This headquarters submitted an ONS for a precision \n     guided 105mm munition.\n       b. Lacking the required accuracy, IBCT's howitzers and \n     mortars remain silent while the IBCTs' headquarters request \n     GMLRS, close air support, or fires from an adjacent HBCT or \n     SBCT. Coordinating and directing fires through multiple \n     levels of commands consumes time and opportunity. Direct fire \n     missile systems (ITAS and JAVELIN) do not meet this \n     requirement due to their limited range and precision.\n       c. This capability is critically needed within the next 12 \n     months. As troop levels in theater begin to drop, our units \n     cannot afford to miss any opportunity to kill the enemy due \n     to lack of organic precision indirect fire. Without it, IBCTs \n     must resort to: slower reinforcing fires; committing Soldiers \n     to an assault; or missing the opportunity altogether.\n       6. System Characteristics: Organic precision indirect \n     capability must: be organic to the IBCT and use existing \n     assets (i.e. mortars and howitzers); have accuracy consistent \n     with the Excalibur or GMLRS; have at least the range of the \n     current M120 120mm Mortar; and in the objective capability, \n     should have both GPS and laser guidance.\n       7. Operational Concept: An organic precision indirect \n     munition will allow comanders to engage targets in \n     environments that ordinarily require putting Soldiers and \n     non-combatants in harms way or cause unnecessary collateral \n     damage.\n       8. Organization Concept: The organic mortar platoons or \n     artillery battalion will fire this munition.\n       9. Support Requirements: If a munition uses laser guidance, \n     then there must be a corresponding increase in laser \n     designators. Full MTOE authorization, not Force Feasibility \n     Review sourcing levels, of the Lightweight Laser Designator \n     Rangefinder (LLDR) and M707 Knight is required to make a \n     laser guided capability viable.\n       10. Availability: Before its termination, the PGMM met the \n     requirement. There are also 105mm precision munitions \n     available.\n       11. Recommendation: Field an organic precision indirect \n     munition to deploying IBCTs within 12 months.\n       12.

Problem: The Rules of Engagement for the Afghanistan \n     Theater of Operations limits the use of conventional \n     artillery and mortar projectiles in support of combat \n     operations. Recently, COMISAF restricted all preparatory \n     fires and pre-assault fires to precision guided munitions and \n     systems. Currently Afghanistan requires two Light Brigade \n     Combat Teams with no organic surface to surface precision \n     strike capability. Our enemy takes advantage of that gap by \n     hiding among the local populace. Additionally, the COIN \n     environment in Afghanistan requires a minimization of \n     collateral damage whenever joint fires are employed.\n       4. Justification:\n       a. In order to meet theater ROE requirements for precision \n     guidance and provide our maneuver commanders with a dedicated \n     105mm and 120mm capability that minimizes collateral damage, \n     precision munitions for both the M119A2 and 120mm Mortar are \n     required.\n       b. The addition of the 105mm and 120mm PGM will give \n     commanders a more prolific economy of force. Currently the \n     limited Close Air Support (CAS) platforms are the only asset \n     with the ability to fire precision guided munitions. This \n     ability will give the BCT commanders the capability to strike \n     a\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\n     target where time is sensitive or awaiting CAS to arrive on \n     station will encumber a mission's accomplishment. This \n     capacity will minimize the number of CAS sorties from being \n     pulled from its original mission, thus economizing force.\n       c. CJTF-82's acquisition of 105mm/120mm PGMs will minimize \n     the volume of fire that is required to destroy a target with \n     surface to surface unguided munitions. Within a three day \n     period the average amount of munitions fired within the two \n     BCTs battlespace are: 97 high explosive 105mm rounds and 72 \n     high explosive 120mm rounds. These PGM munitions will \n     ultimately reduce the amount of munitions required to destroy \n     targets. Providing commanders with precision strikes that \n     need no adjustment while lessening the amount of ammunition \n     resupply missions.\n       d. These precision guided munitions would provide CJTF-82 \n     with a dedicated capability to attack various target sets \n     with precision by all of its major organic artillery and \n     mortar systems. The increased accuracy and effectiveness of \n     these munitions would provide the ground commander the \n     ability to employ fires in support of MOUT and troops in \n     close proximity of enemy forces while decreasing the \n     possibility of collateral damage.\n       5. System Characteristics: While several variants of \n     precision guided munitions are in the testing and development \n     phase for the 105mm howitzer and the 120mm mortar, a low \n     circular error probable (CEP) would be required for any \n     fielded munitions. Additionally, the nature of operations in \n     theater would require any precision guided munitions to use \n     both GPS based guidance system and laser guidance.\n       6. Operational Concept: The employment of these munitions \n     would be at numerous forward operating bases and combat \n     outposts cross the CJOA. This operational concept would \n     enhance the ground commanders' ability to conduct all weather \n     precision strikes against the enemy positions in keeping with \n     ISAF's restrictions on the use of indirect fires.\n       7. Organizational Concept: The 105mm howitzer precision \n     guided munitions will be issued to the field artillery and \n     battalions of each brigade combat team to support maneuver \n     elements with precision guided fires while minimizing of \n     collateral damage. The 120mm mortar precision guided \n     munitions will be issued to the battalions who own battle \n     space within each brigade combat team to support their \n     maneuver elements with precision guided fires while \n     minimizing of collateral damage\n       8. Procurement Objective: CJTF-82 urgently requests the \n     immediate procurement and fielding of these munitions in \n     order to meet COMISAF's restrictions for the application of \n     Joint Fires within the CJOA and provide organic indirect fire \n     support with precision strike capability for all maneuver \n     elements conducting combat operations in Afghanistan.\n       9. Support Requirements:\n       a. If a munition uses laser guidance, then there must be a \n     corresponding increase in laser designators. Full MTOE \n     authorization, not Force Feasibility Review sourcing levels, \n     of the Lightweight Laser Designator (LLDR) and M707 Knight is \n     required to make a laser guided capability viable.\n       b. CJTF-82 would require initial contractor and mobile \n     training team (MTT) support for this rapid fielding.\n       10. Availability: Production and fielding of the \n     projectiles is currently in the RDTE phase. These munitions \n     are not Army programs of record.\n       11. Recommendation: The Department of the Army approves and \n     endorses the procurement and rapid fielding of a Precision \n     Guided Munitions for the 105 mm howitzer and 120mm mortar in \n     support of Operation Enduring Freedom 07-09.\n       12. The point of contact for this memorandum is MAJ Kelly \n     Webster, CJ3 Chief of Fires, Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, \n     Kelly.I.webster@citf76.centcom.mil, DSN 318-231-4024.\n                                          Mark A. Murray, COL. FA,\n                              Joint Fires and Effects Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I filed an amendment which would \nappropriate the necessary funds to require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to develop a pilot program to test entry document verification \ntechnology. This technology allows border agents to quickly check \ntravel document such as drivers' licenses, passports, and visas against \na stored database of legitimate domestic and international travel \ndocuments. L1 Communications, a company with a plant in Wilmington, MA, \nis helping produce this technology and would be an eligible company for \nthis funding.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report stated that ``for terrorists, travel \ndocuments are as important as weapons.'' The report concluded that \n``better technology and training to detect terrorist travel documents \nare the most important immediate steps to reduce America's \nvulnerability to clandestine entry.'' It recommended that the \nGovernment develop a strategy to thwart terrorist travel that would \nincorporate better document authentication technology. Unfortunately, \nthe technology that Customs and Border Protection, CBP, uses to \nauthenticate travel documents is no better now than on 9/11.\n  The absence of advanced document authentication technology often \nforces border agents to eyeball travel documents--a makeshift approach \nthat has proven to be inadequate. In 2006, investigators with the \nGovernmental Accountability Office, GAO, were able to enter the United \nStates from Canada and Mexico by showing CBP agents counterfeit \ndrivers' licenses and an expired, altered U.S. diplomatic passport. The \nGAO used commercially available computer software to produce its travel \ndocuments. Amazingly, the GAO found that it was easier for its \ninvestigators to cross into the United States using fake travel \ndocuments than during an identical 2003 investigation. The GAO is \ncurrently drafting a followup report that will cite automated document \nauthentication technology as a method to improve border security.\n  My amendment requires DHS to develop a pilot program to test \nautomated document authentication technology at various ports of entry \nwithin 6 months. This technology is already widely used by domestic \nagencies, including the Coast Guard, NASA, and the Capitol Police, as \nwell as by foreign governments, such as Australia, Japan, and Sweden. \nReferring to the 9/11 hijackers, the Commission reported that \n``analyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns \ncould have allowed authorities to intercept 4 to 15 hijackers.''\n  We must not allow another 9/11. At a time when protecting our \nhomeland against terrorists and other illicit actors remains the \nparamount national security priority, I believe it is critical that we \nimplement this pilot program to test widely available document \nauthentication technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12768-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12768-S12769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EARMARKS DISCLOSURE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, the explanation of managers accompanying \nthe bill today is not as expansive as it could have been in regard to \nsome sections of the bill. To ensure that my intent, and the intent of \nthe remainder of the conferees, is clear I want to provide additional \ndirection.\n  Section 1001(24) authorizes the remaining features of the Morganza to \nthe Gulf hurricane protection project. It is important to note that the \nHouse, Senate, and conferees recognized the importance of advancing \nthis project beyond the initial authorization of segment J-1 and the \nadditional funding and authorization provided in Public Law 109-148 and \nPublic Law 109-234, with the full understanding of concerns raised \nregarding the potential impact of the project on wetlands--including \nthose raised in the administration's Statement of Administration Policy \nrelated to this bill. The conferees believe that existing law, \nincluding section 902 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 \nand section 7005 of this bill, provides more than sufficient \nflexibility to make any modifications deemed necessary and, subject to \nthe availability of appropriations, expect the project to move \nimmediately to the construction phase.\n  The conferees recognize that the Morganza to the Gulf project was \ninitiated in 1992. Congress authorized the full project in the Water \nResources Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106-541, but Corps of \nEngineers' delays resulted in the failure of the command to meet the \nstatutory deadline required to implement the project. The 15 years it \nhas taken to reach this point have left Terrebonne Parish and portions \nof Lafourche Parish very vulnerable to storm surge, hurricane and flood \ndamage, and the loss of life and property. The Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency has expended well over $100 million in public and \nprivate assistance grants in recent years in response to damages that \nwould have been prevented had the project been in place.\n  The conferees understood that modifications to the Morganza project \nmay be required. These include but are not limited to changes related \nto wetlands, IPET recommendations, and other factors. The conferees \nalso understand that significant cost increases from the initial \nestimates were included in the 2002 and 2003 reports of the chief. \nThese increases are related to significant rises in labor and materials \ncosts as a result of activities responding to Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita and attributable to new standards for storm damage reduction and \nflood control projects related to IPET recommendations. The conferees \ndid not increase the project authorization due to the fact that section \n902 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 specifically \nprovides for cost increases related to ``changes in construction cost \napplied to unconstructed features'' and for increases related to \n``mitigation and other environmental actions''.\n  As was mandated by Congress in the past, the Secretary shall make the \nHouma Lock a top priority and expedite this feature, in addition to \nother features that will provide important protection to vulnerable \nareas. The Secretary should consider integrating the construction of \nthe Houma Lock with modifications of the feature authorized in section \n7006(e)(3)(A)(i), only if the integration will not cause delays to this \nfeature.\n  Should significant additional features or increases in protection \nlevels be warranted, the Secretary should consider the implementation \nof these improvements under section 211 of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1996. It is noted that the Army did not notify \nCongress of any additional authorization needs for this project. It is \nthe conferees' intent that this project move forward as soon as \npossible with no further congressional authorization. Delays in \nprotection for this area cannot continue.\n  Section 1001(25) authorizes the Port of Iberia access improvement and \nVermilion parish storm surge protection project. It is the intent that \nthe Corps provide meaningful storm protection to Vermilion Parish in an \nexpedited manner without delays to the deepening project.\n  Section 1004(a)(7) directs the Army Corps of Engineers to study and \ncarry out a project to dredge and maintain the Napoleon Avenue \nContainer Terminal berthing area in the Port of New Orleans at a depth \nnot to exceed the authorized channel depth of the Mississippi River \nship channel. Deepening of that berthing area will ensure that the full \ntransportation benefits of the authorized channel depth of the \nMississippi River ship channel will be realized by the adjacent port \nterminal. This small navigation enhancement project will create \nsignificant economic and business benefits for the port, and aid in the \ncontinuing recovery of the greater New Orleans area.\n  Section 3081 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to credit the State of \nLouisiana for cost associated with mitigating the impact of freshwater \ndiversions on oyster beds. It is the intent that ``relocating'' \nincludes any means to remove or relocate the interests in the oyster \nbeds from the impact area. In some cases, this may include leaving the \noyster beds in place. It is the understanding of the conferees that \noyster beds could serve as a form of protection from further coastal \nland and wetlands loss.\n  Section 3082 provides for the relocation of facilities impacted by \nthe closure of the Mississippi River gulf outlet through the Department \nof Commerce's Economic Development Administration. The section also \nestablishes a loan program for businesses. The conferees specified that \nthe loan program is a ``revolving loan''; therefore, nothing in the \nbill restricts the loan authority to $85 million. It is the intent that \navailable loan authority be provided to businesses until demand is \nfully met. It is expected that the actual loan authority will far \nexceed the authorized funding level.\n  Section 3084 authorizes the Corps to maintain responsibility for \nlong-term costs associated with the Algiers Canals Levees portion of \nthe Westbank and Vicinity project. Subsection (c) is intended to apply \nonly to work performed under the original authorization. Ongoing work \non the project is based upon authorization and funding provided in the \nvarious emergency supplemental appropriations acts related to \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. The cost share included in subsection (c) \nshall not apply to the work funded in those acts.\n  Section 4101 directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct \na review of disaster debris removal policy related to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita. It is the intent that the GAO shall coordinate the \ndata required to determine the appropriate findings with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers. The EPA and \nCorps are expected to fully cooperate with the GAO and should be given \nthe opportunity to comment and respond to the GAO's findings as is \ncustomary with these reports. Should any adverse findings result, it is \nthe intent\n\n[[Page S12770]]\n\nthat the appropriate agencies immediately respond to such findings.\n  Section 5083 directs the Corps to complete the supplemental EIS \nrelated to the lock project by July 01, 2008. As is clear in the bill \nlanguage, it is expected that this mandate be met. The provision does \nnot provide for alternative deadlines or procedures for delay. \nAppropriate planning and schedule compressions should be applied \nimmediately.\n  Section 5084 clarifies that a previous meeting shall serve as the \nrequirement for a stakeholders meeting. The effect of this provision is \nthat construction grants may be awarded as part of the Lake \nPontchartrain Basin Program.\n  Section 5157(14) authorizes improvements to the Larose to Golden \nMeadow, LA, project by the non-Federal interest to be reimbursed by the \nSecretary. It is intended that these improvements include the \nconversion of the Leon Theriot Floodgate into a lock and improvements \nrequired to advance protection to, meet or exceed the 100-year level of \nflood protection as determined under the National Flood Insurance \nProgram at the time of construction of the improvements. It is expected \nthat this authorization will complement the $90 million in improvements \nauthorized under section 7015.\n  Title VII authorizes 15 coastal protection and restoration projects \nand additional flood protection and storm damage reduction. In the case \nof each project, it is likely that the authority provided by section \n902 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 will be exercised. \nIt is noted that this authority provides for cost increases of 20 \npercent in addition to those increases attributable to inflation, \n``changes in construction cost applied to unconstructed features'' and \nfor other cost increases. It is expected that all deadlines will be met \nand each project will advance in a timely manner.\n  Section 7004 establishes a Federal-State task force. The conferees \nintended that the three representatives of the State of Louisiana each \nserve at the pleasure of the Governor of that State.\n  Section 7005 authorizes the review and modification of water resource \nprojects in the Louisiana coastal area project area to alleviate \nconflicts in project features. The requirement to review ``each'' \nproject in the LCA project area should not be construed as a \nrequirement to conduct an in depth review of all projects. The \nSecretary, in coordination with the State of Louisiana, is expected to \nidentify those projects that are reasonable candidates for modification \nrather than wasting significant resources reviewing all projects in \ndetail.\n  Section 7006, of the Louisiana Coastal Area Title, title VII, \nauthorizes a science and technology program specifically for the \ncoastal Louisiana ecosystem. This science and technology program will \nprovide the accurate scientific and technological advances needed to \nimprove the knowledge of the physical, chemical, geological, \nbiological, and cultural baseline conditions in the coastal Louisiana \necosystem and related natural and built assets.\n  Section 7006 (a)(2)(3) and (4) of title VII of H.R. 1495 already \nprovides some of the purposes and direction for carrying out the \nscience and technology program. However, since there is no further \nreport language clarification in the accompanying conference report \nlanguage, I want to provide further direction, and the conferees \nintent, specifically as it applies to the purposes and organizations \nthat should drive this important research program so that the Louisiana \ncoastal area projects authorized by this important bill are done right \nthe first time.\n  It is my firm intent, and that of the conferees, that the science and \ntechnology program will be conducted through a Louisiana agency-\nuniversity-industry partnership led by the Long-term Estuary Assessment \nGroup, LEAG, and the Coastal Restoration & Enhancement for Science & \nTechnology, CREST, in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey \nNational Wetlands Research Center. The aim of this alliance is to \ncreate a cooperative science, engineering, and technology program to \nhelp policymakers, planners, and coastal resource managers use the \nlatest objective information on the built and natural environment to \nensure sustainable and productive coastal habitats and communities. \nThis program should respond directly to the challenges identified by \nthe task force and provide proactive solutions for the long-term \nsuccess of the program.\n  It is also the conferees intent that the science and technology \nprogram priority research areas shall also include the following \nefforts and purposes:\n  A. Scientific tools for coastal restoration. New tools, or refinement \nof existing tools, for carrying out coastal restoration in coastal \nLouisiana. This area includes evaluation of restoration techniques, \ndevelopment of new sensor and monitoring platform technologies, and \noperational approaches that are applicable to both ongoing and planned \nprojects in the coastal region of these States.\n  B. Human dimensions of coastal restoration efforts. Sociological and \neconomic information of direct use to managers and planners involved in \ncoastal restoration efforts. This area focuses on projects that can be \nof relevance to coastal habitat which includes but are not limited to \naspects such as land use, resource use and management, mitigation of \ncoastal habitat loss, legal or industrial matters, environmental \nhistory, socioeconomic and behavioral effects, values to publics, and \npublic awareness, sustainable neighborhood plan development, and \neducation. This information could also be useful and applicable to \nother regions.\n  C. Future perspectives. Concepts and approaches to guide future \nrestoration of the Louisiana coastal ecosystem should also be \nconsidered. This includes field work, workshops, expert panels, reviews \nor syntheses of existing work. Specifically, projects should consider \nsustainable approaches to restoration that take into account future \nchanges such as existing and emerging contaminants, degradation of \ncoastal habitat resulting from planned human actions or policies, urban \nand natural ecosystem linkages, or the influence of variations in the \nclimate system on the coast. Efforts should be regional in scale and of \ndirect utility to agencies planning future restoration.\n  Southern Louisiana remains severely impacted by or vulnerable to \ncoastal erosion, sea level rise, and the loss and degradation of \nnatural wetland habitats. This long-term deterioration was exacerbated \nby the 2005 hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, which devastated much of \nLouisiana's coastal regions. Such a combination of factors puts at risk \nthe infrastructure of the region and the livelihood of its inhabitants, \npresenting an urgent need for a swift and successful response that will \nrestore the natural protective structures in the region and enhance the \necology. Successful restoration of any natural ecosystem requires sound \nunderstanding of the problems and how they developed, as well as \nclearly defined targets for what we expect from the system after \nrestoration. Scientific uncertainties and technological inadequacies \nmust not limit our ability to respond to the needs of coastal \ncommunities. Rather, advances in science and technology should be \nintegrated directly into restoration programs to ensure that coastal \nhabitat restoration is implemented cost-effectively and successfully \nsustains coastal resources.\n  Section 7007 (b) directs the Secretary to accept as a non-Federal \ncost share other Federal funds in certain cases. In addition to other \nFederal programs and resources, it is the intent that the provision \nshall clarify any misunderstanding that funds resulting from sections \n383 and 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-58, and \ntitle I of Division C of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, \nPublic Law 109-432 are eligible as a non-Federal match. This statement \nshould not be construed as to prejudice any State's ability to use the \nfunds specified from the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 as a \nnon-Federal match for any program or any other use.\n  Section 7012(a) authorizes the modification of the outfall canals on \nLake Pontchartrain. The conference agreement provides for the \nconstruction of closure structures on the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue \nand London Avenue canals at or near the lakefront at Lake \nPontchartrain. It also authorizes the installation of new pumping \nstations associated with the outfall canals. It is the intent of the \nconferees that the Secretary continues ongoing efforts to\n\n[[Page S12771]]\n\nimplement an appropriate solution to the outfall canal and pumping \nchallenges which would be constructed under this authority. Evacuating \nstorm water to the Mississippi River, rather than into the outfall \ncanals, should be considered as part of any comprehensive plan \nconstructed under this authority.\n  The conference agreement also includes bill language that authorizes \nthe replacement or modification of non-Federal levees in Plaquemines \nParish. The conferees urge the Secretary to expedite efforts that will \nsupplement or compliment existing Federal protection adjacent to the \nMississippi River banks associated with the New Orleans to Venice \nproject.\n  Section 7012(b) clarifies that all work authorized pursuant to \nsections 7012(a)(2) through 7012(a)(9) and Section 7013 shall be \nperformed at full Federal expense.\n  Section 7013 authorizes the closure and restoration of the \nMississippi River gulf outlet ecosystem. It is the intent that the full \nrestoration of the area be included as part of the program. The \nSecretary should progress with the closure as soon as possible and \nshould consider using funds and authorization provided in Public Law \n109-148 and Public Law 109-234 immediately upon enactment of this act.\n  Section 7014 requires the Secretary to submit actual project \nrecommendations as part of the Louisiana coastal protection and \nrestoration analysis and design. Despite several communications, the \nSecretary has continued down a course that is entirely inconsistent \nwith congressional intent in regard to this analysis and design. It \nremains very concerning that the Secretary considers expending $20 \nmillion to develop a document that will provide little guidance and not \nadvance future protection efforts a wise use of taxpayer funds. \nFurther, it is inexcusable that the Congress was forced to include this \ndirective in statute to refocus this analysis and design on the intent \nof Congress. The original intent of the authorization was clear that \nCorps was to provide actual project recommendations, design, and a \ntechnical report. The intentional mismanagement of this effort by the \nAssistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works is concerning, will \ncause delays in protection improvements, and may result in additional \nloss of life and property.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a group of 96 World War II veterans from the Acadiana region \nof Louisiana that is making their way to Washington this weekend. Here \nthey will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Marine Corps \nmemorials as well as Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the \nTomb of the Unknowns.\n  The trip to the Nation's Capital this Saturday is being paid for by \ngroup in Lafayette, LA, called Louisiana HonorAir. The organization is \nhonoring each surviving Louisiana veteran by giving them a chance to \nsee the memorials dedicated to their service. So far this year, there \nhave been two trips to these Washington memorials and three more are \nplanned, including this one.\n  World War II was the deadliest conflict in our history. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the \nlong war.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 44,000 living WWII veterans, \nand every one of them has their own heroic tale of their experience in \nachieving a noble victory of freedom over tyranny.\n  Mervin Harmon from Lafayette was one of the Tuskegee Airmen, our \ncountry's first African American pilots. While serving his country, he \nhad to endure the racism that was prevalent in our society during that \nera. Mervin, who is 80 now, joined the service at 18, becoming a \nmechanic and crew chief at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He \noversaw the P-51 Mustang fighters the Airmen flew during the war, \nensuring that planes were safe for battle. When Mervin trained at Ft. \nSmith in Arkansas, he remembers German prisoners of war eating in \nrestaurants while black MPs guarding them were not allowed to be \nserved.\n  Mervin and the other Tuskegee airmen helped our country bridge the \nracial divide. He went on to serve in Lafayette Parish government for \n14 years and had an upholstery business in the city.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring Mervin Harmon, the other 95 \nLouisiana heroes we welcome to Washington this weekend, and Louisiana \nHonorAir for making these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12771-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12771-S12772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IDAHO'S ANGELS IN ADOPTION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am privileged today to honor an \nIdaho couple, Rick and Tina Betzer, who have been blessed with a heart \nand gift to minister to children. Rick and Tina are being honored today \nas Angels in Adoption by the Congressional Adoption Coalition. God \ngrants each of us gifts; some of us use them, others don't, and the \nworld is worse off for that neglect. Today I will share a different \nstory--it is about two people who have chosen to use their gift to make \nan extraordinary difference in the lives of others. Rick and Tina tell \ntheir story better than anyone. With the permission of the Chair, I \nwill include their personal family statement as part of the Record. \nThis is text from Rick and Tina Betzer's personal testimony:\n\n       We met in Jr. High and have been best friends since. We \n     just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. We are \n     privileged to be called mom and dad by 16 wonderful children. \n     Our oldest 5 are biological and the youngest 11 have been \n     adopted over the last 10 years. Our first born is Eric. He is \n     now 31 years old married and has 2 step sons and 2 beautiful \n     little girls. He owns his own tree-trimming business, and \n     they raise quarter horses on their small farm in Chester \n     Idaho. Next is our daughter Gina, who is now 30 years old. \n     She is married to Zac Clawson and they have 3 sons. Zac works \n     for the Federal Government in Washington D.C. They live in \n     Dumfries Virginia. Next is our daughter Amber. She is 28 \n     years old. At this time she is living with us in Shelley and \n     she works for Eastern Idaho Special services and is a \n     transportation specialist for the homeless shelter in Idaho \n     Falls. Our daughter Jessica is 22 years old and is married to \n     Jacob Hackman. They live in Boise and are expecting their \n     first child in June. Our daughter Brittney is 20 years old, \n     graduated High School with honors, and is attending BYU \n     Hawaii. We moved to Shelley in August 2004, from Ashton where \n     we had been living for the past 15 years. While in Ashton, \n     both Rick and I worked for the State of Idaho Department of \n     Juvenile Corrections as a Nurse and as a Therapy Technician. \n     It was at the Juvenile correction center that we became aware \n     of the need for committed foster parents. In the fall of \n     1990, we became licensed foster parents. Over the next 10 \n     years, we fostered 38 children. On December 12, 1993, a case \n     worker knocked on our door with a beautiful 2 year old boy in \n     his arms. At first sight, we knew this little guy belonged to \n     us. This was the first day of the rest of our lives. We \n     adopted Shallon 3 years later. We thought we were a complete \n     family, then, several years later, we were prompted to call \n     LDS services to apply to adopt a special needs baby. A few \n     months later we did not have a baby, but 3 active little \n     kids. Breann, Daniel, and Courtney joined our family at the \n     ages of 5, 6, and 7. At that point we were sure our family \n     was complete. Again, several years went by and we could not \n     get the thought out of our minds that someone was missing \n     from our family. I talked Rick into another home study, and \n     1\\1/2\\ months later we were headed to Florida to pick up our \n     9-week-old daughter, Zoe. At this point, we started to joke \n     that we would stop at 12 kids, not ever intending to go that \n     far, then someone introduced us to the Internet. Thousands of \n     foster children in the United States that are awaiting \n     adoption are listed there. Three little children pulled me in \n     and I contacted their case workers. One was in Texas, one was \n     in Ohio and one in Missouri. We were hoping to be able to \n     adopt one of the three. During this time, Tazier came home \n     for good--he had been our foster son 4 years earlier. A month \n     after his arrival, we brought D'Asia home from Ohio then, 3 \n     months after that, we brought Isabelle home from Missouri, \n     but no word from Texas. Again, we thought we are done. Then, \n     a year later, a phone call from Georgia: Were we interested \n     in one more child? We hesitated and the case worker read us \n     his profile off the Internet. Half way through we stopped her \n     and said ``that's Dakota; he lives in Texas.'' She almost \n     dropped the phone, and asked how we knew that--there were \n     thousands of kids on the Net. We explained that his picture \n     had been on our\n\n[[Page S12772]]\n\n     refrigerator for 2 years! It took almost 3 years from the \n     time we saw him and a case worker in Georgia that didn't know \n     either us or this little guy, but in September of 2002, \n     Dakota came home. While in Texas picking Dakota up from his \n     foster home, Rick heard a noise from a back bedroom of the \n     home and went to investigate, he came back into the room with \n     our next son in his arms, Delarion. He came home in September \n     2003.\n       Our children have changed our lives in many ways. Our world \n     consists of therapists, special education and doctors. Our \n     van could find its own way to Salt Lake and Primary \n     Children's Hospital. We are on a first-name basis with \n     doctors and nurses there and in Idaho Falls at Eastern Idaho \n     Regional Medical Center. From February to November of last \n     year, our children had 9 surgeries and countless procedures \n     that enable them to function as best they can. We had 3 \n     surgeries scheduled in September. Our days are filled with \n     medications, tube feedings, diapers, bottles, wheel chairs, \n     leg braces, glasses, hearing aids and, above all, miracles. \n     It is so humbling to watch these children overcome the \n     obstacles in their lives. Nothing seems to stop them; they \n     have more determination than all of us put together. We \n     remember a Monday night a few years back when, as Tina sat in \n     a chair in our living room holding our 5 year old daughter \n     Zoe, Zoe reached over to the end table and picked up her \n     bottle put the nipple in her mouth and took a drink. We \n     cried. This was a little girl who doctors told us to walk \n     away from, a little girl born with only half a brain, that \n     specialists said would only eat and sleep the rest of her \n     life. At the age of 3, she started playing songs on the \n     piano, by ear because she is blind, with her left hand \n     because her right one doesn't work; a little girl who can \n     scoot on her behind across the floor with amazing speed; a \n     little girl who sings country music, says her ABC's, and \n     counts to 22. These are the miracles in our lives--a little \n     boy born weighing just one pound whose mother was found lying \n     unconscious on the ground in a hospital parking lot, a little \n     boy so tiny that he was thought to be a girl for the first \n     month of his life, a little boy who at the age of 4 would \n     never walk or talk, who now, at the age of eight, runs up to \n     us, puts his little face to ours and says, I want to take a \n     bath. These are some of the reasons why we do what we do . . \n     .\n\n  Rick and Tina are more than deserving of the distinguished honor of \n2007 Angels in Adoption. Their daily challenges are much more than most \nof us could imagine, let alone choose to experience at any time in our \nlives: they have chosen to become parents to children with disabilities \nincluding quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy, blindness, vision \nimpairedness, hearing loss, auditory neuropathy, traumatic brain \ninjury, fetal alcohol syndrome, reactive attachment disorder, attention \ndeficit disorder and genetic optic nerve atrophy. They are selfless \nexamples of a loving commitment of time, energy and resources. Perhaps \nmost difficult, but most rewarding as well, they have committed their \nhearts and emotions to children in need. The Betzers humble us with \ntheir actions they are the angels in their children's lives and \nexamples to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12772-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING THE UNITED STATES WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the great joys of my job as \na Senator is the opportunity to recognize exceptional people. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to recognize seven exceptional people: \nIvana Hong, Nastia Liukin, Samanthat Peszek, Alicia Sacramone, Bridget \nSloan, Shayla Worley, and Shawn Johnson. These young ladies make up the \nU.S. women's gymnastics team.\n  In September of this year at the World Artistic Gymnastics \nChampionship in Stuttgart, Germany, the U.S. women's team won a total \nof four gold, two silver, and one bronze medal, placing them first \noverall in the women's team competition. I congratulate the members of \nthis team, their coaches, and families on their success and for their \nexemplary representation of our country.\n  As an Iowan, I would like to recognize a particular member of the \nU.S. women's team, Ms. Shawn Johnson of West Des Moines, IA. Ms. \nJohnson won the all-around women's gymnastics title at the 2007 World \nArtistic Gymnastics Championship. With this great achievement, she \nbecame just the fourth U.S. woman ever to win a world all-around title.\n  Receiving such a title takes incredible talent and athletic ability. \nBut, without a doubt, it also takes a lot of hard work. At the age of \n3, Ms. Johnson began her gymnastic training at Chow's Gymnastics in \nWest Des Moines, IA, where she continues to train today. As a result of \nyears of hard work and training, she has competed and won at \nprogressively higher levels of competition. In 2006, she won the U.S. \nJunior National Championship; in 2007, the Visa National Championships \nand the Pan American Games, where she won four gold and one silver \nmedal. Next, Ms. Johnson will be competing for a spot on the U.S. \nwomen's gymnastic team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n  I extend my sincere congratulations to the U.S. women's gymnastics \nteam on their success and I wish them luck on their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12772-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING MIKE KURLE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to \nMike Kurle, who retired earlier this year as the longtime manager of \nthe West River/Lyman-Jones Rural Water System. I have worked with Mike \nfor nearly my entire congressional career and value his friendship, \nprofessionalism, and typical South Dakota steadfastness. I know that \nMike and his wife Marlene are looking forward to being able to travel a \nlittle more and spend some time with their children who are scattered \nacross the country. However, I want to take a few minutes and explain \nto the Senate the role Mike played in bringing reliable supplies of \ndrinking water to the towns and ranches of western South Dakota.\n  As manager of West River/Lyman-Jones, Mike guided one of the four \nlocal project sponsors that constitute the Mni Wiconi Rural Water \nSystem--one of the largest Federal drinking water projects constructed \nin the last 30 years. Mike managed the project practically from the \nbeginning and over the past 16 years has always put first the interests \nof the communities, ranches, and farms served by the system. On Mike's \nwatch, 2,200 rural customers now receive reliable drinking water piped \nhundreds of miles from the Missouri River. The towns of Philip, Presho, \nKennebec, Murdo, White River and, very soon, Kadoka benefit from the \nMni Wiconi project. Mike has overseen Federal transfers in excess of \n$55 million and constantly delivered good value and on-time performance \nfrom contractors. Most importantly, Mike is someone that could be \ntrusted and he worked well with the system's three other sponsors--the \nOglala Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and Rosebud Sioux Tribe. \nThe project is a collaboration between the area's American Indian \ntribes, the Federal Government, and the western South Dakota \ncommunities in Lyman, Stanley, Jones, Mellette, Jackson, Haakon, and \nPennington counties. Mike spent countless hours on the road traveling \nfrom one project sponsor meeting to another and on the phone and in \nWashington, DC, meeting with Bureau of Reclamation officials and the \nSouth Dakota congressional delegation to keep the project on track. \nBecause of Mike's good work, the project is close to the finish line \nwith about 70 percent of the system in the ground and delivering water \nto thousands of residents. These are all great goals and \naccomplishments.\n  So, in closing, I want to thank Mike Kurle for his service and \nprofessionalism and most of all friendship and guidance over these many \nyears. I know that Mike can't stay away from the West River/Lyman-Jones \noffice forever but hope that he can enjoy moving at a slower pace \nknowing that future generations will be well served by his \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12772-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12772-S12773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING PENOBSCOT BAY MEDIA, LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a small \ncompany in my home State of Maine, run by a female service-disabled \nveteran, that has made remarkable strides in the information technology \nindustry, and particularly in robotics. Penobscot Bay Media, LLC--known \nto most as Pen Bay Media--is headquartered in Camden, on Maine's \nbeautiful coast, where it specializes in the development of information \nvisualization solutions by using geographic information systems, GIS, \ninteractive distance learning, and other similar technologies. For \nexample, Pen Bay has developed a type of\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\nrobot that has the capability to detect environmental hazards, thereby \nprotecting first responders and potentially saving lives.\n  A retired Navy officer who served in Vietnam, CAPT Ann S. Yahner \nhelped found Pen Bay Media in 1999, along with current partners Stuart \nRich, David Berez, and her husband Frank, a retired U.S. Marine. Today, \nMrs. Yahner serves as president and general manager. I will never \nforget when, in response to her concerns over a ``brain drain'' in \nMaine, Mrs. Yahner sent a letter to MG John Libby, the adjutant general \nof the Maine National Guard, offering to employ qualified returning \nveterans from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan at Pen Bay. Overall, Pen \nBay employs 28 people, and has nearly doubled its workforce since the \nbeginning of 2006. Mrs. Yahner's determination to hire and partner with \nveterans is a solid example of the kind of consistent opportunity we \nneed to extend to those who protect us so admirably.\n  Pen Bay Media has a long history of successful project experience \nwith government clients. It is one of 45 prime companies in the United \nStates, and the only New England company to be awarded the Veterans \nTechnology Services Government-wide Acquisition Contract. As a result \nof this esteemed designation, Pen Bay Media will be eligible to compete \nfor a share of contracts worth $5 billion over the next 10 years. In \naddition, Pen Bay has received countless awards and accolades since its \ninception. Most recently, the Environmental Systems Research Institute, \nESRI, honored Pen Bay with its prestigious Special Achievement in \nGeographic Information System's award. For embracing GIS technology \nthrough its work with the New York City Bureau of Environmental \nSciences and Engineering, ESRI recognized Pen Bay for its \n``extraordinary contributions to our global society.'' According to \nESRI, Pen Bay stood out from more than 300,000 organizations worldwide \nthat use GIS software to enhance its clients' safety.\n  In its 8 years of operation, Pen Bay Media has excelled, finding a \ncreative niche within one of the Nation's fastest-growing industries. \nWhat makes Mrs. Yahner's accomplishments all the more impressive is \nthat, according to the Small Business Administration, only 32 percent \nof disabled veteran business owners are women. Ann Yahner's courageous \nmilitary service and tremendous contributions to small business are \ncommendable and a great lesson that we can all succeed. I thank Ann \nYahner and everyone at Pen Bay Media for the crucial work that they do, \nand I wish them continued success and prestige in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12773-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 928.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention and services program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join Senators Brown, Durbin,\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\nLandrieu, Murkowski and Murray in introducing the Advancing FASD \nResearch, Prevention, and Services Act. I thank them for joining me in \nthis important effort to improve the surveillance, identification, and \nprevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders, or FASD.\n  During the course of my career, I have admired people who struggle \nwith the affects of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and watched with \ndeep respect as their families struggle to help them succeed. Through \nno fault of their own, these FASD-affected individuals face a lifetime \nof cognitive, physical, and emotional challenges, including severe \nlearning disabilities, physical abnormalities, costly medical bills, \nand behavioral impairments. However, we have an opportunity to help \npeople with an FASD overcome many of these challenges with appropriate \nhealth, education, judicial, and housing services. As with other \ndisabilities, by investing a small amount of money, we can ensure that \nFASD-affected individuals have the resources they need to succeed in \nschool, work and life.\n  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are estimated to affect 1 in 100 \nlive births, or more than 40,000 infants, each year. Researchers \nestimate that one percent of our population lives with an FASD, which \nis more than 3 million Americans. In my home State of South Dakota, \napproximately 7,819 individuals are suspected of having an FASD.\n  The costs of this completely preventable condition to our country are \nstaggering. According to the University of South Dakota Sanford School \nof Medicine's Center for Disabilities, the lifetime cost for an \nindividual with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the most severe of disorders in \nthis spectrum, is over $2 million. The annual cost of FASD to South \nDakota, including medical treatment, special education services, and \nhome and residential care, is estimated to be $18 million. Nationally, \nthe cost for these services will approach $6 billion this year alone, \nbut neither of these estimates include the economic costs of lost \nproductivity.\n  While there is no known cure, FASD is entirely preventable, and this \nbill seeks a balance between directing federal resources to prevention \nactivities and to services for individuals living with FASD and their \nfamilies. This bill focuses provision of services in areas where FASD \naffected individuals are already receiving help. In South Dakota, more \nthan 60 percent of people diagnosed with an FASD lived within a foster \ncare home for some part of their lives. With that in mind, our bill \nworks to train foster care workers and foster parents on how to best \ncommunicate with and serve children living with FASD.\n  Furthermore, it is estimated that 60 percent of individuals with FASD \nwill spend some time in a correctional institution or mental health \nfacility during their lives. Most individuals with FASD will commit \ntheir first crime between the ages of 9 and 14. To that end, our bill \nwill provide health care and judicial system workers with the resources \nthey need to work with and understand FASD-affected individuals when \nthey encounter them in health care settings or the court system.\n  All of these unfortunate statistics compel me to join with my \ncolleagues to offer a comprehensive approaching to preventing FASD, \nadvancing research to learn more about FASD, and increasing provision \nof services to those living with FASD and their families. While we have \nincreased awareness about the dangers of consuming alcohol during \npregnancy, we clearly have much more work to do as we strive to reach \nthe goal of eliminating the negative effects of prenatal alcohol \nexposure.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, we have had great successes in \nworking on this issue. With the leadership of the health professionals \nat our esteemed universities, parents, and teachers, among countless \nothers, we have made some important progress in addressing FASD. This \nlegislation will bolster the efforts of these dedicated South Dakotans \nand many others across the country who are working hard to prevent FASD \nand support the children and families living with its consequences.\n  This bill will provide much needed support in the areas of research \nand prevention. This legislation requires the National Institutes of \nHealth to develop a research agenda focusing on the most promising \navenues research in diagnosis, intervention, and prevention, as well as \nfactors that may mitigate the effects of fetal alcohol exposure.\n  This bill will also make available grants to federally qualified \nhealth centers to implement and evaluate programs to increase awareness \nand identification of FASD in those settings.\n  Participating health centers will be able to provide training to \nhealth care providers on identifying and educating women who are at \nrisk for alcohol consumption during pregnancy and on screening children \nfor FASD.\n  Another provision in this bill will create public awareness and \neducation campaigns in at-risk areas in order to further the prevention \nof this disease. This bill will authorize the development and broadcast \nof national public service announcements to raise public awareness of \nthe risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n  Recognizing that the consequences of FASD are not just health-\nrelated, the bill promotes prevention, intervention and services within \nthe education and judicial systems. This legislation provides teachers \nwith resources to educate and support children with FASD. The bill \nseeks to involve everyone who might encounter an FASD-affected person \nin the judicial system, including judges, attorneys, probation \nofficers, law enforcement officers, and many others, and works to train \nthem in communicating with and supporting individuals with FASD.\n  Again, I am so pleased to be introducing this bill with my colleagues \nand encourage all of our colleagues to consider supporting this bill. I \nwould also like to take a moment to thank Senator Daschle for his \nleadership on FASD. His commitment to combating this illness is still \npresent in South Dakota and in the lives of those who battle FASD every \nday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Tester, Mr. Sanders, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Domenici):\n  S. 2143. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nto establish a program to improve the health and education of children \nthrough grants to expand school breakfast programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I join Senator Kohl in introducing \nthe Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act as part of my \ncontinued efforts to improve our nation's schools. I am pleased to be \nworking with the senior Senator from Wisconsin, who has been a longtime \nleader in this area. As far back as 1999, he has sponsored legislation \nto support breakfast programs, and he has continued his support through \nhis work on the Agriculture Appropriations Committee since then.\n  One often overlooked part of student classroom performance is \nnutrition and hunger, which can have a tremendous impact on students. I \nknow many of my colleagues share my support for school programs that \nhelp alleviate hunger for the most in-need students, such as the Free \nand Reduced Price Lunch Program, as well as those programs that provide \nhealthier food, such as the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack and Farm-\nto-Cafeteria programs.\n  I am sure that I am not the only member of this body who grew up \nhearing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When I \ntalk to my colleagues and constituents about our proposal and the \nimportance of breakfast and learning, it is not a hard sell. People \nunderstand immediately why this issue matters.\n  Unfortunately, too many children go hungry and too many parents have \nto choose between giving their children lunch or breakfast, even if \nthey get the help of reduced price meals.\n  The Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act would provide \ngrants for schools wishing to begin or expand universal school \nbreakfast programs. Studies show that kids who eat breakfast perform \nbetter in school and on tests, and they tend to be less disruptive to \nthe class, and I have heard many stories from teachers, school nurses, \nand other school officials over the years to confirm this. In fact, \nlast\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\nyear in my home State of Wisconsin, with the support of Senator Kohl, \nthe Milwaukee Public Schools worked with the Hunger Task Force to \nimplement universal school breakfast programs in more than 60 schools. \nThis program, which has expanded in its second year, has proven popular \nwith students, teachers, and parents.\n  We are set to debate the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind \nAct, NCLB, later this year. NCLB was the 2002 reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, of 1965. NCLB set the \nimportant goal of closing the achievement gap that exists in our \nnation's schools. I disagree with some of the methods that NCLB \nemploys, including relying primarily on high-stakes standardized tests \nto measure students and schools, but I strongly agree that the \nachievement gap needs to be closed. The latest scores from the National \nAssessment on Educational Progress NAEP were released last week and the \nscores show we have a very long way to go before we close that \nachievement gap in many States, including in my State of Wisconsin.\n\n  There are a variety of education reforms that need to be pursued at \nthe federal, state, and local level in order to close the achievement \ngap. One step Congress can take is to support programs to \ncomprehensively address the needs of children, including their \nnutrition, health, and social needs. Our Student Breakfast and \nEducation Improvement Act is legislation that is designed to help \naddress some of those needs. Too many students in some of our nation's \nmost disadvantaged schools walk into school in the morning hungry, or \neat junk food for their breakfast. By working to provide these students \nwith access to a nutritious breakfast, we are telling these students \nthat we value them and that we want to help them achieve all that they \ncan in school. Much more needs to be done to address other needs of our \nstudents, but this bill is a step in the right direction.\n  Our legislation would target the schools most in need, those with 65 \npercent more of students eligible for the free and reduced price lunch \nprogram, with the funds necessary to implement a universal free \nbreakfast program. The grants, which could be used in a number of ways, \naim to help schools overcome the numerous barriers to creating a \nuniversal school breakfast program. In fiscal year 2006, 10 million \nmore students participated in free and reduced price lunch than \nbreakfast. This disparity is troubling to me and many others.\n  Our bill would work with existing meal programs, not replace them. \nProvision 2 of Section 11(a)(l) of the National School Lunch Act allows \nschools to establish their free and reduced meal rates for a 4 year \nperiod if they serve all meals at no charge. The combination of not \nhaving to collect free and reduced price information from students \nannually, and not having to collect daily meal money from students, \nresults in significant administrative savings. While schools \nparticipating under Provision 2 must cover the lost revenue from the \nreduced and full price meal costs, for the high-needs schools such as \nthose targeted by this program, the typically higher participation rate \nalso means the school can benefit from some economies of scale and \nreceive a better price for the food. The grants this bill would provide \nwould help schools make the initial investments needed to establish a \nuniversal breakfast program and make up for the lost revenue.\n  Some universal breakfast programs, like the one I mentioned in \nMilwaukee, have demonstrated that universal free breakfast programs \ncreate an economy of scale that actually makes the cost per student \nlower. The Milwaukee program served breakfast in the classroom, which, \naccording to teachers and others involved, further improved the economy \nof the program, as well as the positive impact of breakfast on \nstudents' attention.\n  While our bill has some preferences, including a target for the \npoorest schools, it is important to note that it has tremendous \nflexibility for the states and school districts. Schools will be able \nto tailor their universal breakfast programs to the needs of their own \nstudents. It also gives schools the option of purchasing locally grown \nfoods and linking with local farmers, which provide excellent \nopportunities for nutrition lessons and can even be incorporated into \nother subjects such as science and math.\n  This bill is just a start; much more should be done to increase \nparticipation in breakfast programs and provide schools with the \nability and resources to design programs that address the needs of \ntheir students and communities. Our bill does not intend to replace \nbroader efforts, but rather to provide some immediate assistance for \nthe schools most in need. Furthermore, by including a reporting \nrequirement and encouraging researchers to study the effectiveness of \nthe funded programs in improving student learning, this legislation \nwould provide useful evidence about the need for broader investment and \nhow to ensure those resources are best spent.\n  I would like to thank Senators Tester, Sanders, Kerry, Durbin, Obama, \nBingaman, and Domenici for their support for this legislation. The \nStudent Breakfast and Education Improvement Act is also supported by \nthe Hunger Task Force, Community Food Security Coalition, the School \nSocial Work Association of America and the Wisconsin School Social \nWorkers Association. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nprovide breakfast to more in-need students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Thune, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Warner, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 2144.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nensure that Indian veterans are not liable for certain health care \npayments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nIndian Veteran Health Care Improvement Act, along with Senators Johnson \nand Dorgan. This legislation would encourage collaborations between the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, which would result in greater access to health \ncare services for American Indian and Alaska Native, AI/AN, veterans of \nfederally-recognized tribes. This legislation also would ensure that \nthese AI/AN veterans eligible for VA health care benefits delivered by \nthe Indian Health Service, IHS, an Indian tribe, or tribal \norganizations will not be liable for any out of pocket expenses.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have a long history of exemplary \nmilitary service to the United States. They have volunteered to serve \ntheir country at a higher percentage in all of Americas' wars and \nconflicts than any other ethnic group on a per capita basis. As a \nresult, they have a wide range of combat related health care needs. AI/\nAN veterans may be eligible for health care from Veterans Health \nAdministration, VHA, or from IHS or both. Despite this dual \neligibility, AI/AN veterans report the highest rate of unmet health \ncare needs among veterans and exhibit high rates of disease risk \nfactors.\n  On February 25, 2003, the HHS and the VA entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, MOU, to encourage cooperation and resource sharing \nbetween the IHS and the VHA. The goal of the MOU is to use the \nstrengths and expertise of both organizations to increase access, \ndeliver quality health care services and enhance the health status of \nAI/AN veterans. These collaborations are designed to improve \ncommunication between the agencies and tribal governments, and to \ncreate opportunities to develop strategies for sharing information \nservices and technology. The technology sharing includes the VA's \nelectronic medical record system, bar code medication administration \nand telemedicine. Also, the VA and the IHS cosponsor continuing medical \ntraining for their health care staffs. The MOU encourages VA, tribal, \nand IHS programs to collaborate in numerous ways at the local level. \nThese services may include referrals for specialty care at a VA \nfacility, prescriptions offered by the VA, and testing not offered by \nIHS.\n  At the local level, many partnerships are being formed among the IHS, \nVA, and tribal governments to identify local needs and develop local \nsolutions. These local needs may include VA enrollment, initial \nscreenings, and other health care services. The anticipated product of \nthese collaborations is to ensure that quality health care is provided \nto all eligible AI/AN veterans. In my State, the Portland VA Medical \nCenter and the Portland Area Office-IHS are working on a local MOU for \nthe purpose of improving access to VA health care services for eligible \nAI/AN veterans. The Warms Springs Confederated Tribes have been \ninstrumental in developing this agreement based on the needs of and by \nAI veterans on the Warm Springs Reservation. These veterans often are \neligible for health benefits from both VA and IHS and it is their \nintended purpose to make care more seamless, thereby improving access \nand quality.\n  Based on the Federal Government's trust responsibility for Indian \ntribes, eligible Indians receive free IHS health services regardless of \ntheir ability to pay. Unlike the IHS, the VA imposes cost-sharing on \ncertain beneficiaries. This bill would alleviate eligible AI/AN \nveterans' responsibility for any VA-related expenses when care is \ndelivered through the IHS.\n  In November 2001, President George W. Bush proclaimed National \nAmerican Indian Heritage Month by celebrating the role of the \nindigenous peoples of North America in shaping our Nation's history and \nculture. He said, ``American Indian and Alaska Native cultures have \nmade remarkable contributions to our national identity. Their unique \nspiritual, artistic, and literary contributions, together with their \nvibrant customs and celebrations, enliven and enrich our land.''\n  An important part of the overall contribution of AI/AN peoples to our \nNation is the part they play in protecting and preserving our freedoms. \nTheir contributions to our armed forces have been made throughout our \nhistory. I am hopeful that the VA and the IHS will continue to work \ntogether to deliver health care services to our Nation's AI/AN veterans \nthat they so deserve. I look forward to hearing about more of these \npartnership projects, and to learn of their successes.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senator Johnson and \nSenator Dorgan, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2148. A bill to provide for greater diversity within, and to \nimprove policy direction and oversight of, the Senior Executive \nService; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague in the House, \nCongressman Danny Davis, to introduce the Senior Executive Service \nDiversity Assurance Act to improve the management of the Senior \nExecutive Service, SES, and enhance its diversity.\n  For years we have known that the Federal SES does not reflect the \ndiversity of our Nation. The Government Accountability Office released \nreports in 2003 and 2007 showing that the percentages of minorities in \nthe SES are inconsistent from agency to agency and not reflective of \nthe diversity of the potential pool of applicants.\n  While we have seen some gains in the area of women in senior \npositions, the 28 percent of women in the SES is far less than the \nnational average. And for minorities in senior level career positions, \nthe gap is worse. Twenty-one percent of the potential applicants are \nracial and ethnic minorities while only 16 percent of the entire SES \nare minorities.\n  As agencies think about the next generation of SES, it is important \nto be reminded of the need to recruit a talented and diverse pool of \ncandidates in order to bring fresh perspectives into our Government's \nleadership roles. In serving the diverse population of America, we need \ndiverse leaders to improve the way the Federal workforce serves our \ncountry.\n  It is well known that the Federal Government is facing an impending \nretirement wave. Ninety percent of senior level employees will be \neligible for retirement in the next 10 years. Federal agencies need to \nprepare for the next generation of leaders and in the process actively \nrecruit diverse talent. I believe that mentoring is an excellent way to \ndo that. This bill requires the establishment of an SES mentorship \nprogram. Qualified senior executives would be paired up with other \ntalented women, racial and ethnic minorities, and disabled persons to \nmentor them in the hopes of cultivating a diverse pool of applicants \nfor SES positions.\n  The Senior Executive Service Diversity Assurance Act also establishes \nan office of senior executive resources to improve overall efficiency \nand diversity by bringing together all the SES policy development and \nimplementation functions at the Office of Personnel Management.\n  The bill also establishes evaluation panels made up of women and \nminorities to review incoming applications for SES positions and pass \nalong recommendations of the qualified candidates to the Executive \nReview Board.\n  The standards are high for entry into the SES, and I believe that \nthis bill continues that tradition and will improve the overall \ndiversity in our highly talented executive workforce.\n  America is a nation of many different races and backgrounds. Every \nyear, the diverse heritage of America continues to grow, and our \ncommunities benefit from the addition of those cultures. New cultures \nbring new ideas, and in our civil service--America's workforce--we need \nleadership that reflects those varied cultures and backgrounds.\n  I believe this bill lays the framework for bringing these new ideas \nand different populations into Federal leadership. I hope to see \nimprovements in the representation of women, racial and ethnic \nminorities, and the disabled in the SES.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12780]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to enhance \ndisclosure of the terms of home mortgage loans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Mortgage Disclosure \nImprovement Act of 2007. This bill will improve the loan disclosures \ngiven to homebuyers not only when they apply for a mortgage, but also \nwhen they refinance their home.\n  As we are all too aware, the percentage of loans entering foreclosure \nis at its highest level in 55 years. According to RealtyTrac, there \nwere 1.2 million foreclosures reported nationwide last year, up 42 \npercent from 2005. Many of these Americans going into foreclosure took \nout exotic adjustable rate and payment option loans which are now \nresetting to new, much higher monthly payments. Many of these consumers \nnever understood how these loan products worked or how high their \npayments would be once these loans reset.\n  The Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2007 would for the first \ntime require that the maximum payment that a consumer has to make on a \nmortgage be disclosed, not only at application, but also seven days \nbefore closing. If these disclosures are not made or are made \ninaccurately, then lenders will be subject to statutory damages. In \naddition to requiring lenders to disclose the maximum payment under the \nloan, they will now have to provide consumers who apply for adjustable \nrate or variable payment loans with a warning that the payments will \nchange, depending on the interest rate.\n\n[[Page S12781]]\n\n  In addition, this bill would require lenders to give firm disclosure \nregarding the terms of the mortgage not only within three days of \napplication for the loan, but also at least seven days before closing. \nLenders also will now need to include a statement that the consumer is \nnot obligated on the mortgage loan just because they have received the \ndisclosures. This will give consumers the opportunity to truly shop \naround for the best mortgage terms for the first time ever. They will \nbe able to compare the payments and costs associated with a certain \nloan product, and decide not to sign on the dotted line if they do not \nlike the basic terms of the loan.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies that lenders are subject to statutory \ndamages for violations of Truth in Lending disclosure provisions, \nincreases the damages for mortgage violations from $2,000 to $5,000 per \nviolation, and requires that mortgage disclosures be made within the \nstated time frames.\n  The increasing rate of foreclosures across the country is troubling. \nNot only are individual families losing their homes and their financial \nnest eggs, but there is a negative ripple effect across communities and \nthe economy. Although improved TILA disclosures are only a small part \nof what Congress needs to do in the upcoming year, I believe that \ngiving consumers the information they need regarding the maximum \npayments they might have to pay under the terms of a loan is an \nimportant and vital part of improving the process. Borrowers need to \nbetter understand the full financial impact of entering into a \nparticular loan early in the loan decision process, and also before \nthey actually consummate the loan.

A bill to authorize and facilitate the improvement of water \nmanagement by the Bureau of Reclamation, to require the Secretary of \nthe Interior and the Secretary of Energy to increase the acquisition \nand analysis of water resources for irrigation, hydroelectric power, \nmunicipal, and environmental uses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill entitled \nthe SECURE Water Act, Science and Engineering to Comprehensively \nUnderstand and Responsibly Enhance Water Act to address some of the \nserious water-related challenges facing this country. My colleagues \nSenator Domenici, Senator Cantwell, and Senator Johnson are \ncosponsoring this measure and I am pleased to have their support.\n  Water resource issues are putting State and local water managers to \nthe test in all areas of the country. In the western U.S., these \nchallenges are exacerbated due to drought, population increases, \nenvironmental needs, and climate change, all of which are affecting the \nsustainability of water supplies. Much needs to be done to ensure that \nsufficient quantities of water of adequate quality are available to \nmeet the basic needs of our citizens, as well as sustaining important \neconomic and environmental uses.\n  As the intense competition for limited water supplies increases, more \nrefined water management strategies are necessary. One way to improve \nin this area is to improve the nationwide data collection and \nmonitoring activities associated with water. The SECURE Water Act will \ndo this by requiring an expansion of the National Streamflow \nInformation Program and the development of a systematic groundwater \nmonitoring program. The bill also directs the U.S. Geological Survey to \nformally establish a water use and availability assessment program \nconsistent with recommendations made by the National Research Council. \nBetter data will lead to better modeling and improved decisionmaking by \nState, local, and Federal water managers.\n  Another area needing more attention concerns the impacts of global \nclimate change on water resources. Already well-documented is the fact \nthat increasing temperatures are resulting in less snowpack and more \nrain in many regions, and changing the timing of snow-melt runoff. \nMoreover, at a recent hearing on climate change and water held by the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the USGS indicated that current \nclimate models are also projecting a long-term drying trend in the \nSouthwest--the fastest growing region in the country. Fully \nunderstanding and adapting to these long-term impacts is imperative to \nthe health and well-being of many communities. The SECURE Water Act \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to establish an Intra-\nGovernmental Panel to help make the link between the scientific \ncommunity and water managers to improve water availability forecasts \nand to implement adaptation strategies. The bill also requires the \nBureau of Reclamation to initiate a climate change adaptation program \nto develop strategies and conduct feasibility studies to address water \nshortages, conflicts, and other impacts to water users and the \nenvironment. In addition, both Reclamation and the Department of Energy \nare directed to assess the effects of climate change on the water \nsupplies needed for hydropower production, which represents the source \nof at least 7 percent of the Nation's electricity supply.\n  Finally, the SECURE Water Act recognizes that promoting the efficient \nuse of water is critical to respond to\n\n[[Page S12782]]\n\nany of the threats that may impact available supplies. Accordingly, the \nBureau of Reclamation is authorized to provide financial assistance to \nStates, tribes, and local entities to construct improvements or take \nactions to increase water-use efficiencies that respond to drought, \nclimate change, or other water-related crises.\n  Of course, States bear the primary responsibility and authority for \nmanaging water resources in this country. Nonetheless, given the \nreality that adequate and safe water supplies are fundamental to the \nhealth, economy, and ecology of the United States, it is imperative \nthat the Federal government be a strong partner in assisting State and \nlocal communities to address present and future water supply \nchallenges. The SECURE Water Act was developed with this strong \npartnership in mind. I look forward to starting the dialogue on this \nimportant legislation and hope that my colleagues will ultimately \nsupport its enactment.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In February 2006, the United States Attorney General \n     and the FBI director announced a partnership with the NAACP, \n     the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban \n     League to investigate unsolved crimes from the civil rights \n     era.\n       (2) Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has pledged that \n     ``The Justice Department is committed to investigating and \n     prosecuting civil-rights era homicides for as long as it \n     takes and as far as the law allows--because there is no \n     statute of limitations on human dignity and justice.''.\n       (3) In February 2006, the FBI enacted an initiative to \n     identify hate crimes that occurred prior to December 1969, \n     and resulted in death.\n       (4) The Bureau's 56 field offices have been directed to \n     reexamine their unsolved civil rights cases and determine \n     which ones could still be viable for prosecution.\n       (5) The FBI has partnered with a number of State and local \n     authorities, civic organizations, and community leaders to \n     reexamine old files.\n       (6) Since the initiative began, the FBI has received nearly \n     100 such referrals.\n       (7) The FBI is continuing to assess each referral for its \n     investigative and legal viability and, given the updated \n     investigative and forensic tools, move forward in \n     investigating these cases.\n       (8) The United States national debt is nearly \n     $9,000,000,000,000.\n       (9) Rather than adding to this debt, Congress should offset \n     any new spending from lower priority spending.\n       (10) Bringing justice to those who have committed ghastly \n     civil rights crimes in a fiscally responsible manner that \n     does not add to the United States national debt should be a \n     higher priority for Congress than funding parochial pork \n     barrel projects.\n       (b) Increased Appropriations.--Amounts provided in this Act \n     for the Civil Rights Division within the Department of \n     Justice are increased by $1,680,000 for the prosecution of \n     civil rights crimes.\n       (c) Decreased Appropriations.--Appropriations in this Act \n     for the following accounts are decreased by the amount \n     indicated:\n       (1) Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes research by $450,000.\n       (2) Ocean and Coastal Management, National Ocean Service, \n     by $500,000.\n       (3) Local Warnings and Forecasts, National Weather Service, \n     by $300,000.\n       (4) National Aeronautics and Space Administration by \n     $800,000.\n       (5) Education Program, NOAA, by $500,000.\n       (d) Prohibition on Funding.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, there shall be no funding for fiscal \n     year 2008 for the following:\n       (1) Advanced Undersea Vehicle, Mystic Aquarium-Institute \n     for Exploration, Mystic, Connecticut.\n       (2) Maritime Museum, City of Mobile, Alabama.\n       (3) Eye-On-The-Sky, Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium, St. \n     Johnsbury, Vermont.\n       (4) Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois.\n       (5) U.S. Space and Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama, for \n     an update for the museum and exhibits.\n       (6) John Smith Water Trail, installation of bouys marking \n     the John Smith National Water Trail on the Chesapeake Bay, \n     the Conservation Fund, Arlington, Virginia.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3244.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limited their travel and personal property \n     rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest \n     foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to \n     the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during \n     World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin \n     Americans held in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian American and German American\n\n[[Page S12807]]\n\n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies.

Mr. President, today the Senate will pass S. 1640, the \nVessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2007, after the \nJudiciary Committee voted unanimously to send it to the floor. This is \na small but important piece of legislation, and I thank my cosponsors, \nSenator Cornyn, Senator Kohl, and Senator Whitehouse, for all their \nhard work. Last year, this bill was passed by the Judiciary Committee \nand by the full Senate, but unfortunately the House held it hostage to \nan unrelated bill at the end of the session. I don't want that to \nhappen again this year.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act to \nrecognize the significant time, effort, and innovation that figure into \nship design. Recent courtroom experience has made it clear that in \norder to be effective, this law needs to be clarified and refined. Our \nbill does exactly this, and no more, by clarifying the definition of \n``hull'' and ``deck.'' This ensures that the intellectual property \nrights of vessel hull designers will be protected.\n  I look forward to this bill becoming law.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 17\n\n       Whereas the decline of several commercially valuable fish \n     stocks throughout the world's oceans highlights the need for \n     fishing nations to conserve fish stocks and develop \n     management systems that promote fisheries sustainability;\n       Whereas fish stocks are migratory throughout their \n     habitats, and changing ocean conditions can restructure \n     marine habitats and redistribute the species dependent on \n     those habitats;\n       Whereas changing global climate regimes may increase ocean \n     water temperature, creating suitable new habitats in areas \n     previously too cold to support certain fish stocks, such as \n     the Arctic Ocean;\n       Whereas habitat expansion and migration of fish stocks into \n     the Arctic Ocean and the potential for vessel docking and \n     navigation in the Arctic Ocean could create conditions \n     favorable for establishing and expanding commercial fisheries \n     in the future;\n       Whereas commercial fishing has occurred in several regions \n     of the Arctic Ocean, including the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, \n     Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Greenland Sea, although \n     fisheries scientists have only limited data on current and \n     projected future fish stock abundance and distribution \n     patterns throughout the Arctic Ocean;\n       Whereas remote indigenous communities in all nations that \n     border the Arctic Ocean engage in limited, small scale \n     subsistence fishing and must maintain access to and \n     sustainability of this fishing in order to survive;\n       Whereas many of these communities depend on a variety of \n     other marine life for social, cultural and subsistence \n     purposes, including marine mammals and seabirds that may be \n     adversely affected by climate change, and emerging fisheries \n     in the Arctic should take into account the social, economic, \n     cultural and subsistence needs of these small coastal \n     communities;\n       Whereas managing for fisheries sustainability requires that \n     all commercial fishing be conducted in accordance with \n     science-based limits on harvest, timely and accurate \n     reporting of catch data, equitable allocation and access \n     systems, and effective monitoring and enforcement systems;\n       Whereas migratory fish stocks traverse international \n     boundaries between the exclusive economic zones of fishing \n     nations and the high seas, and ensuring sustainability of \n     fisheries targeting these stocks requires management systems \n     based on international coordination and cooperation;\n       Whereas international fishing treaties and agreements \n     provide a framework for establishing rules to guide \n     sustainable fishing activities among those nations that are \n     parties to the agreement, and regional fisheries management \n     organizations provide international fora for implementing \n     these agreements and facilitating international cooperation \n     and collaboration;\n       Whereas under its authorities in the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the North Pacific \n     Fishery Management Council has proposed that the United \n     States close all Federal waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort \n     Seas to commercial fishing until a fisheries management plan \n     is fully developed; and\n       Whereas future commercial fishing and fisheries management \n     activities in the Arctic Ocean should be developed through a \n     coordinated international framework, as provided by \n     international treaties or regional fisheries management \n     organizations, and this framework should be implemented \n     before significant commercial fishing activity expands to the \n     high seas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That--\n       (1) the United States should initiate international \n     discussions and take necessary steps with other Arctic \n     nations to negotiate an agreement or agreements for managing \n     migratory, transboundary, and straddling fish stocks in the \n     Arctic Ocean and establishing a new international fisheries \n     management organization or organizations for the region;\n       (2) the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) should conform to the requirements of the \n     United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and contain mechanisms, \n     inter alia, for establishing catch and bycatch limits, \n     harvest allocations, observers, monitoring, data collection \n     and reporting, enforcement, and other elements necessary for \n     sustaining future Arctic fish stocks;\n       (3) as international fisheries agreements are negotiated \n     and implemented, the United States should consult with the \n     North Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and Alaska \n     Native subsistence communities of the Arctic; and\n       (4) until the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) come into force and measures consistent with \n     the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement are in effect, the \n     United States should support international efforts to halt \n     the expansion of commercial fishing activities in the high \n     seas of the Arctic Ocean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/04/senate-section/article/S12827-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2152 and H.R. 2740\n\n  Mr. REID.
