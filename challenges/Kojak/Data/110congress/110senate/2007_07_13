Mr. President, the Senate has now had a full day to \ndebate the Levin amendment. The questions I raised about it yesterday \nremain unanswered. Americans need to know what they are being asked to \nconsider. The troops fighting al-Qaida in Iraq also need to know. I \nwill ask my questions again.\n  The Levin amendment says the Secretary of Defense shall ``commence \nthe reduction of the number of United States forces in Iraq not later \nthan 120 days after the date of enactment of this act.'' What would \nthis reduction involve? The Levin amendment calls for U.S. forces in \nIraq to have a limited presence after the reduction. What is a \n``limited presence''? The Levin amendment says our Armed Forces should \nonly be used to protect U.S. personnel, to train Iraqis to fight, and \nto engage in ``targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida.'' \nWhat does ``targeted'' mean? The Levin amendment says the Secretary of \nDefense shall complete the transition of U.S. forces in Iraq to a \nlimited presence and missions by April 30. How does the author define \n``complete''?\n  A number of papers across America reported this morning that \nyesterday's House vote means that most U.S. troops will be out of Iraq \nby April. I ask the authors of the Levin amendment, is this true?\n  This 1\\1/2\\-page amendment is the centerpiece of the Democratic \nleadership's strategy for Iraq. They want us to choose this over the \nPetraeus plan. Listen to General Petraeus. Just before we began this \ndebate, he made a simple request. He said:\n\n       I can think of few commanders in history who wouldn't have \n     wanted more troops, more time, or more unity among their \n     partners. However, if I could only have one thing at this \n     point in Iraq, it would be more time.\n\n  Our Democratic-led Senate voted 81 to nothing to send General \nPetraeus into Iraq. A bipartisan majority of 80 Senators told him in \nMay that he had until September to report back on progress. His \nstrategy has led to what even skeptics describe as an encouraging \nturnaround against al-Qaida in Anbar, a province which accounts for\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nabout one-third of Iraq's territory. Yesterday, just 1 month after this \nstrategy became fully manned, Democrats are declaring it a failure and \nasking us to rally behind a 1\\1/2\\-page alternative that raises more \nquestions, frankly, than it answers.\n  We have been down this road before. When the President decided to \nchange course in Iraq last year, Democrats said his new strategy \nwouldn't work. They called it a failure before it began. Now just 1 \nmonth after that strategy became fully manned, they are calling it a \nfailure again, even as it has started to show signs of military \nsuccess.\n  The Iraq Foreign Minister told us what would happen if America walks \naway from this fight right now: a sharp increase in violence, thousands \nof civilian deaths, and a regional conflict that could involve several \nother countries in that area. Yet the Democratic leadership has yet to \naddress the consequences of withdrawal. Here is their response to \nconcerns about a victory by al-Qaida, genocide, and a regional war in \nthe Middle East: Blame Bush. That may work on the stump, but it is not \na very sophisticated foreign policy, and it is not going to solve the \ngreat problems we face in Iraq and in the broader Middle East.\n  Fortunately, many brave people are facing this problem head-on. Our \ntop commander in Iraq says he can win this fight. He told us he \nwouldn't risk a single American life if he didn't think he could. All \nhe is asking for is time. Can we at least give him what we agreed to in \nMay?\n  This amendment is not a responsible alternative to the Petraeus plan. \nIt is a page and a half of vague proposals.\n  Now, look, all of us are frustrated with the war, but we have \ncommitted to listen to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. We did \nso through legislation. We need to listen to our top commander in the \nfield. He deserves 60 days. More than 160,000 American soldiers and \nmarines are fighting in Iraq right now. They believe in this mission. \nThey are executing the plan, and they have a leader. He is asking for \nmore time. Let's be fair and honor the legislation we passed in May. \nLet's wait for the report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Levin-Reed amendment requires the \nPresident to take steps to responsibly end the war that the country and \nour brave men and women in uniform deserve and demand, but it does not \nset specific troop levels and, certainly, schedules other than what we \nhave already indicated, and that is the House-passed version, similar \nto ours, 120 days to start redeploying troops; as of April 1, according \nto the House, and May 1, according to us. There must be a change of \nmission. That change of mission will be directed toward \ncounterterrorism, protecting our assets in the area, and also training \nthe Iraqis. That is simply what it says.\n  Senators Carl Levin and Jack Reed are uniquely qualified to offer \nthis amendment. They have been joined in this amendment by others, \nincluding Senator Hagel. This amendment sets a firm date and an end \ndate to transition the mission to begin the reduction of U.S. forces. I \nhave talked about that. It limits the U.S. mission.\n  This policy of the President--it is not Petraeus' policy; it is the \nPresident's--has, during the last 6 months, caused the deaths of over \n600 more American soldiers and cost the American taxpayers more than \n$60 billion. The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Webb, was a step in the right direction. It was defeated. \nWe were not allowed to vote on that. It was offered to give our troops \nthe relief they need--15 months in country, 15 months out of country. \nThat is serious and important to our troops.\n  Our troops are in a difficult position. We are 3,000 officers short. \nThe morning news reports that 13 percent of recruits, even though they \nare 15 percent down in recruitments, 13 percent of those they have, \neven though they have lowered qualifications significantly, 13 percent \nhave criminal records and are going into the military.\n  Of course, the amendment that is offered by Senators Levin and Reed \nrequires that the reduction in force be part of a comprehensive \ndiplomatic, regional, political, and economic effort.\n  The votes we have taken on Iraq thus far make two things very clear: \nFirst, the Democratic caucus is united in our commitment to changing \nthe course of this Iraq intractable civil war. Our resolve has never \nbeen stronger. Second, until and unless the President awakens to his \ngrievous misjudgments, it will take significant Republican support to \nend the war.\n  This week's vote on the Webb amendment was not encouraging. The \nRepublican leadership blocked an up-or-down vote on an amendment to \nsupport our troops by increasing rest time between deployments. \nRepublicans have every right to vote against bills and amendments they \noppose. If they oppose troop readiness, let them go on record voting \nagainst it. But to block an amendment like that shows clearly that some \nRepublicans are protecting the President and not the troops. Plenty of \nRepublicans are talking the right way on Iraq now. They are expressing \ntheir disapproval for the President's policy, and this is a welcome \nstep. But speeches won't end the war; only votes will.\n  We have a constitutional obligation. Section 1, article 8 says that \nwe have an obligation to take care of our troops. We have a \nconstitutional obligation. When we return to the Levin-Reed amendment \nnext week, a final vote will come. We hope it is not blocked again \nprocedurally. I hope all my colleagues, Democratic and Republican \nalike, will embrace this opportunity to finally end a war that has \ncaused our country so much harm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9190-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, might I inquire again as to the schedule \nof the vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The vote is presently scheduled for \n9:30 or, if the speaking engagements end sooner, at the conclusion of \nthose speaking engagements, at the back end of the time. The vote will \nnot be shifted forward in order to accommodate Senators who are \ncounting on the 9:30 vote beginning.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized for 10 minutes. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Chair remind me when I have consumed half of \nthat time? I want to yield the remainder of the time to Senator Conrad.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In about 4 minutes, let me describe an amendment that is \nvery simple. Yesterday, we received a report--it is described in \ntoday's paper--\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\non progress dealing with benchmarks in Iraq. There is only one reason \nwe are given this report by the administration. It is because we \nrequired this report in law. The Congress said: We require you to give \nus this report.\n  There is another report we are not getting. We have not yet required \nit. Our amendment will require it. That is, What has been done and what \nis being done to bring to justice Osama bin Laden and the leadership of \nal-Qaida and those who committed the attacks against this country on 9/\n11/2001? What is being done to bring them to justice? It has been \nnearly 6 long years and Osama bin Laden remains free. More importantly, \nthe threat against our country today is a threat by Osama bin Laden, \nthe leadership of al-Qaida, operating from a secure and safe place in \nPakistan, we are told, planning attacks against our country and others.\n  Here is the situation: August 2001, the Presidential daily briefing \nsaid this--the title was ``Bin Laden determined to strike in the US.'' \nThat was August 2001. It is what was handed to the President back then.\n  Here is today. Our intelligence assessments, we are told by newspaper \naccounts: ``Al Qaeda is better positioned to strike the West.'' Think \nof that. Nearly 6 years later and al-Qaida is better positioned to \nstrike the West.\n  Now, let me tell you what Mr. Negroponte told us in January of this \nyear. He said: ``Al Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our \nHomeland'' from a ``secure hideaway in Pakistan.'' That is from Mr. \nNegroponte, the top intelligence official in our country.\n  He further said this in January of this year:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to [our] \n     Homeland.\n\n  Now, having known that, let me describe a couple of things we have \nbeen reading recently. This is February of this year:\n\n       Senior leaders of al-Qaida operating from Pakistan over the \n     last year have set up a band of training camps in the tribal \n     regions near the Afghan border, according to American \n     intelligence and counterterrorism officials.\n       American officials said there was mounting evidence that \n     Osama bin Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been \n     steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \n     Pakistani tribal area of north Waziristan.\n\n  Finally, this week:\n\n       While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents linked to \n     al Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping and rebuilding in a new sanctuary along the border \n     between Afghanistan and Pakistan, senior U.S. military, \n     intelligence and law enforcement officials said.\n\n  Now, the question is this: While we have soldiers going door to door \nin Baghdad in the middle of a civil war, with sectarian violence----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. May we have order, please, for the \nSenator who is speaking on the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The question is this: It has been almost 6 years since \nOsama bin Laden and the network of al-Qaida attacked our country on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Osama bin Laden is still free. He has not been \nbrought to justice. We are told he is operating in a secure hideaway in \nnorthern Pakistan. Al-Qaida is stronger than it has been in years, and \nwe are told it is rebuilding and regrouping with terrorist training \ncamps. It remains the greatest threat to our country.\n  We are told this after almost 6 years, two wars in two countries, \nhundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars spent here and abroad, the \ndeaths of thousands of our soldiers and tens of thousands of our \nsoldiers wounded, and the threat grows and remains, and those who \nperpetrated the attack against this country and now represent the \ngreatest threat to our country live free in a secure hideaway.\n  President Bush said this in 2003:\n\n       I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really \n     don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The halfway point has been reached.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is a priority for this country, I would say to the \nPresident, and we ask for quarterly reports on what is happening in the \nsearch to bring the leadership of al-Qaida to justice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Conrad.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has now been 2,131 days since 9/11. I \nthink all of us remember that day. It was a horrific day. I will never \nforget having given a speech over in Crystal City that morning and \nhaving driven past the Pentagon, only to get to the Capitol and see \nthat the Pentagon had been attacked and then seeing the incredible \nimages from the World Trade Center and those buildings collapsing.\n  The President said at the time that we would hold Osama bin Laden and \nal-Qaida to account, that we would smoke them out of their holes, and \nthat we would bring them to justice. It is 2,131 days later, and still \nOsama bin Laden has not been brought to justice, nor has Mr. Zawahiri, \nwho now regularly broadcasts additional threats against our country.\n  I believe a very serious strategic mistake was made when the \nPresident chose to go to Iraq instead of finishing business with al-\nQaida. In fact, we know special forces, who are experts in Arab \nculture, in Arab language, were transferred from the hunt in \nAfghanistan for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Those special forces were \nshifted to the hunt for Saddam Hussein in Iraq. They were replaced by \nexperts in Spanish culture. There are not many Spanish speakers in \nAfghanistan.\n  I have always believed it was a profound mistake not to finish \nbusiness with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.\n  I had the benefit of going to high school at an American military \nbase in Tripoli, Libya, north Africa, and living in the Arab culture \nfor 2 years. I think I learned a great deal from that experience about \nthat culture. I think strategically it has been a profound mistake for \nus to go into Iraq instead of keeping our focus and effort and energy \non the people who did attack us--al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, and \nnot Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq. As awful and despicable a \ncharacter as Saddam Hussein was, that should not have been the focus of \nour effort. The people who attacked us were al-Qaida, not Iraq.\n  Now we learn al-Qaida is ``considerably operationally stronger than a \nyear ago'' and has ``regrouped to an extent not seen since 2001,'' a \ncounterterrorism official said, paraphrasing a new intelligence \nreport's conclusions. They are ``showing greater and greater ability to \nplan attacks in Europe and the United States.'' Are we not paying \nattention? Al-Qaida, according to these reports, has increased from \n20,000 terrorist operatives to 50,000.\n  We need to redirect the emphasis and the focus of our security \nefforts and go after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. That is what this \namendment does. It doubles the bounty on Osama bin Laden.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time controlled by Senator \nDorgan has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and conclude by saying that it requires \nan administration report on the strategy for bringing bin Laden and \nother terrorists to justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, had I been present for the vote on \nthe Dorgan amendment, I would have voted in favor of it.\n  We're coming up on the sixth anniversary of 9/11, and the \nbloodthirsty terrorist who plotted this slaughter of nearly 3,000 \nAmericans is still a free man. Back then, could any of us ever have \nimagined such a failure on the part of this administration? Could any \nof us have believed that--more than half a decade later--Osama bin \nLaden would still be enjoying safe haven? Two wars and three elections \nlater--and Osama remains unscathed.\n  What would our reaction have been nearly 6 years ago, had President \nBush gone on national television and predicted this? What would we have \nsaid if he'd told us that the capture of the man who'd unleashed such \nhorror simply wasn't a top priority of his administration? Would any \nAmerican have believed him?\n  The amendment before us aims to make this a top priority. It \nobligates the administration to provide Congress with regular reports \non the progress made, if any, towards the capture or\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nkilling of Osama bin Laden and his closest confederates.\n  The White House seems to have forgotten bin Laden. The American \npeople have not.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say, I intend to vote for this \namendment. But let us not be unmindful of the enormity of the sacrifice \nof the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States--and, \nindeed, perhaps with the assistance of other nations--in trying to \nascertain exactly where bin Laden might be and perhaps to get him. So \nmuch of this, quite understandably, cannot be revealed, but I assure \nthe American public that our U.S. military in no measure has been \nasleep in its pursuit of this infamous man, Osama bin Laden.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say two things about this amendment. \nFirst of all, I hope all of my colleagues will support it because it \nhas been amended in a very important way, which I will discuss in a \nmoment. But the first thing I want to say is, it is a false choice to \nsuggest we should either be fighting in Iraq or going after Osama bin \nLaden. We need to be fighting al-Qaida wherever they are, and we are \ndoing that, in Iraq and in the hills of Pakistan and Afghanistan and \nother places where these terrorists might be hiding, to the very best \nof our ability. We cannot leave Iraq to al-Qaida in order to go after \nOsama bin Laden.\n  To rewrite history here, to somehow suggest we have stopped trying to \nget Osama bin Laden is, I suggest, a willful misrepresentation of what \nour special forces are attempting to do. I agree with the senior \nSenator from Virginia that this is a very difficult and complicated \nmatter in dealing with the Government of Pakistan and other issues that \nmake it very hard to know precisely where Osama bin Laden is and to be \nable to kill or capture him.\n  That relates to the second point. When this amendment was drafted, \nthere was a glaring problem with it. It increases the reward from $25 \nmillion to $50 million, but the way it was originally written, it was \nwritten for information ``leading to the capture'' of Osama bin Laden. \nWe looked at the amendment and, in astonishment, sought to find the \nrest of the phrase that you usually see there, ``the capture or \ndeath,'' but it was not there.\n  I wondered: Is this yet another step in the effort of the majority \nparty to make this a criminal effort rather than to acknowledge that \nthis is a war against a sworn enemy of the United States? In a war, you \ncapture the enemy when you can. When you cannot, if it is necessary to \nkill the enemy, you do. All of this brave talk about getting Osama bin \nLaden and criticism of the administration because we have not gotten \nhim seems to me a little bit hollow if the only way we are going to get \nhim is to capture him.\n  Well, sure, it would be great to capture him, but we may have to kill \nhim; therefore, the amendment which omitted the potential for killing \nOsama bin Laden was amended by Senator Sununu, who offered a second-\ndegree amendment to raise the reward from $25 million to $50 million \nfor the capture or death or information leading to the capture or death \nof Osama bin Laden. It is under those circumstances that I strongly \nsupport the amendment, as amended.\n  But I ask my colleagues on the other side--next week, we are going to \nhave some other discussion about language which would criminalize this \nwar rather than allowing it to be fought as the war it is against sworn \nenemies of the United States. Are we going to continue this trend where \nwe treat it as a matter of criminal law rather than a war? I hope not \nbecause the other side does not treat it that way.\n  So having amended the amendment to include ``the capture or death'' \nof Osama bin Laden, I am very happy to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, does money make the difference? Because if \nmoney had made the difference, Osama bin Laden would be in his grave. \nBut it has not made the difference. Intelligence, human intelligence, \nrelationships, the ongoing development of those kinds of relationships \nwe build around the world makes the difference.\n  Osama bin Laden is a phenomenal symbol today in a large constituency \nworldwide. We will add money, and all of us will support it. The intent \nof this amendment is good. But, as my colleagues have said, to suggest \nit is either/or, we cannot do both, nor should we--I suggest it is not \nthat.\n  Are we going to melt the mountains of northern Pakistan? What, should \nwe have tumbled the government of Musharraf in our pursuit of Osama bin \nLaden? I think that was not our choice, nor should it have been.\n  So we will add some money. We will add some intent. But, in the long \nhaul, building back an intelligence organization, a human intelligence \norganization, that couples with and strengthens our technological \ncapability to observe movement all over the world, ultimately, helps us \npursue terrorist organizations, to go where they are and where they are \ntraining and to be able to topple them before they inflict injury upon \nus. That should be our goal. That is our goal. That is what has been \nour goal since 9/11. But we are so powerful, and we are all ``Nintendo \nwarriors'' today. Remember that game, that electronic game, a few years \nago, push buttons--zim, zam, boom--and it was all over with? That is \nnot the way you fight war, although we as a society have grown to \nbelieve that.\n  When the human is involved, when the human intelligence decides to \nhide, to divert, to connive, to organize, and ultimately to break \nthrough the barriers we build, our vigilance must be constant. We have \njust heard of their capabilities. We now must rest on ours.\n  I will support the amendment. But let us not be fooled that money \nmakes the difference. It is the constant vigilance, the building of \nsystems and organizations, the human intelligence, matched with our \nelectronic and our technological capability, that will continue to \nallow us to be a safer nation in what Americans have now recognized is \na very unsafe world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) \nand the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 247 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n       \n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\n\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Bunning\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--12\n\n     Biden\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Gregg\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Lautenberg\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Vitter\n  The amendment (No. 2135), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The regular order would be the \nLevin amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSanders be recognized for 3 minutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish also \nto accommodate the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will amend that request.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont was \ngoing to speak for a couple minutes, and I wish to have the floor after \nthat for no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I amend my request to ask that after the \nSenator from Vermont speaks, the Senator from Minnesota be recognized \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, a number of Vermont families are \ntraveling to Arlington National Cemetery this week. They are a special \ngroup and they are here for a very special reason. The group is called \nThe Vermont Fallen. They represent the many families in our State who \nhave lost a loved one during the war in Afghanistan or the war in Iraq.\n  On Saturday, July 14, The Vermont Fallen will come together to \nsupport Marion and Peter Dooley for the internment of LT Mark Dooley's \nashes at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  A fellow Vermonter, Lieutenant Dooley was born July 15, 1978. He was \na graduate of the 2001 class of Norwich University and served as a \npolice officer in Wilmington, VT, as well as the Windham County \nSheriff's Department. A first lieutenant in the Vermont National Guard, \nhe served with the 3rd Battalion, 172d Mountain Infantry. He was killed \nwest of Ramadi, Iraq, on September 19, 2005, when the scout platoon he \nwas leading was ambushed.\n  The Vermont Fallen serves a wonderful and unique purpose. They allow \nfamilies from Vermont who have suffered unimaginable loss to come \ntogether and support each other in a way that only they themselves can \ndo.\n  Today, we honor the life and the loss of LT Mark H. Dooley. In doing \nso, we also honor the lives of all those brave Vermont soldiers who \nnever came home.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will yield \nbefore he speaks for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Minnesota is finished, Senator Bill Nelson be recognized \nfor up to 20 minutes on the pending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that an objection has \nbeen raised. I intended to offer amendment No. 2189, which is at the \ndesk. It is a Coleman, DeMint, Thune, Inhofe amendment which would \nprohibit the FCC from reinstating the fairness doctrine.\n  I am not asking for a vote at this time. I only want an amendment to \nbe put into the queue. Just recently, the House dealt with a similar \namendment. That amendment passed the House with over 300 votes in \nfavor. The vote was 309 to 115.\n  My amendment says that the FCC would not be able to reinstate the \nfairness doctrine. It says:\n\n       The Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe \n     any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, or other requirement \n     that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or promulgating \n     in whole or part the requirement that broadcasters, including \n     the Armed Forces Network, present opposing viewpoints on \n     controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred \n     to as the fairness doctrine.\n\n  There is nothing fair about the fairness doctrine. In the past few \nweeks, there has been discussion among some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who have said very publicly that it is time to \nreinstate the fairness doctrine. We have troops in the field of combat \ntoday putting their lives on the line and part of what we protect in \nthis country is the first amendment--is freedom of speech.\n  The fairness doctrine amendment is a relic of a bygone past. It was \ntossed on the ash heap of history in 1987. It was in place from 1949 to \n1987. Its intended effect was to have the Federal Government monitor \nwhat is said on the airwaves and require broadcasters to present \n``fair'' and ``balanced'' programming.\n  The effect was much different from that. In effect, it stifled \nspeech. If you are a broadcaster and you own a station, you could be \nsubject to some kind of penalty if you do not provide the kind of \nbalance that the Government says you must provide. You may well \nchoose--and, in fact, history has shown what has happened--you may \nchoose simply to play country music. I love country music, but I also \nlove free speech, and we do not want to put anything in place that \nstifles free speech.\n  We have gone from 1949, when we had a few TV stations and the \ninformation you got came from relatively few sources, to a world today \nin which we have broadband, high-speed Internet, satellites, blogs, and \na whole range of information. And that is a good thing.\n  In the end, we in this body have to respond, have to listen to the \nvoices of people. We want an informed and educated citizenship. We want \nthem to get diverse views.\n  The reality, in part, of why this issue even comes up is because of \nconcerns from my friends on the other side of the aisle that talk radio \nsomehow is dominated by conservatives. One may argue that perhaps \nbroadcast journalism may be dominated by liberals. There have been \nstudies that have shown that fact. But for us, we shouldn't care \nwhether it is dominated. And as to a response of the Government coming \nin and trying to somehow measure and regulate----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, in the interest of an \neducated electorate, whether he thinks Americans should hear both sides \nof the story, a fair and balanced approach when it comes to \ninformation?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I absolutely believe Americans should hear both sides. \nAbsolutely. But I believe--strongly believe--the Government should not \nbe in the position of deciding and dictating ``now here is the other \nside.''\n  In the world of communications today, Americans have all sorts of \noptions to hear the other side. All they have to do is turn a dial, all \nthey have to do is push a button, all they have to do is press a mouse, \nand they have that ability.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator concede that the airwaves belong to the \nAmerican people?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I concede the airwaves belong to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield for a further question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator concede that those who use the people's \nairwaves to make a profit have to do it with a license from our \nGovernment?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I understand and agree we have a licensing process.\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield, and I yield to the Senator from Illinois to \npresent the entire question so I can continue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not trying to delay the Senator from Minnesota. I \nwill concede the sense-of-fairness doctrine has been set aside since \nthe Reagan administration. Things have changed in broadcast journalism \nand many other aspects of journalism. I have not seen the Senator's \namendment. I sense I know what it might be leading to, but I want to \nmake sure the premise is something on which we may agree.\n  The airwaves belong to the American people. Those who profit from \nthem do it by permission of the people through their Government and \nthose who use those airwaves should do it responsibly and should seek \nto provide both points of view, both sides of the story so that \nAmericans can reach a decision. I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he \ndisagrees with any of those points?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to my learned colleague from \nIllinois, here is our point of disagreement. There is no question, in \nfact, that there is a licensing process. I am a former mayor. We \nlicensed a lot of things. But I think one of the basic principles at \nstake is we don't license and measure content when it comes to speech, \nand that is my concern. That, in fact, is because of the multiplicity \nof communications options that are available to citizens today--as I \nsaid before, blogs, Internet, broadband, and satellite--which we didn't \nhave 20, 30 years ago.\n  Where my objection lies, and the importance of this amendment says \nGovernment should not be monitoring and regulating content. We are not \ntalking about obscenity. There are things the Senator from Illinois \nunderstands the Government has an absolute right to monitor or to deal \nwith. When we get to content--and that is my concern, that those who \nhave raised the issue ``bring back the fairness doctrine,'' are \nbringing it back, and the cry then is to regulate content. And that is \nwhat I object to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask the Senator to yield further for a question, \nthere was a recent episode in the last 2 years when the Public \nBroadcasting Corporation took a show by Bill Moyers off the air and \nwanted to replace it with a show authored by the Wall Street Journal. \nThere were complaints, obviously, that Mr. Moyers was too liberal in \ncontent.\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota believe that was a fair outcome or \nwould he concede it would have been a fairer outcome to allow the \nAmerican people to watch both shows, by the Wall Street Journal and \nBill Moyers, and to hear both points of view and decide what they agree \nwith?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Two observations. First, I am thrilled I am having this \ndiscussion with the Senator from Illinois. My concern is that I just \noffered an amendment which was objected to. Had the amendment not been \nobjected to, we would have time for a full debate on this amendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from South Dakota have a \ngreat interest in this issue. I presume my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle--the junior Senator from Massachusetts has raised concerns \nthat we should reinstate the fairness doctrine. He said that publicly.\n  I would love to have this debate, and yet I stand here offering an \namendment which is being objected to and so instead we are having this \ncolloquy. I appreciate the question and will respond. But I am \ndisappointed that the other side of the aisle will not give us an \nopportunity for a full debate on this issue.\n  In fact, I want all sides to be heard. What I don't want, and the \nfundamental disagreement is, for the regulatory power of Government to \nsit in judgment as Big Brother, to oversee and take stock with pencil \nand pad and take notes: Well, we had Sean Hannity over here. Now we \nhave to get somebody on the left over there.\n  Balance should be heard, but we have a marketplace that provides that \nopportunity. We have folks who support the perspective of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and we have folks who support my perspective. Sometimes \nwe are the same. But for Government to dictate, that is the concern. \nThat is why the FCC got rid of the fairness doctrine in 1987. It is why \nthe Supreme Court raised questions about the necessity of the fairness \ndoctrine. I don't think it is constitutional. We have not gotten to \nthat question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I will yield for one further question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry to interrupt. Through the Commerce Committee \nor the appropriate committee of jurisdiction, we can really get into \nthis question. But the Senator is arguing that the marketplace can \nprovide. What is the Senator's response if the marketplace fails to \nprovide? What if it doesn't provide the opportunity to hear both points \nof view? Since people who are seeking the licenses are using America's \nairwaves, does the Government, speaking for the people of this country, \nhave any interest at that point to step in and make sure there is a \nfair and balanced approach to the information given to the American \npeople?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I will respond to the final question. \nThere is a very clear disagreement here. The Government does not have \nthe responsibility to regulate content of speech. That is what the \nfirst amendment is about. That is exactly what the first amendment is \nabout. Government is not supposed to be regulating content, and at a \ntime in 1949 when we had three-network TV stations, basically when we \nhad limited channels of communication, I presume there was a legitimate \nconcern on the part of some that in fact Government needs to step in \nand ensure balance. But now we are in 2007. I cannot even conceive that \nthe market cannot provide opportunities for differing positions because \nit does.\n  In the end, consumers also have a right, based on the market, to make \nchoices. So if they make choices that say we want to hear more of one \nside than the other, that is OK. I think it is very dangerous, I say to \nmy friend from Illinois--I think it is very dangerous for Government to \nbe in the position of deciding what is fair and balanced. As we see on \nthe floor of the Senate, oftentimes amongst ourselves, hopefully \nlearned individuals who have the great and humble opportunity to serve \nin the Senate, we have differences as to what is fair and balanced.\n  The reason we have a first amendment is we get Government out of \nmeasuring, controlling, dictating, and regulating content. That is my \nconcern, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  I would love to have a debate with the Senator from Illinois. I would \nhave hoped that this amendment would simply have been put in the queue, \nwould have been heard. I think Americans love a fair fight. I think \nAmericans love this kind of dialog. There is nothing fair about the \nfairness doctrine. There is nothing fair if the intent--really, we have \nto lay it on the table--if the intent is to shut down or to limit the \nconservative talk radio. That is where the concern is. Yet, as I said \nbefore, one can raise questions about balance in the print media, one \ncan raise questions about balance in the broadcast media, but I don't \nthink it is the role of Government to be sitting there listening and \nthen weighing, deciding what is fair and balanced, and then requiring, \nunder penalty, a broadcaster to then have to present an opposing point \nof view.\n  What is going to happen--and history has shown this--broadcasters are \nsimply going to say: Let's do something else. Why be in that position \nwhere there may be a line that may be crossed, and I don't know what \nthat line is, and that line may change depending on who is sitting as \nFCC Chair.\n  As I said before, beyond first amendment principles, there are market \nprinciples. Talk radio has flourished because of the market. The \nconsumer says, I want to listen, and they have been given choices. They \ncan simply turn off the dial. They can shut off the radio if they don't \nwant to listen, but it has flourished. It has flourished because of \ndemand, and that is the market, not because of Government command, not \nbecause of Government control. We don't want the Government regulating \ncontent.\n  Like never before, Americans have a wealth of information and \nviewpoints thanks to cable television, radio, the Internet, and that is \na good thing, and let it flourish.\n  John Kennedy stated:\n\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\n\n       We are not afraid to entrust the American people with \n     unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and \n     competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its \n     people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a \n     nation that is afraid of its people.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not afraid of the people. I am not afraid of the \npeople having access to the information and ideas they want access to, \nbut I am afraid of the Government stepping in and regulating content. \nWe have a first amendment that is the underpinning, the foundation, of \nall the other amendments. The fairness doctrine flies in the face of \nthe first amendment. It was rejected in 1987. The idea of bringing it \nback today is a very bad idea.\n  This amendment specifically includes the Armed Forces Network. Our \nfolks who are out there on the frontline fighting shouldn't be thinking \nthat back home someone at the FCC is listening and monitoring and \ndeciding what is fair and what is balanced. Let the people decide. Let \nthe market decide. Let the first amendment flourish.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Florida yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course, I yield to my distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Florida, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is there a time limit on my \nremarks?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I come to this discussion of \nthe Iraq issue from a position of having been in the political arena \nfor 35 years. My brand of politics is moderation. My representation is \ngenerally recognized as being in the mainstream. That is clearly where \nmy State of Florida and the majority of its politics is, in the \nmainstream of American politics.\n  Since so many people like to categorize us in little boxes of where \nour politics is, I am generally categorized in that box as a moderate \nDemocrat. I am here today to state why I will vote for the Levin-Reed \namendment with regard to the troops in Iraq.\n  How did I come to this conclusion? Remembering an Alfred Lloyd \nTennyson poem, ``Ulysses,'' he says, ``I am a part of all that I have \nmet.'' Certainly, my frame of reference was shaped in large part upon \ngraduation from college, being commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy Reserve and being on active duty, first going on active duty as a \n1st lieutenant and then, within a year--since that was the Vietnam era \nwith rapid promotions--serving the second of my 2 years of active duty \nas a captain in the U.S. Army.\n  Vietnam was a tough experience for our country. As I went on active \nduty, President Johnson had announced he was not going to run for \nreelection, in large part, the Nation was split asunder over the issue \nof support of the war. Then during my 2 years of active duty, it was \nthe beginning of the Nixon administration, and as they tried to grapple \nwith the war, they concluded some 4 years later that we had to start \nwithdrawing.\n  It was a time that certainly is different from now because there is \nsuch a respect for our troops now. That was not necessarily the case \nback then when I was in the military. Certainly, all the interaction I \nhad as a military officer was the best, but that was not the case for a \nlot of returning soldiers. Indeed, they came home to an America that \ndid not support them and did not stand up for them. We learned a lot of \nvery painful lessons out of that Vietnam experience.\n  Most of us in this Senate who have the fresh memories of that time, \nwhen we go to the Mall to the Vietnam Memorial, there is emotion that \nis evoked--often the emotion of choking up, as you see those almost \n60,000 names and you see those dramatic statues of both the men and the \nwomen who served in Vietnam.\n  One of the awful lessons of Vietnam is that you cannot conduct a war \nunless you have the support of the American people. Tragically, that is \nthe situation we are getting to today. Today it is a lot different than \nVietnam because there is outright unabashed patriotic support for our \ntroops and the extraordinary job they are doing. But it is very clear, \nif you listen to the street, if you talk to your people back home, you \nrealize the American people are not satisfied with the conduct of this \nwar, they are not satisfied with the progress of this war, and the \nAmerican people, in increasingly larger numbers, are not supporting \nthis war.\n  How did I come to this conclusion to support the Levin-Reed \namendment? Well, back in 2003, when we voted on the authorization for \nthis war, I voted for it, as did most of the Senators here. The \ninformation we were given at the time was clearly information that we \nbelieved--that was that there were weapons of mass destruction, there \nwere certainly chemical and biological weapons, and we were led to \nbelieve Saddam Hussein also had a very active nuclear program.\n  I am not talking about whispers behind the door or surreptitious \nnotes that were passed in the night. I am talking about meeting after \nmeeting--right up there in S. 407, the secure room in the U.S. \nCapitol--sometimes when 75 Senators were present, being briefed by the \nhighest levels of the Government: The Secretary of Defense, the \nNational Security Adviser, the head and deputy head of the CIA, the \nhead of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Over and over these were the \nimpressions; indeed, the specific information that we received.\n  Yes, I got a copy of the National Intelligence Estimate, and it was \nin a meeting called by our chairman, Joe Biden, who had a classified \nmeeting to discuss it with representatives of the intelligence \ncommunity. Indeed, the Director of the CIA, George Tenet, at a later \nmeeting, confirmed what others had already briefed, that there was a \nprogram that Saddam Hussein likely had to take unmanned aerial \nvehicles, put biological and chemical weapons on them, put them on \nships off the east coast of the United States, and launch them over \neast coast cities of the United States.\n  Did I conclude there was an imminent threat to the interests of the \nUnited States by virtue of the information I was given? You bet I did.\n  George Tenet even confirmed that after the war started, the report's \nveracity.\n  What was worse--and what I was not told--was a major part of the \nintelligence community, the Air Force intelligence, disputed the \nunmanned aerial vehicles report. In fact, Air Force intelligence knew \nmore about unmanned aerial vehicles than anybody else, and they said \nthey were likely for reconnaissance purposes, not for offensive \npurposes.\n  So knowing today what I know--that none of that was true--would I \nhave voted the same way? Of course I wouldn't. But I voted in 2002 for \nthe war authorization on the basis of what I was told and which I \nbelieved.\n  In 2006, the agitation against the war continued to swell and the \nquestion came up about withdrawal. Again, I supported the \nadministration, and I voted against a withdrawal timeline because I \nfelt if we had a chance of success, we should not be micro-managing the \nmilitary, and we should let them make their decisions.\n  But then things started to change. At the end of the year came a big \nchange the report of the Iraq Study Commission. Jim Baker and Lee \nHamilton, two of the most respected Americans, co-chaired this. Listen \nto names of the members of this commission who were unanimous. Larry \nEagleburger, former Secretary of State. He replaced, by the way, Robert \nGates, when Gates had to resign because the President was making him \nthe Secretary of Defense. Gates was in on a lot of this Commission \ntestimony.\n  Listen to the rest of them. Vernon Jordan; Ed Meese, former Attorney \nGeneral; Sandra Day O'Connor, everybody knows who she is; Leon Panetta, \nformer Chief of Staff to the President; Bill Perry, former Secretary of \nDefense; Chuck Robb, a former colleague here; Alan Simpson, another \nformer colleague here.\n  These are the people who made up this Iraq Study Commission, and they \ncame out unanimously. There were five\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nDemocrats and five Republicans. It was co-chaired by Jim Baker, the \nformer Secretary of State, and Lee Hamilton, the former chairman of the \nHouse Committee on International Relations. They said there has to be a \ndifferent way and it had to be a goal of withdrawal next spring.\n  So when this issue came up again in the spring of 2007, I voted for \nthe report's goal--an amendment sponsored by Senator Levin and Senator \nReed--the goal of the start of a withdrawal--a partial, gradual \nwithdrawal--not a complete withdrawal, a gradual withdrawal. The goal \nwas April of 2008. Now the amendment has been changed, to mandate a \ngradual withdrawal being completed by April of next year, 2008.\n  That doesn't mean a complete withdrawal. This amendment says is they \nare going to leave a good portion of the troops in Iraq to do a number \nof things. What are those things?\n  First, I wish to say that, except for the requirement of a \nwithdrawal, the Levin-Reed amendment is very similar to the Iraq Study \nCommission report. Senator Salazar and a host of bipartisan Senators, \nincluding this Senator, are cosponsors of Senator Salazar's amendment. \nThe Salazar amendment gives us almost word for word the Iraq Study \nCommission Report. What is before us today is something similar, but \ninstead of the goal of withdrawal by next April, it is a requirement.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment would require the President to implement a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that \nincludes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors. It would ensure \nthat our troops who remain in Iraq will perform the most vital \nmissions--that of protecting the United States and coalition personnel, \ntraining and equipping the Iraqi Army, and continuing to fight the \nterrorist groups, particularly al-Qaida--and it requires the President \nto appoint an international mediator with the authority to engage \nIraq's various factions in an inclusive political process.\n  The Iraq Study Commission report says: Get going. Do an aggressive \ndiplomatic effort in the region. All five Republicans and five \nDemocrats on the commission said: You ought to open up to Syria, and \nyou ought to open up to Iran, under the theory that, indeed, we ought \nto be talking to our enemies.\n  When I took off for the Middle East, about nine countries within a 2-\nweek period before last Christmas, one of my stops was to return to \nSyria for a third visit with the President of Syria, Assad. The White \nHouse said don't go. The State Department came and visited me and said \ndon't go.\n  I said the cat is out of the bag. The bipartisan Iraq Study \nCommission says we have to open up and talk to enemies. That is the \ncommonsense thing to do.\n  I was attacked by Tony Snow in his White House daily briefing. Guess \nwhat happened? Thereafter, Secretary Rice was meeting with the Syrian \nForeign Minister, the same one with whom I met, along with President \nAssad.\n  It is all a part of the necessity of us engaging diplomatically in \nthe region at the same time we are trying to figure out what to do with \nour military.\n  Earlier this year, over many objections, the President then decided \nhe needed to send more troops to Iraq in a surge, and he said it was \nintended to bring about greater stability. I opposed the surge. I \npointed out, from my experience and understanding of Iraq, the surge \nwould put additional American soldiers and marines in the middle of the \nsectarian violence crossfire of a civil war.\n  The sectarian violence has only been going on for 1,327 years, ever \nsince the battle of Karbala in 680 A.D. After that battle, you had, in \neffect, the Shiites separating from the Sunnis, and that has led to \nantipathy that it is hard for us in America to understand. Yet it \ncontinues.\n  I said at the time there was a surge that I would support, and that \nwas in Anbar Province, which is mainly Sunni and where the real enemy \nis al-Qaida. I believed that marines are having some success.\n  I understand I have 1 minute left. Mr. President, I ask for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I believed the marines were making progress. \nBut there you had just Sunnis and you had al-Qaida that was trying to \nundermine the Sunni leadership, and the marines working with the Sunnis \nwere having some effect. That is the part of the surge I supported. I \ndid not support the surge going into Baghdad in the middle of the \ncrossfire of a civil war.\n  The President ignored the findings and the warnings of the Iraq Study \nGroup which recommended a comprehensive strategy for changing the \ncourse in Iraq.\n  So what has happened? In the last 6 months, we have spent more than \n$60 billion and we have lost another 600 American lives and many more \nhave suffered grievous injuries. Despite those losses, the sectarian \nviolence has only increased.\n  Yesterday, the President reported that the Iraqi Government has \nfailed to meet many of the benchmarks that we laid out earlier this \nyear. Only the Iraqis can make the compromises necessary to end this \nwar. Our continued open-ended presence has provided them with no \nincentive to do so. We cannot and we should not be in the middle of \ntheir civil war.\n  What we need is a diplomatic solution with an aggressive, diplomatic \neffort--which was argued by the Iraq Study Group.\n  We also need a political solution instead of a military solution. The \npossible solution that I am drawn to is the one put forth by Senator \nBiden. Under the Iraqi Constitution, which is a federal form of \ngovernment, it will allow autonomy of various regions or states that \ncan provide for their own governance along with a National Government \nthat will allocate the oil revenues according to the population.\n  But still, the President has not changed course in Iraq, despite the \nfacts on the ground and the overwhelming desire of the American people.\n  So, with a heavy heart, it brings me today to say that we must by law \ninsist that he begin the reduction of the forces in Iraq and the \ntransition of our mission there. Along with others, I do not reach this \nconclusion lightly nor with any pleasure. I am extremely concerned by \nthe great toll that this war has taken on our Armed Forces and our \nmilitary families across this Nation, with the thousands killed and \nmany more injured.\n  I am very concerned about the lack of training and the lack of time \nfor recuperation for our troops, especially the National Guard and the \nReserves. I am very close to the Florida National Guard.\n  I am very concerned about the situation in Iraq, that it keeps \nescalating, the violence, especially among Iraqis, and the lack of \ntheir production of an economic lifeline by the production of their \noil. It is being lost to theft and to sabotage. They can't get their \narms around it.\n  And I am very concerned about the plight of the Iraqi people, \nincluding now more than 2 million refugees.\n  I am concerned about the possibility of greater regional violence and \ninstability. I am concerned about the failure of the Maliki government, \nthe failure of the government in and of itself, but especially, as we \nsee now, the failure of the government to lead and to enact necessary \nreforms.\n  I will conclude by saying, an open-ended commitment, keeping our \ntroops in the middle of a civil war, is not the solution. We must not \nonly demand that the President change course, but we must require that \nhe do so. So I rise today in support of the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                      Children's Health Insurance\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about children's \nhealth insurance for a number of reasons, but principally because the \nPresident of the United States, several times in the last couple of \nweeks and months--but especially this past week--has spoken to this \nissue in a way that I think is misleading, in a way that I think does \nnot do justice to this important, compelling issue: whether or not this \ncountry is going to make a real commitment to insuring all of our \nchildren.\n  This is an issue that you and I, Mr. President, have spoken about, as \nhave many others in this Chamber. It is a major priority for the \nAmerican people. I will give the bad news first. The\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\nbad news is we have 9 million American children who have no health \ninsurance. That number stares us in the face every day. There is no \nreason this Congress and this Senate should not do something about \nthat.\n  It is particularly disturbing and insulting that we have not only 9 \nmillion uninsured American children, but we have that number in the \nface of some other numbers, like tax cuts for very wealthy people. Over \nand over again, in the last couple of years, this Congress and the \nCongress before it, has made judgments about priorities. I am afraid \nthere are some people who are making that judgment again about tax cuts \nfor very wealthy people over health care for children.\n  That is the reality. Unfortunately, we have now not only the 9 \nmillion uninsured, but here is another number. Of that 9 million, 6 \nmillion children of that 9 million are eligible for programs that can \nhelp them now, either Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  The final bit of bad news and the challenge for us, not only as a \nSenate but as a people, is that 80 percent of the 6 million who could \nbe helped right now by both programs--80 percent of them come from \nworking families. That should be disturbing to all of us.\n  Here is the good news. We can solve this problem. Not in one budget, \nnot in one year, but over time if we make a real commitment. We can do \nit by supporting the SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. In my home State we call it CHIP, but the Federal Government \nrefers to it as SCHIP. In our State, over 160,000 kids are served by \nthis program now, but there are tens of thousands of other children who \nare not covered right now. We need to cover them in Pennsylvania and \nacross the country. We know there are millions of children right now \nacross the country who are not covered today who could be covered if we \nmake the full commitment.\n  When we talk about children's health insurance, a lot of people \nwatching and a lot of people thinking about this issue say: Oh, it is \nanother Government program. It will cost a lot of money. Why are we \ndoing this?\n  Here is the evidence. We have a 10-year experiment in this country on \nchildren's health insurance. Thank God, under a Democratic President--\nClinton--and a divided Congress, 10 years ago that commitment was made, \nand now we have the evidence. We know for all these children, 6 million \ncovered--9 million not covered but 6 million covered, we know the \ntremendous benefit that means to employers way down the road. We also \nknow what that means for the skills that are developed for one child \nand for many others. It is better for economic growth to ensure \nchildren. It is better for gross national product. It is better to \nbuild a skilled workforce with children's health insurance.\n  Here is the challenge we have, in terms of this year's budget. I and \nmany others, including the Presiding Officer and many people in this \nChamber--mostly on this side but even some on the other side of the \naisle--supported a proposal to say that over 5 years we would spend $50 \nbillion on children's health insurance.\n  It sounds like a lot of money, doesn't it. But when you break it \ndown, $10 billion a year for children's health insurance is a small \ninvestment over the life of that child and over the life of our \ncountry. That is what the goal was, and that still is the goal.\n  Here is the difficulty. We have to deal with the realities of the \nbudget. Senator Max Baucus and others on the Finance Committee--and, \nfrankly, in both parties but mostly on the Democratic side--have worked \nout an agreement on $35 billion, which is a very good start. We can \ngrow that, but they deserve a lot of credit for making sure that money \nwas put in the Finance Committee proposal that is still being worked \non.\n  But Here is the problem.\n  In the face of that bipartisanship 10 years ago, and every year since \non children's health insurance--in the face of all the benefits to our \neconomy, not to mention the life of a child, and also in the face of \nthe consensus that is emerging now in this body about the priority of \nchildren's health insurance, to get at least the $35 billion over 5 \nyears--here is the problem. We have a President who thinks something \nelse.\n  President Bush recently talked about this initiative, to get $50 \nbillion or even to get $35 billion, as somehow a federalization of \nhealth care for children, which is, I guess, to some people a scary \nword, a word that causes them concern.\n  But there are a lot of Governors across this country, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who think otherwise. So I think I have a basic question for \nthe President, and I will conclude with this because he has been \nmisleading people on this issue. Here is the question for the President \nof the United States. If you can give a tax cut in 1 year for people \nmaking over $200,000 a year, that amounts to $100 billion, if that is \nyour policy, to give $100 billion in tax cuts to very wealthy people, \nwhy would you not be willing to spend $10 billion a year for children's \nhealth insurance?\n  That is the question I have for the President. So if this President \nand this Congress are concerned about a skilled workforce and \ndeveloping entrepreneurs and people to contribute to our economy, we \nbetter make a commitment to children in the dawn of their lives to make \nsure they can have the skills they need down the road. But even apart \nfrom the skills, it is the right thing to do. Mr. President, if you can \nhelp the millionaires, the multimillionaires, and the billionaires, why \nwon't you make a full commitment to help the children of America, the \nworking poor and middle-income children?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the motion now that is pending is the \nLevin-Reed, et al., amendment. The floor is open for Senators to come \nand speak on that amendment. I would hope those who have speeches will \ndo that. We need to get to a vote on this amendment early next week. \nThere is no reason this amendment should be the subject of a filibuster \nwith the subject that is on every American's mind. They want us to be \nable to vote up or down on this amendment. I hope it is not necessary \nthat there has to be a cloture motion, because the Senate should \nexpress its will on a subject of this importance. But this is one of \nthe many times that will be available in the next few days to speak on \nthis amendment. We will be here Monday afternoon. We are here now. We \nwill be here Tuesday, obviously, before the meetings of our parties at \nlunch. But I would hope people would take advantage of this opportunity \nto come and speak, pro or con, on the pending amendment, because there \nis no excuse for a filibuster on an amendment of this importance that \nthe entire country is watching. This is one of a number of \nopportunities we are going to have in the next few days for Senators to \nexpress their opinion. I hope they will use this opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we know of two speakers who do wish to come \nover here shortly, about 11:20 and 11:30. We do not know of any other \nspeakers who wanted to be recognized at this point.\n  We are on the bill now. In a moment I am going to ask consent that we \ngo into morning business, with speakers limited to 10 minutes each. But \nI want to note my good friend from Virginia has suggested that we make \nit clear to the body that we are on the bill now. The amendment which \nis pending is the Levin-Reed, et al., amendment, and that we will, \nafter we leave here today, be returning on Monday, at a time that the \nleaders will set, to this bill. This bill will be the pending matter. \nThis amendment will be the pending matter on Monday when we return.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for suggesting that we make that \nclear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I concur in the distinguished chairman's \nobservation. I wish to compliment you and the ranking member, Mr. \nMcCain, for the progress you have made this\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\nweek on this bill. Having had this responsibility, sharing it with you \nfor these many years, I would say the two of you have done \nexceptionally well.\n  Mr. President, also it is my intention--I am doing the final bit of \ndrafting on an amendment by myself, with the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar. I hope to be filing that before 12 noon today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we also urge colleagues who still have \namendments they wish to have considered to bring those amendments here \nto the floor by noon; to bring them here on Monday, because Senator \nMcCain and I have both spoken on the necessity of getting amendments \nthat are going to be filed to be filed by the end of business on \nMonday.\n  We have a lot of amendments we have got to consider. Hopefully we can \nclear some. But the body would be very--colleagues would be doing the \nbody a favor to get these amendments in if there are any additional \namendments they want to consider.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Levin's \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2008. This legislation is long overdue, and I hope all my colleagues \nwill support its swift implementation. I want to thank the chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, Senator McCain, and \nthe chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Akaka, for \ntheir leadership on this issue, and I commend them for the good work \nthey have done. I also want to thank my colleagues for working so \nclosely with me to get this legislation passed.\n  A few months ago I had the pleasure of introducing the Wounded \nWarriors Assistance Act of 2007 with my good friend from Georgia, \nSenator Saxby Chambliss. Our intent was to correct the injustice done \nto our returning wounded veterans and to improve the access and quality \nof health care our military personnel receive. There have been too many \ncases where our veterans have slipped through cracks in the system, and \nthis is why I support the Levin amendment to H.R. 1585. It is a \ncomprehensive policy of care and management for servicemembers with \ncombat-related injuries or illnesses, a concept which mirrors the \nintent of the legislation I introduced. I worked on this legislation \nfor a long time, and I am proud to have worked with the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and Senator Chambliss to put forth meaningful \nlanguage that has the potential to directly help those who defend our \ncountry.\n  This legislation will provide our veterans with assistance to make \nsure their medical needs are met and bureaucracy does not interfere \nwith their progress. While this legislation addresses enhanced health \ncare, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, \ndisability evaluations, and improvement of facilities housing military \npatients, this amendment will ultimately restore confidence in the \nintegrity and efficiency of the military medical system and ensure our \nwounded warriors feel secure in the fact they will always receive \ncommitted, quality care. This act will also increase training for \nhealth care professionals and medical case managers and make a \nphysician or health care professional available to help veterans \nnavigate the medical evaluation board process, translate findings and \nrecommendations, and explaining medical terms and regulations. This \nprocess is a critical crossroad in a service man or woman's career and \ncan be very emotional, confusing, and stressful. I do not believe our \nreturning veterans should have to deal with any more adversity or undue \nstress while trying to recover from their injuries, and this \nlegislation will make this process easier for them.\n  Another provision that I am particularly proud of is the section on \ndisability severance pay. This addition expands the population that is \neligible for the enhancement of disability severance pay to include \ninjuries incurred during performance of duty in support of combat \noperations. Oftentimes our military personnel are wounded in training \nexercises before they are sent into theater, and in current law they \nare not eligible to receive disability severance pay. For example, if a \nsoldier is wounded while training to fast rope out of a helicopter, he \nor she will now be fairly compensated for their sacrifice in support of \ncombat operations.\n  In my home State where 369 Arkansas soldiers have been wounded, my \noffice has provided immeasurable assistance to ensure those veterans \nget better care. I am honored to support this legislation as it also \naffects over 25,000 wounded warriors nationwide. I frequently make \ntrips to Walter Reed Hospital, and I visit wounded Arkansans who are \nsome of the most determined and inspiring individuals I have ever met. \nHowever, they will still require top notch medical care and a lot of \nprayer in order to recover, and I want to make sure they get it.\n  Again, I am proud to support Senator Levin's amendment to H.R. 1585, \nand I am happy to see it adopted into the fiscal year 2008 National \nDefense Authorization Act. We owe nothing less than the best for our \ntroops who make great sacrifices for defense of this country. I firmly \nbelieve this legislation is what we need to reform and modernize the \nway we care for our wounded soldiers.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on an amendment \noffered by Senator Sessions, amendment No. 2024, that stated the policy \nof the United States on the protection of the United States and its \nallies against the possible threat from the potential development of \nIranian ballistic missiles. I supported that amendment, but my vote \nshould not be misconstrued as a blanket endorsement of missile defense \ninstallations, nor as support for military action against Iran.\n  The amendment by Senator Sessions noted Iran's continuing work on a \nnuclear program despite the many concerns voiced by the international \ncommunity, as well as Iran's development of ballistic missiles of \nincreasing range and sophistication. Iranian success in these two areas \nmight eventually pose a threat to the forward-deployed forces of the \nUnited States and NATO allies in Europe. In the longer term, an Iranian \nnuclear and ballistic missile program could perhaps pose a threat even \nto the U.S. mainland. I must state clearly and unequivocally, however, \nthat the best way to confront these possible long-term threats is \ndiplomatically. Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs are not \nan imminent threat to United States security by anyone's reckoning. The \nbest defense against an Iranian nuclear weapon is for that weapon never \nto have been developed. We have time, working together with the \ninternational community, to direct Iran toward a more peaceful path. I \nnote the good news being reported in today's newspapers that Iran has \nagreed to allow IAEA inspectors in to inspect its nuclear facilities. \nThis is a step in the right direction, and we should support these \nefforts to bring Iran into compliance with its international \nobligations. We will not tolerate an illicit nuclear weapons program, \nbut neither should we rush headlong into militant provocations.\n  The Sessions amendment stated the policy of the United States to \n``develop and deploy, as soon as technologically possible, in \nconjunction with its allies and other nations whenever possible, an \neffective defense against the threat from Iran described in subsection \n(a)(1) that will provide protection for the United States, its friends, \nand its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. . . .'' Further, the \namendment stated that deployment of these defenses should be \ncomplementary to any missile defenses that might be deployed by NATO in \nEurope.\n  This amendment does not say anything new, and it does not imply a \nchange in U.S. policy. The United States and its allies have been \ndeveloping missile defenses for many years now. The bill to which this \namendment was offered contains an additional $315 million to accelerate \nseveral missile defense programs aimed at protecting the United States \nand its allies. The Aegis program, the Patriot PAC3, and the THAAD \nsystem program will all benefit from those additional funds. \nImportantly, the underlying bill limits the availability of authorized \nfunding for missile defense installations in Europe until two \nconditions have been met: one, approval is given by the countries in \nwhich missile defense components are to be located; and, two, 45 days \nhave elapsed since Congress receives a report from the Secretary of \nDefense on the proposed deployment. These requirements will help to \nensure that ballistic missile defense programs\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nare not put in place hastily or unwisely.\n  I voted for the amendment because I agree with its underlying \nsentiment, which is that the United States should prepare defenses \nagainst foreseeable threats. What I fear, however, is that the votes in \nfavor of this amendment will become fodder for attempts to further \nincrease funding for missile defense programs that are already more \nthan adequately funded and which history has shown us time and again \nare technologically challenging and cannot be rushed. Over the years, I \nhave seen this tactic used time and again for missile defense programs. \nIt does not matter how much more money is thrown at them, the \ntechnology cannot be rushed. Given the demands for funding for troops \nin harm's way now from mortar rounds, bullets, and IEDs, we must be \ncautious of attempts to further bloat a program intended to confront a \nfar-off threat that may never materialize. My vote in favor of a policy \nof adequately preparing for a long term threat over the long term \nshould not be interpreted as support for excessive spending on missile \ndefense development and deployment. Further, it must not be interpreted \nas a vote suggesting that the situation at this time justifies the \nPresident to use military force in Iran.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Dignity for \nour Wounded Warriors Act, which has just been approved as an amendment \nto the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense authorization bill. Under \nthe leadership of Senators Carl Levin, Patty Murray, and Daniel Akaka, \nwe have drafted this comprehensive response to the failures of the Bush \nadministration to properly care for our wounded servicemembers and \nveterans.\n  We were all shocked and awed by the sorry state of outpatient care at \nWalter Reed. More than 22,000 Purple Hearts have been awarded in Iraq. \nWe know now that our troops have been twice wounded--once on the \nbattlefield and again battling a bureaucracy at home.\n  We know that acute care for our injured troops has been astounding. \nOur military medical doctors and nurses are performing heroically, \ngiving our troops historic rates of survival against devastating new \nweapons of war. We owe a debt of gratitude to these military medical \nprofessionals and to the medics on the battlefield. But while we have \nsaved their lives, we are failing to give them their life back. \nOutpatient care, facilities, social work, case workers, disability \nbenefits--the whole system seems dysfunctional.\n  In March, I visited Walter Reed and met with outpatients at Mologne \nHouse. I am so proud of their service and sacrifice for our Nation and \nso embarrassed by the treatment they have received. We know this \nproblem isn't limited to Walter Reed. It is part of the reckless \nincompetence of this administration. They took us into this war without \na plan for winning it or caring for those we ask to fight it. That is \nwhy the Senate has today taken this important step to provide the care \nour troops, veterans, and their families have earned.\n  This is a comprehensive bill to address the treatment and care of \ninjured veterans and servicemembers. To ensure that what happened in \nBuilding 18 at Walter Reed never happens again, the bill establishes \nminimum standards of repair and maintenance for military treatment \nfacilities and outpatient housing. It authorizes at least $73 million \nin additional funding to enhance care for traumatic brain injury, TBI, \nand post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, including $3 million for \npilot projects to monitor TBI; $10 million for Centers of Excellence \nfor TBI; and $50 million for additional TBI and PTSD research. This is \nin addition to the $900 million in funding for TBI and PTSD programs \nadded by Congress to the fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act.\n  To support a smooth transition for injured troops from military \nmedical care to the Veterans' Administration, this bill also authorizes \n$10 million for a joint DOD/VA office for electronic health records and \nestablishes comprehensive readjustment studies for Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans by the Defense Department, the Veterans' Administration, and \nthe National Academy of Sciences.\n  To develop a better understanding of the signature wounds of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, the amendment directs DOD to establish Centers \nof Excellence for TBI and PTSD and to report to Congress on their \nprogress. It requires comprehensive plans for prevention, diagnosis, \nand treatment of TBI and PTSD as well as long-term studies, clinical \ntrials, and research about mental health, TBI, and PTSD.\n  Our amendment also addresses the unique needs of female \nservicemembers by requiring DOD and the VA to take into account the \nneeds of women servicemembers and women veterans in every aspect of \npatient and veterans care. Every report required by the amendment must \ninclude a description of how it specifically addresses the needs of our \nwomen warriors. It requires DOD and the VA to review the need for \nmental health treatment tailored to meet the needs of female \nservicemembers and veterans and requires the two agencies to develop a \njoint policy for the treatment and care of mental health, TBI, and PTSD \nfor female servicemembers and veterans.\n  To cut through the health care bureaucracy, our bill entitles any \nservicemember or former servicemember with ``severe injury or illness'' \nto treatment in any DOD or VA approved medical facility, whatever is \nclosest or most convenient for the patient. It also authorizes military \nand VA facilities to provide counseling and medical care for families \nand caregivers who are supporting servicemembers--this is important \nsupport for those who have to travel to a treatment facility in order \nto support their injured loved one.\n  To help injured servicemembers transition from DOD health care to the \nVA system, the amendment requires improved information sharing between \nagencies and establishes common processes, procedures, and standards \nbetween the two agencies. It also institutes a 3-year overlap of \nhealthcare service between DOD and VA for severely injured \nservicemembers, so no injured servicemember is allowed to fall between \nthe cracks.\n  This amendment also takes several important steps to improve the \nquality of care in the VA health care system. It requires the VA to \ncreate rehabilitation and reintegration plans for veterans suffering \nfrom TBI and to provide nursing home care to veterans with severe cases \nof TBI. The amendment also extends the window of time during which \nveterans can seek combat-related medical care, from 2 years to 5 years. \nThis will especially help veterans suffering from PTSD, which can take \nseveral years to develop and diagnose.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has a sacred commitment to honor the \npromises we make to troops and their families when they answer the \nNation's call to duty. I am proud to fight each year to make sure these \npromises made are promises kept. This amendment honors our Nation's \nservice men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9199-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, there is hardly a family in America that \nhasn't had an experience with tobacco and cancer. My family is no \nexception. When I was 14 years old, my 53-year-old father died of lung \ncancer. He smoked two packs of Camels a day. He was hopelessly addicted \nto tobacco, and we lost him at what I now view as a very early age. I \ncan recall, as a student in high school, being in his hospital room \nwhen he drew his last, labored breath and the sadness that fell over me \non\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nNovember 13, 1959. I didn't walk out of that hospital room vowing I \nwould get even with tobacco companies, but I never escaped the memory \nof that family experience. Many other families have a similar story to \ntell.\n  The day came many years later when I had an opportunity, as a new \nMember of the House of Representatives, to do something. There is \nanother story leading up to that experience. It involves the customary \nrace of Members of Congress for airplanes. We spend most of our life \nracing through airports. In this particular instance I was in Phoenix, \nAZ trying to fly to Chicago, long before there were transportation \nsecurity agencies and people taking off their shoes and X-ray machines. \nI got to the airport 20 minutes before the plane was about to take off. \nI raced to the United Airlines counter. A young woman was there and I \ngave her my ticket.\n  She said: I will get your boarding pass, but you will to have run to \nthe gate. She gave me a boarding pass. This was 20 years ago. She \nhanded to it me. I looked, and it was a middle seat in the smoking \nsection of the airplane. I knew this was a long flight. I said: I know \nI have to get down to the gate, but can't you give me a different seat \nin the nonsmoking section? She said: No, it is the last seat. There is \nnothing I can do about it. Then she looked down at my ticket and my \ntitle and she said: But, Congressman, there is something you can do \nabout it.\n  I got on the airplane. I sat between two what I now characterize as \nchain-smoking sumo wrestlers and spent several hours in misery \nbreathing in their secondhand smoke. I looked around the airplane and \nthought to myself, what about that elderly lady who is up there in the \nsmoking section two rows away; what about that woman with the little \nbaby? This can't be healthy.\n  I came back to Washington and said to my staff: I want to introduce a \nbill banning smoking on airplanes. There was silence in the room. Then \nthey said: You are crazy. Nobody beats the tobacco lobby. The entire \nleadership of the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans, \ndoesn't want any tobacco amendments for a lot of political reasons.\n  Naive and undaunted, I went forward with my quest to ban smoking on \nairplanes. I had a lot of help along the way. Congressman Bill Young of \nFlorida, who still serves, had been one of the early pioneers in \ndealing with tobacco and smoking. He courageously stepped forward and \nsaid: I will make it a bipartisan amendment, but we don't have a \nchance. We were both on the Appropriations Committee. I managed to at \nleast create an opportunity for a vote on the floor of the House.\n  I reached the floor of the House because of another great \nCongressman, now deceased, Claude Pepper. Claude Pepper served in this \nChamber as a Senator. He was defeated and went over and served in the \nHouse of Representatives. Claude Pepper was chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. He came to my rescue when I was about to lose in the Rules \nCommittee. I never appreciated why he did that, why he gave me a chance \nto get a vote on this issue, until later when somebody told me that as \na Senator in the 1930s, Claude Pepper of Florida had pushed for the \ncreation of the National Cancer Institute. He didn't talk much about \ntobacco, being a southerner, but it meant a lot to him personally. He \nmore than anyone gave me my chance to bring this amendment to the \nfloor.\n  So on July 13, 1987, 20 years ago today, I got my chance to offer the \namendment to ban smoking on flights of 2 hours or less. In the \ngalleries of the House were seated uniformed flight attendants from \nmajor airlines. They were on my side. They were sick and tired of \nbreathing in all the smoke on the airplanes. We came to the floor \nexpecting to lose. I didn't realize at the time that the House of \nRepresentatives, and you can add the Senate into the equation, was the \nlargest frequent flier club in America. We spend more time on airplanes \nthan most people. As the amendment was debated, Congressmen started \ncoming forward to speak on behalf of the amendment--some of the most \nliberal, some of the most conservatives, Republicans, Democrats from \nall over the country. I could feel the momentum building. The debate \nwent on for a long time, and the vote was finally taken. The vote was \n198 to 193. My amendment passed.\n  After it passed, I called over to the Senate and contacted the man \nwho was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee on \nTransportation, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. I said to Frank \nLautenberg: Would you consider offering this same amendment in the \nSenate? He said he would, and he did, successfully.\n  That amendment changed America. I didn't know it at the time and I \ndon't want to take more credit than is due, but at the end of the \ndebate to ban smoking on airplanes, people started asking obvious \nquestions. If secondhand smoke is dangerous on an airplane, why isn't \nit dangerous in a train, on a bus, in a hospital, in a school, at a \nHead Start center, in an office building?\n  We know what has happened 20 years later. It has now become customary \nfor people not to smoke and unusual to see anyone smoking in an \nenclosed space that is not their own home. That is a dramatic change. I \nthink it is a change for the better. As a result of that law, which was \na challenge to me, America is a healthier place. Our attitude toward \ntobacco and smoking is much different today than it was.\n\n  Last year in my home State of Illinois, a record-breaking 36 cities \nand counties enacted smokefree laws, more than any other State in the \nNation. I am very proud of that. This was a milestone for another \nreason. We learned the mighty tobacco lobby is not invincible. We \nproved it on the floor of the House and the Senate 20 years ago. We are \nproving it now in city councils and State legislatures across America. \nThis was one of the first times the tobacco industry had ever lost an \nimportant rollcall vote on the floor of the House. It showed that \nCongress could stand up against special interest groups, the wealthy \nand the powerful, those financing campaigns, and instead vote for the \nhealth of all Americans. Twenty years later, smoking is banned on \nalmost all commercial flights worldwide.\n  I had a funny experience a few years after we passed our law. My wife \nand I were flying to Portugal through London. We changed planes in \nLondon to Air Portugal. The British travelers got on the plane and I \nwas shocked to find they had a smoking section on the airplane. I \ncouldn't believe it. It turned out it was a sign that was put on a seat \nthat said ``smoking allowed behind this sign.'' A group of British \ntourists got on and saw this sign and couldn't believe it and said to \nthe flight attendant: What is this all about? She answered: If you want \nto be in a nonsmoking section, you sit on this side of the sign; \nsmoking section is on the other side of the sign. One of the ladies \nsaid: This will never do. She grabbed the sign and went to the last \nseat in the plane and put it on that seat.\n  My wife turned to me and said: Look what you got started.\n  I don't want to take credit for getting that started, but I am kind \nof proud of being part of it. I congratulate a number of pioneers in \nthis area. Air Canada was way ahead of us on this issue. Northwest \nAirlines was one of the first in the Nation to move toward smokefree \nflights--they deserve special recognition--even before a Federal law \nwas passed.\n  We need to remind ourselves from time to time about tobacco and \ncancer and heart disease. We have been lulled into the feeling that \nthis problem is under control. Tobacco-related disease is the No. 1 \npreventable cause of death in America today. It still is an issue. \nThere are still too many children who take up smoking, I mean literally \nchildren. Tobacco companies know that the way to ensnare someone into \ntobacco addiction is to get them started as kids. Kids, rebellious and \ncurious, turn to tobacco, developing an addiction they don't even \nunderstand, finding it hard to quit. They become early, lifelong \nsmokers, and chances are one in three will die because of that habit.\n  This is still an issue. It is an issue we are going to face soon here \nin the Senate, because the Finance Committee is considering increasing \nthe tobacco tax on America. I am sure there will be screams that that \nis unfair to smokers. But I have reached the point now where I have to \ntell them that there is a great expense associated with their \naddiction. We also know that increased cost of product reduces the \nlikelihood that kids will use tobacco products. So there is a positive \nthat will come out of it.\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\n  We know when it comes to cancer, heart disease, diseases that affect \nvirtually every organ in the human body and, most importantly, impact \nthe life of virtually every family, tobacco is a negative factor.\n  In 2006, the Surgeon General's report entitled ``Health Consequences \nof Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke,'' reaffirmed previous \nfindings. Secondhand smoke causes heart disease, cancer, respiratory \nproblems, and even death. What was once considered impossible is now \nindustry practice. What was once unknown is now conventional wisdom. It \nis time for us to take the next big step.\n  Next week my colleagues, as members of the HELP Committee, led by my \nfriend Senator Ted Kennedy, will debate giving the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to regulate tobacco.\n  Most Americans do not know that tobacco has a curious place in the \nlaw. It is not considered a food or a drug. If it were a food or a \ndrug, it would be regulated. Those who make the product would have to \ndisclose its contents and would have to put meaningful warning labels \non the product. Tobacco has had carved out for it a niche in the law so \nthat requirement does not apply. Nearly every other industry in America \nthat puts public health at risk is regulated by some Federal agency, \nbut not tobacco.\n  If we are going to continue the fight against big tobacco, and the \ndeath and disease which this product creates, if we are going to secure \nthe ability of all Americans to breathe air that is free from \nsecondhand smoke, if we are to affirm the right of all of us to lead \nhealthy and productive lives, we have to take this next step and allow \nthe Food and Drug Administration to regulate this product. We must \nallow the FDA to regulate an industry that continues to cost us the \nlives of more than 43,000 Americans and over $100 billion in health \ncare costs and lost productivity every single year.\n  Today, there will not be any cakes or parties, but we celebrate the \n20th anniversary of a vote in the House of Representatives which has \nbeen an important part of my legislative career. This vote, to ban \nsmoking on airplanes, 20 years ago, played an important role in \nlaunching the smokefree movement in America. I urge my colleagues to \nmove us closer to finishing the work we have started. We stood up to \nthe tobacco industry then, and we can do it again now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9201-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9201-S9203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last month we had a controversial and \nspirited debate over immigration. It went on for several weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate, and many Members of the Senate thought about it \nand voted one way or the other.\n  The net result is that nothing happened. That is unfortunate. \nEverybody concedes our immigration laws have broken down. About 600,000 \nillegal people come into the United States each year and stay. Over 20 \nyears, we now have 12 million people. The number continues to grow.\n  The lure of the United States is overwhelming. It is a lure which \nbrought my grandparents and my mother to this country as immigrants. \nThey wanted to be part of America. They were willing to leave their \nvillage in Lithuania and the comfort there for an opportunity. They \ncame here, struggled and sacrificed, as immigrants do. They became \nAmericans, and I think in a small way our family has made a difference \nin this country.\n  Now, repeat that story millions of times, and that is who we are as a \nnation. We are people who were unhappy, dissatisfied with what we had, \nsaw America as a better chance, and came here.\n  People continue to come here. Our borders cannot hold them back at \nthis moment. So we debated about making those borders stronger, having \nmore enforcement in the workplace. We debated about: How many workers \ndo we need each year to pick our crops and do our work, in addition to \nthe American workforce? And what will we do with the 12 million who are \nhere?\n  It was a big bill. The debate went on for 3 weeks, which is a long \ntime by Senate standards. At the end of the debate, we could not pass \nit. We did not have the 60 votes. We were not even close. We had 46 \nvotes cast in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  There were aspects of that bill, though, that we should not abandon. \nThere were parts of it we have to return to. I think we need to return \nto enforcement so our borders are safer, so there are fewer \nundocumented immigrants crossing into the United States. I think we \nneed enforcement in the workplace to make sure employers meet their \nresponsibilities.\n  But there are several other parts of the bill which we cannot ignore \neither. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has been a leader on the \nissue of agricultural workers. In her bountiful State, the fruits and \nvegetables will, frankly, spoil in the fields if they do not bring in \nworkers to pick them and harvest them. Americans are not lining up for \nthese jobs. They are hard, dirty, sweaty, tough jobs. Immigrants will \ncome and do it. They have done it before. She is trying to permit the \nag workers, under the law, come and do this work. Otherwise, we are \ngoing to lose a lot of our agriculture in America.\n  There is another aspect of the law which is near and dear to me. \nConsider someone undocumented or illegal who comes to the United States \nand brings a child. It happens. That child may come at a very early \nage, maybe a baby in arms, or 1 or 2 years old, and that child will be \nraised in the United States, go through school, and reach a point in \ntheir life where they do not know any other place but America. They did \nnot choose this country. Their parents chose it. They did not come here \nbecause of any thought about being illegal. They came here with their \nfamilies.\n  What I tried to do several years ago was to write a law to take into \nconsideration these young people. It is called the DREAM Act. The DREAM \nAct was a part of this comprehensive immigration reform bill. Here is \nwhat it says: If you came to the United States before the age of 16, if \nyou have lived in this country for at least 5 years, if you graduate \nfrom high school, and then if you will complete either 2 years of \ncollege or 2 years of service in the military, we will give you an \nopportunity for legal status in America.\n  I have met these kids--young men and women. What a waste it would be \nto turn them away. Currently, that is all our law can do--to say to \nthem: If your parents were undocumented and illegal, you have no place \nin America. At a time when we are importing talent and labor from other \nplaces, why would we turn these young people away?\n  First, they beat the odds. Only half, for example, of undocumented \nkids graduate from high school. These kids have to graduate from high \nschool to even have a chance to become legal.\n  Second, they are going to do more with their lives. That is why I \nwanted to raise the issue very briefly this morning.\n  On the floor of the Senate, when we return next week, we will resume \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill. It turns out that many \nin the Department of Defense believe, as I do, that the DREAM Act is an \nimportant part of making certain we have talented young men and women \nready to serve in our military. I have spoken to people at the \nDepartment of Defense who support the idea of the DREAM Act. I think we \nought to include it in the Defense authorization bill. I hope to have \nthat opportunity.\n  For the tens of thousands of young people across America who want a \nchance to be part of America, to contribute to America, the DREAM Act \nis their opportunity. They have to work their way into it. They have to \nprove themselves or they will not have a chance.\n  The nice thing about this amendment is both sides of the aisle agree \non it. We have strong bipartisan sponsorship of this amendment. Senator \nChuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska; and Senator Dick Lugar, Republican \nof Indiana; are cosponsors. They agree with me that this is a good move \nforward and encourage Congress to consider it.\n  I hope when we return to the Defense authorization bill we can make \nthe DREAM Act part of that bill. Certainly, it is going to help our \ndefense and help our military. I think it is going to help America even \nbeyond that.\n  Those young men and women, given a chance to serve in the military, \nwill be\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\ncitizens of this country someday who will make an important \ncontribution, as all of our veterans do. Those who choose to go to \ncollege are on a path to becoming tomorrow's doctors and nurses and \nresearchers and businesspeople--the kind of energy every society needs \nand the kind of energy that has built this great country we have today.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise to speak about legislation known as \nthe DREAM Act, which I hope to offer as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The DREAM Act is a narrowly tailored, bipartisan measure that I have \nsponsored with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and \nRepublican Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana.\n  I want to thank the cosponsors of this amendment, all of whom are \nalso cosponsors of the DREAM Act: Senators Hagel, Lugar, Leahy, Obama, \nLieberman, Feinstein, Kerry, Feingold, Clinton, Bayh, Menendez, Murray, \nBoxer, and Cantwell.\n  The DREAM Act would give a select group of undocumented students the \nchance to become permanent residents if they came to this country as \nchildren, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral character, and \nenlist in the military or attend college for at least 2 years.\n  The DREAM Act is supported by a broad bipartisan coalition in the \nSenate, and by military leaders, religious leaders, and educators from \nacross the political spectrum and around the country.\n  During the 109th Congress, the DREAM Act was adopted unanimously as \nan amendment to immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate. \nIn the 108th Congress, the DREAM Act was the only immigration reform \nproposal reported to the Senate floor, on a bipartisan 16-to-3 vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  And the DREAM Act was included in the immigration bill that was \nconsidered on the Senate floor last month.\n  Some people might ask why the Senate should revisit immigration again \nand whether an immigration amendment should be included in the Defense \nauthorization bill. The answer is simple: The DREAM Act would address a \nvery serious recruitment crisis that faces our military.\n  Under the DREAM Act, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential \nrecruits would become eligible for military service for the first time. \nThey are eager to serve in the Armed Forces during a time of war. And \nunder the DREAM Act they would have a very strong incentive to enlist \nbecause it would give them a path to permanent legal status.\n  Let me begin by explaining the recruitment crisis that faces the \nDefense Department today.\n  Largely due to the war in Iraq, the Army is struggling to meet its \nrecruitment quotas.\n  Just yesterday, the Army announced that it had missed its recruiting \ngoal for June. The Army fell more than 1,000 recruits short of its \nmonthly quota of 8,400. And this is the second straight month that the \nArmy has missed its recruitment target.\n  Because of these recruitment difficulties, the Army is accepting more \napplicants who are high school dropouts, have low scores on the \nmilitary's aptitude test, and have criminal backgrounds.\n  The statistics speak volumes. In 2006, almost 40 percent of Army \nrecruits had below average scores on the military aptitude test. That \nis the highest rate since 1985.\n  In 2006, almost 20 percent of Army recruits did not have a high \nschool degree. This is the highest rate of high school dropouts \nenlisting in the Army since 1981. By comparison, from 1984 to 2004, 90 \npercent or more of Army recruits had high school diplomas.\n  Why does this matter? The Army says high school graduation ``is the \nbest single predictor of stick-to-it-iveness'' that is required to \nsucceed in the military.\n  And Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who is an \nexpert in military culture, said ``the more dropouts [who enlist], the \nmore discipline problems'' the Army is likely to have.\n  Even more disturbing, the number of so-called moral waivers for Army \nrecruits who have committed crimes has increased by 65 percent in the \nlast 3 years, from 4,918 in 2003 to 8,129 in 2006. Many of these \nwaivers are for serious crimes such as aggravated assault, burglary, \nrobbery, and vehicular homicide.\n  In fact, individuals with criminal backgrounds were 11.7 percent of \nthe 2006 recruiting class.\n  In contrast, under the DREAM Act, all recruits would be well-\nqualified high school graduates with good moral character.\n  Let me explain in more detail how the DREAM Act would work.\n  Currently, our immigration laws prevent thousands of young people \nfrom pursuing their dreams and fully contributing to our Nation's \nfuture. Their parents brought them to the United States when they were \nchildren. For many, this is the only home they know. They are fully \nassimilated into American society and they want nothing more than to be \nAmericans.\n  They have beaten the odds in their young lives. The high school \ndropout rate among undocumented immigrants is 50 percent compared to 21 \npercent for legal immigrants and 11 percent for native-born Americans.\n   These children have demonstrated the kind of determination and \ncommitment that makes them successful students and points the way to \nthe significant contributions they will make in their lives. They are \njunior ROTC leaders, honor roll students, and valedictorians. They are \ntomorrow's soldiers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and Senators.\n  Over the years, I have met many of these DREAM Act kids, as they call \nthemselves. Let me give you one example. Oscar Vasquez was brought to \nPhoenix, AZ, by his parents when he was 12.\n  Oscar is a born leader and was naturally drawn to the military. He \nspent his high school years in Junior ROTC, and dreamed of enlisting in \nthe military. At the end of his junior year a recruiting officer told \nOscar that he was ineligible for military service because he was \nundocumented.\n  Oscar was devastated, but he found another outlet for his talent. Two \nenergetic science teachers had enrolled Oscar's high school in the \ncollege division of a robot competition sponsored by NASA.\n  Oscar and three other undocumented students worked for months in a \nwindowless storage room in their high school, and tested their \ninvention at a scuba training pool on the weekends. Competing against \nstudents from MIT and other top universities, Oscar's team won first \nplace in the robot competition.\n  Oscar has since graduated. He hangs sheetrock for a living; it is the \nbest job he could get without a college education or the opportunity to \nenlist in the military. He hopes to save his money and study \nengineering at Arizona State University some day.\n  Couldn't America use Oscar's talent? Couldn't our military use \nsomeone like Oscar?\n  The DREAM Act would help students like Oscar. It is not an amnesty. \nIt is designed to assist only a select group of young people who would \nbe required to earn their way to legal status.\n  The fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish \nchildren for mistakes that their parents made. That is not the American \nway.\n  The DREAM Act says to these students: America will give you a chance. \nWe will give you the opportunity to earn your way to legal status if \nyou meet the following requirements: came to the United States when you \nwere 15 or younger; have lived here for at least 5 years; have good \nmoral character; graduate from high school; and serve in the military \nor attend college for at least 2 years.\n  The DREAM Act doesn't mandate military service. A student who is \notherwise eligible could earn legal status by attending college. It \nwould be inconsistent with the spirit our volunteer military to force \nyoung people to enlist as a condition for obtaining legal status.\n  But the DREAM Act creates a strong incentive for military service. \nAnd many DREAM Act kids come from a demographic group that is already \npredisposed towards military service. A 2004 survey by the Rand \nCorporation found that 45 percent of Hispanic males and 31 percent of \nHispanic females between ages 16 and 21 were very likely to serve in \nthe Armed Forces, compared to 24 percent of White men and 10 percent of \nWhite women.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  It is important to note that immigrants have an outstanding tradition \nof service in the military. There are currently 35,000 noncitizens \nserving in the military, and about 8,000 more enlist each year.\n  A recent study by the Center for Naval Analyses concluded:\n\n       Non-citizens have high rates of success while serving [in \n     the military]--they are far more likely, for example, to \n     fulfill their enlistment obligations than their U.S.-born \n     counterparts.\n\n  The study also concluded that there are additional benefits to \nenlisting noncitizens. For example, noncitizens ``are more diverse than \ncitizen recruits--not just racially and ethnically, but also \nlinguistically and culturally. This diversity is particularly valuable \nas the United States faces the challenges of the Global War on \nTerrorism.''\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do; it would be good for \nAmerica. The DREAM Act would allow a generation of immigrant students \nwith great potential and ambitions to contribute to the military and \nother sectors of American society.\n  The Pentagon recognizes that. We have worked closely with them on the \nDREAM Act.\n  Bill Carr, the Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Military \nPersonnel Policy, recently said that the DREAM Act is ``very \nappealing'' to the military because it would apply to the ``cream of \nthe crop'' of students. Mr. Carr concluded that the DREAM Act would be \n``good for [military] readiness.''\n  And last year, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the \ncontributions of immigrants to the military, David Chu, the \nUndersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, testified as \nfollows:\n\n       There are an estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented alien \n     young adults who entered the U.S. at an early age and \n     graduate from high school each year, many of whom are bright, \n     energetic and potentially interested in military service. \n     They include many who have participated in high school Junior \n     ROTC programs. Under current law, these young people are not \n     eligible to enlist in the military. . . . Yet many of these \n     young people may wish to join the military, and have the \n     attributes needed--education, aptitude, fitness, and moral \n     qualifications. . . . the DREAM Act would provide these young \n     people the opportunity of serving the United States in \n     uniform.\n\n  Military experts agree. Margaret Stock, a professor at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point, said:\n\n       Passage of the DREAM Act would be highly beneficial to the \n     United States military. The DREAM Act promises to enlarge \n     dramatically the pool of highly qualified recruits for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces. . . . passage of this bill could well \n     solve the Armed Forces' enlisted recruiting woes.\n\n  Conservative military scholar Max Boot agrees. When asked about the \nDREAM Act, he said:\n\n       It's a substantial pool of people and I think it's crazy we \n     are not tapping into it.\n\n  These experts are right. DREAM Act kids are ideal recruits: they are \nhigh school graduates, they have good moral character, and they \ndesperately want to serve this country. At the time when the military \nhas been forced to lower its standards due to recruitment shortfalls, \nwe should not underestimate the significance of these young people as a \nnational security asset.\n  This is the choice the DREAM Act presents to us. We can allow a \ngeneration of immigrant students with great potential and ambitions to \ncontribute more fully to our society and national security, or we can \nrelegate them to a future in the shadows, which would be a loss for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to consider the DREAM Act as \nan amendment to this Defense authorization bill as part of our national \nsecurity. We will have a chance to debate it in its entirety, and I \nwill return to it when we come back to this bill next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9203-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9203-S9208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a while on the pending \nbusiness before the Senate this past week and next week, which is the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Now, constituents, people who have been watching the proceedings of \nthe Senate for the last week, might be a little confused because if \nthey know a little bit about how the Senate has historically done its \nbusiness, they know the Defense authorization bill is the bill we adopt \neach year to set the policies and the spending priorities for the \nDefense Department to ensure our national security will remain strong \nfor the next year.\n  However, this year, instead of talking about the acquisition of \nequipment we need, the new aegis cruisers we are going to be sending \naround the world--deploying to ensure we have a missile defense that is \nnot only on land but on the seas--instead of talking about the space \ntest bed--a research project that enables us, among other things, to \nfind out how to deal with antisatellite weapons that the Chinese, for \nexample, might use to destroy our satellites--or instead of talking \nabout the need to increase the number of our military--primarily, our \nsoldiers and marines--by about 90,000, so we have a more robust \nmilitary to have boots on the ground anywhere in the world--instead of \ndebating these various issues about our military posture, we have spent \nalmost the entire week focused on what, the argument about the Iraq \nwar.\n  Now, it is perfectly appropriate to debate issues relative to the war \nagainst terrorists. Certainly, the main battlefield in that war against \nterrorists today is Iraq. But it seems to me our focus is a little off \nwhen, instead of looking at the things we could do to make the United \nStates more secure--by focusing on this Defense authorization bill and \nthe specific elements of it--we are, instead, focusing on arguments \nabout how quickly to withdraw from Iraq.\n  We have in place a new strategy in Iraq. At the end of last year, \nafter the election, when Secretary Rumsfeld left his position as \nSecretary of Defense, the President said: All right, I believe we have \nnot had a successful strategy, and we are going to have a new strategy.\n  That strategy was announced in January, sometimes called the surge. \nBut what it involved was a combination of involving Iraqis more in the \ndefense and securing of their country and the application of a very \nfocused U.S. force of increased strength in specific areas of the \ncountry, not just to take those areas but to hold them once they were \ntaken.\n  In the past, we would move into an area, we would clear it of the \nenemy, and then, after a few days, we would leave. What happened? The \nenemy would filter right back into the same areas, sometimes \nestablishing an even stronger presence than they had before.\n  That, obviously, did not work, and the President realized it. \nEverybody in the country said: The election results show you need to \nhave a new strategy. So the President, working with the Iraqis, working \nwith General Petraeus--David Petraeus was confirmed unanimously by the \nSenate to go over and develop and execute a new strategy. Working with \nthem, the President devised this new strategy of taking and holding the \nkey areas of Iraq so peace and stability could be brought to that war-\ntorn country. The opportunity for the Government then to grab hold of \nthe situation and do the things it needs to do would be given full \neffect.\n  That strategy counted on five new brigades of U.S. forces, consisting \nof over 25,000 on-the-ground servicemen, going in to join with about \ntwice as many Iraqi Army and police units to effectuate this strategy \nof clearing and holding and maintaining control that I mentioned \nbefore.\n  That strategy, finally, about 2 weeks ago, has been put in full \nforce, with the arrival of the last of the five brigades. They have \ngone into both Anbar Province, which is almost a third of the country \nof Iraq, largely controlled by--it is called a Sunni area, and largely \ncontrolled by tribal leaders--and into Baghdad, which is, obviously, \nthe primary population center of the country, where a lot of the \nprevious Shiite and Sunni conflict was occurring.\n  What have we seen in the debate over the Defense authorization bill? \nWe have seen attempt after attempt after attempt from the other side of \nthe aisle to declare the war lost, the strategy a failure, and, \ntherefore, a commitment by the Senate to direct the President to begin \nbringing the troops home.\n  Next Tuesday--I believe it is Tuesday--we will actually vote on an\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\namendment that has as its specific directive a mandate that we begin \nbringing the troops home within a very specific time--I believe it is \n120 days now--and that withdrawal be complete within roughly a year--\nagain, I have forgotten the exact date--clearly, predicated on the \nnotion that we have either lost or cannot win, that there is no point \nin allowing this new strategy to play out to see whether it can \nsucceed, and to tell the entire world we are leaving Iraq.\n  Now, they put a little pink ribbon around it and said: Oh, we will \nleave some forces over the horizon so we can ride to the rescue if \nanything bad happens--as if there is not a clear common understanding \nthat a lot bad will, of course, happen or the need to maintain some \npresence to help train Iraqi troops.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nStephen Biddle dated July 11 that was carried in the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, July 11, 2007]\n\n                        Iraq: Go Deep or Get Out\n\n                          (By Stephen Biddle)\n\n       The president's shaky political consensus for the surge in \n     Iraq is in danger of collapsing after the recent defections \n     of prominent Senate Republicans such as Richard Lugar (Ind.), \n     Pete Domenici (N.M.) and George Voinovich (Ohio). But this \n     growing opposition to the surge has not yet translated into \n     support for outright withdrawal--few lawmakers are \n     comfortable with abandoning Iraq or admitting defeat. The \n     result has been a search for some kind of politically \n     moderate ``Plan B'' that would split the difference between \n     surge and withdrawal.\n       The problem is that these politics do not fit the military \n     reality of Iraq. Many would like to reduce the U.S. \n     commitment to something like half of today's troop presence \n     there. But it is much harder to find a mission for the \n     remaining 60,000 to 80,000 soldiers that makes any sense \n     militarily.\n       Perhaps the most popular centrist option today is drawn \n     from the Baker-Hamilton commission recommendations of last \n     December. This would withdraw U.S. combat brigades, shift the \n     American mission to one of training and supporting the Iraqi \n     security forces, and cut total U.S. troop levels in the \n     country by about half. This idea is at the heart of the \n     proposed legislative effort that Domenici threw his support \n     behind last week, and support is growing on both sides of the \n     aisle on Capitol Hill.\n       The politics make sense, but the compromise leaves us with \n     an untenable military mission. Without a major U.S. combat \n     effort to keep the violence down, the American training \n     effort would face challenges even bigger than those our \n     troops are confronting today. An ineffective training effort \n     would leave tens of thousands of American trainers, advisers \n     and supporting troops exposed to that violence in the \n     meantime. The net result is likely to be continued U.S. \n     casualties with little positive effect on Iraq's ongoing \n     civil war.\n       The American combat presence in Iraq is insufficient to end \n     the violence but does cap its intensity. If we draw down that \n     combat presence, violence will rise accordingly. To be \n     effective, embedded trainers and advisers must live and \n     operate with the Iraqi soldiers they mentor--they are not \n     lecturers sequestered in some safe classroom. The greater the \n     violence, the riskier their jobs and the heavier their \n     losses.\n       That violence reduces their ability to succeed as trainers. \n     There are many barriers to an effective Iraqi security force. \n     But the toughest is sectarian factionalism. Iraq is in the \n     midst of a civil war in which all Iraqis are increasingly \n     forced to take sides for their own survival. Iraq's security \n     forces are necessarily drawn from the same populations that \n     are being pulled apart into factions. No military can be \n     hermetically sealed off from its society--the more severe the \n     sectarian violence, the deeper the divisions in Iraqi society \n     become and the harder it is for Americans to create the kind \n     of disinterested nationalist security force that could \n     stabilize Iraq. Under the best conditions, it is unrealistic \n     to expect a satisfactory Iraqi security force anytime soon, \n     and the more severe the violence, the worse the prospects.\n       The result is a vicious cycle. The more we shift out of \n     combat missions and into training, the harder we make the \n     trainers' job and the more exposed they become. It is \n     unrealistic to expect that we can pull back to some safe yet \n     productive mission of training but not fighting--this would \n     be neither safe nor productive.\n       If the surge is unacceptable, the better option is to cut \n     our losses and withdraw altogether. In fact, the substantive \n     case for either extreme--surge or outright withdrawal--is \n     stronger than for any policy between. The surge is a long-\n     shot gamble. But middle-ground options leave us with the \n     worst of both worlds: continuing casualties but even less \n     chance of stability in exchange. Moderation and centrism are \n     normally the right instincts in American politics, and many \n     lawmakers in both parties desperately want to find a workable \n     middle ground on Iraq. But while the politics are right, the \n     military logic is not.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The reason I want to put this article in the Record is that \nit very clearly points out the problem with the strategy of many of the \nDemocrats that I have just outlined, including the notion that somehow \nyou could reduce our forces by perhaps half or more and still achieve \nthis goal of defeating al-Qaida and training up the Iraqi units.\n  One of Biddle's key points is that the only way you can successfully \ntrain up these Iraqi units is having relative stability in the country, \nthat if you have an out-of-control war going on, you have to be \nfighting that war, and it is very difficult to at the same time be \ntraining up these forces. The best way to train the Iraqi military is \nto work in conjunction with U.S. units, as General Petraeus has \ndevised, go into an area, clear it, and then leave primarily Iraqi \nunits behind to continue to maintain control in the area. But if you \nhave constant fighting and you haven't been able to clear or hold the \narea, those Iraqi troops never have that opportunity or the experience \nof holding the area.\n  So, as Mr. Biddle points out, you can't have it both ways. This \ncompromise may satisfy some political requirements back home, but it is \ntotally unworkable in the place where it matters, and that is in Iraq. \nYou can't withdraw half or more of the troops quickly and have any \nchance of success in maintaining peace and stability and in helping to \ntrain up the Iraqi forces.\n  So why are people in the Senate focused on bringing the troops home \nor otherwise micromanaging the way the President deploys the units to \nachieve the mission's objectives? Well, it is either one of two things. \nNow, from outside this body, I know there are a lot of people who have \na motive of trying to make the President look bad and undercutting his \nauthority and undermining the strategy he is following, I gather both \nfor partisan reasons and because they just don't think it can work. But \nwithin the body, here in the Chamber, I know my colleagues do not want \nany American life to have been lost in vain and that they treasure \nevery life that has been put on the line. That is why it is troublesome \nto me to have to defeat amendments which have as their core point \nundercutting the President's authority, micromanaging the war from the \nCongress, and specifically calling for early withdrawal, and by early I \nmean before the surge has even had an opportunity to play out.\n  In that regard, I would like to place in the Record a piece that was \ncarried this morning in the Washington Post by Charles Krauthammer, and \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Jul. 13, 2007]\n\n                           Deserting Petraeus\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       ``The key to turning [Anbar] around was the shift in \n     allegiance by tribal sheiks. But the sheiks turned only after \n     a prolonged offensive by American and Iraqi forces, starting \n     in November, that put al-Qaeda groups on the run.''--The New \n     York Times, July 8.\n       Finally, after four terribly long years, we know what \n     works. Or what can work. A year ago, a confidential Marine \n     intelligence report declared Anbar province (which comprises \n     about a third of Iraq's territory) lost to al-Qaeda. Now, in \n     what the Times's John Burns calls an ``astonishing success,'' \n     the tribal sheiks have joined our side and committed large \n     numbers of fighters that, in concert with American and Iraqi \n     forces, have largely driven out al-Qaeda and turned its \n     former stronghold of Ramadi into one of the most secure \n     cities in Iraq.\n       It began with a U.S.-led offensive that killed or wounded \n     more than 200 enemy fighters and captured 600. Most important \n     was the follow-up. Not a retreat back to American bases but \n     the setting up of small posts within the population that, \n     together with the Iraqi national and tribal forces, have \n     brought relative stability to Anbar.\n       The same has started happening in many of the Sunni areas \n     around Baghdad, including Diyala province--just a year ago \n     considered as lost as Anbar--where, for example, the Sunni \n     insurgent 1920 Revolution Brigades has turned against al-\n     Qaeda and joined the fight on the side of U.S. and Iraqi \n     government forces.\n       We don't yet know if this strategy will work in mixed \n     Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods. Nor can we be certain that this \n     cooperation between essentially Sunni tribal forces and an \n     essentially Shiite central government can endure. But what \n     cannot be said--although it is now heard daily in \n     Washington--is that\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\n     the surge, which is shorthand for Gen. David Petraeus's new \n     counterinsurgency strategy, has failed. The tragedy is that, \n     just as a working strategy has been found, some Republicans \n     in the Senate have lost heart and want to pull the plug.\n       It is understandable that Sens. Lugar, Voinovich, Domenici, \n     Snowe and Warner may no longer trust President Bush's \n     judgment when he tells them to wait until Petraeus reports in \n     September. What is not understandable is the vote of no \n     confidence they are passing on Petraeus. These are the same \n     senators who sent him back to Iraq by an 81 to 0 vote to \n     institute his new counterinsurgency strategy.\n       A month ago, Petraeus was asked whether we could still win \n     in Iraq. The general, who had recently attended two memorial \n     services for soldiers lost under his command, replied that if \n     he thought he could not succeed he would not be risking the \n     life of a single soldier.\n       Just this week, Petraeus said that the one thing he needs \n     more than anything else is time. To cut off Petraeus's plan \n     just as it is beginning--the last surge troops arrived only \n     last month--on the assumption that we cannot succeed is to \n     declare Petraeus either deluded or dishonorable. Deluded in \n     that, as the best-positioned American in Baghdad, he still \n     believes we can succeed. Or dishonorable in pretending to \n     believe in victory and sending soldiers to die in what he \n     really knows is an already failed strategy.\n       That's the logic of the wobbly Republicans' position. But \n     rather than lay it on Petraeus, they prefer to lay it on \n     Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and point out his government's \n     inability to meet the required political ``benchmarks.'' As a \n     longtime critic of the Maliki government, I agree that it has \n     proved itself incapable of passing laws important for long-\n     term national reconciliation.\n       But first comes the short term. And right now we have the \n     chance to continue to isolate al-Qaeda and, province by \n     province, deny it the Sunni sea in which it swims. A year \n     ago, it appeared that the only way to win back the Sunnis and \n     neutralize the extremists was with great national compacts \n     about oil and power sharing. But Anbar has unexpectedly shown \n     that even without these constitutional settlements, the \n     insurgency can be neutralized and al-Qaeda defeated at the \n     local and provincial levels with a new and robust \n     counterinsurgency strategy.\n       The costs are heartbreakingly high--increased American \n     casualties as the enemy is engaged and spectacular suicide \n     bombings designed to terrify Iraqis and demoralize Americans. \n     But the stakes are extremely high as well.\n       In the long run, agreements on oil, federalism and de-\n     Baathification are crucial for stabilizing Iraq. But their \n     absence at this moment is not a reason to give up in despair, \n     now that we finally have a counterinsurgency strategy in \n     place that is showing success against the one enemy--al-\n     Qaeda--that both critics and supporters of the war maintain \n     must be fought everywhere and at all cost.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what Charles Krauthammer, who is a very \nknowledgeable analyst and writer on this subject, has said is that the \nPetraeus plan has the makings of a successful strategy, it has already \nbegun to show some positive results, and that it would be folly to \ndeclare it a failure before it even has a chance to play out.\n  Everybody knows General Petraeus is going to report back to the \nCongress and to the President in September of this year, and he will be \naccompanied by Ambassador Crocker, our Ambassador to Iraq, who will \ngive us a report on the status of the situation. Now, it has never been \ncontemplated that that is the end of the matter by any stretch of the \nimagination since it will have only been a few months since the \nstrategy will have been in place, but at least he can give us an idea \nof how it is working. Why anybody would want to set a different course \nnow, before he gives that report, is beyond me and certainly beyond \nCharles Krauthammer.\n  Krauthammer points out that this new strategy has already begun to \nshow success. For example, in the Anbar Province, which was an area \nthat was almost exclusively controlled by al-Qaida--let me digress for \njust a moment to make this point. We heard discussions several months \nago about a civil war in Iraq. It is true, there were elements of Sunni \nand Shiite Iraqis who were fighting each other, and some were calling \nthat a civil war. But two things are important to know about that.\n  The first is that much of that fighting was instigated by al-Qaida. \nAl-Qaida had come into the Sunni areas and had a declared intention to \nstart a fight between the Shiites and the Sunnis. When the fight didn't \nmaterialize, al-Qaida went to Samarra, a holy place for Shiites, and \nblew up one of their most revered shrines, the Golden Mosque. In fact, \nit has been twice attacked, thus, in effect, poking the nose of the \nbear to the point that the bear had to react, and the Shiites did \nreact. They said: If the Iraqi Army cannot protect our holy sites, by \ngolly, we will--or whatever the Iraqi phrase is--and they created \nmilitias that began attacking Sunnis, and we did have a lot of Shiite \non Sunni and vice versa violence. But the first point is it was largely \ninstigated by al-Qaida, who knew precisely what it was doing and had a \ndeclared strategy to begin that fight. We have the intelligence to \ndemonstrate that.\n  The second point is that al-Qaida, since that violence has to some \nextent now subsided because of the surge--we have gone into these \nShiite neighborhoods, for example, and we have persuaded the Shiite \nleadership to stop the militias from acting, stop the violence, and \ncalm the neighborhoods down so that life can return to normal, and in \nat least half of Baghdad that has now been what is occurring.\n  In the Sunni areas, we went to the tribal leaders there and said: \nLook, al-Qaida is causing you more problems than it is solving. \nEventually, these tribal leaders came back to our troops and to the \nIraqi leadership and said: You are right. We have now seen what life \nunder al-Qaida would be like as a Taliban kind of rule, where they \ndon't let us do anything; they impose this very harsh penalty on \nanybody who isn't conforming to their way of life.\n  Most of the al-Qaida are coming into Iraq from other countries. They \nare foreigners to the Iraqis, and many of these tribal sheiks, almost \nall of them in the Anbar Province, said: We are tired of dealing with \nthese al-Qaida terrorists, and we want to join you in fighting them. By \nthe hundreds and thousands, young Iraqis began joining the police and \narmy to fight al-Qaida. And Anbar Province now, as Charles Krauthammer \ndetails in his article and as our intelligence has also made very \nclear, has become one of the strongest anti-al-Qaida areas in the \ncountry. It has largely been pacified. It is a good example of how this \nnew strategy can work.\n  What Krauthammer says is: We don't know yet if this same strategy \nwill work in the next Sunni-Shiite areas, but we can see how it has \nworked and how it could work if we allow time for the Petraeus plan to \nplay out. He points out that a month ago, Petraeus was asked whether we \ncould still win in Iraq. I am going to quote here:\n\n       The General, who had recently attended two memorial \n     services for soldiers lost under his command, replied that if \n     he thought he could not succeed, he would not be risking the \n     life of a single soldier.\n\n  That is a very important concept for us to remember back here because \nwhen people talk about supporting the troops, it seems to me the first \ntype of support we should be providing is the moral support for these \nsoldiers, to support their mission, not only to provide everything they \nneed in terms of material support and training but to assure them they \nare not risking their lives in vain, that we will continue to support \nthe mission we have sent them on that they think they can win and \nbelieve they are winning. The worst thing we could do is to have \nexpressions here in the Senate that we think they have lost or that \nthey can't win, and therefore we want to begin declaring defeat and \nleaving the battlefield. At that point, as it was back in Vietnam, it \nbecomes a question of who is the last man out and who is the last \nperson to risk death, for what? For a timetable? That cannot be why we \nsend young men and women into combat, into harm's way.\n  For those who believe it is already lost or that it is a failure and \nthat we cannot succeed, I say to them, you have an obligation, then, to \ntry to bring them home immediately because not 1 more day should pass \nfor people to risk life for nothing more than a timetable. I don't \nhappen to believe that. General Petraeus doesn't happen to believe \nthat. I believe we can allow the Petraeus plan to have the time it \nneeds to show that it can succeed, not just in Anbar Province but in \nother places in Iraq as well.\n  Let me quote another couple of sentences from Krauthammer's article:\n\n       Just this week Petraeus said that the one thing he needs \n     more than anything else is time. To cut off Petraeus's plan \n     just as it is beginning--\n\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\n\n  Krauthammer says--\n\n     the last surge troops arrived only last month--on the \n     assumption that we cannot succeed is to declare Petraeus \n     either deluded or dishonorable.\n\n  Well, he is clearly not deluded or dishonorable.\n  I regret that some of my colleagues believe the only way to resolve \nthe situation in Iraq is to begin leaving now. That would be a strategy \nfor failure.\n  I ask my colleagues this: We have in this body made pronouncements \nthat we need to help people in places such as Darfur where there is \ngenocide occurring, and we have always tried to help people, whether it \nbe in Kosovo or Afghanistan or--and incidentally, isn't it interesting \nthat in two of those places, we are talking about largely Muslim \ncountries, and in places such as Somalia, also a predominance of \nMuslims--we cannot as a nation ignore what would happen in Iraq were we \nto leave prematurely. Almost all of the intelligence in the Baker-\nHamilton report which is cited by many of my colleagues confirms this \nas well, acknowledges that if we leave Iraq before the Iraqis can \nmaintain peace and stability, the kind of genocide and killing and \nterrorism that would ensue would be almost incalculable. Thousands, if \nnot hundreds of thousands and more, would die. Many believe that blood \nwould be on our hands if we are the ones who walk out before they have \nthe ability to prevent that kind of violence.\n  Al-Qaida clearly is the primary enemy now. As I talked about before, \nthe largely Shiite-Sunni violence has subsided to a significant degree, \nand most of what is occurring against our forces and against other \nIraqis today is being perpetrated by al-Qaida--Al-Qaida in Iraq. If we \nleave and al-Qaida in Iraq is allowed basically a free hand, most \npredict that it will have created a situation where, like it did in \nAfghanistan, al-Qaida will have the ability to train, to plan attacks, \nand to have refuge from any kind of action to stop them from doing so. \nThey would also have access to the oil wealth of the country of Iraq \nand to the other resources of the country. To the extent that anybody \nin Iraq has tried to be a friend of the United States or cooperate with \nthe Iraqi Government--all of those people, remember, with the purple \nthumbs--would be targeted by the thugs and terrorists who would reign \nin Iraq. They would undoubtedly be executed.\n  Think of Saddam Hussein's regime. Think back when the North \nVietnamese came sweeping into South Vietnam and all of the boat people \nfled and those who didn't get away were sent to the ``reeducation \ncamps'' or killed. Think of Cambodia, when we left there with 3 million \nCambodians killed.\n  Were we to leave Iraq, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \npeople will die--largely innocent people. That blood will be on our \nhands.\n  Mr. President, that is not the worst of it. The U.S. security will \nhave been significantly jeopardized because we will have ceded the \ncentral battle in the war against the terrorists to the terrorists. We \nwill have been defeated by the terrorists, much more than their sneak \nattack on September 11 defeated us. It killed 3,000 Americans. It was, \nlike Pearl Harbor, the attack that awoke the ``sleeping giant'' to \nfinally recognize that after having been attacked, I believe, six times \npreviously by al-Qaida, we finally realized we are in a war with those \npeople. Whether we want to fight or not, they are going to attack us, \nand we better fight back.\n  We began to do that. I fear that there is a tiredness beginning to \nseep into some around the world--and even among some Americans--in \nfighting this enemy that is very elusive and generally doesn't fight us \non the battlefield but, rather, waits and waits and, as soon as we \nrelax, engages in a sneak attack. They have tried to do it against our \nallies. They have done it in Great Britain and in Spain, for example. \nOther activities have been thwarted. We have been fortunate because our \nhomeland security has thwarted those attacks here at home.\n  We are not always going to have a battlefield on which to confront \nthem. What confuses me is the argument of some of my colleagues that we \nshould cede the one place where they have directly confronted us on the \nbattlefield in Iraq--cede that battle to the enemy by prematurely \nwithdrawing our troops and somehow reconfiguring our effort to fight \nthem in a different way at a different place. The argument that, if we \nleave Iraq, we can focus on them in Afghanistan is a false choice. We \nare fighting them in both places. If we need more elements of support \nin Afghanistan, then we should send them there. That is supposed to be \na NATO exercise, and a lot of our NATO friends could be doing more \nthere to help us. I think we could use more help there.\n  It is a false argument to say we should not fight them in both \nplaces, when the enemy has finally come out onto the battlefield and is \nconfronting us in the one area where we can defeat them with the U.S. \nmilitary. Nobody can beat our military, the best military in the world \nand that has ever existed. Al-Qaida is no match for our military. When \nthey are willing to basically come out of their holes and confront us \nin Iraq, for us not to directly attack, kill, or capture as many of \nthem as possible would be the ultimate in negligence and fecklessness \nin fighting the war against terrorists. They are the terrorists; they \nare there. We are able to kill them there. Why we would not engage the \nenemy in the place where there are the most of them is beyond me.\n  Now, what that means is that we are putting our young men and women \nin harm's way. They have volunteered for this mission in which they \nbelieve deeply because they have looked into the eye of the enemy and \nhave seen the evil that is there, and they have been willing to lay \ntheir lives on the line. Given that fact, and given the fact that we \nhave a brilliant commander with a strategy that appears to be working, \nwhy would the United States Congress pull the rug out from under the \noperation of General Petraeus and our troops when they have their hands \naround the neck of the enemy and can deal a very severe blow to this \nevil enemy? That is beyond my comprehension. It takes nothing from the \nargument that we should be engaged in intelligence operations around \nthe world, that we should be trying our best to get Osama bin Laden, \nand their argument suggests that somehow we are not. That denigrates \nthe efforts of our special forces and others who, believe me, are \ntrying their very best to get this guy and the other leadership of al-\nQaida. But to somehow suggest that we should leave Iraq because the \nenemy exists in other places is not only totally illogical but, as I \nsaid, would be a very feckless approach in trying to win this war \nagainst the terrorists.\n  Another thing that bothers me relates directly to the bill we are \ndebating. We are going to see it next week, and we saw it this morning. \nIt is the notion that has begun to creep into the discussion that maybe \nthis is not really a war at all. One of the candidates for President \ncalled this just a bumper sticker. Well, their effort to make this a \ncriminal enterprise--in other words, to criminalize the war rather than \ntreat it as the war that it is--is very troublesome to me.\n  This morning, we had an amendment that was drafted to provide that \ninstead of a $25 million reward to get Osama bin Laden, it upped it to \n$50 million for the capture or information leading to the capture of \nOsama bin Laden.\n  Mr. President, I was not aware there was a limit on time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 10-minute time limit on morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 more \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time is left in total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 10-minute limitation on each \nspeaker, and if it is not objected to, the Senator may continue to \nspeak.\n  Mr. KYL. I wasn't aware that Senator Brownback was here. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment was drafted to provide money \nfor the capture or information leading to the capture of Osama bin \nLaden. Senator Sununu and others looked at that and said: Wait a \nminute, this is a war. It may well occur that we cannot just capture \nhim, he may have to be killed. So we added the words ``or death'' to\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\nthe amendment by a second-degree amendment. That was adopted this \nmorning.\n  Next week, we are going to get right back to the argument about \ncriminalization versus war. There is in the bill--and we are going to \nhave to strike the language with an amendment--language that requires \nus to send lawyers over to Iraq and Afghanistan to represent these \nterrorists we capture on the battlefield. We would have to give them \nlegal representation in theater, and we would have to show them \nclassified information that may be used in their prosecution or \ncontinued detention.\n  Mr. President, I have said that is nuts. I hate to use that kind of a \nphrase on the Senate floor, but I don't think it represents good \npolicy. We are going to have to strike that language from the bill. \nThat is criminalization of the war. This is a war against evil people \nwho will kill us if they can. The sooner we recognize that fact and \ndeal with them, the sooner we will defeat the enemy, and the enemy will \nno longer represent a threat to us. We cannot assume they don't really \nmean it. We cannot assume we can negotiate with them. We cannot treat \nthem as if they are defendants in an American criminal trial. They are \nevil terrorists who deserve to be dealt with on the battlefield, as we \nhave dealt with, historically, all of our enemies.\n  So I hope that next week we can turn from some of the amendments that \nhave been used here to primarily undercut the strategy in dealing with \nthe Iraq war and debate some key provisions of the Defense \nauthorization bill, which do need our attention--I have a couple of \namendments I hope we can deal with--and that we can also strike from \nthe bill the provision that would allow a new theory of criminal law to \nintrude into the battlefield to deal with the POWs or detainees there \nas if they are criminal defendants in an American court rather than the \nPOWs or enemy detainees that, in fact, they are.\n  I hope at the conclusion of the debate next week we will have \ncontinued to defeat these amendments that undercut our efforts in Iraq, \ncontinued to support the mission of the troops, and thereby the troops, \nand strengthened the Defense authorization bill so that for the next \nyear we will have a bill that strongly supports the troops and provides \nfor the national security of the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments. I \nappreciate the Chair staying here and facilitating this and allowing us \nto speak about a very important issue--the key issue of our time--the \nwar in Iraq and what is taking place there.\n  I want to focus my brief comments on what we need to do on a \npolitical solution. I think we are caught up with the idea that we need \nto be on a military solution. A military solution is not going to \nultimately solve the situation in Iraq. You have to have a political, \ndurable solution. Unless we are willing to sit there for an indefinite \nnumber of years with troops engaged in a very active military setting, \nwe have to get a political, durable situation in Iraq and on the ground \nif we are going to be realistic about what we are going to do.\n  I have worked with Senator Biden on this proposal. I will talk about \na resolution that we have worked together on for a political solution. \nHe chairs the Foreign Relations Committee. I have been on that \ncommittee for a number of years. I think we have to realize the \npopulation we are dealing with. The situation is not dissimilar, in \nsome respects, to when we saw what took place in the former Yugoslavia. \nWe had a number of different populations where history had washed over \nthat place with different waves of different individuals' thoughts and \nphilosophies. After Tito leaves and you take off this big military \napparatus and intelligence apparatus that was willing to kill people to \nenforce power, you are left with sectarian groups that don't get along. \nNow Yugoslav has six countries in two autonomous regions after hundreds \nof thousands of people were killed and multiple sets of civil wars that \ntook place. I think that is instructive from the standpoint of that is \nwhat takes place when you take a big military apparatus off of areas \nwhere you have nonuniform or a homogenous region. We are seeing this in \nSudan. You have in Sudan a north dominated by Arab and Muslim and a \nsouth that is Black and Christian, by and large. They don't get along. \nThere were 2 million killed in the south. The south is going to secede. \nYou have genocide in Darfur by this government--a militant Islamic \nregime in Khartoum. The world is growing in awareness of what is taking \nplace in Darfur.\n  I think we have to recognize the situation in Iraq and that you have \nseveral different populations. The Kurdish population is separate and \ndistinct and operating in its own area and doing a nice job. There is \ngrowth taking place there--not everyplace, but it is doing pretty well. \nYou have a mixed Sunni and Shia population in the rest of the country--\ndominant Sunni in some areas and dominant Shia in others, and Baghdad \nis a mixed federal city. I think we have to look at that situation and \nrecognize the mixture and the combustibility of that mixture and get to \na more durable political solution.\n  You are seeing now an ongoing migration of Iraqis inside their own \ncountry, which I think suggests Iraq will eventually do what would be \ncalled a soft partition. That is the logical thing that would take \nplace, and it is taking place today. There is an outcome of many \nhistorical precedents--most notably in Bosnia in the 1990s. Senator \nBiden and I introduced a resolution calling on Iraqis to reach an \nagreement that would formalize a federal system in Iraq consistent with \ntheir Constitution that would allow for Kurds, Sunnis, and Shia to \nmanage their own affairs, with Baghdad remaining a federal capital \ncity.\n  It is increasingly clear to me that we should start taking interim \nsteps now to facilitate a three-state, one-country solution in Iraq. We \nshould begin by acknowledging that many Iraqis whose lives are \nthreatened because of their sectarian affiliation are on the move. More \nIraqis are facing sectarian violence and are considering moving. As \ntragic as these movements seem now, they are preferable to the mass \nmigration that would occur if Iraq were to implode.\n  There are steps we can take now to ease the process of internal \nmigration. We can start by authorizing our commanders on the ground to \nhelp families who express a desire to relocate to areas where they \nwould join a sectarian majority. Relocating families will require \nsecure passage to safer areas and reliance probably on economic \nassistance to reestablish them. Those who wish to relocate should be \nassisted in this fashion.\n  I don't expect that the Iraqi people will create three completely \nhomogeneous regions. In fact, the level of Sunni and Shia marriage \nwould preclude such an outcome. We should be attentive to those who \nbelieve security is enhanced by moving out of mixed neighborhoods, \nwhere they do not face the danger of sectarian violence.\n  Indeed, there was reporting of people swapping houses who were Sunni \nin a dominant Shia area, and Shia in a dominant Sunni area, so they \nwould feel more secure after one of their families had been killed or \nkidnapped. I think that makes sense. As populations continue to move, \nwe also need to take steps to avert other aspects of an implosion. We \nneed to ensure that the Kurdish region, which has been a bedrock of \nstability to this point, remains a stable area. Turkey is rightly \nconcerned about the threat of terrorism coming from across the Iraqi \nborder. We need to reassure them, and we should bolster \ncounterterrorism capabilities of Iraqi forces deployed in that region--\nmuch as we have done in Georgia and in other nations where terrorists \ntried to establish a safe haven and destabilize their region. Our \nmilitary strategy certainly depends on a stable Kurdish region. Our \npolitical vision of Iraq also requires the Kurdish area to remain \nstrong, and I hope we can move quickly to address terrorism issues \nthere.\n\n  There are other steps we should take to prepare Iraq for a federal \npolitical settlement. We must take additional steps to secure the Iraq-\nIranian border, which would be of great benefit to the troops executing \nthe surge, as well as mitigate any attempt Iran might make or thinks \nthat it has to exploit a future three-state, federal version of Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\n  Last, we should place new emphasis on local and provincial elections \nin Iraq.\n  I raise these issues because I do not believe we can precipitously \npull out of Iraq, nor should we. But I think we have to recognize the \nsituation on the ground for what it is and facilitate it before we see \nmore mass sectarian violence taking place. We can do this and, in a \ncivil fashion, save lives. That is what this is about. It is about \nsaving lives.\n  We have seen this play before. We have seen it recently in \nYugoslavia. We are seeing it today in Sudan. Why can't we see this and \nsay we are going to save lives by facilitating this rather than \ncreating a combustible situation that blows up on us later. This is \nconsistent with the Iraqi Constitution. It is a more robust political \nsolution which matches our need militarily on the ground.\n  I finally, say, Mr. President, I have traveled the country a lot. I \nhear a number of people out there. They don't want to lose in Iraq, but \nthey don't see us on a track to win. What they are after is us coming \ntogether here to provide that solution of how we can win. What I am \ntalking about is a political solution that is as aggressive as our \nmilitary solution. The military gives us space for the political side \nto act. But we have to get it moving, and that is a situation where we \ncan win and we can go to the American people and say we are on track to \nwin and be able to pull our forces from the frontlines and reduce the \ndeath loss we are experiencing as a country, that my State is \nexperiencing, that the Big Red One stationed at Fort Riley, KS, is \nexperiencing.\n  We can do this. We need to show some foresight and bipartisanship to \nget it done. That is why I call, along with my colleague, Senator \nBiden, for this proposal, and I urge other colleagues to join us as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to outline some of the \nlegislative activities of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Some would rather pick fights about controversial judicial nominees. \nThe disappointing decisions from this year's Supreme Court term remind \nus that this President has been quite successful in moving the Federal \ncourts to the right. This President has not only appointed two members \nof the Supreme Court but has also already appointed almost one-third of \nthe 871-member Federal judiciary. When the appointments of his father \nand other Republican Presidents are considered, more than two-thirds of \nall current Federal judges were appointed by Republican Presidents.\n  Of course, the Judiciary Committee has been engaged in oversight \nefforts this year with regard to the U.S. attorney scandal and other \nexamples of White House interference with Federal law enforcement. \nDespite the attitude of the current administration, our Constitution \ndoes not include the phrase ``unitary executive'' or ``executive \nprivilege.'' What the U.S. Constitution does provide in the oath of \noffice is that the President must swear to ``faithfully execute the \nOffice of President of the United States'' and ``preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' His essential duties \nrequire him to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' I \nhave great concern with regard to how this administration is fulfilling \nthose essential duties. The political intrusion into the law \nenforcement functions of the Government through the scheme to fire and \nreplace our U.S. attorneys is most troubling.\n  The recent decision to override a prosecution, jury trial, conviction \nand prison sentence for one of his aides, to excuse his lying to \nFederal investigators and a grand jury and his perjury, and to reward \nhis silence and purportedly bad memory seems an abuse of the \nconstitutional pardon power. The lack of accountability for anyone in \nthe Bush administration has reached new heights--or depths.\n  The secret determination to ignore our surveillance laws and engage \nin years of warrantless wiretapping of Americans is another instance we \nare investigating that appears at odds with the Constitution's \ndirective to ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed'' and \nthat the liberties of the American people secured by the Constitution \nbe protected.\n  While our oversight efforts have taken a good deal of time and \neffort, we have simultaneously succeeded in an ambitious legislative \nagenda. That is what I would like to focus on for a few minutes. While \nthe committee has been productive in reporting a number of bipartisan \nmeasures to the Senate, Republican holds have to date been blocking \nSenate action on these measures.\n  Republican holds and filibusters have not been limited to obstructing \nour efforts to support our troops, rebuild our National Guard, and \nbring an end to the failed policies that have led to the deaths of so \nmany in a civil war in Iraq.\n  Let me mention a few examples of beneficial legislation that are \nbeing stalled, as well:\n  We just observed the 41st anniversary of the Freedom of Information \nAct ``FOIA'' on July 4. An important bipartisan FOIA reform measure--\nthe Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act, the \nOPEN Government Act, S. 849,--was favorably reported in April. Its \nconsideration has been blocked by a Republican objection.\n  The OPEN Government Act promotes and enhances the public disclosure \nof government information pursuant to FOIA. This legislation will also \nprovide much-needed reforms to strengthen FOIA by, among other things, \nhelping Americans to obtain timely responses to their FOIA requests and \nimproving transparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process.\n  This bill is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 14 Senators, \nincluding my lead Republican cosponsor Senator Cornyn. The OPEN \nGovernment Act is also supported by more than 115 open government, \nbusiness and news media organizations from across the political and \nideological spectrum, including, the American Library Association, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the \nRepublican Liberty Caucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and \nthe Vermont Press Association.\n  The passage and enactment of this important FOIA reform legislation \nwill improve government transparency and openness for all Americans. \nThe bill has now been stalled by Republican objection for several \nweeks.\n  A second measure the committee reported months ago that has been \nstalled by unspecified objection from the other side of the aisle is \nThe War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, S. 119. This bill provides \na significant new tool for Federal law enforcement to combat the \nscourge of war profiteering, which is needed now more than ever given \nthe ongoing reports of rampant fraud, waste, and abuse in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The bill now has the support of Senator Sessions, after \nbeing modified to eliminate potential objections to specific language \nin the bill and we have circulated an amendment to combine it with the \nSessions-Landrieu Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty \nEnhancement Act of 2007, S. 863, to be a legislative package that \nshould win overwhelming bipartisan Senate support. Passage of this \nmeasure is long overdue and is being blocked by unspecified Republican \nobjection.\n  A third measure that the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported was \nthe Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Act, S. 535. This is a \ngood bill, authored by Senator Dodd and Representative John Lewis in \nthe House. The Senate bill and Senate consideration of the House-passed \ncompanion measure have been blocked by yet another Republican \nobjection.\n  These are just three examples of matters currently being delayed and \nobstructed by unspecified objection from the other side of the aisle. \nThe American people may begin to see a pattern.\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nEach of these measures should command majority support in the Senate. \nThey may be able to command supermajority support on their merits. If \nwe could only get to their merits. So while the Judiciary Committee has \nremained productive, its efforts to enact helpful, remedial legislation \ncontinue to be thwarted by Republican objections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9209-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               Private First Class Johnathon M.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor the \nheroic sacrifice of a courageous Alabamian who selflessly risked \nhimself to save members of his unit under attack.\n  PFC Johnathon M. Millican was tragically killed on January 20, 2007, \nin Karbala, Iraq. A member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery \nRegiment from Fort Richardson, AK, he risked his own safety to cover an \nenemy grenade with his body during an attack by insurgents.\n  For his gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States, \nPrivate First Class Millican was posthumously awarded the Silver Star, \nour Nation's third highest award for combat valor. While this is a \ngreat honor and one deserving of Private First Class Millican's \nactions, I believe his act of heroism and bravery deserves our Nation's \nhighest honor. Therefore, I have asked the Department of Defense to \nconsider him for the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration \nawarded by the United States. Private First Class Millican went beyond \nthe call of duty and risked his own life not only to protect our Nation \nbut to save members of his unit.\n  I offer my thoughts, prayers and condolences to Private First Class \nMillican's family. His loss symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for our county. His service represented his commitment to protect \nhis family, community, and our Nation.\n  I am honored to stand before the Senate today to pay tribute to the \nlife and service of PFC Johnathon Millican. Private First Class \nMillican's dedication to the principles of freedom and democracy will \nserve as an example to all of us, for generations to come. It is my \nhope that he will be duly honored with the Medal of Honor, but even if \nPrivate First Class Millican is not awarded the Medal of Honor, he is \nno less a hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9209-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE McGOVERN\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 35 years ago, thousands of young people \nentered politics for the first time by working on the Presidential \ncampaign of George McGovern--a champion for social and economic justice \nand leading progressive.\n  Senator McGovern's legacy of progressive politics dates back to \nvolunteering for Henry Wallace's Presidential campaign in 1948.\n  At 19, and still in college, I was one of those who volunteered for \nSenator McGovern during a time of great social and political upheaval \nin our Nation.\n  We looked to Senator McGovern for his leadership on ending the \nVietnam war; for his vision of a nation defined by equal rights, equal \nopportunity, and unwavering support for those in need.\n  I remember being struck by the strength of his faith and by his \npatriotism.\n  When he thought our Nation needed to go to war, he served in \nuniform--earning the Distinguished Flying Cross during World War II.\n  And when he knew it was a war that was wrong, he spoke out early, and \noften, as was the case with the Vietnam war.\n  Whether he courageously spoke out against the war from this Chamber \nas a U.S. Senator, or spoke out for social justice on the Presidential \ncampaign trail, Senator McGovern gave hope--and purpose--to a \ngeneration of Americans.\n  He changed lives and improved a nation.\n  Senator McGovern's work continues today.\n  A former U.N. Global Ambassador on World Hunger, Senator McGovern's \noutreach has helped feed literally millions of families around the \nworld.\n  Together with Senator Bob Dole, he founded the George McGovern-Robert \nDole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, \nwhich helps feed children in developing nations.\n  And Senator McGovern continues to influence the national debate, \nspeaking out on the Iraq war and weighing in on behalf of \ndisenfranchised populations in our Nation and throughout the world.\n  Senator McGovern changed forever political activism and grassroots \norganizing. He opened the door for millions of activists attracted by \nhis idealism, many of whom remained in public service their entire \nlives.\n  More than public servant, Senator McGovern has been a beloved husband \nand father.\n  The Senator was married to his wife Eleanor for nearly 64 years, \nbefore her passing earlier this year.\n  Together, they raised five children, Ann, Terry, Susan, Mary, and \nSteven.\n  Nearly 35 years after running for President, and marking his 85th \nbirthday, Senator McGovern is ready to help lead us all into the next \nprogressive era of our Nation.\n  I am humbled by Senator McGovern's service to our Nation and feel \nprivileged to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9209-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   HONORING THE CHILD ABUSE LISTENING, INTERVIEWING AND COORDINATION \n                                 CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 10th anniversary of the Child Abuse Listening, \nInterviewing and Coordination Center, CALICO Center.\n  CALICO Center was established in 1997 to provide a supportive \nenvironment for children in Alameda County who have suffered from \nabuse. By providing a safe and secure place where children are the \nfirst priority, CALICO Center successfully minimizes the trauma that \nthese children face when dealing with the after effects of abuse. As a \nmultidisciplinary center, CALICO Center brings together law \nenforcement, child welfare workers, and prosecutors to coordinate \nAlameda County's response to child abuse. CALICO Center also works with \nthe community to increase the prosecution of child abusers who engage \nin such heinous crimes.\n  Since it first opened, CALICO Center has effectively served more than \n5,000 children, most of whom were victims of violence in their homes \nand communities. It also connects children and families with critical \ntherapeutic, medical and legal support services that are essential to \nthe healing process.\n  I commend CALICO Center's dedicated staff and volunteers, who have \nworked tirelessly and unrelentingly to help children and end child \nabuse in Alameda County for the past decade. They have an incredibly \ndifficult job, but the men and women at CALICO Center prove every day \nthat they are truly community heroes by helping these innocent victims \nof child abuse.\n  Child abuse is one of the most vicious crimes known to humanity. \nSince 1997, CALICO Center has served as a model for how to successfully \nengage the entire community in protecting its most vulnerable citizens. \nIts dedication to the community is inspiring and impressive. I \ncongratulate CALICO Center on its 10th anniversary and wish them many \nmore years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9209-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9209-S9210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING COLONEL STEPHEN L. HILL\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I honor COL Stephen L. Hill \nand the exceptional service he has provided as commander of the \nPittsburgh District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the period \nfrom July 16, 2004, to July 13, 2007. My colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, has joined me to honor Colonel Hill.\n  On Friday, July 13 in Pittsburgh, PA, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers Pittsburgh District military Change of Command ceremony will \nhonor the services of the outgoing commander, COL Stephen L. Hill, and \nwelcome the incoming commander, COL Michael P. Crall.\n  Colonel Hill will leave a legacy of excellence. His leadership \nfocused the district's capabilities on executing vital programs for the \nregion and the Nation. His superb managerial skills and emphasis on \nbuilding relationships and encouraging open and honest communication \nincreased confidence in the\n\n[[Page S9210]]\n\nability of the district to accomplish its mission.\n  During his tenure as district commander, the district's workload \nexpanded and its annual operating budget increased from less than $100 \nmillion in Fiscal Year 2004 to over $184 million in Fiscal Year 2007. \nColonel Hill skillfully managed resources and reengineered district \nprocesses to efficiently accomplish the planning, engineering, \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of Pittsburgh district's 23 \nlocks and dams, 16 multipurpose reservoirs, local flood protection \nprojects and environmental infrastructure projects covering 26,000 \nsquare miles and portions of five States.\n  Colonel Hill knew that an important aspect of commanding the district \nwas developing relationships with key leaders in the region. He took \nthe time to meet with officials, visit projects, evaluate the issues, \nand work to understand the various perspectives of the experts in the \nregion. He established and improved relations with local, State and \nFederal officials, culminating in changes to outdated lock and dam \noperating schedules, resulting in cost savings and efficiencies. \nColonel Hill's partnerships resulted in the revitalization in projects \naffecting the critical waterways in the Lower Monongahela and Upper \nOhio River. He championed efforts with the Upper Ohio River Study, \nAsset Management, Charleroi construction, the district's Strategic \nBusiness Initiative, SBI, and a number of other high priority projects. \nThese efforts and accomplishments greatly improved the district's image \nand reputation among the public, stakeholders, congressional staff and \nthe workforce.\n  Colonel Hill recognized the importance of working across and beyond \nthe district's boundaries. He led by example, deploying to Louisiana to \nassist in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort, serving as part of \nTask Force Hope. More than 25 percent of the Pittsburgh District team \nmembers also deployed to assist in the hurricane recovery effort.\n  Colonel Hill's exceptional service reflects great credit upon \nhimself, the Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Army.\n  Colonel Hill's next duty assignment is Commander of the gulf region \nSouth District at Base Camp Adder, Iraq. The South District covers more \nthan 65,000 square miles, manages more than 1,500 projects that are \nvalued at over $3.3 billion. Colonel Hill will oversee 107 U.S. \nmilitary and civilian professionals, 263 contract security personnel \nand nearly 124 Iraq professionals who work side-by-side to provide the \ntransitional support in order to create a viable and stable democracy \nin the country.\n  Pennsylvania has been honored to experience the leadership and \npassion that COL Stephen Hill provided to the Pittsburgh District. \nAlong with my colleague, Senator Specter, I thank the colonel for his \nservice to our country and wish him a safe tour of duty in Iraq and \nmuch success throughout his entire career.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a biography of Colonel Hill.\n  The material follows:\n\n       Colonel Stephen L.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nmark the centennial of Elida, NM.\n  In July 1907, the town of Elida was officially incorporated, and for \nthe last 100 years this small New Mexico town has remained a close-knit \nranching community. Although much has changed in Elida during the last \n100 years, many things have not. Elida is still the kind of town where \nneighbors take the time to help one another and come together for a \nFourth of July barbeque every year. I believe that kind of community is \nsomething special and those individuals who call Elida home should be \nproud.\n  As the residents of Elida and the surrounding area gather this \nweekend to celebrate the history of their town, I would like to wish \nthem well and I hope Elida has another wonderful 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9210-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9210-S9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF ERIN RATH\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my longtime \ncommunications director and friend Erin Rath, who for the past 9 years \nhas had the unenviable task of turning a sow's ear to a silk purse, of \nexplaining what I ``really'' meant and consoling reporters whose call I \nmissed.\n  Erin comes from hearty New Hampshire political stock and was brought \nup in an environment where politics and community service was very much \na part of her life. Her mother Chris is a leading educator in Concord, \nserving as superintendent of schools, and her father Tom is a bit of a \nlegend in New Hampshire politics for offering sound advice to \nPresidential candidates who wander into the Granite State. But, anyone \nwho knows Erin will tell you she has always cut her own path, willing \nto take any task and accomplishing it with a smile. Whether it was \ndealing with a not so media friendly member or an aggressive reporter, \nErin has perfected the skills needed to pitch any story with style and \ngrace. She understands how to craft a message and have it be \nunderstood, whether by a weekly paper in New Hampshire or the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  On those rare days that I didn't want to do press, Erin was always \nthe one coming to me and promoting an interview or conference call and, \neven when temporarily rebuffed, would find a way to cheerfully get her \nmission accomplished. And, when she was left to translate the day's \nevents to a press corps that was disinterested or confused, Erin would \nfind a way to make the story intelligible and get it in print or across \nthe airwaves.\n  Erin has also worn another very important hat in my office as the \nlead on appropriations issues. She excelled at organizing and managing \nmy appropriations requests and making sure worthy New Hampshire \nprojects were\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nnot overlooked. Erin has been responsible for helping to deliver \nhundreds of millions of dollars to better our State.\n  Just as important to Kathy and I has been the friendship that went \nwell beyond the office. Knowing Erin since she was rather young, \nallowed us the rare opportunity to watch a bubbly, redheaded, star \nathlete mature into a charming and professional woman and soon to be \nmother. Whether it was house-sitting or helping watch over our active \nfamily, Erin has long been a part of the Gregg family.\n  Erin has decided to delay the dream many of us had for her of running \nfor Congress in New Hampshire until after the birth of her first child \nand move to Minnesota with her husband Dan Moos as he begins his \nteaching career at the Gustavus Adolphus College. Erin, after being in \nthe eye of the storm for the past 9 years, will enjoy living in a \nfrozen, quiet land where community spirit is derived from singing the \nGolden Gophers fight song.\n  Kathy joins me in wishing Erin continued great success and in \nthanking her for all that she has done for the Gregg family, our \noffice, and New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9211-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on July 13, 2007, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bill, without \namendment:\n\n       S. 1701.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 1787. A bill to conduct 1 or more higher education and career \nreadiness demonstration projects for rural, low-income students; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, all students, regardless of where they \nlive, need appropriate tools to compete in today's global economy. \nToday, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will ensure students \nin rural areas are equipped with the resources they need. If approved, \nthe Rural Students College, Career, and Community Readiness Act of 2007 \nwould improve the educational and career outcomes and build the \nleadership skills of students in rural communities. I am pleased to be \nworking my colleague, Senator Specter, on this important and timely \nlegislation.\n  Roughly one in four public schools is located in rural America, \naccounting for 14.5 percent of total public school enrollment. \nUnfortunately, studies have shown students attending these rural \nschools generally have lower educational aspirations than their urban \nand suburban peers. In addition, roughly half of rural high school \nstudents live and attend schools in counties that do not have colleges.\n  These facts are daunting and present a major hurdle in improving \neducation for students in rural communities. However, if our country is \nto successfully compete for jobs in the marketplace of the 21st \ncentury, we must ensure all students have access to an excellent \neducation. These are some of the many reasons why Senator Specter and I \nhave joined together to introduce the Rural Students College, Career, \nand Community Readiness Act of 2007.\n  This legislation will establish partnerships between nonprofit \nentities and rural school districts to improve the academic motivation \nand educational performance of rural, low-income students. Under these \npartnerships, students in grades 7-12 will receive 25 hours of program \nworkshops during the school year to develop career awareness and build \ntheir leadership skills. Furthermore, these programs will provide \ninformation for students about the opportunities for and the importance \nof higher education while increasing understanding of the future labor \nneeds in their State.\n  This legislation also calls for a rigorous evaluation of the \nprogram's impact. The results of this evaluation will not only tell us \nthe rates of participation in dual enrollment courses, advanced \nplacement courses, or other related programs of our rural students, but \nalso provide models of best practices for partnerships so others can \nreplicate their success.\n  The Rural Students College, Career, and Community Readiness Act \nemphasizes the improvement of human capital through education as an \nimportant engine for economic development for rural communities. This \nlegislation is needed to increase the number of rural students engaged \nin rigorous, college-preparatory coursework, improve their high school \ngraduation rates, and prepare the next generation of leaders in rural \ncommunities.\n  I am hopeful my Senate colleagues will join us to move this \nlegislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 1788. A bill to provide for the mandatory revocation of passports \nof individuals whose child support payments are more than $2,500 in \narrears; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nensure that noncustodial parents pay child support, instead of fleeing \noff to hide from their responsibilities. I commend my fellow Kansas \ncolleagues, Congressman Dennis Moore and Congressman Jerry Moran, for \nintroducing similar legislation in the House.\n  The problem is this: noncustodial parents could potentially avoid \npaying their responsible share of child support by leaving the country. \nState child support enforcement agencies must certify cases to the \nState Department for passport denial if the child support debt is over \n$2,500. The loophole that emerges is for those deadbeat parents who \nalready have a passport. Under current implementation of the law, the \nnext opportunity for enforcement is at the renewal of the passport, \nwhich could be several years down the road. The legislation I offer \ntoday closes that loophole, and simply instructs the State Department \nto revoke, in addition to denying, a noncustodial parent's passport \nonce the individual's child support debt exceeds $2,500. Studies show \nthat the receipt of child support is a key factor that keeps a child \nand single parent family from living in or near poverty. Beyond the \nfinancial security that steady child support provides, there is a \ngreater likelihood that noncustodial parents are personally involved in \ntheir child's life. If a parent shows responsibility financially, there \nis a bigger chance that he or she is involved emotionally. The impact \nof a noncustodial parent's involvement in his child's life, in many \ncases, results\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nin better grades and fewer behavioral problems.\n  In Kansas alone, there are currently 131,000 child support cases \nopen, including those receiving public assistance, and those above that \nincome bracket. Last year, the Kansas Child Support Enforcement Program \ncollected $156 million in child support.\n  Now, you might ask: What percentage of the population will this help? \nI would concede that, although this may not impact a high percentage of \nthose children and families receiving child support, the impact on an \nindividual family is very significant. According to my state's limited \nrecords on this issue, approximately 50 passport applications and \nrenewals are denied on a yearly basis. That figure does not include \nthose passports that should be revoked. The Kansas Child Support \nEnforcement Program estimates that the number of deadbeat parents \naffected would increase to 250. The security afforded by the steady \nstream of child support could be the lone determinant of a family \nliving in poverty or existing on adequate financial ground.\n  I encourage my colleagues to add their support to this important fix. \nWe must ensure that the tools provided to the states have the teeth \nnecessary to discourage deadbeat parents from running out on their \nfinancial responsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9213-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           SENATE RESOLUTION 271--HONORING LADY BIRD JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nSmith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, \nMr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Baucus) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 1585, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 703. LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE \n                   COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the uniformed services and their \n     families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of \n     the last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n     are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n       (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n       (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n     benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n     employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n     members of the uniformed services are turning for health care \n     services to the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE \n     program, for the health care benefits in retirement that they \n     earned by their service in uniform.\n       (6) In some cases, civilian employers establish financial \n     incentives for employees who are also eligible for \n     participation in the TRICARE program to receive health care \n     benefits under that program rather than under the health care \n     benefits programs of such employers.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n     large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n     larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n     retired members of the uniformed services.\n       (8) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program \n     far exceeds the 33-percent increase in military retired pay \n     since such fees, deductibles, and copayments were first \n     required on the part of retired members of the uniformed \n     services 11 years ago.\n       (9) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n     the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n     members of the uniformed services who are participants in the \n     TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such \n     members paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for \n     health care in retirement through their extended sacrifices \n     by service in uniform.\n       (10) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n     accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs, and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements, for health care services.\n       (11) The Department of Defense has chosen to count the \n     accrual deposit to the Department of Defense Military Retiree \n     Health\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\n     Care Fund against the budget of the Department of Defense, \n     contrary to the requirements of section 1116 of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n       (12) Senior officials of the Department of Defense leaders \n     have reported to Congress that counting such deposits against \n     the budget of the Department of Defense is impinging on other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces, including weapons \n     programs, an inappropriate situation which section 1116 of \n     title 10, United States Code, was intended expressly to \n     prevent.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the uniformed services that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the uniformed services \n     who participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE \n     program, and should pursue any and all such options rather \n     than seeking large increases for enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments for such retirees, and their \n     families or survivors, who do participate in that program;\n       (3) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments that may be considered under the TRICARE program \n     for retired members of the uniformed services and their \n     families or survivors should not in any case exceed the \n     percentage increase in military retired pay; and\n       (4) any percentage increase in fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments under the TRICARE program that may be considered \n     for members of the uniformed services who are currently \n     serving on active duty or in the Selected Reserve, and for \n     the families of such members, should not exceed the \n     percentage increase in basic pay for such members.\n       (c) Pharmacy Benefits Program.--Section 1074g(a)(6) of \n     title 10, United Stated Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) The amount of any cost sharing requirements under \n     this paragraph may not be increased in any year by a \n     percentage that exceeds the percentage increase of the most \n     recent increase in retired pay for members of the armed \n     forces under section 1401a(b)(2) of this title. To the extent \n     that such increase for any year is less than one dollar, the \n     accumulated increase may be carried over from year to year, \n     rounded to the nearest dollar.''.\n       (d) Premiums for TRICARE Standard for Reserve Component \n     Members Who Commit to Service in the Selected Reserve.--\n     Section 1076d(d)(3) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The monthly amount'' and inserting ``(A) \n     Subject to subparagraph (B), the monthly amount''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of the premium in effect for a month \n     for TRICARE Standard coverage under this section may not \n     exceed a percentage equal to the percentage of the most \n     recent increase in the rate of basic pay authorized for \n     members of the uniformed services for a year.''.\n       (e) Copayments Under CHAMPUS.--Paragraph (3) of section \n     1086(b) of such title is amended in the first sentence by \n     striking ``during the period beginning on April 1, 2006, and \n     ending on September 30, 2007.'' and inserting ``after March \n     31, 2006''.\n       (f) Prohibition on Enrollment Fees for Certain Persons \n     Under CHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) A person covered by subsection (c) may not be charged \n     an enrollment fee for coverage under this section.''.\n       (g) Automatic Enrollment for Certain Persons Under \n     CHAMPUS.--Section 1086(b) of such title is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) A person covered by subsection (c) shall not be \n     subject to denial of claims for coverage under this section \n     for failure to enroll for such coverage. To the extent \n     enrollment may be required, enrollment shall be automatic for \n     any such person filing a claim under this section.''.\n       (h) Premiums and Other Charges Under TRICARE.--Section \n     1097(e) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary of \n     Defense''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Effective as of October 1, 2007, the percentage \n     increase in the amount of any premium, deductible, copayment \n     or other charge prescribed by the Secretary under this \n     subsection may not exceed the percentage increase of the most \n     recent increase in retired pay for members and former members \n     of the armed forces under section 1041a(b)(2) of this \n     title.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2192.

requirements.\n       (5) The means by which the Air Force was able to restart \n     the production line for the C-5 aircraft after having closed \n     the line for several years, and the actions to be taken to \n     ensure the production line for the C-17 aircraft could be \n     restarted should a decision to close the line be made, \n     including an analysis of the following:\n       (A) The costs of closing and re-opening the production line \n     for the C-5 aircraft, and an assessment of the costs of \n     closing and re-opening the production line for the C-17 \n     aircraft on a similar basis.\n       (B) The risks inherent in permitting a production line to \n     close when compared with the potential savings or favorable \n     aspects of keeping a production line open.\n       (6) The financial effects of retiring or upgrading and \n     maintaining the C-5A aircraft fleet on procurement decisions \n     relating to the C-17 aircraft.\n       (7) The impact that increasing the role and use of \n     strategic airlift aircraft in intratheater operations will \n     have on the current target number for strategic airlift \n     aircraft of 299, including an analysis of the following:\n       (A) The appropriateness of using C-5 aircraft and C-17 \n     aircraft for intratheater missions, as well as the efficacy \n     of these aircraft to perform current and projected future \n     intratheater missions.\n       (B) The interplay of existing doctrinal intratheater \n     airlift aircraft (such as the C-130 aircraft and the future \n     Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA)) with an increasing role for C-5 \n     aircraft and C-17 aircraft in intratheater missions.\n       (C) The most appropriate and likely missions for C-5 \n     aircraft and C-17 aircraft in intratheater operations and the \n     potential for increased requirements in these mission areas.\n       (D) Any intratheater mission sets best performed by \n     strategic airlift aircraft as opposed to traditional \n     intratheater airlift aircraft.\n       (E) Any requirements for increased production or longevity \n     of C-5 and C-17 aircraft, or for a new strategic airlift \n     aircraft, in light of the matters analyzed under this \n     paragraph.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to exclude from the study under subsection (a) \n     consideration of airlift assets other than the C-5 aircraft \n     or C-17 aircraft that do or may provide intratheater and \n     intertheater airlift, including the potential

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has vital national security interests \n     in Iraq and the Middle East region.\n       (2) These vital interests include the prevention of Iraq or \n     any piece of its territory from being used as a safe haven or \n     training ground for terrorists or as a repository or assembly \n     point for weapons of mass destruction; the prevention of acts \n     of violence and disorder that upset wider regional stability, \n     undermining friendly governments, expanding refugee flows, \n     impairing the international shipping lanes in the Persian \n     Gulf, or destroying key oil production or transportation \n     facilities; the prevention of Iranian domination of or \n     aggression toward nations or areas of the Middle East, which \n     would have potentially serious consequences for weapons \n     proliferation, terrorism, the security of Israel, and the \n     stability of friendly governments; and the protection of U.S. \n     credibility in the region and throughout the world.\n       (3) On January 10, 2007, the President announced the ``New \n     Way forward'' (hereinafter known as ``the President's \n     strategy''), which consists of four basic elements: \n     political, regional, economic, and military.\n       (4) The central component of the military element of the \n     President's strategy is an increased emphasis on population \n     security with augmented Iraqi and Coalition force levels in \n     Baghdad and elsewhere. This element required the deployment \n     of five additional U.S. brigade combat teams, with the fifth \n     brigade combat team having been deployed and having become \n     operational in June 2007.\n       (5) It is widely recognized that there is no purely \n     military solution to the situation in Iraq. The Iraqi leaders \n     must, as a unified government, reach political settlements in \n     order to achieve reconciliation, for their failure to do so \n     greatly contributes to the violence and disorder in Iraq.\n       (6) The viability of the President's strategy within Iraq \n     depends upon: 1) military success at reducing violence and \n     instability in Iraq to a degree that creates greater \n     political\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n     normalcy to conclude political compromises; 2) the \n     willingness of Iraqi leaders to subordinate their personal, \n     tribal, and sectarian loyalties and agendas to allow for \n     meaningful and lasting compromises on key questions of \n     economic and political power, such as the equitable \n     distribution of hydrocarbon resources, the enactment of a de-\n     baathification policy, the enactment of provincial election \n     law, the completion of the Constitutional review process, and \n     the settlement of the Kirkuk question; and 3) the ability of \n     these potential compromises to achieve a sufficient level of \n     national reconciliation to sustain a stable, unified \n     government, security forces loyal to that government, and a \n     cohesive society despite the continuing risk of terrorism or \n     sectarian violence.\n       (7) According to the Initial Benchmark Assessment Report, \n     issued on July 12, 2007, under the requirements of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (Public Law 110-\n     28), enacted May 25, 2007, the Administration has scored \n     satisfactory progress toward 8 of 18 benchmarks, but \n     unsatisfactory or mixed progress is being marked in 10 \n     others. Specifically, in the Security sector, while the \n     report grades ``satisfactory progress toward providing three \n     trained and ready Iraqi brigades to support Baghdad \n     operations, ``the Iraqi Government has made unsatisfactory \n     progress toward increasing the number of Iraqi Security \n     Forces units capable of operating independently'', and has \n     not made satisfactory progress ``in ensuring that Iraqi \n     Security Forces are providing even-handed enforcement of the \n     law. . .''\n       (8) The Administration's Initial Benchmark Assessment \n     Report of July 12, 2007, indicates clearly that none of the \n     benchmarks set forth in P.L 110-28, nor those milestones \n     recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in December \n     2006 in the areas of national reconciliation, security and \n     governance have been reached in their entirety.\n       (9) Sectarian agendas, heightened by current power \n     struggles and the memory of the oppressive rule of Saddam \n     Hussein, have generated fear, distrust, and hatred in many \n     parts of Iraq leading to ethnic cleansing, violence, \n     sabotage, economic discrimination, and uncompromising \n     political agendas that have hindered attempts to achieve \n     political reconciliation.\n       (10) Many leaders of the Iraqi government and sectarian \n     factions have not demonstrated a commitment to the concept of \n     a pluralist government; nor have they demonstrated the \n     ability to control many sub-factions within their sects.\n       (11) The difficulty of achieving short-term political \n     accommodation in Iraq has been complicated by absenteeism in \n     Parliament, personal feuds among leaders, factional boycotts, \n     and the demands of making policy by consensus in a fragmented \n     society.\n       (12) Though some Iraqi military and security units have \n     achieved a commendable, professional degree of capability and \n     have performed courageously in combat, a measure of sectarian \n     loyalties, agenda, and corruption still afflict the Iraqi \n     security services.\n       (13) Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and \n     few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's \n     factions, the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, \n     pluralist, democratic government that is able to police \n     itself, protect its borders, and achieve economic development \n     is not likely to be achieved in the near future.\n       (14) American military and diplomatic strategy in Iraq must \n     adjust to the reality that sectarian factionalism is not \n     likely to abate anytime soon and probably cannot be \n     controlled from the top.\n       (15) The U.S. military's capacity to interpose itself \n     indefinitely between sectarian factions in Iraq is limited by \n     the high tempo of deployments to Iraq during four and a half \n     years of conflict have impacted the overall readiness of our \n     armed forces, complicated the all-volunteer policy of \n     recruitment, and strained the quality of life for military \n     families.\n       (16) The extended Iraq deployments have potential \n     consequences for U.S. abilities to respond to other national \n     security threats, including challenges in Afghanistan.\n       (17) The safety and security of our military forces, as \n     well as our credibility in the region require that any \n     military withdrawal or redeployment from Iraq be carefully \n     planned and executed.\n       (18) Some level of American military presence in or near \n     Iraq would improve prospects that the United States could \n     respond to terrorist threats, protect petroleum flows, help \n     deter a regional war, and reassure friendly governments of \n     America's commitment to Middle East security.\n       (19) Our military planners and diplomats must have as much \n     time as possible to develop and implement the elements of any \n     follow-on policy to the President's strategy, including \n     securing the cooperation of the Iraqi government and key \n     states in the region and establishing the logistics to \n     support a residual or temporary American military presence.\n       (20) A poorly-planned or precipitous withdrawal from Iraq \n     could compound the risks of a wider regional conflict \n     stimulated by Sunni-Shia tensions, damage U.S. credibility \n     among regional allies, expose Iraqis who have worked with the \n     Coalition to retribution, increase the magnitude of \n     destabilizing refugee flows, undercut economic and \n     development projects currently underway in Iraq, and signal \n     that the United States was abandoning efforts to prevent \n     Iraqi territory from being used as a terrorist base.\n       (21) The December 2006 report issued by the Iraq Study \n     Group advocated a comprehensive strategy that includes ``new \n     and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the \n     region, and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces in \n     Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its \n     combat forces out of Iraq responsibly;''.\n       (22) A new strategy should reference the recommendations of \n     the Iraq Study Group, which consulted nearly 200 leading \n     officials and experts, including senior members of the \n     Government of Iraq, the United States Government, and key \n     coalition partners and received advice from more than 50 \n     distinguished scholars and experts from a variety of fields \n     who conducted working groups in the areas of economy and \n     reconstruction, military and security, political development, \n     and the strategic environment in Iraq and the Middle East.\n       (23) The long term importance of Iraq and the Middle East \n     to American economic and national security requires that our \n     policy in Iraq be militarily sustainable and that it command \n     the greatest degree of public and Congressional support \n     possible.\n       (24) The report of the Iraq Study Group opened with a \n     letter from the co-chairs, James A. Baker, III and Lee H. \n     Hamilton, which states ``Our political leaders must build a \n     bipartisan approach to bring a responsible conclusion to what \n     is now a lengthy and costly war. Our country deserves a \n     debate that prizes substance over rhetoric, and a policy that \n     is adequately funded and sustainable. The President and \n     Congress must work together. Our leaders must be candid and \n     forthright with the American people in order to win their \n     support''.\n\n     SEC. 1542. REPORTING AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) The President shall require the Director of National \n     Intelligence to review and update, as required, the National \n     Intelligence Estimate (NIE) titled ``Prospects for Iraq's \n     Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead'', dated January 2007, \n     not later than September 4, 2007. The updated NIE shall \n     include an assessment specifically of the consequences of the \n     various courses of action reducing U.S. forces in Iraq on the \n     future of Iraq, the Middle East region, U.S. national \n     interests, and U.S. partners and allies.\n       (b) The President, in close coordination with the \n     Secretaries of Defense and State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \n     other senior military leaders, shall, as a matter of \n     prudence, consider all options and initiate planning to:\n       (1) transition U.S. combat forces from policing the civil \n     strife or sectarian violence in Iraq;\n       (2) redeploy or reallocate those forces in a responsible \n     manner as conditions permit;\n       (3) refocus U.S. military operations on maintaining the \n     territorial integrity of Iraq, denying international \n     terrorists a safe haven, conducting counterterrorism \n     operations against al Qaeda in Iraq and its associates, \n     protecting U.S. forces and facilities, and training and \n     equipping Iraqi forces to take full responsibility for their \n     own security; and\n       (4) address the findings of the Independent Assessment of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces as provided by PL 110-28 to include \n     decision points for the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq \n     that are based upon the readiness of Iraqi Security Forces.\n       (c) The aforementioned plans shall be presented to \n     Congress, in a format determined by the Administration, not \n     later than October 16, 2007, and shall be accompanied by the \n     results from modeling and simulation efforts by appropriate \n     departments and agencies of the U.S. government that address \n     the consequences of the courses of action proposed and \n     analyzed. The results of that modeling and simulation shall \n     be made available to Congress.\n       (d) We recommend that the President and the Administration \n     design plans to be executable beginning not later than \n     December 31, 2007.\n\n     SEC. 1543. AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF FORCE.\n\n       Findings:\n       (1) In the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \n     (Public Law 110-28), enacted May 25, 2007, the Congress \n     enacted broad legislation, part of which originated in the \n     Senate, and the President signed the legislation which \n     specifically mandated that the President take the following \n     actions:\n       (A) ``The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved''.\n       (B) ``The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, The Secretary of Defense, The Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress''.\n       (C) ``If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\n     in the report, the advisability of implementing such aspects \n     of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems \n     appropriate''.\n       (D) ``The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria, outlined above''.\n       (E) ``Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq will be made available to testify in \n     open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of \n     the Congress''.\n       (F) The Department of Defense ``will commission an \n     independent, private-sector entity, which operates as a \n     501(c)(3), with recognized credentials and expertise in \n     military affairs, to prepare an independent report assessing \n     the following:\n       (i) The readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to \n     assume responsibility for maintaining the territorial \n     integrity of Iraq, denying international terrorists a safe \n     haven, and bringing greater security to Iraq's 18 provinces \n     in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an end to sectarian \n     violence to achieve national reconciliation;\n       (ii) The training, equipping, command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities, and logistics capacity of the ISF;\n       (iii) The likelihood that, given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by U.S. forces, the continued support of U.S. \n     troops will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill \n     the missions outlined in subparagraph (A)''.\n       (iv) It is anticipated that the ``Independent Report on the \n     Iraqi Security Forces,'' will, in whole or in part, be \n     available before September 5, 2007.\n       (2) Two successive reports by the President, a report from \n     the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, a report from the Commander of \n     Multinational Forces--Iraq, and the Independent Assessment of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces, thereby provide a comprehensive \n     body of information available to the American public and to \n     the Congress, upon which they can establish opinions and \n     evaluate decisions on the future course of U.S. involvement \n     in Iraq and the surrounding region.\n       (3) The findings that supported H.J. Res. 114, Public Law \n     107-243, which was enacted in 2002 and which authorized the \n     President to use the Armed Forces of the United States \n     against Iraq, require review and revision. Therefore, as part \n     of his September 15, 2007, report, Congress expects that the \n     President will submit to Congress a proposal to revise Public \n     Law 107-243.\n\n     SEC. 1544. STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT.\n\n       The President shall direct the Secretary of State, in \n     conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, to initiate \n     negotiations with the Government of Iraq on a Status of \n     Forces Agreement with a goal to complete work not later than \n     120 days after enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 1545. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN IRAQ \n                   AND THE MIDDLE EAST.\n\n       (a) Findings\n       (1) The Iraq Study Group recommended a diplomatic \n     offensive, stating ``all key issues in the Middle East - the \n     Arab-Israeli conflict, Iraq, Iran, the need for political and \n     economic reforms, and extremism and terrorism, are \n     inextricably linked''. The report stressed that diplomacy \n     aimed at solving key regional issues would ``help marginalize \n     extremists and terrorists, promote U.S. values and interests, \n     and improve America's global image''.\n       (2) Members of the Gulf Cooperation Council-Plus-Two issued \n     a joint statement on January 16, 2007, reflecting ``their \n     collective desire to prevent Iraq from becoming a \n     battleground for regional international powers and urged all \n     to help end sectarian violence in Iraq''.\n       (3) The Bush Administration supported and participated in \n     the March 10, 2007, regional conference in Baghdad and the \n     follow-up regional conference held in Egypt on May 3 and 4, \n     2007, and that conference produced three working groups: one \n     chaired by Syria on Border Security, a second chaired by \n     Jordan on Refugees, and a third by Turkey on Fuels and \n     Energy.\n       (4) The redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to other \n     locations in the Middle East, would require the cooperation \n     of regional governments.\n       (5) A revision of U.S. military policy in Iraq could \n     increase the chances of stimulating greater economic and \n     diplomatic assistance for Iraq from multi-lateral \n     organizations and European allies, who have sought to limit \n     their association with an unpopular war.\n       (6) Regional players, including- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, \n     Egypt, Turkey, the Gulf States, and others have substantial \n     concerns about Iran's disruptive agenda in the region that \n     converge with U.S. interests.\n       (7) All states in the region, including Iran and Syria have \n     some interest in preventing political turmoil and refugee \n     flows from emanating from Iraq or the break-up of Iraq into \n     sectarian regions.\n       (8) All nations that depend on oil imports, particularly \n     those who are dependent on Persian Gulf oil, have a strong \n     economic and security interest in maintaining stability in \n     the Gulf region.\n       (b) It is the Sense of Congress that the United States \n     Government should work vigorously with like-minded \n     governments, including the Iraqi government, to establish a \n     predictable and regular multi-lateral diplomatic forum \n     related to Iraq that meets frequently and is open to all \n     parties in the Middle East.\n       (c) Such a forum could be based on the existing structure \n     of the May 2007 foreign ministers conference at Sharm el-\n     Sheikh in Egypt that plans to reassemble in Istanbul at a \n     date to be determined, or it could be initiated with a new \n     structure.\n       (d) U.S. goals in advancing the forum should include \n     promoting international support for reconciliation in Iraq, \n     dealing with refugee flows emanating from Iraq, protecting \n     the territorial integrity of Iraq, advancing Iraqi economic \n     development, and containing any conflict that might spread \n     from Iraq.\n       (e) The United States should work with other nations at the \n     forum to promote transparency of national interests and \n     actions so that the risks for neighboring states of pursuing \n     armed aggression or destructive sectarian agendas are \n     heightened and all parties avoid miscalculations that could \n     lead to conflict.\n       (f) In the context of a drawdown of American forces in \n     Iraq, the United States should attempt to secure \n     contributions of resources or military personnel for \n     international efforts to stabilize Iraq's borders.\n       (g) Although focused on a multi-lateral approach to issues \n     related to Iraq, the United States should encourage \n     opportunities to discuss other regional concerns and to \n     facilitate bilateral contacts between those in attendance, \n     when appropriate.\n       (h) As the United States attempts to establish a more \n     sustainable policy in Iraq, our government should launch a \n     broader diplomatic offensive in the region aimed at repairing \n     alliances, assuring regional governments of our staying power \n     in the Middle East, enlisting greater help international help \n     in combating terrorism, stabilizing oil prices, and making \n     progress in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2209. Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Gregg, \nand Mr. Roberts) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill H.R. 1585, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2008 \nfor military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 143. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE REPLACEMENT OF THE TANKER \n                   AIRCRAFT FLEET.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that timely replacement of the \n     Air Force aerial refueling tanker fleet is a vital national \n     security priority for the reasons as follows:\n       (1) The average age of the aircraft in the Air Force aerial \n     refueling tanker fleet is now more than 43 years, with the \n     age of the aircraft in the KC-135 tanker fleet averaging 46 \n     years.\n       (2) The development and fielding of a replacement tanker \n     aircraft will allow the United States military to continue to \n     project combat capability anywhere in the world on short \n     notice without relying on intermediate bases for refueling.\n       (3) Under current plans, it will take more than 30 years to \n     replace the current fleet of KC-135 tanker aircraft, meaning \n     that some KC-135 tanker aircraft are scheduled to remain \n     operational until they are nearly 80 years old.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/13/senate-section/article/S9224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
