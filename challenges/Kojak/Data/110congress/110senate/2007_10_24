Fifty-seven and a half minutes on \nthe majority side and 58 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much again on the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I spoke extensively last night after \nSenator Leahy, the chairman, spoke about the nomination. I will make a \nfew comments now, and I will invite my colleagues to come to the floor \non the Republican side. For those who are interested in time, we have \nonly a limited amount, but we will apportion it as best we can, \nobviously equitably. It is my hope that we will move through the \ncloture vote to cut off debate and then proceed to confirm Judge Leslie \nSouthwick.\n  As I said yesterday--and, again, I spoke at some length--Judge \nSouthwick comes to this nomination with an outstanding academic, \nprofessional, and judicial record. On the Court of Appeals in the State \nof Mississippi and the intermediate appellate court, Judge Southwick \nhas distinguished himself by participating in some 6,000 cases and \nwriting some 950 opinions. His critics have singled out only two cases \nagainst that extraordinary record. I commented yesterday at length \nabout the fact that in neither of the cases in which he has been \ncriticized did he write the opinion, but only concurred, and there were \ngood reasons for the positions he took.\n  An extraordinary thing about Judge Southwick is that he got a waiver \nto join the Army Reserve at the age of 42 and then at the age of 53 \nvolunteered to go to Iraq into harm's way to serve on the Judge \nAdvocate General's staff, receiving the commendation of the major \ngeneral which I put into the Record yesterday.\n  His record shows that he has been very concerned about plaintiffs in \npersonal injury cases, about defendants in criminal cases, and has \nlooked out for the so-called little guy. As I enumerated yesterday, a \nnumber of very prominent members of the African-American community from \nMississippi have come forward in his support--one young lady who was \nhis law clerk and others who knew him. It is my view that on the \nmerits, there is no question that Judge Southwick should be confirmed.\n  There has been some concern about the seat he is filling, whether \nthere should be greater diversity on the seat. That really is a matter \nin the first instance for the President and then in the second instance \nfor the Senate to consider the merits of the individual. It is the \nAmerican way to consider Judge Southwick on his merits as to what he \nhas done and as to what he stands for.\n  We have seen this body very badly divided in the past couple of \ndecades along partisan lines. In the final 2 years of the \nadministration of President Reagan when Democrats had control of the \nSenate and the Judiciary Committee, President Reagan's nominees were \nstonewalled to a substantial extent. The same thing happened during the \nlast 2 years of the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Then, \nRepublicans acted in kind during the Clinton administration and refused \nin many cases to have hearings or to call President Clinton's nominees \nup for confirmation. I think that was the incorrect approach and said \nso, in fact, on a number of President Clinton's nominations.\n  This body had a very tough time 2 years ago when we were considering \nthe so-called nuclear constitutional option which would have taken away \nthe filibuster opportunity to require 60 votes, and we succeeded in a \ncompromise with the so-called Gang of 14. The Judiciary Committee has \nfunctioned more smoothly during the course of the past 3 years with \nSenator Leahy now the chairman and during the course of the 109th \nCongress in 2005 to 2006 when I chaired the committee.\n  So it is my hope that comity will be maintained, that Judge Southwick \nwill be considered as an individual as to whether he is qualified, \nwithout any collateral considerations as to the history of nominees to \nthe Fifth Circuit. I think if that is done, Judge Southwick will be \nconfirmed. It would be most unfortunate, in my judgment, if we were to \ngo back to the days of excessive partisanship.\n  It is an open question as to who the President will be following the \n2008 elections, and it would be my hope that however the Presidential \nelection works out and whoever may control the Senate, that we will \nconsider the nominees on their individual merits. To repeat, I think \nthat will lead to the confirmation of Judge Southwick.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Judge Southwick. With a long and consistent history of \ninsensitivity toward discrimination and of siding with the powerful \nagainst the powerless, Mr. Southwick is the wrong person to take a seat \non the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he is the wrong person to \nsit on the Federal bench in the State of Mississippi.\n  Before I explain why I oppose this nominee, let me say that my \nconcerns are based entirely on Judge Southwick's judicial record. They \nhave absolutely nothing to do with Judge Southwick as a person--whether \nhe is a nice man, a good employer, or a devoted family man. That is not \nwhat this confirmation process is all about. This confirmation process \nis about the kind of judge Leslie Southwick was on the Mississippi \nState Court of Appeals and what kind of judge he will be if he is \nconfirmed to the Fifth Circuit.\n  On the basis of Judge Southwick's record on the State court, I have a \nfairly clear picture of the kind of judge he will be if given a \nlifetime appointment. He will be the type of judge who consistently \nrules in favor of big business and corporate interests at the expense \nof workers' rights and consumer rights. I know this because in 160 out \nof 180 written decisions, he found a way to achieve that very outcome.\n  What I do know is that he interprets the law in a way that is not \nblind to color, blind to race, or blind to sexual orientation, but, in \nfact, focuses on these factors and sides against them. In fact, his \nrecord reveals a long history of discriminating against individuals \nbased on race and sexual orientation, a long history of siding with the \npowerful over and to the detriment of the powerless.\n  Finally, what I do know is that when given the opportunity, he stands \nby those opinions. When asked by my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, under oath, Judge Southwick was unable to think of a single \ninstance--not even one example--of standing up for the powerless, the \npoor, minorities, or the dispossessed, not when he was asked during the \nhearing and not when he was asked for a second time in written \nfollowup. This is not the kind of judge we need on the Federal bench.\n  Remember the circuit this judge was nominated to--the Fifth Circuit. \nIt is the circuit that covers Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, the \ncircuit that has the largest percentage of minority residents of any \nFederal circuit in the United States--44 percent. Let's not forget that \nhe is nominated to take one of the seats within that circuit reserved \nfor a judge from Mississippi--the State with the highest percentage of \nAfrican Americans in the country.\n  President Bush made a commitment to the residents of the Fifth \nCircuit, the people of Mississippi, and the people of this country that \nhe would appoint more African Americans to this circuit. Not only has \nhe gone back on this commitment, he has nominated someone whom the \nCongressional Black Caucus vehemently opposes on the grounds that he \nwould not provide equal justice in a circuit where racial \ndiscrimination has always been the most pronounced. He has nominated \nsomeone who the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the National Urban \nLeague, and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition have all said would fail to \nprotect the civil rights of the millions of minority residents living \nwithin the Fifth Circuit. Judge Southwick is an unacceptable nominee to \nany position on the Federal bench, but he is particularly ill-suited \nfor the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, let me give you one example of how Judge Southwick's \ninsensitivity toward racial discrimination affects how he decides \ncases. In the case of Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \nServices, Judge Southwick had to decide whether it was racial \ndiscrimination for a White employer to refer to an African American as \n``a good ole'' N word. Reversing\n\n[[Page S13275]]\n\na trial court's finding of discrimination, Judge Southwick joined an \nopinion stating that the N word was only ``somewhat derogatory'' and \ncompared it to calling someone a ``teacher's pet.'' A teacher's pet?\n  Judge Southwick was the deciding vote in the 5-4 decision. He had \nstrong opposition from four dissenting judges who wrote:\n\n       The [``N'' word] is, and has always been, offensive. Search \n     high and low, you will not find any non-offensive definition \n     for this term. There are some words, which by their nature \n     and definition are so inherently offensive, that their use \n     establishes the right to offend.\n\n  It is incomprehensible to me that anyone could disagree with that \nstatement. It is even more incomprehensible that the President of the \nUnited States could nominate an individual who does not believe the law \nsees such a term as offensive to the Federal appellate bench.\n  The ``N'' word is one of the most hateful, most denigrating words in \nthe English language. It has no place in our society and certainly \nshould never be tacitly permitted in the workplace.\n  The fact that Judge Southwick joined the majority opinion--which I \nshould add was reversed by the State supreme court--is not an anomaly. \nJudge Southwick also has a troubling record in cases reviewing racial \nbias in the selection of jurors. Of the 59 instances that an African \nAmerican defendant challenged their conviction on the grounds that the \nprosecution systematically struck African-American jurors, Mr. \nSouthwick refused the challenge 54 times. That is an over 91 percent \nrefusal rating.\n  When the color of the juror's skin was different, when African-\nAmerican defendants challenged their convictions on the grounds that \ntheir defense attorneys were prevented from striking Caucasian jurors, \nMr. Southwick refused their challenge and allowed the Caucasian juror \nto remain in the jury 100 percent of the time. So if a defendant \nclaimed an African American was unjustly kept off the jury, Judge \nSouthwick denied his claim. If a defendant claimed a Caucasian was \nunjustly kept on the jury, Judge Southwick denied his claim. Thus, it \nseems like Judge Southwick favors keeping Caucasians on juries and \nkeeping African Americans off--even in a State like Mississippi.\n  One of Judge Southwick's own colleagues criticized this apparent \npolicy because it established a low burden for the state to keep \nCaucasian jurors on a jury and a high burden for defendants to keep \nAfrican Americans on a jury. Any double standard of justice, especially \none that gives the benefit of the doubt to the Government at the \ndetriment of individual rights, is antithetical to our justice system \nand its presumption of innocence. It is absolutely unacceptable on a \nFederal appellate court.\n  Another area of concern I have involves Judge Southwick's rulings in \ncases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In \nthe case S.B. v. L.W., Judge Southwick joined an opinion that took an \n8-year-old child away from her birth mother largely because of the \nmother's sexual orientation. The fact that Judge Southwick joined this \novertly discriminatory opinion is extremely troubling. However, the \nconcurrence he himself authored is even more so.\n  His concurring opinion stated that homosexuality was a ``choice'' \nthat comes with consequences. Despite the fact that the American \nPsychological Association has found that sexual orientation is not a \nchoice, Judge Southwick decided to give his personal opinion, his \npersonal belief, that is was a choice, the weight of the law. Judges \nmust always remember the precedential value of their words and their \nopinions. That a judge would base a legal judgment on personal opinion \nis disconcerting. That a judge would base a legal judgment on such \nmisguided personal views regarding sexual orientation is absolutely \nintolerable.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to discuss one other problem I have \nwith Judge Southwick's nomination. That is the distinct trend in Judge \nSouthwick's decisions of deciding in favor of big business and against \nthe little guy. In fact, Judge Southwick ruled against injured workers \nand consumers 89 percent of the time when there was a divided court; 89 \npercent of the time Judge Southwick put the interests of corporations \nahead of average Americans; 89 percent of the time injured workers and \ninjured consumers found they were entitled to no relief in Judge \nSouthwick's eyes.\n  I understand that the individual is not always right. Big business is \nnot always wrong. But no judge should have such a strongly slanted \ntrack record in one direction or another. 89 percent is a very strongly \nslanted track record.\n  That is one reason why the UAW has also come out in strong opposition \nto Judge Southwick's nomination. Another reason the UAW is so strongly \nopposed is Judge Southwick's opinion that the ``employment at will'' \ndoctrine, which allows employers to fire workers for any reason, \n``provides the best balance of the competing interests in the normal \nemployment situation.'' In other words, he does not believe in \nprotecting job security. It is no wonder that the UAW has serious \nconcerns about his ability to enforce the National Labor Relations Act, \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act, and other laws that protect \nemployees in the workplace and limit ``employment at will.'' I share \nthose concerns.\n  Let me give you an example. In Cannon v. Mid-South X-Ray Co., Judge \nSouthwick refused to allow a woman to receive compensation for the \ndebilitating injuries she suffered as a result of being exposed to \ntoxic chemicals at work. The majority believed the woman should be able \nto bring her case to trial. Judge Southwick dissented from the 8-2 \ndecision. He rested his decision on a procedural point--that the statue \nof limitations had tolled--even though the woman did not experience \nsymptoms of her poisoning until years after initially being exposed. He \nrested his decision on the fact that she should have brought her case \nbefore she experienced any symptoms of poisoning. There was a shadow of \na doubt as to when the clock should have began to run for her case--and \nhe found in favor of big business.\n  In another case, Goode v. Synergy Corporation, Judge Southwick's \ndissent would have kept a family--whose granddaughter was killed in a \npropane heater explosion--from receiving a new trial even after it \nbecame clear that the company responsible for the heater had provided \nfalse information in the original trial. Luckily for the family, the \nmajority opinion felt differently.\n  Mr. President, our Federal appellate courts are the second most \npowerful courts in our country, deferring only to the Supreme Court on \na relatively small number of cases each year. For the majority of \nAmericans, justice stops there. Now more than ever we need an \nindependent judiciary that respects the rights of all Americans, is \ndedicated to colorblind justice, and protects workers and consumers \nfrom corporate America. We cannot afford to get these nominations \n``wrong.'' These are lifetime appointments that cannot be taken away \nonce we grant them.\n  In many ways, Judge Southwick is exactly what a judge should not be. \nHe brings his personal bias into his decision-making process. He \nconsistently sides with the government over defendants, particularly \nAfrican-American defendants. He routinely finds in favor of big \nbusiness at the expense of individual workers and consumers. He does \nnot seem to approach his cases with an open mind.\n  We cannot place a judge like this on the Federal appellate bench. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke \ncloture, and should that succeed, to unanimously vote against the \nnominee and giving a lifetime appointment to someone who consistently \ndecides against African Americans. In a circuit in which they are such \na huge part of the population, it is simply unacceptable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and concern from \ngroups concerned about the environment, the Bazelon Center for Mental \nHealth Law, the United Auto Workers, and the African-American Bar \nAssociation of Dallas, Texas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13276]]\n\n\n         Community Rights Counsel; Earthjustice; Friends of the \n           Earth; Sierra Club, Endangered Habitats League, \n           Louisiana Bayoukeeper, Inc., Louisiana Environmental \n           Action Network, San Francisco Baykeeper, Texas Campaign \n           for the Environment, Valley Watch, Inc.,\n                                                    June 13, 2007.\n     Re nomination of Leslie Southwick to a Lifetime Position on \n         the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n     Hon.

[Hereinafter Recent \n     Trends]\n\n   Judge Southwick Supports the Majority Side in the Supreme Court's \n Federalism Revolution and, Potentially, the ``Constitution in Exile'' \n                                Movement\n\n       Between 1990 and 2001, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court \n     struck down federal legislation at a rate rivaled only by the \n     discredited ``Lochner-era'' Court, which blocked the labor \n     reforms of the Progressive Era and the Congressional response \n     to the Depression in the early stages of the New Deal The \n     Court's rulings, often grouped together under the inaccurate \n     label of ``federalism,'' undermined important laws protecting \n     women, senior citizens, minorities, the disabled, and the \n     environment. These rulings have engendered withering \n     criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. For \n     example, Judge John Noonan, a conservative appointed by \n     President Reagan to the Ninth Circuit, declared that the \n     Rehnquist Court had acted ``without justification of any \n     kind'' in doing ``intolerable injury to the enforcement of \n     federal standards.'' ``The present damage,'' Judge Noonan \n     warns, ``points to the present danger to the exercise of \n     democratic government.'' As Senator Specter noted in a letter \n     to then Judge John Roberts, these cases represent ``the \n     judicial activism of the Rehnquist Court.''\n       Judge Southwick, writing in 2003, had a much more positive \n     view of these cases. Indeed, he analogized the Court's \n     ``return to first principles'' to a Christian following the \n     Scriptures: ``The Court is insisting on obedience to \n     constitutional structural commandments. It is as if the text \n     that is being followed begins along these lines: In the \n     Beginning, the New World was without Form, and void, and the \n     Patriot Fathers said 'Let There Be States.' Behold, there \n     were States, and it was Good.'' Separation of Powers, at 929. \n     He noted that the ``return by the Supreme Court to the \n     original scripture of federalism, or as some opposed to the \n     outcomes might claim, to the original sin of the \n     constitutional fathers, began in earnest with United States \n     v. Lopez in 1995.'' Id. at 929. The bulk of his article is \n     devoted to explaining how the model set by the Supreme Court \n     can be employed at the state level by the new conservative \n     majority on the Mississippi Supreme Court.\n       Even more troubling, at least potentially, is his assertion \n     that ``[f]rom 1937 to 1995, federalism was part of a \n     'Constitution in exile. ''' Id. at 930. Judge Southwick's \n     invocation of this term, coined by D.C. Circuit Judge Douglas \n     Ginsburg, and still relatively obscure outside Federalist \n     Society circles in 2003, suggests that he is supportive of \n     efforts by certain scholars in academia and some judges on \n     the federal bench to restore understandings of the \n     Constitution held by a conservative majority of the Supreme \n     Court in the period before the Great Depression and the New \n     Deal As University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein \n     opined in a New York Times Magazine cover story written by \n     Jeffrey Rosen, success of this ``Constitution in Exile'' \n     movement would mean:\n\n     many decisions of the Federal Communications Commission, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration and possibly the National Labor \n     Relations Board would be unconstitutional. It would mean that \n     the Social Security Act would not only be under political but \n     also constitutional stress. Many of the Constitution in \n     Exile people think there can't be independent regulatory \n     commissions, so the Security and Exchange Commission and \n     maybe even the Federal Reserve would be in trouble. Some \n     applications of the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water \n     Act would be struck down as beyond Congress's commerce \n     power.\n\n  Judge Southwick is a Pro-Corporate Partisan in the Mississippi Tort \n                                  Wars\n\n       Over the past decade, Mississippi judges have been engulfed \n     in what Judge Southwick calls ``never-ending and ever-\n     escalating tort wars being fought out at every level of the \n     Mississippi court system.'' Recent Trends at * 11. Judge \n     Southwick is clearly a partisan in this war. He criticizes \n     former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Chuck McRea for ``an \n     interest in crafting precedents that were favorable to the \n     interests of plaintiffs in personal injury actions.'' He \n     calls former Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove ``the \n     poster boy for trial lawyer campaign contributions.'' \n     Separation of Powers at 1027. Judge Southwick is also deeply \n     critical of the litigation against tobacco companies led by \n     former Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, favorably \n     quoting another commentator for the proposition that ``[i]f \n     the fallout from the state tobacco litigation is not \n     addressed quickly, it will further distort and destabilize a \n     number of areas of law, including the separation of powers \n     within state governments.'' Separation of Powers at 1032. \n     Finally, Judge Southwick notes that he has been criticized \n     for taking the defendants' side in such cases: ``[o]ther \n     appellate judges, including the author of this article, may \n     from time to time also appear to various observers to have \n     brought their background experiences into play in their \n     rulings on the bench.'' Recent Trends at * 11. Some of these \n     statements--particularly Judge Southwick's pointed \n     depiction'' of the sitting Mississippi Governor--seem a bit \n     intemperate for a sitting judge.\n       Moreover, examinations of Judge Southwick rulings by \n     Alliance for Justice and a business advocacy group support a \n     conclusion that Judge Southwick's rulings as a judge favored \n     corporate defendants. In 2004, a business advocacy group gave \n     Judge Southwick the highest rating of any judge on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals, based on his votes in cases \n     involving liability issues. B. Musgrave and T. Wilemon, \n     ``Business Group Rates State Justices,'' The Sun Herald (Mar. \n     24, 2004). According to an analysis by the Alliance for \n     Justice, ``Judge Southwick voted, in whole or in part, \n     against the injured party and in favor of special interests, \n     such as corporations or insurance companies, in 160 out of \n     180 published decisions involving state employment law and \n     torts cases in which at least one judge dissented.'' Alliance \n     for Justice, Preliminary Report on the Nomination of Leslie \n     H. Southwick to the Fifth Circuit, at 4-5; http://\nindependentjudiciary.com/resources/docs/\nPreliminaryReportSouthwick.pdf.\n       One of the cases included in the Alliance report gives us \n     particular concern because it limits access to courts, which \n     is essential to ensure that Americans have a meaningful right \n     to prevent and redress environmental harms including injury \n     to their health and safety, clean water, clean air, and \n     endangered species. State common law tort, nuisance and other \n     civil remedies often provide invaluable supplementation of \n     limited federal safety, health and environmental statutes. \n     Court rulings that unfairly cut off state common law \n     claims can preclude the most effective or only avenue of \n     relief. Unfortunately, that is what Judge Southwick would \n     have done in his dissent in a case in which the court \n     ruled 8-2 that the statute of limitations did not begin to \n     run until the plaintiff had reason to believe the \n     chemicals that she was exposed to caused her illness. \n     Gannon v. Mid-South X-Ray Co. 738 So. 2d 274 (Miss. Ct. \n     App. 1999).\n       His record as a judge, combined with Judge Southwick's own \n     words, raise questions about his ability to be a fair and \n     neutral arbiter of environment and other cases that involve \n     the interests of corporate defendants. Concerns about the \n     ability of a judicial nominee to be unbiased go to the heart \n     of the Senate's constitutional advice and consent role. We \n     urge you to carefully consider these concerns, raised by \n     Judge Southwick record, before voting on his proposed \n     nomination to a lifetime position on the Fifth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n         Doug Kendall, Executive Director, Community Rights \n           Counsel.\n         Glenn Sugameli, Senior Judicial Counsel, Earthjustice.\n         Dr. Brent Blackwelder, President, Friends of the Earth.\n         Pat Gallagher, Director, Environmental Law Program, \n           Sierra Club.\n         Dan Silver, Executive Director, Endangered Habitats \n           League.\n         Tracy Kuhns, Executive Director, Louisiana Bayoukeeper, \n           Inc.\n         Marylee M.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Specter: I write to express \n     the opposition of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law to \n     the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals. The Bazelon Center\n\n[[Page S13277]]\n\n     is a national nonprofit organization that advocates for the \n     rights of individuals with mental disabilities through \n     litigation, policy advocacy, education and training. The \n     Center previously expressed concern about the nomination; we \n     now feel it is appropriate to express our opposition.\n       Judge Southwick apparently holds a narrow view of federal \n     power that suggests that he would invalidate portions of \n     critical civil rights legislation if appointed. He has \n     characterized the Supreme Court as returning to the \n     ``scripture'' of the Constitution by striking down portions \n     of the Violence Against Women Act and Gun Free School Zones \n     Act, and hampering Congress's power to abrogate sovereign \n     immunity to protect Native Americans. Leslie Southwick, \n     Separation of Powers at the State Level, 72 Miss. L. J. 927, \n     930-31 (2003). Southwick also indicated his apparent support \n     for the ``Constitution in exile'' movement, a radical \n     ideology that would undo seventy years of Supreme Court \n     rulings, dramatically undermining the federal government's \n     power.\n       These issues are of paramount concern to the disability \n     community because the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \n     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) have been the targets \n     of repeated attacks on federalism grounds, and the \n     constitutionality of these laws has been hotly contested in \n     the federal courts.\n       Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit is especially \n     troubling because that court is already closely divided on \n     the constitutionality of disability rights legislation. See \n     Pace v. Bogalusa City School Bd., 325 F.3d 609 (5th Cir. \n     2003) (Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign \n     immunity in the IDEA), rev'd, 403 F.3d 272 (5th Cir. 2005) (5 \n     judges dissenting); McCarthy v. Hawkins, 481 F.3d 407 (5th \n     Cir. 2004) (upholding ADA's community integration mandate \n     against commerce clause challenge in divided vote); Neinast \n     v. Texas, 217 F.3d 275; (5th Cir. 2000) (Congress lacked \n     authority under Fourteenth Amendment Section 5 to enact the \n     ADA's bar on imposing handicapped parking placard surcharges \n     on individuals with disabilities). Southwick's addition to \n     the Fifth Circuit would increase the likelihood that critical \n     disability rights protections would be eliminated in that \n     Circuit.\n       This lifetime position should be held by someone who \n     respects Congress's authority to enact needed civil rights \n     protections, including protections for individuals with \n     disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Robert Bernstein,\n\n                                Executive Director, Bazelon Center\n     for Mental Health Law.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                                 October 22, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate may take up the \n     nomination of Mississippi Judge Leslie H. Southwick to the \n     5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The UAW urges you to oppose his \n     nomination and to vote against any attempt to invoke cloture \n     on this nomination.\n       Judge Southwick's record as a judge on the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals is deeply troubling. He has consistently \n     ruled against workers seeking compensation for injuries \n     suffered on the job. He has also opined that the ``employment \n     at will'' doctrine, which allows employers to fire workers \n     for any reasons, ``provides the best balance of the competing \n     interests in the normal employment situation.'' This raises \n     serious questions about his ability to enforce the National \n     Labor Relations Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and \n     other laws that protect employees in the workplace and limit \n     ``employment at will.''\n       Judge Southwick also joined the court's 5-4 decision in \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, \n     upholding the reinstatement of a state social worker who was \n     fired for using a despicable racial epithet in a \n     condescending reference to a co-worker. This decision reveals \n     a disturbing lack of understanding for the negative impact of \n     this language. In addition, a review of Judge Southwick's \n     decisions reveals a disturbing pattern in which he routinely \n     rejects defense claims regarding racially motivated \n     prosecutors who strike African-American jurors, but upholds \n     claims of prosecutors that defense attorneys are striking \n     white jurors on the basis of their race.\n       For all of these reasons, the UAW believes that Judge \n     Southwick's confirmation would endanger core worker and civil \n     rights protections. Accordingly, we urge you to vote against \n     his nomination and against any attempt to invoke cloture to \n     cut off debate on his nomination.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         The African-American Bar Association of Dallas, Texas,\n                                                     June 6, 2007.\n     Re nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States Court \n         of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The J.L. Turner Legal Association \n     (``JLTLA''), the premier organization for African-American \n     attorneys in Dallas, Texas, writes to register its opposition \n     to the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States \n     Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit. In so doing, we join \n     with Senator Barack Obama, the Magnolia Bar Association, the \n     Alliance for Justice and the National Employment Lawyers \n     Association, among others, in voicing concerns about Judge \n     Southwick's fitness for elevation to a lifetime appointment \n     to the federal appellate bench.\n       More significantly, the JLTLA is deeply disturbed by the \n     Bush Administration's consistent and highly objectionable \n     pattern of selecting ultra-conservative, non-diverse \n     candidates to serve on the most racially diverse federal \n     circuit in the country. The Fifth Circuit, comprised of \n     Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, is home to more African-\n     Americans than any other federal circuit, with the possible \n     exception of the Fourth Circuit. Only one African-American \n     judge, Carl Stewart, currently serves on the Fifth Circuit. \n     Bush has, moreover, nominated no African-Americans to the \n     Fifth Circuit. After Charles Pickering and Mike Wallace, \n     Judge Southwick's nomination could only very generously be \n     described as yet another ``slap in the face'' to the diverse \n     populations of the Fifth Circuit.\n       Further, this appointment reflects the Bush \n     Administration's clear disregard for the will of the American \n     people given the significantly dynamic change in Congress. \n     The dramatic outcome of the midterm Congressional election \n     signals that Americans are seeking a new landscape rather \n     than leaving an even more conservative footprint on what is \n     now one of the most conservative Circuits in the nation.\n       Historically, the Fifth Circuit served as the vanguard for \n     the advancement of civil and human rights, particularly with \n     regard to the implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court's \n     dictates following its historic ruling in Brown v. Board of \n     Education et al. The last 20 years, however, have marked a \n     notable retrenchment in the Fifth Circuit's commitment to \n     civil rights. Judge Southwick's elevation to the Fifth \n     Circuit would only strengthen the conservative leanings of \n     this Court, and further alienate the diverse citizens of this \n     Circuit.\n       We trust that you will call upon all of your colleagues on \n     the Judiciary Committee to reject this nomination, and call \n     on the President to select a consensus nominee that would \n     bring greater balance to the Fifth Circuit.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                           Vicki D. Blanton, Esq.,\n                                                 President, JLTLA.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few brief remarks on this \nnomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich serves the residents of Mississippi, Louisiana, and my State of \nTexas.\n  Judge Leslie Southwick has served for almost 12 years on the \nMississippi Court of Appeals where he has participated in thousands of \ncases in almost every area of State civil and criminal law. He is, by \nall accounts--notwithstanding some of the attacks by interest groups \nthat we have heard recounted here today--a respected member of that \ncourt and an honorable and decent man. Notably, he took a leave from \nthe bench to volunteer to serve his Nation in Iraq. I ask: What kind of \nman would give up a cushy job on the Mississippi Court of Appeals to \nput his life on the line in Iraq?\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously found Judge Southwick \n``well qualified'' to serve on the Fifth Circuit, which is the highest \nrating the American Bar Association gives. It is important to point out \nthat the American Bar Association investigates the background of these \nnominees, talks to litigants who appeared before them, talks to other \njudges and leaders of the legal community, and they have concluded that \ninstead of the comments we have heard today attacking the integrity of \nthis public servant, that he deserves the highest rating of the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  For whatever reason, this honorable public servant has been dragged \nthrough the mud in this confirmation proceeding and, in my opinion, has \nbeen slandered by some of his critics. Judge Southwick has been called \nan ``arch-reactionary,'' a ``neoconfederate,'' ``hostile to civil \nrights,'' everything but the word ``racist,'' although that has been \nimplied time and time again.\n  Judge Southwick's nomination was opposed by 9 of the 10 Democrats on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. But, to her credit, Mrs. Feinstein, the \nSenator from California, declined to be strong-armed by the interest \ngroups who are whipping up manufactured hysteria when it comes to \nopposing\n\n[[Page S13278]]\n\nthis nominee. Announcing that she found ``zero evidence to support the \ncharges against Judge Southwick,'' Senator Feinstein joined the nine \nRepublicans on the committee to advance the nomination to the Senate \nfloor.\n  What was never answered in the Judiciary Committee's debate over this \nnomination is why the same panel had, just a year earlier, unanimously \napproved him for a seat on the Federal District Court bench. I posed \nthis question to my colleagues during the Judiciary Committee debate:\n\n       If there is a concern out there that Judge Southwick is not \n     qualified because of some perceived racial problem, why in \n     the world would that opposition deem him acceptable to be a \n     Federal District Court judge?\n       Think about that a second. The discretion afforded a \n     District Court judge is so much greater than that on the \n     court of appeals--from the start of a trial, through voir \n     dire and juror strikes, through evidentiary rulings, and jury \n     instructions. I trust that my colleagues would never vote for \n     someone with a perceived race problem for life tenure in a \n     role with such enormous discretion. We all know that there \n     was no objection at the time he came before the committee for \n     a Federal District bench because, the fact is, the \n     allegations against him had been manufactured since that \n     time.\n\n  There is no legitimate concern about Judge Southwick's character or \nrecord. This is just the latest incarnation of the dangerous game being \nplayed with the reputations and lives of honorable public servants.\n  The Republican leader put it this way:\n\n       When do we stop for the sake of the institution, for the \n     sake of the country, and for the sake of the party that may \n     not currently occupy the White House? When do we stop?\n\n  The Washington Post's editorial page, along with the respected legal \naffairs columnist Stuart Taylor, both lamented the treatment afforded \nJudge Southwick who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate but hopefully \nwill be today. Stuart Taylor's column is appropriately titled \n``Shortsighted on Judges.'' He writes:\n\n       The long-term cost to the country is that bit by bit, \n     almost imperceptibly, more and more of the people who would \n     make the best judges--liberal and conservative alike--are \n     less and less willing to put themselves through the ever-\n     longer, ever-more-harrowing gauntlet that the confirmation \n     process has become.\n\n  The attacks on Judge Southwick, unfortunately, have come to typify \nthe kinds of vicious, gratuitous, personal attacks that are occurring \nwith greater frequency against judicial nominees.\n  I wonder if there is a Member of this body who doesn't think we need \nto improve the tone and rhetoric of the judicial confirmation process. \nWhen good men and women decline the opportunity to serve on the Federal \nbench out of disdain for this unnecessarily hostile process, the \nadministration of justice in this Nation can only be the worst for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a strong message today with this vote \nthat these unwarranted, baseless attacks on Leslie Southwick are \nbeneath the dignity of the Senate. At some point in time we have to \nstop it, and I can think of no better time than now with this \noutstanding public servant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after the Senator from Illinois speaks, I \nwould like to yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, our Nation witnessed one \nof the largest civil rights rallies in decades. It was a rally to \ncondemn hate crimes and racial disparities in our criminal justice \nsystem. It occurred in a town in Louisiana that most of us never heard \nof, Jena, LA. That small town captured the attention of America. Why? \nWell, because of an incident that occurred at a high school where there \nwas a tree that White students traditionally gathered under.\n  School officials came to the conclusion it was time that all students \ncould sit under the tree. In protest for that decision, White students \nhung nooses from the tree. Nooses, the ancient symbol of hatred and \nbigotry.\n  Well, that incident led to other incidents, fights between Black and \nWhite students at the school. Three White students who put the nooses \nin the tree were given a 3-day suspension from the school, a 3-day \nsuspension.\n  In contrast, the Jena district attorney, who was White, brought \ncriminal charges for attempted murder against six African-American \nteenagers, the so-called Jena 6.\n  If convicted on all the charges, the African-American students could \nhave served a combined total of more than 100 years in prison. One \nhundred years in prison for one group of students, a 3-day suspension \nfor others. It is no wonder this captured the attention of the Nation.\n  Squabbling, fighting among students, led to serious criminal charges \nfor some and a very slight reprimand for others. This is not the first \ntime America has faced this kind of disparity in justice. Sadly, it is \nnot likely to be the last. Some of us in my age group can recall the \nstruggles of the 1960s when civil rights became a national cause in \nAmerica, when all of us, Black, White, and brown, North and South, were \nforced to step back and take a look at the America we live in and make \na decision as to whether it would be a different country.\n  We look back now as we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday \nand observances with fond remembrance of that era. But I can remember \nthat era, too, as being one of violence and division in America. I can \nrecall when Dr. King decided to come to the Chicago area and lead a \nmarch. It was a painful, violent experience in a State I love.\n  I look back on it because I want to make it clear: discrimination is \nnot a Southern phenomena, it is an American phenomena. But in the \ncourse of the civil rights struggle in the 1960s, there were some real \nheroes, and one of them was a man I dearly love and served with in the \nHouse, John Lewis.\n  John Lewis, a young African-American student, decided to engage in \nsit-ins, and when that did not succeed, he moved on to the next level, \nthe freedom bus rides. He risked his life taking buses back and forth \nacross the South to establish the fact that all people, regardless of \ntheir color, should be given a chance.\n  And then, of course, the historic march in Selma. John Lewis was \nthere that day. I know because I returned to that town a few years ago \nwith him and he retraced his footsteps. He showed us how he walked over \nthat bridge as a young man. As he was coming down on the other side of \nthe bridge, he saw gathered in front of him a large group of Alabama \nState troopers. As they approached the troopers, the troopers turned on \nthe marchers and started beating them with clubs, including John.\n  John was beaten within an inch of his life, knocked unconscious. \nThank God he survived. I thought about that because I wanted to be \nthere at that Selma march. I was a student here in Washington at the \ntime and for some reason could not make it and have regretted it ever \nsince.\n  But as we were driving back from Selma, I recall that John Lewis said \nsomething to me which stuck. He said: You know, there was another hero \non that Selma march who does not get much attention; his name was Frank \nJohnson. Frank Johnson was a Federal district court judge and later a \nFederal circuit court judge in the Fifth Circuit, which at the time \nincluded the State of Alabama. John Lewis said: If it were not for the \ncourage of Frank Johnson, who gave us the permission to march, there \nnever would have been a march in Selma. Who knows what would have \nhappened to the civil rights movement.\n  Well, Frank Johnson is a man who has been celebrated in his career as \na jurist for his courage. He and his family faced death threats. They \nwere under constant guard for years because of the courageous decisions \nhe made that moved us forward in the civil rights movement.\n  I had a chance to meet with two prospective nominees to the Supreme \nCourt before their confirmations, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito. I gave both of them this book, ``Taming the Storm,'' written by \nJack Bass--which is a biography of Frank Johnson--hoping that in their \nbusy lives they might take the time to read these words about his \ncourage and his life and be inspired in their own responsibilities.\n  There are so many things that have been said and written about Frank \nJohnson's courage as a judge, a circuit judge in the same circuit we \nare considering today. One of them was written by a fellow who served \nin the Senate. I didn't have the chance to serve\n\n[[Page S13279]]\n\nwith him, but I heard so many wonderful things about him, Howell \nHeflin. Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama introduced a bill to name the \nU.S. courthouse in Montgomery, AL, for Frank Johnson, Jr.\n  This is what he said: Judge Johnson's courtroom has been a living \nsymbol of decency and fairness to all who come before his bench. It is \nfrom this courthouse that the term ``rule of law'' came to have true \nmeaning; it is from this courthouse that the term ``equal protection of \nthe law'' became a reality; and it is from this courthouse that the \nphrase ``equal justice under law'' was dispensed despite threats to his \npersonal life.\n  Frank Johnson, circuit judge, Fifth Circuit, had the courage to make \nhistory and the power to change America. It is a high standard, and it \nis not for all of us, whether you are a Member of the Senate or seek to \nbe on the Federal judiciary.\n  It is particularly an important standard to consider with the \nnomination of Leslie Southwick. There are so many good things to say \nabout Leslie Southwick, if you read his biography, things he has done \nin his military service, his service in many respects.\n  But he is asking to serve on Frank Johnson's circuit court, the Fifth \nCircuit. I guess many of us believe it is a particularly important \ncircuit for the same reason it was in the time of Frank Johnson.\n  That Fifth Circuit is still a crucible for civil rights. That Fifth \nCircuit contains Jena, LA. That is a circuit which many times has been \ncalled upon to make important historic decisions about fairness and \nequality in America.\n  So, yes, I know we ask more of the nominees for that circuit. We know \nit has a higher minority population than any other circuit in America. \nWe know the State of Mississippi, the home of Leslie Southwick, has the \nhighest percentage of African Americans.\n  Yesterday, the Congressional Black Caucus came to meet with the \nSenate leadership. It is rare that they do that. Congresswomen Carolyn \nKilpatrick and Eleanor Holmes Norton and others came to speak to us.\n  The depth of emotion in their presentation is something that touched \nus all. Members of the Senate who have been through a lot of debates \nand a lot of nominations, many of them were misty-eyed in responding to \nthe feelings, the deep-felt feelings of these African-American \nCongresswomen about this nomination.\n  Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the only Black Congressman from that \ndelegation, talked about what this meant to him, how important it was \nto have someone who could start to heal the wounds of racism and \ndivision in the State he lived in. It touched every single one of us.\n  I asked Leslie Southwick a question at his nomination hearing under \noath; it was as open-ended as I could make it. I asked him:\n\n       Can you think of a time in your life or career where you \n     did bend in that direction, to take an unpopular point of \n     view on behalf of those who were voiceless or powerless and \n     needed someone to stand up for their rights when it wasn't a \n     popular position?\n\n  Judge Southwick responded:\n\n       I hope that a careful look--and the answer is, no, I cannot \n     think of something now. But if I can give you this answer. I \n     cannot recall my opinions, and I don't think of them in those \n     terms.\n\n  By every standard that was a softball question. I asked this man to \nreflect on his personal and professional life and talk about a Frank \nJohnson moment, when he stood up to do something that was unpopular but \nright for someone who did not have the power in his courtroom.\n  I even sent him a followup written question because I wanted to be \nfair about this. And he still could not come up with anything. It is \ntroubling. I hope that if the Senate rejects this nomination, the \nSenators in the Fifth Circuit, particularly from Mississippi, will \nbring us a nominee for this circuit who can start to heal the wounds, \nwho can bring us back together, who can give hope to the minorities and \ndispossessed in that circuit that they will get a fair shake if their \ncases come to court.\n  I hope they can reach back and find us a Frank Johnson, someone in \nthat mold, someone who can answer that open-ended question in a very \npositive way.\n  Today, I will vote against cloture and oppose the nomination of \nLeslie Southwick.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 45 minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona. I will yield 10 minutes jointly to the senior Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, and Senator Graham, which will come in sequence \nafter we alternate with the Democrats.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nSchumer of New York wishes to be recognized for 10 minutes at 10 \no'clock, which just about coincides with what the Senator from \nPennsylvania has indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Southwick. There \nis no question that the nominee is qualified to serve. I do not need to \nrepeat his qualifications. Senators Specter and Feinstein did that very \nwell last night. There is no question that he has had an impressive \nlife of service.\n  Nobody can question the service of a man who joins the Army Reserves \nat age 42 and then requests duty in a war zone when he is past the age \nof 50. I will suggest, by the way, that might have been a good answer \nto the question that Senator Durbin proposed a moment ago. His life is \na life of service, and I believe we should honor him for that.\n  There is no question the Nation would be well served by his service \non the bench. There is also no question the questions about him have \nbeen contrived, and there is no question there is more at stake today \nthan the confirmation of Judge Leslie Southwick.\n  My colleagues should think long and hard about voting against cloture \nand about what has happened to this nomination. Until the year 2003, no \ncircuit court nominee has been denied confirmation in this body due to \na filibuster. Only Abe Fortas faced a real filibuster attempt, and \nobviously he had ethics issues which caused him to withdraw after it \nwas clear he lacked even majority support.\n  Since that time, the convention throughout the 1970s and 1980s and \n1990s was to reject this path of filibustering nominees. Senators did \nnot like some nominees, but they did not require cloture. When a few \nSenators tried to impose a cloture standard, the Senate united, on a \nbipartisan basis, to reject that 60-vote standard.\n  In fact, then-Majority Leader Lott and then-Judiciary Chairman Hatch \nled the fight against requiring cloture in 2000 when we voted on \nClinton nominees Paez and Berzon. The vast majority of Republicans \nrejected any filibuster of judicial nominees.\n  But in 2003 things began to change. Liberal activist groups pursued \nmany Democrats to apply a different standard. From 2003 to 2005, \nDemocrats actively filibustered several nominees.\n       I recall the Senator from Nevada saying: ``This is a \n     filibuster.''\n  Well, it was a brandnew world, and many realized it was not good. A \ngroup of Senators, seven from both parties, got together and worked out \nan arrangement which would preclude this from happening in the future \nbecause it was not good and was setting a very bad precedent in the \nSenate.\n  In 2005, most of the people on both sides of the aisle backed down \nfrom this precipice and the Democrats agreed that in light of the \nopposition to what they had been doing, their obstructionism, that they \nwould no longer do that.\n  Unfortunately, today we are seeing a rise, a rejuvenation of those \nearlier efforts. It strikes me as exceedingly shortsighted and needs to \nstop. Senator Feinstein's thoughtful speech last night set the \nstandard.\n  She concluded the speech with the following words, relating to Judge \nSouthwick:\n\n       He is not outside the judicial mainstream. That's the \n     primary criterion I use when evaluating an appellate \n     nominee. And I expect future nominees of Democratic \n     Presidents to be treated the same way.\n\n  Well, that is the real question, Mr. President: Will Senator \nFeinstein's expectation become the reality? I wish I could say yes, but \nit may not occur that way if cloture is not granted to\n\n[[Page S13280]]\n\nJudge Southwick, and that is the larger question.\n  Until now, my Republican colleagues and I have been clear that we \nthink judicial filibusters are inappropriate. I suggest today's vote is \na watershed. If Senate Democrats decide to filibuster Judge Southwick \ntoday, a clearly qualified nominee, they should not be surprised if \nthey see similar treatment for Democratic nominees. This cannot be a \none-sided standard. So this isn't just a vote about Judge Southwick; it \nis about the future of the judicial nomination process. If Leslie \nSouthwick can't get an up-or-down vote, then I suspect no Senator \nshould expect a future Democratic or Republican President to be able to \ncount on their nominees not to be treated in the same fashion. Any \nlittle bit of controversy could be created to create the kind of \nhurdles Judge Southwick is facing today.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Feinstein have made clear there is \nnothing to these supposed controversies that have been generated around \nLeslie Southwick. They are largely inventions of the activist left and \ndon't hold up in the light of scrutiny.\n  So what of the future? If a Republican wants to block a Democratic \nPresident's nominee, all one would need would be the allegation of a \ncontroversy. Pick out a case. Raise questions about motivation. Ignore \nthe plain language of a court opinion. Speculate. Ignore the man's \ncharacter.\n  The Senator from Illinois spoke movingly a little while ago about \ncivil rights, John Lewis, Frank Johnson, Martin Luther King, all of \nwhich are very important to any debate, but very little of Leslie \nSouthwick--no evidence that he would not apply the same standard in \njudging civil rights matters, just an insinuation because he didn't \nanswer a question about whether he had ever done something unpopular \nbut right. Well, that is not a disqualification from serving on the \ncourt.\n  So think about the nominees whom you might want to recommend. Could \nan activist group gin up a controversy about your nominee? Is there \nanything in his or her past that could be misconstrued, distorted, or \npainted in an unfair light?\n  Senator Feinstein asked for a system in which we simply asked whether \nnominees are in the mainstream and, obviously, are they qualified? She \nasks that we apply that standard in the future. That is the standard we \nshould be applying on both sides. But if things go badly today and \nJudge Southwick is treated as poorly as he has been treated so far, \nthen I would have to say that nobody can count on what that standard \ncould be in the future.\n  Vote for cloture today, my friends, because Judge Southwick is an \nAmerican patriot who has devoted his life to service. Vote for cloture \nbecause he is qualified to serve on the bench. But if that isn't \nenough, vote for cloture to save future nominees from the same kind of \nproblem that has been attendant to this nominee and the potential that \na different standard will be applied in the future with respect to \nconfirming our nominees. That would take us down the wrong path.\n  Senator Feinstein is right. We should confirm this nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have a brief unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senator from Arizona has given me the courtesy of \npropounding before he speaks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of opposition from People For the American Way, the West Texas \nEmployment Lawyers Association, the National Gay and Lesbian Task \nForce, and the National Council of Jewish Women.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  People for the American Way,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 30, 2007.\n     Re Leslie Southwick.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Specter: I am writing on \n     behalf of People For the American Way and our more than \n     1,000,000 members and supporters nationwide to express our \n     strong opposition to the confirmation of Mississippi lawyer \n     and former state court judge Leslie Southwick to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Apart from the \n     fact that much of Judge Southwick's record has not yet been \n     provided to the Committee for its consideration, what is \n     known of that record is disturbing, particularly in \n     connection with the rights of African Americans, gay \n     Americans, and workers. Moreover, given that the states \n     within the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit (Mississippi, \n     Louisiana, and Texas) have the highest percentage of \n     minorities in the country, we deem it of great significance \n     that the NAACP of Mississippi and the Congressional Black \n     Caucus are among those opposing Southwick's confirmation.\n       As you know, Judge Southwick has been nominated by \n     President Bush to fill a seat on the Fifth Circuit that the \n     President has previously attempted to fill with Charles \n     Pickering and then with Michael Wallace, both of whose \n     nominations were met with substantial opposition, in large \n     measure because of their disturbing records on civil rights. \n     As you will recall, on May 8, 2007, jointly with the Human \n     Rights Campaign (which has since announced its opposition to \n     Southwick's confirmation), we sent the Committee a letter \n     expressing our very serious concerns about Judge Southwick's \n     nomination, observing that, once again, President Bush had \n     chosen a nominee for this seat who appeared to have a \n     problematic record on civil rights. In particular, our letter \n     discussed in detail the troubling decisions that Judge \n     Southwick had joined in two cases raising matters of \n     individual rights that strongly suggested he may lack the \n     commitment to social justice progress to which Americans are \n     entitled from those seeking a lifetime appointment to the \n     federal bench. Those decisions take on added significance \n     because the intermediate state appellate court on which Judge \n     Southwick sat does not routinely consider the types of \n     federal constitutional and civil rights matters that would \n     shed a great deal of light on a judge's legal philosophy \n     concerning these critical issues. As further discussed below, \n     Judge Southwick's confirmation hearing on May 10 did not \n     allay the concerns raised by these decisions or by other \n     aspects of his record.\n       In one of the cases discussed in our earlier letter, \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Service, 1998 \n     Miss. App. LEXIS 637 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), reversed, 745 So. \n     2d 254 (Miss. 1999), Judge Southwick joined the majority in a \n     5-4 ruling that upheld the reinstatement with back pay of a \n     white state employee who had been fired for calling an \n     African American co-worker a ``good ole nigger.'' The \n     decision that Judge Southwick joined effectively ratified a \n     hearing officer's opinion that the worker's use of the racial \n     slur ``was in effect calling the individual a `teachers \n     pet'.'' 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 637, at *19. The hearing \n     officer considered the word ``nigger'' to be only ``somewhat \n     derogatory,'' felt that the employer (the Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services no less) had ``overreacted'' in \n     firing the worker, and was concerned that other employees \n     might seek relief if they were called ``a honkie or a good \n     old boy or Uncle Tom or chubby or fat or slim.'' Id. at *22-\n     23.\n       Four of Judge Southwick's colleagues dissented. Two would \n     have upheld the decision by DHS to fire the worker. Two \n     others, also joined by one of the other dissenters, objected \n     to the Employee Appeals Board's failure to impose any \n     sanctions at all on the worker, noting a ``strong presumption \n     that some penalty should have been imposed.'' Id. at *18. The \n     three judges issued a separate dissent and would have \n     remanded the case so that the board could impose ``an \n     appropriate penalty or produce detailed findings as to why \n     no penalty should be imposed.'' Id. at *18. Significantly, \n     Judge Southwick chose not even to join this three-judge \n     dissent that would have remanded the case so that some \n     disciplinary action short of firing the worker could have \n     been imposed on her for having referred to a co-worker by \n     a gross racial slur, ``in a meeting with two of the top \n     executives of DHS.'' Id. at *28.\n       As we discussed in our earlier letter, the Mississippi \n     Supreme Court unanimously reversed the ruling that Southwick \n     had joined. The Supreme Court majority ordered that the case \n     be sent back to the appeals board to impose a penalty other \n     than termination or to make detailed findings as to why no \n     penalty should be imposed--the position taken by three of \n     Judge Southwick's colleagues. Some of the justices on the \n     Supreme Court would have gone even further and reinstated the \n     decision by DHS to fire the worker. But all of the Supreme \n     Court justices rejected the view of the Court of Appeals \n     majority (which included Southwick) that the board had not \n     erred in ordering the worker's reinstatement without \n     imposition of any disciplinary action.\n       In the second case that we discussed in our May 8 letter, \n     S.B. v. L.W., 793 So. 2d 656 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001), Judge \n     Southwick joined the majority in upholding--over a strong \n     dissent--a chancellor's ruling taking an eight-year-old girl \n     away from her bisexual mother and awarding custody of the \n     child to her father (who had never married her mother), in \n     large measure because the mother was living with another \n     woman in ``a lesbian home.'' In addition to the disturbing \n     substance of the majority's ruling, its language is also \n     troubling, and refers repeatedly to what it calls the \n     mother's ``homosexual lifestyle'' and her ``lesbian \n     lifestyle.''\n       Judge Southwick not only joined the majority opinion \n     upholding the chancellor's ruling, but alone among all the \n     other judges in\n\n[[Page S13281]]\n\n     the majority, he joined a concurrence by Judge Payne that was \n     not only gratuitous, but gratuitously anti-gay. As we have \n     previously observed, the concurrence appears to have been \n     written for the sole purpose of underscoring and defending \n     Mississippi's hostility toward gay people and what it calls \n     ``the practice of homosexuality'' (id. at 662), in response \n     to the position of the dissenters that the chancellor had \n     erred. (The word gay is not used; the concurrence refers \n     repeatedly to ``homosexuals'' and ``homosexual persons.'') \n     Among other things, the concurrence suggests that sexual \n     orientation is a choice, and explicitly states that while \n     ``any adult may choose any activity in which to engage,'' \n     that person ``is not thereby relieved of the consequences of \n     his or her choice.'' Id. at 663. In other words, according to \n     Judge Southwick, one consequence of being a gay man or a \n     lesbian is possibly losing custody of one's child.\n       In addition, and as we noted in our May 8 letter, the \n     concurrence claimed that ``[u]nder the principles of \n     Federalism, each state is permitted to set forth its own \n     public policy guidelines through legislative enactments and \n     through judicial renderings. Our State has spoken on its \n     position regarding rights of homosexuals in domestic \n     situations.'' Id, at 664. Thus, according to the separate \n     concurrence that Southwick chose to join, the states' rights \n     doctrine gave Mississippi the right to treat gay people as \n     second-class citizens and criminals. The views expressed in \n     this concurrence strongly suggest that Judge Southwick is \n     hostile to the notion that gay men and lesbians are entitled \n     to equal treatment under the law.\n       Unfortunately, Judge Southwick's testimony at his May 10 \n     hearing and his response to post-hearing written questions \n     did not resolve and in fact underscored the very serious \n     concerns that we and others had raised about his record and \n     in particular his decisions in these cases. For example, in \n     response to Senator Kennedy's post-hearing question about \n     why, in the Richmond case, Judge Southwick had ``accept[ed] \n     the employee's claim that [the racial slur] was not \n     derogatory,'' Judge Southwick stated that while the word is \n     derogatory, ``there was some evidence that [the worker] had \n     not been motivated by hatred or by animosity to an entire \n     race,'' and further stated that the opinion he joined had \n     recounted evidence that the employee's use of the racial slur \n     ``was not motivated by a desire to offend.'' Judge \n     Southwick's answers reflect far too cramped an appreciation \n     of the magnitude of the use of this gross racial slur \n     anywhere, let alone to refer to a co-worker in Mississippi.\n       Senator Kennedy also asked Judge Southwick why, ``[e]ven if \n     you did not think a worker should be fired for using a racial \n     slur--why not at least let the employer impose some form of \n     discipline?'' Southwick replied that ``[n]either party \n     requested that any punishment other than termination be \n     considered.'' However, as noted above, three of Judge \n     Southwick's dissenting colleagues and the state Supreme Court \n     found no impediment to concluding that even if termination \n     were not warranted by the use of this offensive racial slur, \n     the case should have been sent back so that some form of \n     lesser punishment could be considered.\n       The custody case was also the subject of much questioning \n     at Judge Southwick's hearing and in post-hearing questions. \n     When Judge Southwick was asked at his hearing about his \n     decision to uphold the chancellor's ruling to deprive the \n     mother of custody of her daughter, in large measure because \n     of her sexual orientation, Judge Southwick repeatedly \n     insisted that a parent's ``morality'' was a relevant factor \n     in a Mississippi custody case, the clear implication being \n     that Southwick considers gay men and lesbians to be immoral. \n     And he also observed that Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 \n     (1986), upholding anti-gay ``sodomy'' laws, was then good law \n     (not yet having been overturned by the Supreme Court in \n     Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)).\n       However, when Senator Durbin in his post-hearing questions \n     expressly asked Judge Southwick whether he would have voted \n     with the majority or the dissent in Lawrence (which, as \n     noted, overruled Bowers), Judge Southwick did not answer this \n     question, instead giving what appears to have become the rote \n     answer of all nominees to lower courts--that if confirmed \n     they will be ``bound to'' and will follow precedent. \n     Particularly in light of Judge Southwick's reliance on the \n     much-discredited and since overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, his \n     refusal to answer Senator Durbin's question is quite \n     disturbing, and further calls into question whether he can \n     apply the law fairly to all Americans.\n       Judge Southwick's decisions in Richmond and in S.B. raise \n     enormous red flags about his legal views. These are the types \n     of cases that draw back the curtains to reveal critical \n     aspects of a judge's legal philosophy and ideology. We simply \n     cannot conceive of any situation in which calling an African \n     American by the racial slur used in the Richmond case would \n     be akin to calling her ``a teacher's pet,'' and we cannot \n     fathom describing that slur as only ``somewhat'' derogatory, \n     as the hearing officer did in an opinion essentially ratified \n     by Judge Southwick. As America's recent experience with the \n     racially offensive remarks leveled at the young women of the \n     Rutgers University basketball team has shown, most of our \n     country has progressed beyond racial slurs and recognizes the \n     right of every individual to be treated with dignity \n     regardless of race.\n       And we agree with the Human Rights Campaign, which stated \n     in its May 23, 2007 letter to the Committee opposing Judge \n     Southwick's confirmation, that if Judge Southwick ``believes \n     that losing a child is an acceptable `consequence' of being \n     gay, [he] cannot be given the responsibility to protect the \n     basic rights of gay and lesbian Americans.'' Every American, \n     regardless of his or her sexual orientation, should likewise \n     be accorded equality of treatment and dignity under the law.\n       Unfortunately, Judge Southwick's decisions in Richmond and \n     S.B. call into serious question his understanding of and \n     commitment to these fundamental principles. Moreover, these \n     decisions are far from the only troubling aspects of his \n     record. As the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP has \n     observed in connection with Judge Southwick's rulings on race \n     discrimination in jury selection, ``[d]ozens of such cases \n     reveal a pattern by which Southwick rejects claims that the \n     prosecution was racially motivated in striking African-\n     American jurors while upholding claims that the defense \n     struck white jurors on the basis of their race.'' Indeed, in \n     one such case, three other judges on Southwick's court \n     harshly criticized him in a dissent, accusing the majority \n     opinion written by Southwick of ``establishing one level of \n     obligation for the State, and a higher one for defendants on \n     an identical issue.'' Bumphis v. State, No. 93-KA-01157 COA \n     (Miss. Ct. App., July 2, 1996).\n       During his time on the state court of appeals, Judge \n     Southwick also compiled a strikingly pro-business record in \n     divided rulings. According to an analysis by the Alliance for \n     Justice, ``Judge Southwick voted, in whole or in part, \n     against the injured party and in favor of special interests, \n     such as corporations or insurance companies, in 160 out of \n     180 published decisions involving state employment law and \n     torts cases in which at least one judge dissented. In 2004, a \n     business advocacy group gave Judge Southwick the highest \n     rating of any judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, \n     based on his votes in cases involving liability issues.\n       In one case heard by his court involving an alleged breach \n     of an employment contract, Judge Southwick went out of his \n     way in a dissenting opinion to praise the doctrine of \n     employment-at-will, which allows an employer to fire an \n     employee for virtually any reason. Despite the fact that \n     neither the existence nor merits of the at-will doctrine were \n     at issue in the case, Judge Southwick wrote, ``I find that \n     employment at will, for whatever flaws a specific application \n     may cause, is not only the law of Mississippi but it provides \n     the best balance of the competing interests in the normal \n     employment situation. It has often been said about democracy, \n     that it does not provide a perfect system of government, but \n     just a better one than everything else that has ever been \n     suggested. An equivalent view might be seen as the \n     justification for employment at will.''\n       Dubard v. Biloxi H.M.A., 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 468, at *16 \n     (Miss. Ct. App. 1999), rev'd 778 So. 2d 113, 114 (Miss. \n     2000). The National Employment Lawyers Association has cited \n     this case in particular in explaining its opposition to Judge \n     Southwick's confirmation. According to NELA, ``[t]hat Mr. \n     Southwick would use the case as a platform to propound his \n     views, rather than as a vehicle to interpret laws is \n     problematic and suggests that he may be unable to separate \n     his own views from his judicial duty to follow the law.'' \n     Indeed, when asked about this case at his May 10 hearing, \n     Judge Southwick admitted that he had put his personal \n     ``policy'' views into a decision, but claimed to regret \n     having done so.\n       Finally, we note that not all of Judge Southwick's record \n     has been provided to the Committee, including more than two \n     years' worth of unpublished decisions by the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals in cases on which he voted but in which he \n     did not write an opinion. As the Richmond and S.B. cases \n     underscore, the opinions that a judge chooses to join, or \n     elects not to, can be just as revealing of his judicial \n     philosophy as those that he writes. Particularly given what \n     is known about Judge Southwick's record, the notion of \n     proceeding with his nomination on less than a full record \n     would be grossly irresponsible.\n       With a lifetime position on what is essentially the court \n     of last resort for most Americans at stake, Judge Southwick \n     has failed to meet the heavy burden of showing that he is \n     qualified to fill it. The risks are simply too great to put \n     someone with Judge Southwick's legal views on a federal Court \n     of Appeals for life.\n       In this regard, we were particularly struck by a very \n     telling moment at Judge Southwick's May 10 hearing. Senator \n     Durbin, in questioning Judge Southwick, noted the great \n     personal courage of federal Judge Frank Johnson of Alabama, \n     whose landmark civil rights rulings were so critical to \n     advancing the legal rights of African Americans in the south. \n     Senator Durbin then asked Southwick, looking back on his \n     career in public service, to cite an instance in which he had \n     ``stepped out'' and taken an unpopular view on behalf of \n     minorities. Judge Southwick could not identify one single \n     instance in response to this question, even when Senator \n     Durbin asked it a second time.\n       As more than 200 law professors wrote to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in July 2001, no federal judicial nominee \n     is presumptively entitled to confirmation. Because federal \n     judicial appointments are for life and significantly affect \n     the rights of all Americans, and because of the Senate's co-\n     equal\n\n[[Page S13282]]\n\n     role with the President in the confirmation process, nominees \n     must demonstrate that they meet the appropriate criteria. \n     These include not only an ``exemplary record in the law,'' \n     but also a ``commitment to protecting the rights of ordinary \n     Americans,'' and a ``record of commitment to the progress \n     made on civil rights, women's rights, and individual \n     liberties.'' Judge Southwick has failed to meet his burden of \n     showing that he should be confirmed.\n       We had hoped that after the failed nominations of Charles \n     Pickering and Michael Wallace, the President would nominate \n     someone for this lifetime judicial position in the tradition \n     of Frank Johnson, or at the least someone whose record did \n     not reflect resistance to social justice progress in this \n     country. Unfortunately, the President has not done so. We \n     therefore strongly urge the Judiciary Committee to reject \n     Leslie Southwick's confirmation to the Fifth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ralph G.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write on behalf of the West Texas \n     Employment Lawyers' Association. Collectively, the members of \n     our group have represented thousands of employees, workers \n     and average folk in matters ranging from employers' failures \n     to pay our clients a minimum wage for work performed, sexual \n     harassment claims, as well as age, race, disability and sex \n     discrimination claims. We routinely practice in front of the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and we are very proud of the \n     work we perform on behalf of the hardworking men and women of \n     our nation, vindicating their right to be free from \n     discrimination.\n       As an organization, we felt it necessary to go on record to \n     oppose Leslie Southwick's nomination to the Fifth Circuit. \n     Please oppose the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Fifth \n     Circuit. As civil rights and employment discrimination \n     lawyers, it is our humble opinion that Leslie Southwick would \n     do grievous and long-term harm to ordinary workers, and \n     normal Americans whose last names are not ``Inc.'' or ``Ins. \n     Co.''\n       Please, for the sake of our civil liberties and the average \n     working American, do all in your power to prevent Leslie \n     Southwick's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Enrique Chavez, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Gay and Lesbian\n\n\n                                                   Task Force,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2007.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Specter: On behalf of the \n     National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Inc. a non-partisan \n     civil rights and advocacy group organizing nationwide to \n     secure lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) \n     equality, I urge you to oppose the nomination of Leslie \n     Southwick to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit. Judge Southwick has a disturbing record on LGBT \n     rights. His statements during his confirmation hearing and \n     written responses do not allay our concerns about how he \n     would approach cases involving the rights of gay, lesbian, \n     bisexual, and transgender Americans.\n       While on the Mississippi Court of Appeals, Judge Southwick \n     joined an opinion removing an eight-year-old child from the \n     custody of her mother, citing in part that the mother had a \n     lesbian home. This decision was based on a negative \n     perception about the sexual orientation of the biological \n     mother and ignored findings by the American Psychological \n     Association, along with every other credible psychological \n     and child welfare group that lesbian and gay people are \n     equally successful parents as their heterosexual \n     counterparts.\n       Further, Judge Southwick was the only judge in the majority \n     to join a deeply troubling concurrence written by Judge \n     Payne. The concurrence asserts that sexual orientation is a \n     choice and an individual who makes that choice must accept \n     the negative consequences, including loss of custody. This \n     statement underscores Judge Southwick's disregard for \n     commonly accepted psychiatric and social science conclusions \n     that sexual orientation is not a choice. Regardless, it also \n     demonstrates Judge Southwick's callous disregard for the \n     rights of LGBT families.\n       A nominee to the federal bench bears the burden of \n     demonstrating a commitment to rigorously enforce the \n     principles of equal protection and due process for all \n     Americans. The judicial record of Judge Southwick makes clear \n     that he cannot meet that burden. It also makes clear that the \n     individual and equal protection rights of LGBT families would \n     be in real jeopardy if he were confirmed.\n       We therefore oppose his nomination and request that you \n     vote against his confirmation. It would be unconscionable for \n     this Senate to confirm any judge who has illustrated such a \n     clear anti-LGBT bias to a lifetime seat on the federal bench.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Matt Foreman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Council of Jewish Women,\n\n                                       New York, NY, June 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the 90,000 members and \n     supporters of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), I \n     am writing to urge the Judiciary Committee to reject the \n     nomination of Judge Leslie H. Southwick to the 5th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. Much of Judge Southwick's record remains \n     unknown because the opinions in which he concurred were \n     rarely published, but what we do know is deeply troubling. It \n     does not appear that Judge Southwick will uphold federal law, \n     including laws against discrimination on the basis of race, \n     sex, national origin, and religion.\n       To the contrary. Judge Southwick joined a majority of the \n     Mississippi appeals court in ruling that a state employee's \n     dismissal for referring to a co-worker as ``a good ole \n     n****'' was unwarranted, a ruling unanimously reversed by the \n     Mississippi Supreme Court. In another case Judge Southwick \n     wrote a concurring opinion positing that a ``homosexual \n     lifestyle'' could be used to deprive a parent of custody of \n     her own child.\n       Historically, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has served \n     as a bulwark for the protection of civil rights. Sadly in \n     recent years that record has evaporated. President Bush has \n     twice nominated candidates perceived to be hostile to civil \n     rights that fortunately were never confirmed. Judge Southwick \n     appears to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor \n     nominees in his apparent hostility to civil rights. It is \n     also disappointing that President Bush again failed to take \n     advantage of an opportunity to appoint an African American \n     lawyer to the Mississippi seat on the 5th Circuit Court.\n       The Judiciary Committee's hearing of May 10, 2007, did not \n     reverse the clear impression that Judge Southwick is unable \n     to serve as an impartial judge on the 5th circuit, and much \n     of his record still remains unavailable for analysis. The \n     committee should reject his nomination and urge the President \n     to submit a consensus nominee committed to respect for \n     fundamental constitutional rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Phyllis Snyder,\n                                                   NCJW President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will vote today on \nJudge Southwick's nomination. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nvoting to confirm this dedicated public servant and courageous soldier.\n  Judge Southwick has many impressive credentials. Most impressive to \nme and most revealing of his character is his military service. In \n1992, almost 20 years after graduating from law school, Judge Southwick \ninterrupted his successful career as an attorney in private practice \nand obtained an age waiver to join the U.S. Army Reserves Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps. Ten years later, at age 53, Judge Southwick \nvolunteered to transfer to the 155th Brigade Combat Team of the \nMississippi National Guard, a line combat unit that was deployed to \nIraq in 2005. Judge Southwick's decision to join the Army is a model of \nself-sacrifice, and his actions helped to provide equal justice not \nonly to American soldiers but also to the numerous Iraqi civilians \nwhose cases he heard while he was stationed in Iraq. That is the kind \nof service this individual has provided to his country.\n  Most disappointing is that some Members of the Senate have questioned \nJudge Southwick's character by stating that ``He has an inclination \ntoward intolerance and insensitivity.'' That is an interesting criteria \nthat we should set for the confirmation of judges.\n  It is interesting that we are now going to have, for the first time \nin a long time, a requirement for 60 votes to move forward. As my \ncolleagues might recall, a couple of years ago there was a proposal \nfrom some on this side of the aisle and some others that we should \nchange the rules of the Senate so that only 51 votes would be necessary \nto confirm a nominee. At that time, I opposed that idea because I \nthought that it would then put us on a slippery slope to other \nrequirements, other further erosion of the 60 votes upon which this \nbody operates and which separates us from the House of Representatives. \nSo a group of us, who were given the nickname of the ``Gang of 14,'' \ngot together and agreed that we would not filibuster or require 60 \nvotes unless there were ``extraordinary circumstances.'' As a result of \nthat, Justices Roberts, Alito, and many other judges were confirmed by \nthis body.\n  I think it is pretty obvious that agreement has broken down. I would\n\n[[Page S13283]]\n\nlike to remind my colleagues that not that many years ago the benefit \nof the doubt went to the President and his nominees and that elections \nhave consequences. Among those consequences are the appointments of \njudges--in some respects, perhaps the most important consequence of \nelections because, as we all know, these are lifetime appointments, and \nsome of us on the conservative side have viewed over the years \nlegislating from the bench in certain kinds of judicial activism as \nvery harmful not only to our principles and philosophy and our view of \nthe role of Government and the various branches of Government but the \neffects of some of that judicial activism.\n  So here we are now with a person who is clearly qualified, served in \nthe military, and is now being accused of perhaps having an \n``inclination toward intolerance or insensitivity.'' I can assure my \ncolleagues there are some people living in Iraq today who don't believe \nJudge Southwick has an inclination toward intolerance and \ninsensitivity. In fact, he has earned their gratitude for his efforts \nin installing the fundamental effects of democracy, and that is the \nrule of law.\n  I hope, Mr. President, once we get this over with, perhaps we can sit \ndown again, Republicans and Democrats alike, and try to have a process \nwhere we could move forward with these judicial nominations. As we \nknow, there are more vacancies every day. And I would even agree to \ngive them a pay raise, which they seem to feel is rather important.\n  This is an important decision right now, which I think is larger than \njust the future of this good and decent man. Will others who want to \nserve on the bench be motivated to serve or not serve as they watch \nthis process where someone accused of an inclination toward intolerance \nand insensitivity seems to be a new criteria?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to echo the sentiments of \nSenator McCain and add my two cents' worth to this debate. In this \nregard, there will be some good news today. I anticipate that this fine \nman will have a vote on the floor of the Senate, that the cloture \nmotion will pass, and we will allow an up-or-down vote and he will get \nconfirmed.\n  To my two colleagues from Mississippi: Well done. You have sent to \nthe Senate an unusually well-qualified candidate by any standard you \nwould like to apply to a person in terms of his humanity, his \nintellect, and his judicial demeanor. It is one of the best selections \nI have had the privilege of reviewing since I have been in the Senate.\n  The unfortunate news is that we are having to go through this \nparticular exercise to get 60 votes. Quite frankly, I think the \naccusations being made against Judge Southwick are unfounded and just \npolitical garbage, to be honest with you.\n  He has received the highest qualified rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. Everyone who has ever served with Judge Southwick, in any \ncapacity, whether it be as a judge, a lawyer, or private citizen, has \nnothing but glowing things to say about the man. And really, we are \ntrying to use two legal events to cast doubt over the man. Six hundred \ncases he has sat in judgment upon, and the American Bar Association has \nreviewed all these cases, I would assume, and come to the conclusion \nthat he is at their highest level in terms of judicial qualification.\n  Judge Southwick has done things as a person that have really been \nbeneficial to Mississippi. He has tried to bring out the best in \nMississippi. These are the types of people you would hope to represent \nthe State of Mississippi--or any other State, for that matter--in terms \nof their demeanor, their tolerance, their willingness to work together \nwith all groups to move their State forward.\n\n  Now, the two cases in question are just complete garbage--the idea \nthat the term ``homosexual lifestyle'' was used in an opinion that he \nconcurred in involving a custody case. That term, if you research it in \nthe law, has been used in hundreds of different cases--over 100 cases. \nPresident Clinton mentioned it in 1993 when he was talking about his \npolicy regarding the military. It is a term that was used in the \nMississippi court cases that were the precedent for the case involved. \nAnd to say that he concurred in an opinion where the authoring judge \nused that term has somehow tainted him means you better go through the \nrecords and throw a bunch of judges off, Democrats and Republicans. \nThat is ridiculous, completely ridiculous, and if applied in any fair \nway would just be--it would be chaos. You would have politicians, you \nwould have judges, you would have people from all over the country who \nsomehow, because of that term having been used in a judicial opinion, \ncouldn't sit in judgment of others. That is ridiculous. Just go search \nthe record of how this term has been used. To suggest that it means \nsomething in Judge Southwick's case but no one else's has a lot to say \nabout this body, not Judge Southwick.\n  Now, the other case, he was sitting in judgment of an administrative \nboard that decided not to dismiss an employee who used a racial slur in \nthe workplace. To suggest that by somehow giving deference to the \nadministrative board, whether or not their decision was capricious and \narbitrary--the review standard at the appellate level--he embraces this \nterm or is intolerant is equally ridiculous. I have an administrative \nboard in the State of Mississippi that is an expert in the area of \nemployment discrimination law, hiring and firing practices. The case is \ndecided at the administrative level, and it comes up to appeal, and \nevery judge involved says this is a terrible word to use but, as a \nmatter of law, the board's finding it was an isolated incident did not \njustify a complete dismissal was the issue in the case.\n  Now, do we really want to create a situation in this country where \nthe judges who want to get promoted will not render justice or apply \nthe law, that they will be worried about themselves and what somebody \nmay say about the context of the case? Are we going to get so that you \ncannot represent someone? What about the person who was being accused \nof the racial slur? What if you had represented them? Would we come \nhere on the floor of the Senate saying: My God, you represented someone \nwho said a terrible thing; therefore, you can't be a judge? I don't \nknow about you, but as a lawyer, I have represented some pretty bad \npeople. It was my job. And judges have to apply the law and use their \nbest judgment.\n  So I hope this man will get an up-or-down vote and that this garbage \nwe are throwing at our nominees will stop.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, could you tell me how much time we have \nremaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-three minutes 45 seconds, including \nthe----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The 10 minutes, yes. And how about on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  This is, indeed, an important debate, and I think you can look at it \nat two different levels.\n  First, I wish to argue strongly against the confirmation of Leslie \nSouthwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. We do not assess \njudicial nominees in a vacuum. In addition to the particular record of \nthe nominee, there are a number of factors that figure into a Senator's \nproper evaluation of a candidate. We may consider, among other things, \nthe history behind the seat to which the candidate has been nominated; \nthe ideological balance within the court to which the nominee aspires; \nthe diversity of that court; the demographics of the population living \nin that court's jurisdiction; the legacy of discrimination, injustice, \nand legal controversy in that jurisdiction. In this case, the context \nand circumstances of the nomination require us to view it with \nparticular scrutiny. In this case doubt must be construed not for the \nnominee, as some of my colleagues--the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from South Carolina--have argued, but, rather, against the \nnominee.\n\n  The Fifth Circuit is perhaps the least balanced and least diverse in \nthe country. The circuit has deservedly earned a reputation as being \namong the most conservative in the Nation. It has 15\n\n[[Page S13284]]\n\njudges, 11 filled by Republican Presidents. It has a large African-\nAmerican population. There is only one African-American judge serving \non it. The circuit has three seats traditionally reserved for \nMississippians. That honor has never gone to an African American, even \nthough Mississippi's population is more than one-third African \nAmerican. Of course, the Fifth Circuit services areas that still suffer \nthe scars and effects of decades of deep racial inequality and \ndiscrimination.\n  So you have to put things in context. We have had two other nominees \nwho were extremely unsuitable candidates: Judge Pickering, whom this \nbody rejected, and Michael Wallace, whom many, when you speak to them \nin Mississippi and in the African-American community there, said an \nAfrican American might not get a fair trial in Michael Wallace's court. \nBut they were nominated. The exact same reasoning could have been used \nfor them. Those were the two previous nominees. We have to evaluate \nJudge Southwick against this backdrop.\n  When we do so, we cannot have confidence that he is a moderate jurist \nwho will apply the law evenhandedly. Most disturbingly, Judge \nSouthwick's judicial record provides no comfort that he understands or \ncan wisely adjudicate issues relating to race, discrimination, and \nequal treatment. In this circuit above all, that should be a criterion. \nWhether you are from Mississippi or Arizona or South Carolina or New \nYork, we should all care about that.\n  Let's go over some of the record. There is the Richmond case. The \nmajority opinion in the Richmond case reflects an astonishingly bad \ndecision. In that case, Judge Southwick joined a 5-to-4 ruling that \nessentially ratified the bizarre finding of a hearing officer who \nreinstated a State worker who had insulted a fellow worker by using the \nworst racial slur, the ``n'' word. To join that wrongheaded decision \nwas to ignore history and common sense and common decency, to find a \nbasis for excusing the most deeply offensive racial slur in the \nlanguage. As the dissenters in Richmond pointed out, and there were \nfour of them, the term ``is and always has been offensive. Search high \nand low, you will not find any nonoffensive definition for this term. \nThere are some words which by their nature and definition are so \ninherently offensive their use establishes the intent to offend.''\n  Of course, the Mississippi Supreme Court, the highest court in \nMississippi, unanimously reversed. The Richmond case cannot be \ndismissed, as some would like, as just one case that Judge Southwick \nmerely joined. He could have joined the very vocal dissent. He could \nhave written a separate concurrence. He did neither. It is fair and \nproper to ascribe to Judge Southwick every word of the Richmond \nmajority opinion--and the case is a touchstone, the case is a \nbenchmark. It is a predictor and it is all the more important because \nthere is little or nothing in the record to offset the impression it \ngives about Judge Southwick's jurisprudence.\n  Judge Southwick, at his hearing, said some of the hearing officer's \nanalysis ``does not now seem convincing to me,'' even though he \nendorsed it only 9 years ago. This mild attempt at backtracking at his \nconfirmation hearing does not provide comfort. In fact, it smacks of a \nnominee trying in some small way to please Senators who will decide his \nfate.\n  Beyond this defining case, moreover, Judge Southwick has shown over \nmore than a decade of adjudicating cases that we should be concerned \nabout his legal philosophy in so many areas: consumer rights, workers' \nrights, race discrimination in jury selection. He has shown a bias. I \nam not going to get into those cases, but, again, I would say there is \na special onus on us all here.\n  Most of my colleagues--some on this side of the aisle--have said: \nWell, he issued thousands of opinions and only made one mistake. First, \nI am not sure that is true. When you look at his opinions, there are \nmore mistakes than that. But let's even say he made this one mistake. \nNormally that would be a good argument. We all make mistakes. None of \nus before God is flawless, is perfect. Of course we are human beings. \nBut certain mistakes are not forgivable. They may be forgivable of a \nperson as a man or a woman, but not forgivable when you are elevating \nsomeone to the Fifth Circuit.\n  We have had a poison in America since the inception of this country. \nThis is a great country. I am a patriot. I love this country dearly. It \nis in my bones. But the poison in this country, the thing that could do \nus in, is race and racism. Alexis de Tocqueville, the great French \nphilosopher, came here in the 1830s. He made amazing predictions about \nthis country. We were a tiny nation of farmers, not close to the power \nof Britain or France or Russia, the great European nations. De \nTocqueville comes from France and says this country, America--this is \nin the 1830s--this country is going to become the greatest country in \nthe world. He was right. Then he said one thing could do us in--race, \nracism and its poison. He was right again.\n  When it comes to the area of race and racism, we have to bend over \nbackwards. The African-American community in Mississippi, in the \ncountry, is strongly against the Southwick nomination. They know this \ndiscrimination, this poison of America, better than anybody else. They \nknow, even in 2007, the little winks and gestures that indicate a whole \ndifferent subplot. When you condone using the ``n'' word, you are doing \njust that. Unfortunately, Judge Southwick--he may be a good man and I \ncertainly don't think he is a racist, but his words have to be seen in \ncontext. Like it or not, when he is nominated to the Fifth Circuit he \nis carrying 200-some-odd years of bigotry that has existed in this \ncountry, and particularly in this circuit, on his back. That is the \nissue here. This is not just any mistake; this is not just any flaw. \nThis comes in a whole subcontext.\n\n  Then I heard yesterday that Judge Southwick has not met with the one \nAfrican Member of the Mississippi delegation, Bennie Thompson. He has \nnot met with, I believe it was called the Magnolia Bar Society, the \nAfrican-American bar society in Mississippi. Should not Judge \nSouthwick, after these allegations, have gone out of his way? He called \nyesterday, after Bennie Thompson, Congressman Thompson, presented this \nto us. Shouldn't he have been camped out at Bennie Thompson's door to \ntry to explain what he did? It is the same kind of attitude. It is the \nsame kind of subtext that, frankly, unless you are African American, \nyou don't see.\n  John McCain is right. Elections have consequences. I do not expect \nour President to nominate to the Fifth Circuit somebody who has my \nviews or the views of other Members of this side. Elections do have \nconsequences. But on the issue of race, the poison of America, where \nthe Fifth Circuit has been a cauldron, I do expect the President to \nnominate someone who is above reproach. Because we are not just judging \na man or a woman as he or she treads on this Earth. We are judging \nsomebody to go to the second highest court in the land. There must be--\nthere must be--thousands of jurists of every race who meet the \nPresident's views but do not have this unfortunate, serious, and \nirremovable blemish upon them.\n  This one to me is not an ordinary situation. It is not one mistake \nout of 7,000 opinions. It is not judging whether Judge Southwick is a \ngood man. Let's assume he is. It goes far deeper than that. It is not \nsaying, as so many of my colleagues have said: We may have a Democratic \nPresident and we need, next time out, to make sure we come together on \njudges. I wish to do that. You know, when you vote for 90-some-odd \npercent of the President's nominees, almost every one of whom you \ndisagree with philosophically, you are doing that. I have done that. \nMost Members on this side have done that. But that does not forgive \nthis--again, in the context, not of somebody as a person but in the \ncontext of something to be elevated to the Fifth Circuit.\n  In conclusion, we have to make every effort to bend over backwards on \nthe issue of race and racism in the Fifth Circuit and in the other \ncircuits as well. We have not done that here. We are sort of casting it \naside, finding an excuse, pushing it under the rug. Again, I do not \nbelieve Judge Southwick is a racist, but I do believe when it comes to \nthe issue of race, one on the Fifth Circuit must be exemplary. This \ncase shows he is not. He has failed\n\n[[Page S13285]]\n\nthat standard. I urge my colleagues, every one of them on both sides of \nthe aisle, to look into their hearts when they cast this important \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters regarding \nthis Nomination be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 8, 2007.\n     Re Leslie Southwick\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Specter: We are writing on \n     behalf of People for the American Way and the Human Rights \n     Campaign and our combined grassroots force of more than \n     1,700,000 members and other supporters nationwide to express \n     our serious concerns regarding the nomination of Mississippi \n     lawyer and former state court judge Leslie Southwick to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. As you \n     know, Judge Southwick has been nominated by President Bush to \n     fill a seat on the Fifth Circuit that the President has \n     previously attempted to fill with Charles Pickering and then \n     with Michael Wallace, both of whose nominations were met with \n     substantial opposition, in large measure because of their \n     disturbing records on civil rights. Now, with Judge \n     Southwick, President Bush once again appears to have chosen a \n     nominee for this seat who has a problematic record on civil \n     rights, as further discussed below. And once again the \n     President has passed over qualified African Americans in a \n     state with a significant African American population that has \n     never had an African American judge on the Fifth Circuit.\n       At the outset, we are constrained to note that there are \n     significant concerns regarding the insufficient time provided \n     to the Judiciary Committee to consider Judge \n     Southwick's record in the careful manner required by the \n     Senate's constitutional responsibilities in the \n     confirmation process, as well as concerns raised by the \n     fact that Judge Southwick's complete record does not \n     appear to have been provided to the Committee. The \n     confirmation hearing for Judge Southwick was scheduled \n     with only a week's notice to the Committee, providing \n     insufficient preparation time for the consideration of a \n     controversial appellate court nominee. In addition, there \n     has not been sufficient time since Judge Southwick \n     submitted his responses to the Committee's questionnaire, \n     in late February, for his entire judicial record to be \n     reviewed; indeed, it appears that some of his record has \n     not yet even been provided to the Committee.\n       Leslie Southwick served as a judge on the Mississippi Court \n     of Appeals from 1995-2006. The number of cases in which he \n     participated during that time is voluminous, well in excess \n     of 7,000 by his own estimation. Moreover, according to Judge \n     Southwick, many of the court's decisions during that time \n     were not published at all (including all of the court's \n     rulings--some 600 cases a year according to Southwick--issued \n     over a period of approximately two and a half years during \n     his tenure). While Judge Southwick in late February provided \n     to the Committee a compact disc containing thousands of pages \n     of his own unpublished opinions, to the best of our knowledge \n     he has not provided copies of the court's unpublished \n     opinions as to which he voted but that he did not write. As \n     the cases discussed below underscore, it is critical that the \n     Committee examine those rulings as well, for the opinions \n     that a judge chooses to join, or elects not to, can be just \n     as revealing of his judicial philosophy as those that he \n     writes.\n       In addition, and to our knowledge, the Committee also has \n     not been provided with Department of Justice records relevant \n     to Southwick's tenure as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n     during the administration of the first President Bush. These \n     records would shed additional light on Southwick's legal \n     philosophy and views, particularly on federal law issues that \n     simply did not come before him while he served on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals but that likely would if he were \n     confirmed to a federal Court of Appeals. It is axiomatic that \n     the Committee should not consider any judicial nominee \n     without the nominee's full record or adequate time in which \n     to review it.\n       Apart from these significant procedural issues, a \n     preliminary review of Judge Southwick's record raises serious \n     concerns about his record on civil rights. As an intermediate \n     state appellate court, the Mississippi Court of Appeals hears \n     appeals in state law criminal cases and typical state law \n     civil cases such as contract disputes, tort claims, workers \n     compensation matters, trusts and estates matters, and the \n     like. It does not routinely consider the types of federal \n     constitutional and civil rights matters that would shed a \n     great deal of light on a judge's legal philosophy concerning \n     these critical issues. Nonetheless, Judge Southwick's \n     positions in two cases before that court during his tenure \n     raising matters of individual rights are highly disturbing, \n     and strongly suggest that Southwick may lack the commitment \n     to social justice progress to which Americans are entitled \n     from those seeking a lifetime appointment to the federal \n     bench. We discuss each of these cases below.\n       Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1998 \n     Miss. App. LEXIS 637 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), reversed, 745 So. \n     2d 254 (Miss. 1999)\n       In Richmond, Judge Southwick joined a 5-4 ruling upholding \n     the reinstatement of a white state social worker, Bonnie \n     Richmond, who had been fired for referring to an African \n     American co-worker as ``a good ole nigger'' at an employment-\n     related conference. Richmond worked for the Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services (``DHS''), which terminated her \n     employment after other employees raised concerns about her \n     use of the racial slur. The ruling that Southwick joined was \n     unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The \n     facts are as follows.\n       After she was fired, Richmond appealed her termination to \n     the state Employee Appeals Board (``EAB''), which ordered her \n     reinstatement. The hearing officer opined that Richmond's use \n     of the racial slur ``was in effect calling the individual a \n     `teachers pet'.'' 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 637, at *19. He \n     considered the word ``nigger'' only ``somewhat derogatory,'' \n     felt that DHS had ``overreacted,'' and was concerned that \n     other employees might seek relief if they were called ``a \n     honkie or a good old boy or Uncle Tom or chubby or fat or \n     slim.'' Id. at *22-23.\n       The opinion that Southwick joined upheld the EAB's \n     reinstatement of Richmond, essentially ratifying the \n     astonishing findings and conclusions of the hearing officer. \n     Moreover, the opinion that Southwick joined accepted without \n     any skepticism Richmond's testimony that her use of the \n     racial slur was ``not motivated out of racial hatred or \n     animosity directed at her co-worker or toward blacks in \n     general, but was, rather, intended to be a shorthand \n     description of her perception of the relationship existing \n     between the [co]-worker and [a] DHS supervisor.'' Id. at \n     *9-10 (emphasis added).\n       There was a strong dissent by two judges who were obviously \n     appalled by the hearing officer's findings and opinion. \n     Unlike the majority, they openly criticized the hearing \n     examiner's findings and also criticized the majority for \n     presenting a ``sanitized version of [those] findings.'' Id. \n     at *29. According to the dissenters,\n       The hearing officer's ruling that calling [the co-worker] a \n     `good ole nigger' was equivalent to calling her `teacher's \n     pet' strains credulity. . . . The word `nigger' is, and has \n     always been, offensive. Search high and low, you will not \n     find any nonoffensive definition for this term. There are \n     some words, which by their nature and definition are so \n     inherently offensive, that their use establishes the intent \n     to offend.\n       Id. at *26.\n       The dissenters would have held that the EAB's actions were \n     not supported by substantial evidence, and would have upheld \n     the decision by DHS to fire Richmond. Another judge wrote a \n     separate dissent, joined by two other judges, in which he \n     would have remanded the case to the EAB so that some penalty \n     could be imposed on Richmond, or detailed findings made as to \n     why no penalty was appropriate.\n       DHS appealed the ruling of Southwick's court to the \n     Mississippi Supreme Court, which unanimously reversed. The \n     Supreme Court majority ordered that the case be sent back to \n     the EAB to impose a penalty other than termination or to make \n     detailed findings as to why no penalty should be imposed. \n     Some of the justices on the court would have gone even \n     further and reinstated the decision by DHS to fire Richmond. \n     But all of the Supreme Court justices rejected the view of \n     the Court of Appeals majority (which included Southwick) that \n     the EAB had not erred in ordering Richmond's reinstatement.\n       S.B. v L.W., 793 So. 2d 656 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).\n       In this case, Judge Southwick joined a decision by the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals, upholding--over a strong \n     dissent--a chancellor's ruling taking an eight-year-old girl \n     away from her bisexual mother and awarding custody of the \n     child to her father (who had never married her mother). The \n     mother was living at the time with another woman, and in \n     awarding custody to the father, the chancellor was plainly \n     influenced by the mother's sexual orientation and his obvious \n     concern about having the girl continue to live in what he \n     called ``a lesbian home.'' Judge Southwick not only joined \n     the majority opinion upholding the chancellor's ruling, but \n     alone among all the other judges in the majority, he joined a \n     concurrence by Judge Payne that was not only gratuitous, but \n     gratuitously anti-gay.\n       In taking the girl away from her mother (with whom she \n     lived), the chancellor cited a number of factors that he \n     claimed weighed in favor of the father, but it is clear that \n     he was heavily influenced by the mother's sexual orientation. \n     For example, the chancellor stated that the factor of \n     ``[s]tability of the home environment'' weighed in favor of \n     the father, because ``he is in a heterosexual environment. \n     Has a home there that is an average American home.'' 793 So. \n     2d at 666. Meanwhile, the chancellor said, ``[t]o place the \n     child with [the mother], the child would be reared in a \n     lesbian home, which is not the common home of today. To place \n     a child with [the father], the child would be reared in a \n     home which is considered more common today.'' Id.\n       The mother appealed to the Court of Appeals which, as noted \n     above, upheld the chancellor's ruling taking her daughter \n     away from her. The majority opinion, which Southwick joined, \n     held that the chancellor had not erred in taking the mother's \n     sexual\n\n[[Page S13286]]\n\n     orientation into consideration as what it viewed as one \n     factor in his ruling. In addition to the disturbing substance \n     of the majority's ruling, its language is also troubling, and \n     refers repeatedly to what it calls the mother's ``homosexual \n     lifestyle'' and her ``lesbian lifestyle.''\n       Not only did Southwick sign on to the majority opinion, but \n     he also made an affirmative decision to join a concurrence by \n     Judge Payne that was gratuitously anti-gay--and was the only \n     other judge in the majority to do so. The concurrence appears \n     to have been written for the sole purpose of underscoring and \n     defending Mississippi's hostility toward gay people and what \n     it calls ``the practice of homosexuality'' (id. at 662), in \n     response to the position of the dissenters (see below) that \n     the chancellor had erred. (The word gay is not used; the \n     concurrence refers repeatedly to ``homosexuals'' and \n     ``homosexual persons.'') The concurrence begins by stating \n     that the Mississippi legislature has ``made clear its public \n     policy position relating to particular rights of homosexuals \n     in domestic relations settings.'' Id. at 662. It then \n     proceeds to note that Mississippi law prohibits same-sex \n     couples from adopting children--although this law had nothing \n     to do with the case, since the mother was the birth mother--\n     and also notes that state law makes `` `the detestable and \n     abominable crime against nature' ''--which it says includes \n     ``homosexual acts''--a ten-year felony. Id.\n       Finally, the concurrence takes a huge and troubling states' \n     rights turn, claiming that ``[u]nder the principles of \n     Federalism, each state is permitted to set forth its own \n     public policy guidelines through legislative enactments and \n     through judicial renderings. Our State has spoken on its \n     position regarding rights of homosexuals in domestic \n     situations.'' Id. at 664. In other words, according to the \n     separate concurrence that Southwick chose to join, federalism \n     gives Mississippi the right to treat gay people as second-\n     class citizens and criminals. The views expressed in this \n     concurrence strongly suggest that Judge Southwick is hostile \n     to the notion that gay men and lesbians are entitled to equal \n     treatment under the law.\n       Two judges dissented, and in particular noted that there \n     had been no finding that there was any conduct harmful to the \n     child, and that ``it is the modern trend across the United \n     States of America to reject legal rules that deny homosexual \n     parents the fundamental constitutional right to parent a \n     child.'' Id. at 668.\n       As more than 200 law professors wrote to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in July 2001, no federal judicial nominee \n     is presumptively entitled to confirmation. Because federal \n     judicial appointments are for life and significantly affect \n     the rights of all Americans, and because of the Senate's co-\n     equal role with the President in the confirmation \n     process, nominees must demonstrate that they meet the \n     appropriate criteria. These include not only an \n     ``exemplary record in the law,'' but also a ``commitment \n     to protecting the rights of ordinary Americans,'' and a \n     ``record of commitment to the progress made on civil \n     rights, women's rights, and individual liberties.''\n       The burden is on Judge Southwick to demonstrate that he \n     satisfies these important criteria for confirmation. In \n     addition to addressing the serious concerns raised by the \n     matters discussed herein and those that have been raised by \n     others, Judge Southwick must also make his full record \n     available, and the Committee must have a reasonable \n     opportunity to examine it. Because the Supreme Court hears so \n     few cases, the Courts of Appeals really are the courts of \n     last resort in most cases and for most Americans. It is \n     therefore imperative that the Committee not engage in a rush \n     to judgment over anyone seeking a lifetime seat on a federal \n     appellate court, and that it insist upon being provided with \n     the nominee's complete legal record.\n       It is critical that the Committee closely scrutinize Judge \n     Southwick's full record and his jurisprudential views and \n     legal philosophy, particularly with respect to matters \n     critical to individual rights and freedoms. Until the \n     Committee has the opportunity to do that, and unless the \n     significant questions raised to date by Judge Southwick's \n     record are resolved satisfactorily, the Committee should not \n     proceed with consideration of Judge Southwick's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joe Solmonese,\n       President, Human Rights Campaign.\n     Ralph G. Neas,\n       President, People For the American Way.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Magnolia Bar\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                               Jackson, Mississippi, May 30, 2007.\n\n     Re Nomination of Leslie Southwick\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Magnolia Bar Association, Inc. \n     opposes the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       Founded in 1955, the Magnolia Bar was formed as all \n     organization of African-American lawyers in Mississippi at a \n     time when the Mississippi Bar was only open to white \n     attorneys. The Magnolia Bar, an affiliate of the National Bar \n     Association, is now a biracial organization whose membership \n     is committed to the same ideals of racial equality that drove \n     our founders to form the Magnolia Bar in the first place.\n       A federal judgeship is a lifetime position. Any time there \n     is an opening, there are a number of people who could be \n     considered, and no one is necessarily entitled to such an \n     appointment. While the President has a right to nominate, the \n     Senate and its Judiciary Committee must insure that the \n     nominations do not form a pattern that is racially \n     discriminatory in purpose or effect. President Bush has \n     demonstrated an absolute disdain for appointing African-\n     Americans to the federal judiciary; particularly within the \n     states representing the Fifth Circuit. Of his seven \n     nominations to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and his 32 \n     nominations to the district courts, not one nominee is an \n     African-American. This is particularly painful as African-\n     Americans comprise 37% of the population of Mississippi \n     according to the most recent census. This is the highest of \n     the fifty states. Louisiana is the second highest while Texas \n     also has a high African-American population percentage. \n     Confirmation should focus not simply on the nominee, but on \n     the impact the person's appointment will have on the federal \n     judiciary and the interpretation of the law.\n       Leslie Southwick's nomination continues a stark pattern of \n     racial discrimination and racial exclusion in appointments by \n     President Bush to the Fifth Circuit and to the federal \n     judiciary from Mississippi. If the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     approves this nomination, it will perpetuate this pattern of \n     exclusion and will, in our view, bear equal responsibility \n     for it. Moreover, Judge Southwick's record as a state court \n     of appeals judge in Mississippi suggests that he is not the \n     right person for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals at this \n     time in our history, and that his presence there could lead \n     to an improperly narrow interpretation of the constitution \n     and the civil rights laws. There are many others from \n     Mississippi who would make good federal judges, some of whom \n     are African-American. We ask that you not approve this \n     nomination, but instead allow President Bush to reconsider \n     and perhaps nominate someone who will add to the Fifth \n     Circuit's stature, diversity, and sensitivity to the need to \n     enforce fully the civil rights laws.\n       Despite an ever-growing pool of highly qualified candidates \n     from which to choose, all seventeen Mississippi nominees for \n     federal judgeships the past twenty-two years have been white. \n     The only appointment of an African-American federal judge in \n     the history of Mississippi, the twentieth state to join the \n     union, was when Judge Henry Wingate was appointed by \n     President Reagan to the district court in 1985. Of the \n     sixteen active and senior judges from Mississippi on the \n     federal district courts and court of appeals, only one is \n     African-American. Of the nineteen active and senior judges on \n     the Fifth Circuit, only one is African-American--Carl Stewart \n     of Louisiana, who was appointed by President Clinton. \n     Incidentally, Judge Stewart is only the second African-\n     American to have been appointed to the Fifth Circuit since \n     the court was created by the Judiciary Act of 1869.\n       Having an appreciation of Mississippi's long history of \n     racial apartheid, disenfranchisement, interposition and \n     massive resistance, it is scandalous that President Bush \n     has not seen fit to nominate not one African-American from \n     our state to the federal judiciary.\n       Fortunately, the Senate Judiciary Committee has not \n     ratified all of these nominees. It did not approve the \n     earlier nominations of Charles Pickering and Mike Wallace to \n     this seat. Yet, President Bush continues his pattern of \n     racial exclusion by submitting only white people for these \n     appointments, and submitting those who have not shown a \n     sufficient appreciation of the need for racial progress in \n     Mississippi. It is vitally important for the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to stand firm and not ratify President Bush's \n     brazen disregard of the need to integrate the federal \n     judiciary and to nominate those who have demonstrated they \n     will fully enforce the civil rights laws. If President Bush \n     is unwilling to help create a racially integrated federal \n     judiciary that is his prerogative. The Senate, however, \n     should not be an accomplice to this unjustifiable behavior. \n     It should keep the seats open until he is willing to do so or \n     until we have a new President who will have a fresh \n     opportunity to do so.\n       Several organizations have already expressed concern about \n     the decisions of Judge Southwick and whether he will fairly \n     and properly interpret the law with respect to the civil \n     rights of all. We share those concerns. Particularly \n     troubling is the decision Judge Southwick joined in the case \n     of Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services. The \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals does not review many cases \n     involving racial issues in employment. This is not a \n     situation where this decision is an outlier in what otherwise \n     is a progressive record on issues of race in the workplace. \n     Judge Southwick and his colleagues in the 5-4 majority \n     basically held that the Mississippi Department of Human \n     Services--an agency of the State of Mississippi--could not \n     discipline this worker who called a co-worker a ``good ole \n     nigger.'' This decision was the subject of publicity in \n     Mississippi, Clarion Ledger, August 5, 1998, and seemed to \n     send a message that the Court of Appeals majority did not \n     believe state officials should have the power to eliminate \n     this sort of behavior from the workplace.\n       In written questions by Senator Durbin, Judge Southwick was \n     asked why he believed\n\n[[Page S13287]]\n\n     that the hearing officer was not acting arbitrarily and \n     capriciously when he (the hearing officer) concluded that the \n     use of the word ``nigger'' was similar to the terms ``good \n     old boy or Uncle Tom or chubby or fat or slim.'' Judge \n     Southwick responded by saying that ``[i]t was the EAB's \n     [Employee Appeals Board] decision, though, not that of the \n     hearing officer, that was subject to our analysis . . .'' But \n     that statement is misleading. The Richmond majority opinion, \n     which Judge Southwick joined, states: ``The hearing officer's \n     findings, subsequently adopted by the full Board, address two \n     separate aspects of the matter under consideration.'' 1998 \n     Miss. App. LEXIS 637 *4. The opinion adds: ``In order to \n     reverse the EAB, we must determine that there was not \n     substantial evidence in the record to support the findings \n     made by the hearing officer and ratified by the full board.'' \n     Id. *7. As explained by the dissent of Judge King (a \n     distinguished African-American from Mississippi who is now \n     Chief Judge of the Mississippi Court of Appeals having been \n     appointed as Chief by the Chief Justice of the Mississippi \n     Supreme Court and who would make an excellent federal \n     appellate judge): ``Because the EAB made no findings of its \n     own, we can only conclude that it incorporated by reference \n     and adopted the findings and order of the hearing officer.'' \n     Id. * 19. As Judge King later said: ``The majority opinion is \n     a scholarly, but sanitized version of the hearing officer's \n     findings and is subject to the same infirmities found in that \n     opinion.'' Id. *28-29.\n       Moreover, we agree with Judge King, that one can ``[s]earch \n     high and low, [and] you will not find any non-offensive \n     definition for [the] term [nigger], and it ``is so inherently \n     offensive that it is not altered by the use of modifiers, \n     such as `good ole.'' Id. at 26-27 Having used the term, which \n     has always been offensive, within a 60% black division of a \n     state agency with more than 50% black employees demonstrated \n     a gross lack of judgment that the agency should have \n     dismissed the employee. As Justice Fred Banks, the African-\n     American member of the Supreme Court at the time, explained \n     in his concurring opinion:\n       [I]t is clear [the Department of Human Services] had an \n     interest in terminating Bonnie Richmond because not to have \n     taken some sort of action regarding the comment made by her, \n     could possibly have subjected the agency to a claim of \n     racially hostile environment claim under federal law, and \n     therefore retaining Bonnie Richmond could constitute \n     negligence. Richmond v. Mississippi Dept. of Human Services, \n     745 So.2d 254, 260 (Miss. 1999)(Banks, J., \n     concurring)(joined by Sullivan, P.J., and Smith, J.)\n       We are also troubled by the other decisions and positions \n     cited in the various questions propounded by members of the \n     Judiciary Committee and in the statements issued by other \n     organizations expressing concern over this nomination. We \n     question whether Judge Southwick will properly enforce the \n     law when it comes to the rights of those who are unpopular \n     and who are marginalized by the political process. The Fifth \n     Circuit needs a moderating influence at this point in \n     history, but it appears this appointment will have the \n     opposite effect.\n       As Senator Durbin pointed out at the hearing on Judge \n     Southwick's nomination, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     was once a collection of several heroic judges who \n     steadfastly enforced the civil rights of African-Americans \n     and other dispossessed groups even though many white people \n     in the South were quite hostile to the notion of equal rights \n     under the law. Unfortunately, the present-day Fifth Circuit \n     has often retreated from that legacy by applying a narrow and \n     overly technical interpretation of the constitution and the \n     civil rights laws. Moreover, at a time when the bars of \n     Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas have become racially \n     integrated, and when many governmental bodies in those states \n     have achieved significant racial diversity, the Fifth Circuit \n     presently stands as an almost all-white judicial body in the \n     heart of the Deep South. This is a sad legacy and the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee should do everything it can to end that \n     legacy rather than perpetuate it.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Carlton W.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Specter: I am writing to you as \n     President of the National Employment Lawyers Association \n     (NELA) to express our strong opposition to the nomination of \n     Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. After \n     reviewing Mr. Southwick's background and legal experience, we \n     believe he is not qualified to be appointed to the federal \n     bench.\n       Mr. Southwick has been nominated to the same Fifth Circuit \n     seat that has been steeped in controversy: President Bush \n     recess appointed Charles Pickering to the seat in January \n     2004 and nominated Michael Wallace to the seat in 2006. NELA \n     strongly opposed both of those nominees and takes a similar \n     position on Mr. Southwick's nomination.\n       Like Pickering and Wallace, Mr. Southwick has espoused \n     extreme views reflecting a lack of commitment to equality and \n     justice in the workplace. For example, Mr. Southwick joined a \n     troubling 5-4 decision from the Mississippi Court of Appeals \n     that excused the use of a racial slur by a white state \n     employee. In Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of Human Services, \n     Bonnie Richmond, an employee with the Mississippi Department \n     of Human Services (DHS), was terminated when she referred to \n     an African-American co-worker as a ``good ole n*****'' at a \n     meeting that included agency executives. Richmond appealed \n     her termination to the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board \n     (EAB). A hearing was conducted by one member of the EAB who \n     had been designated to act as hearing officer.\n       Among other things, the hearing officer concluded that the \n     ``DHS overreacted'' to Richmond's comments, because the term \n     ``was not a racial slur, but instead was equivalent to \n     calling [the African American employee] `teacher's pet.''' \n     The hearing officer stated, ``I understand that the term \n     `n*****' is somewhat derogatory, but the term has not been \n     used in recent years in the conversation that it was used \n     in my youth, and at that point--at that time it was a \n     derogatory remark . . . I think that in this context, I \n     just don't find it was racial discrimination.''\n       The majority, which included Mr. Southwick, affirmed the \n     EAB hearing officer's decision without reservation. They \n     found that, taken in context, the slur was an insufficient \n     ground to terminate Richmond's employment in part because it \n     ``was not motivated out of racial hatred or racial animosity \n     directed toward a particular co-worker or towards blacks in \n     general.'' The dissent, rightly disturbed by the majority's \n     failure to acknowledge the inherent offensiveness of the \n     epithet, stated that ``the hearing officer and the majority \n     opinion seem to suggest that absent evidence of a near race \n     riot, the remark is too inconsequential to serve as a basis \n     of dismissal.''\n       When Judiciary Committee member Senator Russ Feingold, at \n     Mr. Southwick's hearing earlier this month, characterized the \n     argument relied upon by Mr. Southwick in the case as ``a \n     pretty shocking piece of analysis,'' Mr. Southwick even \n     admitted that the reasoning ``does not now seem convincing to \n     me.'' However, his backpedaling comes too late and fails to \n     allay NELA's concerns that Mr. Southwick, if confirmed to the \n     Fifth Circuit, will turn a blind eye to discrimination in the \n     workplace.\n       Indeed, NELA is troubled by Mr. Southwick's views on other \n     workplace issues, particularly his zealous support for the \n     employment-at-will doctrine, a doctrine which provides that \n     employers can fire employees for virtually any reason. In \n     Dubard v. Biloxi, H.M.A., the court addressed the issue, \n     among others, of whether there was sufficient evidence to \n     show that the defendant did not breach the plaintiff's \n     employment contract or that the defendant did not wrongfully \n     discharge the plaintiff. In a dissenting opinion that focused \n     less on the merits of the case and more on the virtues of the \n     employment-at-will doctrine, Mr. Southwick went to great \n     lengths to justify a legal theory that has been the subject \n     of intense legal, judicial and academic controversy. He \n     wrote: ``I find that employment at will, for whatever flaws a \n     specific application may cause, is not only the law of \n     Mississippi but it provides the best balance of the competing \n     interests in the normal employment situation. It has often \n     been said about democracy, that it does not provide a perfect \n     system of government, but just a better one than everything \n     else that has ever been suggested. An equivalent view might \n     be seen as the justification of employment at will.''\n       Mr. Southwick casually, and without any supporting \n     citations, equated the doctrine of employment at will with \n     democracy. In fact, it is its polar opposite. That doctrine \n     is often used to justify employers' decisions to discharge \n     employees who have engaged in pro-union activities or in \n     other conduct protected by anti-discrimination, minimum wage \n     and overtime, occupational safety and health, family and \n     medical leave, whistleblower protection, and other federal \n     and state statutes. An employer can cause devastating \n     financial and emotional harm to an employee; an individual \n     employee rarely has that same power. Mr. Southwick's \n     endorsement of that doctrine calls into question his \n     willingness to vigorously enforce federal legislation that \n     imposes restrictions on an employers ability to fire \n     employees without a good reason or, for that matter, without \n     any reason.\n       Based on his demonstrated insensitivity to race issues, \n     combined with his apparent inability to divorce his views \n     from his judicial obligation to be fair and independent, NELA \n     believes that Mr. Southwick would be in the mold of previous \n     nominees like Charles Pickering and Michael Wallace who had \n     never been friendly to employee rights. As such, NELA is \n     strongly opposed to Mr. Southwick's nomination to the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and believes he should not be \n     confirmed by the Senate.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact NELA Program Director \n     Marissa Tirona.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Kathleen L. Bogas,\n\n                                                        President,\n                          National Employment Lawyers Association.\n\n[[Page S13288]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Leslie Southwick to serve on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit.\n  Article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution explicitly provides \nthe responsibilities of the executive branch of Government and the \nSenate with respect to judicial nominations. Article II, section 2 of \nthe Constitution reads, in part, that the President ``shall nominate, \nand by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . \n. Judges of the Supreme Court and all other Officers of the United \nStates . . . .''\n  Thus, the Constitution provides the President of the United States \nwith the responsibility of nominating individuals to serve on our \nFederal bench.\n  The Constitution provides the Senate with the responsibility of \nproviding advice to the President on those nominations and with the \nresponsibility of providing or withholding consent on those \nnominations.\n  In this respect, article II, section 2 of our Constitution places our \nFederal judiciary--a coequal branch of Government--in a unique posture \nwith respect to the other two co-equal branches of our Federal \nGovernment. Unlike the executive branch and unlike the Congress, the \nConstitution places the composition and continuity of our Federal \njudiciary entirely within the coordinated exercise of responsibilities \nof the other two branches of Government. Only if the President and the \nSenate fairly, objectively, and in a timely fashion exercise these \nrespective constitutional powers can the judicial branch of Government \nbe composed and maintained so that our courts can function and serve \nthe American people.\n  For this reason, in my view, a Senator has no higher duty than his or \nher constitutional responsibilities under article II, section 2--the \nadvice and consent clause.\n  During the course of my 28 years in the Senate, I have always tried \nto fairly and objectively review a judicial nominee's credentials prior \nto deciding whether I will vote to provide consent on a nomination. I \nlook at a wide range of factors, primarily character, professional \ncareer, experience, integrity, and temperament for lifetime service on \nour courts. While I certainly recognize political considerations, it is \nmy practice not to be bound by them.\n  Having reviewed Judge Southwick's nomination, in my view, he is \neminently qualified to serve on the Federal bench. I note that the \nAmerican Bar Association, often cited as the ``gold standard'' of \nreview of judicial nominees, agrees with me as it has given Judge \nSouthwick its highest rating of ``well-qualified.''\n  Judge Southwick's credentials are well-known but worth repeating. He \nreceived his bachelor's degree, cum laude, from Rice University and \nthen proceeded to law school at the University of Texas.\n  Subsequent to his law school graduation, he served as a law clerk for \ntwo jurists: a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit--the court for which he now has been nominated--and for a judge \non the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.\n  Upon completing his clerkships, Mr. Southwick entered private \npractice with a law firm in Mississippi, starting as an associate but \nrising to the level of partner 6 years later. After 12 years of private \npractice, he joined the U.S. Department of Justice in the George H. W. \nBush administration, working as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Civil Rights Division.\n  From 1995 until 2006, Leslie Southwick served as a member of the \nMississippi Court of Appeals. During this time, Judge Southwick also \nserved his country in uniform.\n  From 1992 through 1997, he was a member of the Judge Advocate \nGeneral's Corps in the U.S. Army Reserve. In 2003, he volunteered to \nserve in a line combat unit, the 155th Separate Armor Brigade. In 2004, \nhe took a leave of absence from the bench to serve in Iraq with the \n155th Brigade Combat Team of the Mississippi National Guard.\n  Mr. President, Judge Southwick is obviously very well qualified to \nserve on the Federal bench. Not only does he meet the requisite \nacademic requirements, he also has real world experience in private \npractice and a dedication to public service.\n  In my view, he deserves to be confirmed to the Federal bench. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this eminently qualified nominee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Judge \nLeslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \nHis confirmation is compelling for two reasons. Judge Southwick should \nbe confirmed because of his merits, and Judge Southwick should be \nconfirmed because of the traditions of this body.\n  Judge Southwick's merits are obvious. He is a good man and a good \njudge. Leslie Southwick has long been active serving his community, his \nchurch and his country. He is a man of character and integrity.\n  Our colleagues from Arizona, South Carolina, and Virginia, Senators \nMcCain, Graham, and Warner, have spoken forcefully and eloquently from \ntheir perspective as veterans about Judge Southwick's military service. \nHe volunteered for service in Iraq when he was old enough to have \nchildren serving in Iraq. He did not have to do that, he offered to do \nthat. It seems to me that we want men and women on the Federal bench \nwho have this selfless commitment to serving others.\n  Leslie Southwick is also a good judge. What could be more directly \nrelevant to a Federal appeals court nomination than 12 years of State \nappeals court service? During that time, he participated in more than \n7,000 cases and wrote nearly 1,000 opinions.\n  Earlier this year, the Congressional Black Caucus said that, in \ndeciding whether to confirm Judge Southwick, we should consider how \noften his majority and concurring opinions were reversed on appeal. I \ndo think that is a legitimate factor to consider. I thought I would \nfind an unusually high number, that he has been repeatedly rebuked, \nrebuffed, and reversed, that Mississippi Supreme Court had to routinely \nput him in his judicial place. I found just the opposite. Only 21 of \nJudge Southwick's majority or concurring opinions were reversed or even \ncriticized by the Mississippi Supreme Court. That is less than 2 \npercent. I am indeed impressed by that low figure because it shows that \nJudge Southwick's work as a judge stands up under scrutiny. If that is \nan appropriate standard for evaluating his nomination, we should \nconfirm him immediately.\n  Judge Southwick's critics suggest that he is supposedly out of the \nmainstream. That is the phrase liberals invented 20 years ago to attack \njudicial nominees who they predict will not rule a certain way on \ncertain issues. This is a completely illegitimate standard for \nevaluating judicial nominees and is based on a tally of winners and \nlosers, as if judges are supposed to decide winners and losers by \nlooking at the parties rather than at the law and the facts. Perhaps my \nliberal friends could publish a confirmation rate card, telling us how \noften judges are supposed to rule for one party or another in certain \ncategories of cases. But the case against Judge Southwick is even more \nridiculous than that. The case against Judge Southwick's nomination \nrests on just two, of the 7,000 cases in which he participated. It \nrests on two opinions, just two, that he did not even write. No one has \nargued that those cases were wrongly decided. No one has argued that \nthe court ignored the law. No one is making that argument because no \none can. In fact, the Washington Post editorialized that Judge \nSouthwick should be confirmed and said that while they might not like \nthe results in these two cases, they could not argue with what the Post \nadmitted was a ``legitimate interpretation of the law.''\n\n  I ask my colleagues a very important, perhaps the most important, \nquestion: Are judges supposed to be legally correct or politically \ncorrect? Are judges supposed to decide cases based on legitimate \ninterpretation of the law or based on which side wins or loses? Are \njudges supposed to apply the law or ignore the law? That question of \nwhat judges are supposed to do lies at the heart of every conflict over \na judicial nominee, including the one before us today.\n  The case against Judge Southwick is that, in just two cases with \nopinions he did not write, the court was legally correct instead of \nbeing politically correct. The case against Judge Southwick is that, in \njust two cases, the court did not ignore the law. What\n\n[[Page S13289]]\n\nkind of crazy, topsy-turvy argument is this, that Judge Southwick \nshould not be confirmed because as a state court judge he stuck to the \nlaw? I think that exposing the real argument against him is enough to \nshow that there is no real argument against him at all. I thought we \nwanted judges on the Federal bench who would rule based on the law, who \nwould be committed to equal justice for every litigant coming before \nthem.\n  When it comes to evaluating Judge Southwick's record, whom should we \nbelieve--partisan and ideological critics here in Washington or lawyers \nand judges who have worked with Judge Southwick for many years? That is \nnot even a close call. Everyone who actually knows him, everyone who \nhas actually worked with him, says that Judge Leslie Southwick is fair, \ndecent, hard-working, and committed to equal justice under law. You \nwould have to twist and contort his record into something else entirely \nto conclude otherwise.\n  The American Bar Association also looked at Judge Southwick's fitness \nfor the Federal bench. They evaluated his qualifications and record not \nonce but twice, last year when he was nominated to the U.S. District \nCourt and again this year after his nomination to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. I must be candid with my colleagues regarding the ABA's two \nratings of Judge Southwick. In the interest of full disclosure, I must \nbe honest that the ABA's two ratings of Judge Southwick are not the \nsame and, quite frankly, I think this must be considered when we vote. \nThe ABA's rating for Judge Southwick's current appeals court nomination \nis higher than their rating for his district court nomination. The ABA \nsays that it looks specifically at a nominee's compassion, freedom from \nbias, openmindedness and commitment to equal justice under law. The \nABA's highest ``well qualified'' rating means Judge Southwick receives \nthe highest marks for these qualities. I thought we wanted judges on \nthe Federal bench who are compassionate, free from bias, openminded, \nand committed to equal justice under law. Judge Southwick's critics \nhave offered nothing, absolutely nothing, to rebut this conclusion. \nNothing at all.\n  I think the record, the evidence, and the facts are clear. Judge \nSouthwick is a good man and a good judge, and, based on his merits, he \nshould be confirmed.\n  Judge Southwick should also be confirmed because of the traditions of \nthis body. Traditionally, the Senate has respected the separation of \npowers when it comes to the President's appointment authority. Under \nthe Constitution, the President has the primary appointment authority. \nWe check that authority, but we may not hijack it. We may not use our \nrole of advise and consent to undermine the President's authority to \nappoint judges. That is why, as I have argued on this floor many times, \nit is wrong to use the filibuster to defeat judicial nominees who have \nmajority support, who would be confirmed if only we could vote up or \ndown. That is why I have never voted against cloture on a judicial \nnomination. That is why I argued against filibusters of even President \nClinton's most controversial judicial nominees. And believe me, the \ncase against some of those nominees was far greater, far more \nsubstantial, by orders of magnitude, than the nonexistent case against \nJudge Southwick.\n  Traditionally, the Senate has not rejected judicial nominees based on \nsuch thin, trumped-up arguments. We have not rejected nominees who \nreceived the ABA's unanimous highest rating. In fact, I remember when \nthis body confirmed judicial nominees of the previous President whom \nthe ABA said were not qualified at all. We have not rejected judicial \nnominees who received such uniform praise from those who know them and \nworked with them. We have not rejected judicial nominees for refusing \nto ignore the law.\n  Traditionally, the Senate has respected the views of home-state \nSenators. Our colleagues from Mississippi, Senators Cochran and Lott, \nare respected and senior members of this body. They strongly support \nJudge Southwick, and we should respect their views. Such home-state \nsupport was an important factor in moving even the most controversial \nClinton judicial nominees to this floor and onto the Federal bench.\n  So I say to my colleagues that Judge Southwick's merits and our \ntraditions mean that he should be confirmed. Judge Southwick is a good \nman and a good judge. Our traditions respect the separation of powers, \nrespect the obvious merits of nominees, and respect the views of home-\nstate Senators. I urge my colleagues not to veer from that path, but to \nsupport this fine nominee and keep the confirmation process from \nslipping further into the political mire.\n  I urge my colleague to vote for cloture and to vote for confirmation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of \nJudge Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. I believe he should not be confirmed.\n  The context for this nomination is important, so I want to turn to \nthat first.\n  During the last 6 years of the Clinton administration, this committee \ndid not report out a single judge to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. And, as we all know, that was not for lack of nominees to \nconsider. President Clinton nominated three well-qualified lawyers to \nthe court of appeals. None of these nominees even received a hearing \nbefore this committee. When Chairman Leahy held a hearing in July 2001 \non the nomination of Judge Edith Brown Clement, only a few months after \nshe was nominated, it was the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee \nsince September 1994. Judge Clement was quickly confirmed. We have also \nconfirmed two other Fifth Circuit nominees during this administration, \nEdward Prado and Priscilla Owen.\n  So there is a history here. Some may think it is ancient history, but \nthe fact is that nominees to this circuit were treated particularly \nunfairly during the Clinton administration, and there was a special \nburden for the current administration to work with our side on nominees \nfor it. To ignore this history would be to simply reward the behavior \nof the Republicans during the last 6 years of the Clinton \nadministration. And the numbers tell a very clear tale--three judges \nconfirmed for this circuit during the first 6 years of this \nadministration, versus none in the last 6 years of President Clinton's \nterm.\n  President Bush did not act in a bipartisan way, of course, in the \ncase of the seat for which Judge Southwick has been nominated. First, \nhe nominated Judge Charles Pickering, leading to one of the most \ncontentious floor fights of his first term. Judge Pickering was never \nconfirmed by the Senate, but in a further slap to this institution, the \nPresident put him on the court through a recess appointment. Then, when \nJudge Pickering retired, the President nominated Michael Wallace, whom \nthe ABA judicial nominations screening committee unanimously gave a \nrating of ``not qualified'' based on comments from judges and lawyers \nin his own State concerning his temperament and commitment to equal \njustice. Mr. Wallace ultimately withdrew his nomination when it became \nclear he could not be confirmed.\n  Another important part of the context of this nomination is that \nexcept for the DC Circuit, the Fifth Circuit has the largest percentage \nof residents who are minorities of any circuit--over 40 percent. \nThirty-seven percent of the residents of Mississippi are African \nAmerican. Yet only 1 of the 19 seats on the circuit is currently held \nby an African American judge. The Fifth Circuit is a court that during \nthe civil rights era issued some of the most significant decisions \nsupporting the rights of African-American citizens to participate as \nfull members of our society. It is a circuit where cases addressing the \ncontinuing problems of racism and discrimination in our country will \ncontinue to arise.\n  In this context, as we come to the end of this President's term, I \nwanted very much to see, if not an African-American nominee, at least a \nnominee whose commitment to equal rights for all Americans and equal \njustice under law is unassailable. Judge Southwick is not that nominee. \nWhile the record we have been able to review is not extensive, two \ndecisions he made as a judge raise real red flags.\n  In the Richmond case, Judge Southwick joined the majority in a split \ndecision upholding a hearing examiner's decision that an employee's use \nof the most offensive racial slur in our Nation's history was not \nadequate\n\n[[Page S13290]]\n\ngrounds for dismissal. That hearing examiner said that the slur was \n``somewhat derogatory, but the term has not been used in recent years \nin the conversation that it was used in my youth, and at that point--at \nthat time it was a derogatory remark. I think that in this context, I \njust don't find it was racial discrimination.''\n  A unanimous Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the decision that \nJudge Southwick joined. Mr. Chairman, in the year 2007, in a State \nwhere 37 percent of the residents are African Americans, we need a \njudge on the Fifth Circuit who recognizes that such a decision had to \nbe overturned.\n  I am also disturbed by Judge Southwick's role in the child custody \ncase, S.B. v. L.W., and particularly by his joining a stridently \nantigay opinion concurring in the decision to take a woman's child away \nfrom her and give custody to the unmarried father of the child. I found \nJudge Southwick's explanation of his reasoning in joining this opinion, \nand his assurances that he harbors no bias against gay Americans, \nunconvincing. I am simply not convinced by his assurances that he will \ngive all litigants who come before him a fair hearing.\n  Mr. President, it gives me no pleasure to vote against this nominee. \nAs my colleagues know, I do not start with a predisposition against the \nPresident's choices. I have supported well over 200 of the President's \njudicial nominees. But no one is entitled to a lifetime appointment to \nour powerful Federal courts, and Judge Southwick has not demonstrated \nthat he is the right nominee for this vacancy. I will vote no.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and concern from \nthe Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, the California State Conference of \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the \nCongressional Black Caucus, and the NAACP be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2007.\n     Re Jude Leslie Southwick nomination.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Specter: On behalf of the \n     Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), we write \n     to express our strong opposition to the nomination of Judge \n     Leslie Southwick to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit.\n       The Southwick nomination fails to address the lack of \n     diversity on Mississippi's federal branch. As you know, the \n     Fifth Circuit presides over the largest percentage of \n     minority residents (44%) of any circuit. Mississippi has the \n     highest African American population (36%) of any state in the \n     country. Yet, out of the seventeen seats on the Fifth \n     Circuit, only one is held by an African-American. \n     Additionally, the Fifth Circuit has issued decisions \n     important to minority communities such as employment \n     discrimination, voting rights and affirmative action. The \n     lack of diversity of the Fifth Circuit, compounded with Judge \n     Southwick's flawed record on race, further exemplifies the \n     unacceptability of Southwick's nomination.\n       Judge Southwick's record as a judge on the Mississippi \n     State Court of Appeals clearly demonstrates that he is an \n     objectionable nominee for the Fifth Circuit. In the case of \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, Judge \n     Southwick joined a 5-4 decision that upheld the reinstatement \n     of a white state social worker, Bonnie Richmond, who had been \n     fired for calling an African American co-worker a ``good ole \n     n***** '' at a meeting that included top agency executives. \n     The ruling that Southwick joined was unanimously reversed by \n     the Supreme Court of Mississippi.\n       CAPAC is furthered disturbed by Judge Southwick's rulings \n     against consumers and workers in divided torts and employment \n     cases and worker rights. In 160 out of 180 published \n     decisions, Judge Southwick votes against the injured party \n     and in favor of business interests, such as corporations or \n     insurance companies.\n       With the lifetime judicial position at stake, Southwick's \n     record has failed to reflect the values of social justice, \n     fairness and equality in this country. We strongly urge the \n     Judiciary Committee to reject Leslie Southwick's confirmation \n     to the Fifth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael M. Honda,\n       Chair, CAPAC.\n     Bobby Scott,\n       Chair, CAPAC Civil Rights Task Force.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Partnership\n\n\n                                        for Women & Familines,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2007.\n     Re nomination of Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of \n         Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Specter: We write to urge you to \n     reject the nomination of Leslie Southwick for a seat on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. As an \n     organization committed to protecting and promoting women's \n     rights and eradicating discrimination in the workplace, the \n     National Partnership for Women & Families is troubled by \n     Judge Southwick's record and its implications for rights that \n     are vital to ensuring equal opportunity and access to \n     justice. Judge Southwick's failure to produce significant \n     portions of his record--effectively thwarting the thorough, \n     comprehensive review every federal appellate nomination \n     deserves and demands--only exacerbates these concerns.\n\n\n                           incomplete record\n\n       For the committee to consider fairly any nominee for a \n     lifetime appointment to a seat on the federal court of \n     appeals--the court of last resort in the vast majority of \n     cases--the nominee's entire record must be fully reviewed and \n     evaluated. Judge Southwick's failure to produce unpublished \n     opinions in which he participated and joined during his first \n     two years on the Mississippi Court of Appeals makes such \n     review impossible. These gaps in Judge Southwick's record \n     alone should give the committee pause in moving Judge \n     Southwick's nomination forward.\n\n\n                       A Setback for Civil Rights\n\n       A review of Judge Southwick's record calls into question \n     his commitment to the full enforcement of rights critical to \n     ensuring fair workplaces and access to justice. In Richmond \n     v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, 1999 Miss. App. \n     LEXIS 468 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999), Richmond, a social worker, \n     was terminated by the Mississippi Department of Human \n     Services for using a derogatory racial epithet. Richmond \n     appealed the decision and was reinstated by the state \n     Employee Appeals Board (EAB). A sharply divided Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals affirmed the EAB ruling. Judge Southwick \n     joined the Court of Appeals's 5-4 decision, which credited \n     Richmond's testimony that ``her remark was not motivated out \n     of racial hatred or animosity directed toward her co-worker \n     or toward blacks in general.'' The Mississippi Supreme Court \n     was unanimous in reversing the Court of Appeals, holding \n     instead that the EAB should either impose some penalty on \n     Richmond or make detailed findings why no penalty should be \n     imposed. Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \n     Services, 778 So. 2d 113, 114 (Miss. 2000). Three justices \n     would have gone further by reversing the EAB' s reinstatement \n     decision and upholding Richmond's termination.\n       Judge Southwick's decision to join the majority in this \n     case is deeply troubling. The EAB's written decision is \n     limited and provides little explanation of its reasoning. The \n     primary record about the incident at issue consists of the \n     hearing officer's findings. The hearing officer found that \n     the racial epithet used by Richmond--referring to an employee \n     as a ``good ole n***** ''--was once considered \n     ``derogatory,'' but was no longer evidence of racial \n     discrimination. Instead, he characterized the phrase as akin \n     to calling someone a ``teacher's pet,'' ``chubby,'' or \n     ``slim.'' These statements indicate a failure to take this \n     incident seriously and are wildly out of touch with the \n     deeply offensive and charged nature of racial slurs. The \n     hearing officer's findings should have raised a red flag, \n     particularly in light of the diversity of the agency where \n     Richmond worked, where more than half of the employees were \n     African American, and the undoubtedly very diverse client \n     base the agency served--all factors that further heightened \n     the need for sensitivity to issues of race.\n       Although Judge Southwick's ability to alter the outcome in \n     this case may have been constrained by the posture of the \n     case and the deferential standard of review, he still had \n     every opportunity to object to the use of the epithet and \n     demand a fuller explanation of why Richmond was reinstated by \n     writing a separate concurring opinion or working with the \n     authoring judge to modify the opinion. Judge Southwick did \n     neither of these things. That the dissenting judges on his \n     own court and each of the justices on the Mississippi Supreme \n     Court recognized the gravity of this incident while Judge \n     Southwick did not makes plain that Judge Southwick is out of \n     step with his peers on issues of racial justice. If the \n     opinion Judge Southwick joined had been the final word in \n     this case, Richmond would have been reinstated without any \n     discipline and would have faced no consequences for using a \n     horrible racial slur. Moreover, the underlying record and the \n     questionable assessment of the hearing officer would have \n     been left unrebutted, perhaps influencing the outcome of \n     future cases. Judge Southwick's deference to the decision of \n     the EAB despite the suspect findings on which that decision \n     was based calls into question his ability to apply the law to \n     ensure that workplaces in the Fifth Circuit--\n\n[[Page S13291]]\n\n     the circuit with the largest minority population--are free of \n     discrimination.\n       Judge Southwick displayed similar insensitivity to the \n     rights of minorities in S.B. v. L.W., 793 So. 2d 656 (Miss. \n     Ct. App. 2001), a case in which the Mississippi Court of \n     Appeals granted custody of a child to the child's father \n     based on a number of factors, including the mother's sexual \n     orientation. Not content simply to review the lower court's \n     application of the custody standard and explain why the \n     application was or was not correct, Justice Southwick joined \n     a separate opinion to emphasize the immorality of the \n     mother's ``choice'' to engage in a ``homosexual \n     lifestyle.'' His decision to join an opinion that injected \n     personal views and divisive rhetoric into the legal \n     analysis raises concerns about whether he will apply the \n     law without prejudice to all who may come before him as a \n     judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\n                      Hurdles for Injured Parties\n\n       Judge Southwick's ability to apply the law fairly is also \n     called into question by his lopsided record favoring business \n     interests over individuals and his tendency to deny \n     plaintiffs their right to have their cases decided by a jury \n     of their peers. According to published reports, Judge \n     Southwick voted, in whole or in part, against the injured \n     party and in favor of the defendant, in 160 out of 180 non-\n     unanimous published decisions involving state employment and \n     tort law. In a troubling number of cases, Judge Southwick \n     voted to prevent an injured party's case from being heard by \n     a jury based on cramped legal interpretations that erect \n     unreasonable barriers to pursuing one's day in court. See, \n     e.g., Cannon v. Mid-South X-Ray Co., 738 So. 2d 274 (Miss. \n     Ct. App. 1999).\n\n\n                  Curtailing Civil Rights Protections\n\n       Finally, Judge Southwick's view of the ``federalism \n     revival'' raises doubts about his commitment to civil rights \n     laws that have been essential to advancing equal employment \n     opportunities. In a 2003 article, Judge Southwick indicated \n     that he approved of the Supreme Court's recent limitations on \n     Congress's ability to pass civil rights legislation under its \n     commerce power, and on Congress's power to abrogate state \n     immunity and allow state employees to sue to vindicate their \n     rights under federal law. See Judge Leslie Southwick, \n     Separation of Powers at the State Level: Interpretations and \n     Challenges in Mississippi, 72 Miss. L. J. 927 (2003). This \n     narrow view of Congress's authority to combat and remedy \n     domestic violence and workplace discrimination raises \n     significant concerns for those who have looked to Congress to \n     ensure that crucial rights and protections extend to every \n     American.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       It is critical to ensure that judges elevated to the \n     federal appellate bench inspire confidence that the law is \n     being administered fairly, consistently, and without bias. \n     Because of the concerns outlined above, we urge the committee \n     to reject Judge Southwick's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Debra Ness,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         California State Conference of the National Association \n           for the Advancement of Colored People,\n                                    Sacramento, CA, June 13, 2007.\n     Re California State Conference of the NAACP opposition to the \n         nomination of Lesley Southwick to the 5th Circuit U.S. \n         Court of Appeals.\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The California State Conference of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP), our nation's oldest, largest and most widely \n     recognized grassroots civil rights organizer for stands in \n     strong opposition to the nomination of Lesley Southwick to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. After \n     thoughtful review and careful analysis of Judge Southwick's \n     record, it is clear that Judge Southwick has a disdain for \n     civil rights, evidenced by a substantial sentencing disparity \n     on the basis of ethnic identity where African Americans are \n     overwhelmingly incarcerated. It is equally important to note \n     that the 5th Circuit, which covers Louisiana, Mississippi and \n     Texas, has the highest concentration of racial and ethnic \n     minorities in the country.\n       Judge Southwick's record as a jurist on the Mississippi \n     State Court of Appeals clearly demonstrates that he is an \n     inappropriate nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     5th Circuit. In the case of Richmond v. Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 637 \n     (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), reversed, 745 So. 2d 254 (Miss. 1999). \n     Judge Southwick joined a 5-4 ruling upholding the \n     reinstatement of a white state social worker, Bonnie \n     Richmond, who had been fired for referring to an African \n     American co-worker as ``a good ole nigger'' at an employment-\n     related conference. Richmond worked for the Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services (``DHS''), which terminated her \n     employment after other employees raised concerns about her \n     use of the racial slur. The ruling that Southwick joined was \n     unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.\n       The California State Conference of the NAACP is further \n     disturbed by Judge Southwick's rulings on race discrimination \n     in jury selection. His rulings demonstrate a clear lack of \n     support for or even understanding of the basis for civil \n     rights for African Americans in the American legal system. \n     Dozens of cases in this area reveal a pattern in which Judge \n     Southwick rejected the claims that the prosecution was \n     racially motivated in striking African American jurors \n     while upholding claims that the defense struck white \n     jurors on the basis of their race. In Bumphis v. State, \n     and appellate colleague accused Judge Southwick of \n     ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and \n     a higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''\n       The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has a history of \n     protecting and even promoting the civil rights of the racial \n     and ethnic minorities living within its jurisdiction. The \n     current court, however, does not appear to be following this \n     trend; indeed they appear more interested in curbing civil \n     rights and retarding civil liberties. Given Judge Southwick's \n     record, we believe he would only perpetuate this \n     discriminatory trend if he were confirmed. Therefore the \n     California State Conference of the NAACP must oppose Judge \n     Southwick's nomination to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals \n     and urge you to do the same when his nomination is considered \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       On behalf of the California State Conference of the NAACP, \n     I want to thank the Senate Judiciary Committee for its \n     consideration of our letter of opposition to the Southwick \n     nomination. Should you have any questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Alice A. Huffman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Congressional Black Caucus\n\n\n                          of the 110th United States Congress,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2007.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President, United States of America, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Mr. President: On behalf of the nearly forty million \n     Americans we represent, including those in Louisiana, \n     Mississippi and your home state of Texas, we urge you to \n     withdraw the nomination on Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. To say that our opposition to Mr. \n     Southwick is strong and unequivocal would be an \n     understatement.\n       As you know, the Fifth Circuit presides over the largest \n     percentage of minority residents (44%) of any circuit. It has \n     issued seminal decisions on voting rights, affirmative \n     action, employment discrimination, discriminatory jury \n     selection, and the death penalty.\n       The Southwick nomination fails to remedy the egregious \n     problem with the lack of diversity on Mississippi's federal \n     bench. It bears noting that Mississippi has the highest \n     African-American population (36%) of any state in the \n     country. Yet, you have nominated ten individuals to the \n     federal bench in Mississippi, none of whom has been African-\n     American. While you have nominated three individuals to the \n     Fifth Circuit, none of them has been approved. The Southwick \n     nomination would compound the absence of diversity with a \n     nominee with an unacceptable record on race.\n       Please consider Mr. Southwick's judicial record in the \n     following cases:\n       In Richmond v. MS Dep't of Human Services, 1998 Miss. App. \n     LEXIS 637 (Miss. App. Ct. 1998), Southwick joined a decision \n     reinstating the job of a white employee who had used the word \n     ``nigger'' toward an African-American coworker.\n       At an employment related conference, the white employee had \n     called the black employee ``a good ole nigger,'' and then \n     used the very same term toward the employee the next day back \n     at the office. The white employee was fired.\n       The opinion joined by Southwick was reversed by the \n     Mississippi Supreme Court. 745 So. 2d 254 (Miss. 1999). No \n     one on the Supreme Court thought that the ruling of \n     Southwick's court was correct. They reversed and remanded the \n     case on the nature of the penalty or to make detailed \n     findings on the record why no penalty should be imposed. Some \n     members of the Supreme Court would not only have reversed, \n     but would have reinstated the judgment of the Circuit Court \n     upholding the termination.\n       In Brock v. Mississippi, No. 94-LA-00634 (Miss. App. Ct. \n     Dec. 2, 1997), Southwick authored an opinion upholding a \n     conviction where the defendant had challenged the \n     prosecution's strike of an African-American juror.\n       The prosecution had responded by stating that the juror was \n     struck because he lived in a high crime area.\n       Southwick held that ``striking a juror based upon residency \n     in a high crime area is a race neutral explanation.'' Another \n     Court of Appeals judge disagreed with such a broad holding: \n     ``While [another state] has adopted the position that being a \n     resident of a high crime area is automatically a race neutral \n     reason to strike a potential juror, I am not\n\n[[Page S13292]]\n\n     prepared to do so. Given existing housing patterns and common \n     sense, there are generally, common racial characteristics \n     shared by persons, who reside in so-called high crime areas. \n     To accept without reservation, a strike which on its face, \n     appears geared toward a racially identifiable group, has the \n     potential for great mischief.'' (King, J., concurring in \n     result).\n       It is clear from this record that Mr. Southwick is not \n     properly suited to serve on the Fifth Circuit. In 160 out of \n     180 published decisions on state employment law or torts in \n     which one judge dissented, Southwick voted in favor of the \n     corporate defendant, in whole or in part.\n       Mr. Southwick's intolerant racial views and his fixed \n     right-wing worldview make support for him a vote against \n     everything the CBC and African-Americans are striving for in \n     2007. Your continued support of Mr. Southwick would make a \n     bad Fifth Circuit problem worse. We trust that your \n     reconsideration of this nomination will result in a fairer \n     Fifth Circuit that is truly representative of the diverse \n     populations served by the Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick,\n                                Chair, Congressional Black Caucus.\n     Bennie Thompson,\n     Member, Congressional Black Caucus.\n                                  ____\n\n         Washington Bureau, National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.\n     Re NAACP reiteration of strong opposition to the nomination \n         of Lesley Southwick to the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of \n         Appeals.\n\n     Members,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators; On behalf of the National Association for \n     the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), our nation's \n     oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots civil \n     rights organization, I am writing to reiterate our \n     organization's strong opposition to the nomination of Lesley \n     Southwick to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. \n     Our opposition comes after a careful and thorough review of \n     Judge Southwick's record, and our resulting dismay with his \n     dismal record on civil rights. Our opposition to his \n     nomination is amplified by the fact that the 5th Circuit, \n     which covers Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas has the highest \n     concentration of racial and ethnic minority Americans in our \n     country.\n       Judge Southwick's record as a judge on the Mississippi \n     State Court of Appeals clearly demonstrates that he is an \n     inappropriate nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     5th Circuit. In the case of Richmond v. Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 637 \n     (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), reversed, 745 So. 2d 254 (Miss. 1999), \n     Judge Southwick joined a 5-4 ruling upholding the \n     reinstatement of a white state social worker, Bonnie \n     Richmond, who had been fired for referring to an African \n     American co-worker as ``a good ole nigger'' at an employment-\n     related conference. Richmond worked for the Mississippi \n     Department of Human Services (``DHS''), which terminated her \n     employment after other employees raised concerns about her \n     use of the racial slur. The ruling that Southwick joined was \n     unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.\n       The NAACP is further disturbed by Judge Southwick's rulings \n     on race discrimination in jury selection. They demonstrate a \n     clear lack of support for, or even understanding of the basic \n     civil rights of African Americans in the American legal \n     system. Dozens of cases in this area reveal a pattern in \n     which Judge Southwick rejected the claims that the \n     prosecution was racially motivated in striking African \n     American jurors while upholding claims that the defense \n     struck white jurors on the basis of their race. In Bumphis v. \n     State, an appellate colleague accused Judge Southwick of \n     ``establishing one level of obligation for the State, and a \n     higher one for defendants on an identical issue.''\n       The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has a history of \n     protecting and even promoting the civil rights of the racial \n     and ethnic minorities living within its jurisdiction. The \n     current court, however, does not appear to be following this \n     trend; indeed they appear more interested in curbing civil \n     rights and retarding civil liberties. Given Judge Southwick's \n     record, we believe he would only perpetuate this sad trend if \n     he were confirmed. Thus, the NAACP must oppose Judge \n     Southwick's nomination to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals \n     and urge you to do the same when his nomination is considered \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Finally, given Mississippi's long history of racial \n     apartheid, disenfranchisement, interposition, nullification \n     and massive resistance, it is unfathomable that President \n     Bush has not nominated a single African American to serve on \n     the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit or any of the \n     district courts during his tenure in office. This is \n     especially mind-boggling, given that 37% of Mississippi's \n     population is African American, the highest percentage of all \n     50 states. While it certainly is the President's prerogative \n     to nominate the individuals of his choice to the federal \n     judiciary, and while the NAACP does not advocate the \n     nomination of unqualified individuals simply because of the \n     color of his or her skin, we unequivocally reject the notion \n     that there are no qualified African Americans to fill this \n     vacancy on the 5th Circuit. Lesley Southwick's nomination \n     continues a stark pattern of racial discrimination and racial \n     exclusion in appointments by President Bush in a state and a \n     region that continues to need integration. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee must defeat Lesley Southwick's nomination \n     based on his clear lack of qualifications and merit. This \n     will provide President Bush with the opportunity to nominate \n     a well-qualified racial or ethnic minority individual with \n     the appropriate judicial temperament to dispense justice as \n     intended by our Constitution.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to the NAACP's \n     strong opposition to the Southwick nomination. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me if there is any more information I can \n     provide you on our position, or if you have any questions or \n     comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the nomination of Leslie \nSouthwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals because I have serious \nquestions about his ability to be an impartial jurist.\n  I am concerned that Judge Southwick's views of racial discrimination \nin jury selection reflect a lack of adequate respect for Supreme Court \nprecedent. In Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court ruled against \npreemptory dismissal of jurors without stating a valid cause for doing \nso may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race.\n  The contrast between Judge Southwick's votes in jury challenge cases \nis particularly troubling. In the majority of cases where African-\nAmerican defendants have challenged their convictions on the ground \nthat the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike African-\nAmerican jurors, Judge Southwick voted against the defendant's \nchallenge. Further, in the majority of cases where African-American \ndefendants challenged their convictions on the ground that the \nprosecution had unfairly prevented them from using their peremptory \nchallenges to exclude White--or in one case Asian American--jurors, the \ndefendants, with Judge Southwick joining the majority, lost the \nchallenges.\n  There is other evidence of racial insensitivity that concerns me. In \nRichmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, Judge Southwick \njoined a 5-4 ruling upholding the reinstatement of a White State social \nworker who had been fired for referring to an African-American co-\nworker as a ``good ole n*****'' during a meeting with high level \ncompany officials. After she was fired, Richmond appealed her \ntermination to the State Employee Appeals Board, EAB, which ordered her \nreinstatement. The hearing officer opined that Richmond's use of the \nracial slur ``was in effect calling the individual a `teacher's pet.''' \nOn appeal, Judge Southwick joined a majority that held that the use of \nthe racial slur was ``not motivated out of racial hatred or animosity \ndirected at her co-worker or toward blacks in general, but was, rather, \nintended to be a shorthand description of her perception of the \nrelationship existing between the [co-]worker and [a] DHS supervisor.''\n  In dissent, two judges criticized the hearing officer and majority \nopinion for having a ``sanitized version'' of the facts and for \nsuggesting that ``absent evidence of a near race riot, the remark is \ntoo inconsequential to serve as a basis of dismissal.'' The dissent \nfound that the racial epithet of ``n*****'' is ``inherently offensive, \nand [its] use establishes the intent to offend.''\n  The ruling Judge Southwick joined was unanimously reversed and \nremanded on appeal by the Mississippi Supreme Court.\n  Further, in Brock v. Mississippi, a case which upheld a criminal \nconviction where the prosecution used a preemptory challenge against an \nAfrican-American juror purportedly because he lived in a high crime \narea, the dissenting judge criticized Judge Southwick's opinion for \naccepting the action of the prosecutor, which, ``on its face appears \ngeared toward a racially identifiable group.''\n  Some have tried to make the point that Judge Southwick did not write \nmost of these opinions; rather that he merely signed on to them. If \nJudge Southwick did not agree with those opinions, he could have \ndissented. If he agreed with the holding but not the reasoning, he \ncould have written a separate concurrence. To the contrary, he simply \nvoted with the majority and supported their opinions.\n\n[[Page S13293]]\n\n  Because I do not believe that his record reflects the objectivity and \neven-handedness necessary to serve in a lifetime appointment on the \nFederal bench, I cannot vote to confirm his nomination.\n   Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today the Senate has a golden opportunity \nto take a big stride forward in working its way out of this judicial \nnomination mess we are in. At some point we as a body are going to have \nto take partisanship out of this judicial nomination process if we hope \nto continue to attract great candidates to the Federal bench. We have \nseen other great nominees withdraw because of the stress and difficulty \nof this process. Fortunately, Judge Southwick has stood firm so that \nthe Senate has a chance to confirm him.\n  Leslie Southwick is an Iraq veteran and has already demonstrated that \nhe is a great jurist. From the testimonials of people in Mississippi, \nregardless of political or cultural differences, he is fairminded, not \nbiased, and is an outstanding pick for this seat.\n  It is incredible to observe the vitriolic opposition to this \nnomination that is built wholly on two written opinions in question \nthat Judge Southwick did not even write. How can the Senate seriously \nsay that those two opinions, in a vacuum, show that Judge Southwick is \nracist or insensitive to minority litigants? The support from African-\nAmericans in Mississippi exposes that the opposition is politically \nmotivated.\n  The Senate and the Judiciary Committee must step away from the \npolitically based litmus tests that currently control the nominations \nprocess. We must also stop focusing purely on the results of cases, \nwithout any context to the facts and law at issue, as the sole \nindicator of a nominee's judicial philosophy.\n  I ask my colleagues to seriously reconsider our current course and \nlet Judge Southwick have a fair up-or-down vote.\n  When we are reviewing judicial nominees, we should ask ourselves \nthree questions:\n  First, does the nominee have the basic qualifications to be a good \njudge?\n  In this case, the answer is yes. The American Bar Association twice \nrated Judge Southwick ``well qualified,'' with the ABA actually \nincreasing their rating to ``unanimously well qualified'' when he was \nnominated to the Fifth Circuit vacancy.\n  Second, does the nominee possess the appropriate judicial temperament \nso that every litigant will be treated fairly when they come before \nthis nominee?\n  The answer again is yes. If you read the many letters from lawyers \nand judges in the Mississippi legal community, they clearly believe \nlitigants are treated fairly and impartially before Judge Southwick.\n  Third, does the nominee respect the proper constitutional role of a \njudge to not create law from the bench?\n  Again the answer is yes. The record clearly demonstrates that Judge \nSouthwick is and will be a restrained jurist.\n  As Congress we should be thrilled when a judge shows that he will be \nrestrained in his rulings from the bench. We write the laws, and we \nshould be grateful that a judge knows he is not a Member of Congress \nand will defer to us in the task of writing law.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to move beyond petty partisanship with \nquality nominees like Judge Southwick, and let's give him a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 27 minutes, including leadership \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is that 27 minutes on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Might I inquire of the senior Senator from Mississippi how much time \nhe would like?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would be happy to speak for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is very difficult to listen to the \ncriticism of those who have not known Leslie Southwick in the context \nand with the experiences of those, obviously, who have worked with him, \nobserved him in close range as a fellow lawyer, seen him take positions \nof public support for candidates who were running for office in \nMississippi, being active in our Republican Party in Mississippi; being \nadmired widely by all who have come to know him, practicing law with \nhim, observing him as a lecturer at the Mississippi College School of \nLaw, observing him serving voluntarily as an officer in the Mississippi \nNational Guard, the U.S. Army Reserves, being deployed to Iraq, \nvolunteering for duty to serve as a judge advocate, and accompanying \nMississippi soldiers who were deployed to that region in time of war.\n\n  He didn't have to do that. He is way beyond the age of most of those \nwho were engaged in that operation and in that responsibility to \nprotect the security interests of our country.\n  It is so inconsistent--all of that--to those of us who know this \nnominee compared with the harsh, shrill pronouncements being made on \nthis floor of the U.S. Senate by leaders of the opposition to this \nnomination. I am not going to criticize their right to disagree with \nthose of us who support Judge Southwick, but I do want to point out \nthat I hope Senators will look at the record that has been accumulated \nin the Senate as a result of statements made by Senator Lott, me, and \nothers who have known Judge Southwick and others who are the most \nrespectable and trustworthy people in our State and Nation who have a \ntotally different view of him as a person and of his record as an \nappellate judge, as a lawyer, and as a professor of law.\n  I hope Senators will take a look at who is saying what and base a \njudgment on this nomination on the things that have been said and the \ninformation that has been made available to the Senate from those who \nhave spent time with Judge Southwick, who know him, or whether that \nwill be outweighed by the harsh and shrill blandishments and criticisms \nand hyperbole and exaggerations and inaccuracies in the description of \nthis person as a lawyer, as an individual, as a citizen who is here \nbeing subjected to totally unfounded criticism.\n  I hope those words aren't too harsh. I believe they are just as true \nand accurate as can be. And it would be a disgrace on this body to \nblock the confirmation, to vote against invoking cloture which, in \neffect, would kill the nomination. We are going to vote on whether to \ninvoke cloture. It will take 60 votes to shut off debate so we can get \nto a vote on the confirmation.\n  I have spoken on the floor on two or three occasions on this subject, \nback in June, I think, the first time. I have been reading the Record \nand looking at what I said July 19, 2007. I included after my remarks \nletters that I had received and that the committee had received from \nlawyers, judges, and acquaintances of Leslie Southwick over the past 30 \nyears of his life. I am not going to burden the Record by putting all \nthose letters in or reading them or reading excerpts from them, but \nthese are some of the finest people, and some of them are liberal \nDemocrats. Some of them are active today as elected officials in our \nState. Others are just fellow lawyers, people who have worked with him \nclosely, a State supreme court justice. Former Gov. William Winter is \nan example.\n  This morning, I found on my desk in my office when I came to work a \nletter that had been faxed to me, I guess, this morning. At 9:01 a.m. \nit was received in my office. It is from the Secretary of State of \nMississippi, Eric Clark. And because this is a new letter, I think I \nwill read it. It is actually addressed to me and Senator Lott:\n\n       Dear Senator Cochran and Senator Lott:\n       I sat at home last night and listened on C-SPAN to the \n     debate on Judge Leslie Southwick, and I feel compelled to \n     write you this letter.\n       I am the senior Democratic elected official in Mississippi. \n     I have been elected to office eight times as a Democrat. I am \n     retiring from politics in January, so I have no ax to grind \n     by commenting on this debate. During my entire career in \n     public service, I have aggressively promoted the inclusion of \n     all Mississippians, and particularly African-Americans, at \n     the decision-making table in Mississippi. I take a back seat \n     to no one in promoting inclusion in our state.\n\n[[Page S13294]]\n\n       It has been my pleasure to know Leslie Southwick for more \n     than twenty years. If I had to name one person who is kind, \n     fair, smart, thoughtful, and open-minded, it would be Leslie \n     Southwick. For any Senators who have been told or who have \n     concluded otherwise, that is wrong--as wrong as it can be.\n       We in Mississippi are quite accustomed to being the objects \n     of negative stereotyping. Of course, it is much easier to \n     believe a stereotype about someone than to make the effort to \n     get to know that person. It is perfectly clear to me that \n     this is what is happening to Judge Southwick.\n       It seems to me that what is being decided in this case is \n     not whether Leslie Southwick would be a good and fair judge--\n     we could not have a better or fairer one. What is being \n     decided, I think, is whether the United States Senate \n     considers judicial nominees based on truth and merit, or \n     based on politics and partisanship.\n       Let me make my point as plainly as I can: Leslie Southwick \n     is the polar opposite of an ignorant and bigoted judge--the \n     polar opposite of that stereotype. I hope that the Senate \n     passes the test of recognizing the truth and acting \n     accordingly.\n       Thank you. Sincerely, Eric Clark, Secretary of State of \n     Mississippi.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, including \nthe leadership time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I see the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nLott, on the Senate floor. How much time would Senator Lott like?\n  Mr. LOTT. Just a couple minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Lott can have as much time as he wants. It \nsounds as if he wants 5 minutes. I yield to Senator Lott.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't want to repeat everything that has \nbeen said. I was going to read this letter from our secretary of state, \nEric Clark. My senior colleague just read it, and I am glad he did. I \nappreciate how he feels.\n  I do feel hurt in some ways by what has happened in this particular \ncase. This is a good and honorable man, qualified by education, by \nexperience, by temperament. He deserves to have an up-or-down vote. We \nshould vote for cloture, and then we should have an up-or-down vote on \nthis judge for a position that is a judicial emergency for the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which is a very broad-based circuit court of \nappeals. He will be a fine addition to that court.\n  I want to end on a positive note because Judge Southwick has waited a \nlong time, has been open and available to anybody who was willing to \nmeet with him, not just the Judiciary Committee members but others, \nincluding House Members.\n  We are here because Senator Dianne Feinstein showed unbelievable \ncourage by voting to report this nominee out of the Judiciary Committee \nafter very careful analysis, looking at the cases, meeting with the \nnominee. I will always be indebted to her and appreciative of what she \ndid.\n  I have to acknowledge that the Judiciary Committee, in this case led \nby the very aggressive support of Senator Specter, has done its job, \nand has done it well, and we have reached a point of final \ndetermination.\n  I also thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for \nworking together to find time to make this happen. I know from \nexperience, majority leaders do not have to allow votes such as this to \noccur, and I suspect the majority leader has been criticized for it.\n  I do believe that this is a moment in time--I hope it is not \nfleeting--where we can return to some modicum, some small amount of \nbipartisanship, nonpartisanship, and civility. I think Senator Reid, \nSenator McConnell, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Specter have made the \nright steps to make that possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and vote for this nominee. \nHe will be a credit to the court on which he will serve, the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He will exhibit the character and the \npositions that I believe the people in the Senate will think are \nappropriate for the rest of his life.\n  I believe confirmation of this judge will reflect well on the Senate \nand will pay dividends in many ways not visible at this moment.\n  I thank Senator Specter for yielding this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we only have the Senators from \nMississippi and myself on the floor. For any other Republicans who wish \nto speak, now would be a good time to come to the floor. I know our \nleader, Senator McConnell, will be speaking shortly, at 10:40 a.m., but \nthere is still 11 minutes remaining.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Florida, Mr. \nMartinez.\n  Mr. President, that will take us right up to 10:40 a.m., at which \ntime it is my understanding there is an order for the two leaders to \nspeak. I yield 10 minutes now to Senator Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Florida is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nam very pleased to speak on behalf of a good man to occupy a very \nimportant position. The Fifth Circuit is a very important court. I want \nto talk about this nomination as a person who practiced law for a \nquarter of a century. Twenty-five years of my life I spent in \ncourtrooms in Florida. As a result of that experience, I have a great \nand abiding respect for our judicial system and for what it does for \npeople to reasonably and in an orderly way settle disputes, and also \nfor those who run afoul of the law to be brought through a justice \nsystem that is fair, that is just, and that works for all Americans.\n  At the pinnacle of all that, at the very centerpiece of the judicial \nsystem that functions is the judiciary. And in the judiciary, we need \nto have the best. We need to have people of dedication. We need to have \npeople of competence and people with impeccable credentials. That is \nthe kind of judge Judge Southwick is and the kind of person he will \nmake as a judge on the Fifth Circuit.\n  I wish to talk about the process. It is a process that has become \nmuch too poisoned. It has become much too divisive and increasingly \nhostile. What occurs then is that between the inadequate salaries \njudges in the Federal judiciary now make in comparison to what they \ncould easily be making in the private sector, as well as the difficult \ngauntlet they must run in order to be confirmed and to then have the \nopportunity of serving their Nation as a member of the judiciary, I do \nbelieve it is very important that judicial candidates be given a fair \nand timely hearing, that they be given fair and timely consideration.\n  I believe all too often we allow dissident groups to gain our \nattention, not mine but some of those who do pay attention to the \noutside noise when it comes to judicial candidates. I don't believe it \nis appropriate that we should allow for outside influences to steer us \nin different directions that become more and more divisive.\n  When it comes to judicial candidates, we ought to look for \nqualifications. We ought to look for experience. We ought to look for \nthose things we could consider. I always think, is this the kind of \njudge I would like to try a case in front of, is this the kind of judge \nI would like to take my clients' affairs in front of to have a fair, \nimpartial, and reasoned disposition of the matter I bring before the \njudge? If he or she is that kind of person, they should be given \nconfirmation. To allow outside and distracting political debates to be \na part of the confirmation process is simply wrong.\n  I was pleased when Chief Justice Roberts was going through the \nprocess and he used language in his confirmation hearing that ought to \nring true with all of us. He said he viewed his role as a judge as that \nof an umpire. He viewed his role as someone who could come into the \ncourtroom and call it as he sees it, call balls and strikes. For the \nvast majority of what a judge does, that is what it is about. It is \nabout calling balls and strikes. It is not about pitching. It is not \nabout catching, not about hitting. It is about calling balls and \nstrikes. That is the role of the judge. That is the role of the \njudiciary. We honor that role when we accept a judicial candidate who \nis otherwise qualified, who has an impeccable record. I used to be \ncalled from\n\n[[Page S13295]]\n\ntime to time by the ABA committee, the American Bar Association, that \nlooks at candidates and they would ask: What kind of judge would he \nmake? Would he have the right judicial temperament? These are the \nthings we want to know. Is he knowledgeable of the law? Would he be a \nfair and impartial judge? Does he have the ethical considerations to be \nthe kind of person who is going to set higher standards for those on \nthe bar, who is going to be the kind of person society will accept when \nhe makes a difficult ruling that sometimes has to come from the court?\n  It is with great pleasure that I support this nominee. I hope my \ncolleagues will do so as well. It is important we restore a certain \nnormalcy to the confirmation process. I say this fully understanding \nthat in about a year and some months, there could very well be someone \nof a different party who has a very different philosophy about who \nshould be on the bench than the current President. At that time, I will \nbe prepared to live by the standard I have laid out today, which is a \nstandard of qualifications, a standard that puts aside political \nconsiderations, a standard that looks at a judicial nominee, as we have \ndone for most of the history of our country. The departure we have had \nover the last several years is not a healthy one. It is not positive \nfor the judicial system and for the admission of justice. This is a \nstandard I will be prepared to live with, even if someone from a \ndifferent party than mine is making judicial nominations. I will look \nto their qualifications, experience, ethical standing. Is this the kind \nof judge I would have been happy to have my client take matters before.\n  I would expect a fair and impartial judge to make a learned and \nreasonable decision based on the facts, the evidence, and the law. That \nis what judges are about, analyzing facts and law and making a judicial \ndetermination of how to rule in a given case. It is not about politics \nthat more belong in a body such as ours and not on the bench.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 5\\1/2\\ minutes before leadership \ntime.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, shortly we will have an extremely \nimportant vote in terms of our ability to deal with judicial \nconfirmations in the future. There has been widespread bipartisan \nconcern that the confirmation process has descended to a point with \nwhich most of the Members on both sides of the aisle are uncomfortable. \nWe will have an interesting test shortly as to whether the Senate can \nuse cloture not to defeat a judge but to move a nomination forward. \nThat is the way it has been done in the past. We have had controversial \njudicial nominations from time to time over the years, controversial \nwith a few but not all of the Senate. The way cloture was used in those \nsituations was to advance a nomination, not to stop it. I am reminded \nwhen Senator Lott was the majority leader, there were a couple of \ncontroversial nominations from California. His view was they were \nentitled to an up-or-down vote. We invoked cloture on the nomination. I \nremember voting for cloture because I believed judges were entitled to \nan up-or-down vote and then not supporting the judge on final passage.\n  We have before us the nomination of a Mississippi lawyer named Leslie \nSouthwick. He wanted to serve his country in the Armed Forces. At 42, \nhe was too old to do so. But service to others is a duty Leslie \nSouthwick has always taken very seriously, whether in the Justice \nDepartment or on the State bench or with Habitat for Humanity or in \ndoing charity work for inner-city communities. So in 1992, 42-year-old \nLeslie Southwick sought an age waiver to join the U.S. Army Reserves. \nThe country had the good sense and the good fortune to grant this \nrequest.\n  Leslie Southwick continued to serve in the Armed Forces after he was \nelected to the State court of appeals in 1994. He conscientiously \nperformed his military and judicial duties, even using his vacation \ntime from the court to satisfy the required service period in the \nMississippi National Guard.\n  In 2003, LTC Southwick volunteered for a line combat unit, the 155th \nSeparate Armor Brigade. His commanding officer, MG Harold A. Cross, \nnotes that his decision ``was a courageous move; as it was widely known \nat the time that the 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for overseas \nduty in the near future.'' Colleagues such as attorney Brian Montague \nwere not surprised. ``Despite the love of wife and children,'' Leslie \nSouthwick volunteered for a line combat unit over a safer one ``because \nof a commitment to service to country above self-interest.''\n  In August of 2004, Leslie Southwick's unit mobilized in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. His commanding officer states he distinguished \nhimself at forward bases near Najaf. Another officer, LTC Norman Gene \nHortman, Jr., described Leslie Southwick's service in Iraq as follows:\n\n       Service in a combat zone is stressful and challenging, \n     often times bringing out the best or the worst in a person. \n     Leslie Southwick endured mortar and rocket attacks, travel \n     through areas plagued with IEDs, extremes in temperature, \n     harsh living conditions . . .--the typical stuff of Iraq. He \n     shouldered a heavy load of regular JAG Officer duties which \n     he performed excellently. He also took on the task of \n     handling the claims of numerous Iraqi civilians who had been \n     injured or had property losses due to accidents involving the \n     U.S. military . . .\n       Leslie always listened to these Iraqi claimants patiently \n     and treated them with the utmost respect and kindness. He did \n     this not just out of a sense of duty but because he is a \n     genuinely good and caring person. His attitude left a very \n     positive impression on all those that Leslie came in contact \n     with, especially Iraqi civilians he helped. This in turn \n     helped ease tensions in our unit's area of operations . . . \n     and ultimately, saved American lives.\n\n  Lieutenant Colonel Hortman concludes that Leslie Southwick ``has the \nright stuff''--the right stuff--for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals: \n``profound intelligence, good judgment, broad experience, and an \nunblemished reputation.'' He adds:\n\n       I know him and can say these things without reservation. \n     Anyone who says otherwise simply does not know him.\n\n  Stuart Taylor writes in the National Journal that Leslie Southwick \n``wears a distinctive badge of courageous service to his country,'' and \nthat he ``is a professionally well-qualified and personally admirable'' \nnominee to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Judge Southwick does not seek thanks or notoriety or charity for his \nmilitary and other civic service. He asks to be judged fairly--to be \njudged on the facts, to be judged on his record. It is the same \nstandard he has applied to others as a judge, a military officer, and a \nteacher. It is a standard for which he is well known and admired. By \nthat standard, he is superbly fit to continue serving his country, this \ntime on the Fifth Circuit. Senators Cochran and Lott, his home State \nSenators, know this. They are strongly behind him. As everyone knows, \nhis peers on the State bar know this. They honored him as one of the \nState's finest jurists, saying he is ``an example of judicial \nexcellence; a leader in advancing the quality and integrity of justice; \nand a person of high ideals, character and integrity.''\n  The American Bar Association knows this. It has twice given him its \nhighest rating: ``well-qualified.'' In doing so, the ABA found him to \nbe exemplary in the areas of ``compassion,'' ``open-mindedness,'' \n``freedom from bias and commitment to equal justice under law.''\n  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee knew this too. Last fall all of \nthem--every single one--looked at his record and approved him for a \nlifetime position to the district court. Congress adjourned before he \ncould be confirmed, and Judge Southwick was renominated to fill a \njudicial emergency on the Fifth Circuit. Two things then occurred. \nFirst, the ABA increased his rating--increased his rating--from ``well-\nqualified'' to ``unanimously well-qualified.'' In other words, not a \nsingle person on the ABA committee found him anything other than the \nmost qualified nominee possible. Second, in August, the committee \nfavorably reported his nomination to the floor with bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S13296]]\n\n  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side who had \nsupported his nomination to the Federal bench last fall seem to have \nchanged their mind. Since there is no material change in Judge \nSouthwick's credentials other than the ABA actually giving him an even \nhigher rating for the circuit bench than they gave him for the district \nbench, the sudden change is indeed puzzling.\n  Critics now point to two cases out of 7,000, neither of which Judge \nSouthwick wrote, and both of which existed when the committee \nunanimously approved him last fall. One of our colleagues even asserts \nthat because these two cases create a perception among some outside \ngroups about potential unfairness, this ``perceived fairness'' standard \nshould determine our vote on Judge Southwick.\n  That is a standard I would say I would hate to have applied to \nnominations by a Democratic President by Republican Senators. And \nremember, we are setting a standard here that will apply not only to \nthis nomination but to other nominations in the future.\n  The notion that mere perception, not reality, should determine \nwhether someone is confirmed is troubling, to say the least. We expect \nthe judges we confirm to rule based on the facts. We should not judge \ntheir fitness for office based on perception rather than the facts. In \nthe case of Judge Southwick, the sudden ``perception'' about his \nfairness is driven by those who do not even know him, and it is amply \ndisproven by his long record and by those who know him very well.\n  But more broadly, if we start opposing well-qualified nominees \nbecause outside groups have manufactured an unfair perception of them, \nthen we will have established a precedent that will affect us all, as I \nindicated a minute ago, and for the worse--regardless of who is in the \nWhite House and which home State Senators support a nomination. Is the \nstandard going to be around here the perception created by some outside \ngroup? I think that is a standard that would be very dangerous, no \nmatter who is in the White House.\n  I urge my colleagues not to undo the good work and goodwill that \nbrought us back from the precipice we had almost descended into a few \nyears ago on judicial confirmations. I urge them to think hard about \nthe ramifications of their vote for the future, and to vote for cloture \non the Southwick nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nopposition and concern from numerous organizations regarding the \nnomination now before the Senate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Fair Housing Alliance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: The National Fair Housing Alliance \n     (NFHA) is strongly opposed to the nomination of Leslie \n     Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       NFHA is dedicated to ending housing discrimination and \n     ensuring equal housing opportunity for all people. With \n     several member organizations within the Fifth Circuit, we are \n     deeply concerned about a nominee whose civil rights record \n     reveals a lack of commitment to equality and justice.\n       We find the civil rights record of Judge Southwick on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals quite troubling. His rulings on \n     race discrimination in the areas of employment and jury \n     selection lead us to question his ability to be a fair and \n     impartial decision-maker in cases involving housing \n     discrimination.\n       Judge Southwick participated in a shocking 5-4 decision \n     that essentially excused an employee's use of a racial slur. \n     The holding in Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human \n     Services affirmed a Mississippi Employee Appeals Board \n     hearing officer's decision to reinstate an employee who had \n     been fired for calling her co-worker a ``good ore nigger.'' \n     The officer had concluded that the employer had overreacted \n     because the term was not a racial slur but rather equivalent \n     to calling the black employee ``teacher's pet.'' The \n     majority, including Judge Southwick, agreed, finding that \n     taken in context, the comment ``was not motivated out of \n     racial hatred or racial animosity directed toward a \n     particular co-worker or toward blacks in general.''\n       This decision drew a strong dissent and was unanimously \n     reversed by the Mississippi Supreme Court. The dissenters \n     stated that the majority's reasoning ``strains credulity'' \n     because ``[t]he word `nigger' is, and has always been \n     offensive.'' They went on to argue that ``the hearing officer \n     and the majority opinion seem to suggest that absent \n     evidence of a near race riot, the remark is too \n     inconsequential to serve as a basis of dismissal.''\n       Judge Southwick's reasoning in Richmond is indicative of a \n     general lack of concern for rice discrimination, and it \n     reveals a potential hostility toward equal opportunity in \n     housing. Many cases of housing discrimination involve \n     intimidation through racial slurs. In this context, as in all \n     contexts, the word ``nigger'' is powerful, offensive, and \n     threatening. The following cases are indicative of the \n     pervasive nature of this deplorable conduct in housing cases:\n       In Bradley v. Carydale Enterprises, the Eastern District of \n     Virginia ordered compensatory damages for an African-American \n     woman whose neighbor had called her ``nigger.'' The court \n     noted that the term ``deeply wounded'' the woman, pointing to \n     her humiliation and embarrassment, sleepless nights, and \n     inability to perform at her job.\n       In Smith v. Mission Associates Ltd. Partnership, an on-site \n     property manager called a white tenant a ``nigger-lover'' \n     because of his live-in girlfriend's bi-racial children, and \n     the manager's son told one of these children he didn't like \n     ``niggers.'' Based on this and other racially hostile \n     conduct, the District of Kansas held that the plaintiffs had \n     established a prima facie case for a hostile housing \n     environment under the Fair Housing Act.\n       In Cousins v. Bray, the Southern District of Ohio granted \n     the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against \n     eviction and any attempts of harassment, intimidation, or \n     threats. The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations \n     that defendants had referred to their biracial sons as \n     ``niggers'' helped to establish that race motivated their \n     eviction, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n       And just this month, in United States v. Craft, the Seventh \n     Circuit relied on an arsonist's use of the term ``nigger'' to \n     determine that he targeted a black man's house because of the \n     victim's race. It held the arsonist in violation of the \n     portion of the Fair Housing Act that prohibits the use of \n     coercion or intimidation to interfere with property rights.\n       As these cases demonstrate, our federal courts acknowledge \n     that harmful racial slurs like ``nigger'' are powerful tools \n     in the denial of fair housing. We are deeply concerned that \n     based on his record, Judge Southwick does not share these \n     ideals, and we question his ability to be a fair and \n     impartial decision-maker in these and other civil rights \n     cases.\n       Thus, we strongly oppose Judge Southwick's nomination to \n     the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and believe the Senate \n     should not confirm him.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Shanna Smith,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Service Employees\n\n\n                                          International Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am \n     writing on behalf of the 1.8 million members of the Service \n     Employees International Union (SEIU), including the health \n     care, public sector and property service members who live and \n     work in the Fifth Circuit, to oppose the nomination of Judge \n     Leslie H. Southwick to the United States Court of Appeals. \n     SEIU joins the civil rights organizations, professional \n     societies and editorial boards which have stated their \n     opposition to Judge Southwick's nomination because of his \n     consistent record of hostility to the rights of minorities \n     and gay parents as well as his practice of going beyond the \n     resolution of the case at issue to inject his own views on \n     social and legislative policies into his decisions. We write \n     separately to express our concerns regarding Judge \n     Southwick's rulings regarding workplace issues and his \n     ability to fairly enforce the nation's labor and employment \n     laws.\n       In his dissent in Cannon v. Mid-South X-Ray Co., 738 So. 2d \n     274 (Miss. App. Ct. 1999), Judge Southwick argued that the \n     claim of Annie Cannon, a worker exposed to toxic chemicals in \n     her work place, should be rejected because it was barred by \n     the statute of limitations. Ms. Cannon had begun to \n     experience health problems soon after the start of her \n     employment as a darkroom technician. However, while the \n     severity of the problems increased over time, Ms. Cannon's \n     condition was not diagnosed by a doctor as work related until \n     sometime later. Based on this diagnosis, Ms. Cannon filed \n     suit.\n       Judge Southwick argued that all that is necessary for the \n     statute of limitations to run against a plaintiffs claim is \n     that the plaintiff know of her illness, not the cause of her \n     illness. This rule, as the eight judges in the majority \n     recognized, places an unreasonable burden on a worker ``who \n     cannot reasonably be expected to diagnose a disease on which \n     the scientific community has yet to reach an agreement.'' \n     While Ms. Cannon knew she was sick, she did not know she had \n     been injured by the defendants until her disease was \n     affirmatively diagnosed by her doctor and therefore should \n     not have been required to file a cause of action which she \n     did not know even existed.\n\n[[Page S13297]]\n\n       The use of a procedural device by Judge Southwick to deny \n     an injured worker her day in court is chillingly similar to \n     the rule announced by Justice Alito in Ledbetter v. Goodyear \n     Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S.--(2007). In that case, Lilly \n     Ledbetter's pay disparity claim was not ``easy to identify'' \n     because the impact of that discrimination, like Ms. Cannon's \n     illness, grew over time and when it reached the point that it \n     was clear that discrimination, or work place chemicals, was \n     the cause, an action was filed. In upholding the dismissal of \n     Ms. Ledbetter's case, Justice Alito relied upon same statute \n     of limitations procedural device employed by Judge Southwick \n     in denying Ms. Cannon her day in court.\n       In another dissent, Judge Southwick offers a gratuitous \n     insight into his judicial philosophy on the subject of \n     employment at will. The employment at will doctrine, which is \n     premised on the illusion that employers and individual \n     workers have equal power in the employment relationship, has \n     been consistently criticized and limited by legislative and \n     judicial action over the last hundred years. However, in \n     Dubard v. Biloxi H.M.A., 1999 Miss. App. Lexis 468 (1999), \n     rev'd, 778 So. 2d 113, 114 (Miss. 2000), Judge Southwick \n     opines that ``employment at will . . . provides the best \n     balance of the competing interests in the normal employment \n     situation. It has often been said about democracy, that it \n     does not provide a perfect system of government, but just a \n     better one than everything else that has ever been suggested. \n     An equivalent view might be seen as the justification for \n     employment at will.'' Judge Southwick's radical statement of \n     judicial philosophy calls into question the legitimacy of \n     most federal employment laws enacted in the twentieth \n     century, from the minimum wage to the Family and Medical \n     Leave Act, implying that they are inconsistent with a \n     democratic system of government.\n       Judge Southwick's record of judicial activism evidences a \n     willingness to erect insurmountable barriers to workers \n     seeking access to the courts and an aversion of laws which \n     limit the employer's unrestricted right to control the \n     employment relationship. He should not be given a lifetime \n     appointment to a court where he will be called upon to \n     enforce laws that he clearly disdains by injured workers who \n     he believes have no right to ask for relief. We ask the \n     Committee to reject the nomination of Judge Southwick to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Anna Burger,\n     International Secretary-Treasurer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.\n     Re Nomination of Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of \n         Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Specter: We write to express our \n     serious concerns regarding the nomination of Leslie Southwick \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. As an \n     organization dedicated to advancing and protecting women's \n     legal rights, the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) has \n     reviewed Judge Southwick's available record, his testimony \n     before the Committee, and his responses to Senators' written \n     questions in order to assess his commitment to upholding \n     essential civil rights protections. This substantive review \n     has led the Center to conclude that there is a significant \n     basis to doubt that commitment. Under these circumstances, it \n     is especially troubling that hundreds of unpublished opinions \n     that Judge Southwick joined while on the Mississippi Court of \n     Appeals have not been produced to the Committee. As a result, \n     the legal record that serves as the basis for determining his \n     fitness for a lifetime position on the Fifth Circuit remains \n     woefully incomplete. Consequently, we urge the Committee not \n     to advance Judge Southwick's nomination until all of his \n     record has been made available and has been reviewed, and \n     until the substantive concerns have been satisfied.\n       Judge Southwick's actions in S.B. v. L.W. and Richmond v. \n     Mississippi Department of Human Services raise significant \n     concerns. Judge Southwick joined a separate concurrence in \n     S.B. v. L.W. and joined the majority opinion in Richmond. \n     Although he did not write those opinions, the result and \n     reasoning therein is properly ascribed to him. As Judge \n     Southwick stated in his hearing before the Committee, his \n     decision to join an opinion as a judge on the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals meant that he at least agreed with the \n     outcome espoused by that opinion. He also acknowledged at the \n     hearing that he could have worked with the author of \n     an opinion to change its language and at all times had the \n     option of writing his own separate opinion.\n       In S.B. v. L. W., a 2001 custody case involving the \n     parental rights of a mother in a homosexual relationship, \n     Judge Southwick joined the majority in its holding awarding \n     custody to the father. He also chose to join a concurrence \n     that gratuitously took pains to elaborate the punitive \n     ``consequences'' that may be imposed on individuals in \n     homosexual relationships, including the loss of custody of a \n     child. The concurrence expounded upon the state's ability, \n     grounded in principles of ``federalism,'' to limit the rights \n     of homosexual Americans in the area of family law and \n     characterized participation in a homosexual relationship as a \n     ``choice'' and ``exertion of a perceived right.'' In \n     addition, although neither party to the case had raised \n     constitutional questions, the concurrence undertook to \n     discuss constitutional precedent in a highly selective manner \n     to support its conclusion that the Mississippi legislature \n     had permissibly taken a policy position with regard to the \n     rights of homosexual individuals in domestic relations \n     settings that would limit the custody rights of homosexual \n     parents. The opinion cited the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld criminal penalties for \n     sodomy, but ignored Romer v. Evans, which struck down a \n     ballot initiative that ``classifie[d] homosexuals not to \n     further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal.'' \n     To make matters worse, when Judge Southwick was questioned \n     about the concurrence's failure to discuss Romer, he answered \n     that neither Romer nor Bowers was argued by the parties to \n     the case. However, his answers do not speak to why the \n     concurrence only cited Bowers, and, therefore, do not allay \n     our concerns about the impartiality of the legal analysis in \n     this case.\n       Furthermore, while Judge Southwick indicated in written \n     responses that the custody decision would be evaluated \n     differently today in light of the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Lawrence v. Texas, he did not directly address concerns \n     raised by the language of the concurrence either in his \n     written answers or in his testimony, although he was asked to \n     do so. He did not clarify whether he considers homosexuality \n     to be a choice as suggested in the concurrence and provided \n     no persuasive justification for his seeming endorsement of \n     extraordinarily harsh penalties for that so-called choice.\n       Judge Southwick's decision to join the majority opinion in \n     Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, \n     affirming a state review board's decision to overturn a state \n     agency's termination of an employee for referring to an \n     African-American employee as a ``good ole n*****,'' also \n     raises serious concerns. The majority in Richmond concluded \n     that the terminated employee ``was not motivated out of \n     racial hatred or racial animosity directed toward a \n     particular co-worker or toward blacks in particular,'' and \n     that there was no ``credible proof'' that the use of this \n     highly inflammatory racial epithet caused substantial \n     problems within the agency workplace. This majority \n     opinion failed to adequately consider the discrimination \n     inherent in the use of that particular racial epithet and \n     required an unnecessarily stringent showing of disruption \n     from the employing agency. The Mississippi Supreme Court \n     unanimously reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, \n     remanding to the review board to make findings as to \n     whether the agency acted properly under state personnel \n     rules, and as to whether a lesser penalty than termination \n     should be imposed.\n       Judge Southwick's testimony before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and his responses to written questions did not \n     alleviate NWLC's concerns. It is disturbing that Judge \n     Southwick continues to consider the majority opinion in \n     Richmond well-reasoned and declined to criticize the opinion \n     he joined in part so as not to ``change horses mid-stream.'' \n     In addition, Judge Southwick's characterization of the \n     standard of review in his written questions as whether no \n     evidence sported the review board's decision (rather than \n     whether substantial evidence support it) is incorrect. \n     Whether the mischaracterization represents his original \n     understanding of the standard of review or a post-hoc attempt \n     to justify joining the majority, his position is equally \n     troubling. Further, although the Mississippi Supreme Court \n     concluded that the employee should not have been terminated, \n     two strong dissents raised grounds for Judge Southwick to \n     consider whether his decision to join the majority opinion \n     was correct: first, that the Court of Appeals improperly \n     placed the burden of proof upon the agency with regard to the \n     issue of the disruptive effect of the epithet; second, that \n     failing to terminate the employee could have subjected the \n     agency to a federal discrimination action and thus would have \n     constituted negligence; and third, that the majority of the \n     Mississippi Supreme Court substituted its judgment for the \n     review board's. As a result, Judge Southwick's reliance on \n     the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion in answer to questions \n     about whether he believed his decision to join the majority \n     in Richmond was correct does not eliminate our concerns.\n       Although our concerns are primarily grounded in only two of \n     the reported cases that came before Judge Southwick on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals, these cases are significant \n     because they are among the few in his available record that \n     raise constitutional and civil rights issues that Judge \n     Southwick would face if confirmed to the Fifth Circuit. \n     Moreover, hundreds of unpublished opinions that Judge \n     Southwick joined during his first two years on the \n     Mississippi Court of Appeals have not been tamed over to the \n     Committee. These opinions could implicate an even broader \n     range of legal issues and could shed light on Judge \n     Southwick's approach to the constitutional and federal legal \n     issues that come before the Fifth Circuit. It is critical for \n     Senators and the public to be able to review a nominee's \n     complete record when a lifetime appointment to the\n\n[[Page S13298]]\n\n     federal bench is at stake. To allow this already-questionable \n     nomination to move forward while substantial gaps in the \n     record exist would be highly unfortunate and unwarranted.\n       No judicial nominee enjoys a presumption in favor of \n     confirmation; rather, it is the nominee who carries the \n     burden of convincing the Senate that he or she should be \n     confirmed. NWLC respectfully urges the Committee not to vote \n     Judge Southwick out of committee while his record remains \n     incomplete, and while substantive concerns raised by his \n     available record have not been allayed.

Southwick to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     There is absolutely nothing in Judge Southwick's troubling \n     record, written responses, or testimony to the committee to \n     indicate that he can fairly judge cases involving gay, \n     lesbian, bisexual or transgender families or any other \n     minority parties.\n       As a member of the Mississippi Court of Appeal, Judge \n     Southwick joined a majority opinion which took custody of an \n     eight-year-old child away from her mother, citing in part the \n     mother's ``lesbian home'' and ``homosexual lifestyle'' as \n     justification for the decision. Additionally, Judge Southwick \n     was the only other judge to join a concurring opinion by \n     Judge Payne that unnecessarily referenced the state's \n     probation on gay and lesbian adoption, despite the fact that \n     this was not an adoption case, using the phrase ``the \n     practice of homosexuality'' throughout. Most disturbingly, \n     the concurrence states that even if the mother's sexual acts \n     are her choice she must accept the fact that losing her child \n     is a possible consequence of that choice.\n       We hope that you will agree that all American families, \n     including those living in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, \n     deserve a federal court system free from bias, regardless of \n     their sexual orientation or gender identity. We are in no way \n     confident that Judge Leslie H. Southwick can provide that \n     basic right. Because of this, we strongly urge you to oppose \n     the nomination of Leslie H. Southwick to a lifetime seat on \n     the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       For more information please contact our Assistant Director \n     of Programs, Elizabeth Hampton Brown, at (202) 467-8180 ext. \n     211 or e-mail ebrown@pflag.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jody M. Huckaby,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Alliance for Justice,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: No nominee to a \n     lifetime seat on our federal courts is entitled to a \n     presumption of confirmation. As Senator Leahy has stated, the \n     Senate's constitutional ``advice and consent'' role is a \n     serious responsibility, by which ``those 100 of us privileged \n     to serve in the Senate are entrusted with protecting the \n     rights of 280 million of our fellow citizens.'' Were the \n     Senate to confirm Judge Leslie Southwick to a lifetime \n     appointment on the Fifth Circuit, it will in fact have placed \n     in jeopardy the rights of many of the most vulnerable of our \n     fellow citizens. As a judge on the Mississippi Court of \n     Appeals, Judge Southwick assembled a deeply troubling record \n     in cases involving the interests of vulnerable parties, \n     consistently favoring corporations, insurance companies, and \n     other powerful interests over vulnerable workers and \n     consumers. His record also calls into question his commitment \n     to equal dignity and equal justice for minorities.\n       Judge Southwick's published opinions reveal that he voted \n     89 percent of the time against injured workers and consumers \n     in divided employment and torts decisions. In a number of \n     these cases, Judge Southwick harshly interpreted laws and \n     precedents to favor corporate defendants. In Goode v. Synergy \n     Corporation, Judge Southwick voted to deny a family, who sued \n     the propane company after their grandchild was killed in a \n     fire, a new trial even though there was new evidence \n     previously undisclosed by the company, showing that the \n     company's conduct may have caused the fire.\n       Although there are few cases that shed light on Judge \n     Southwick's views on civil rights, those that do are \n     profoundly troubling. Astonishingly, in one of his \n     exceedingly rare decisions in favor of an employee, he joined \n     the court's 5-4 opinion in Richmond v. Mississippi Dep't of \n     Human Services, which upheld an Employee Appeals Board \n     decision to reinstate, with full back pay, a woman who used a \n     racial slur in reference to a coworker, calling her a ``good \n     ole n*****.'' In neither the opinion he joined, nor in his \n     answers to questions at his confirmation hearing, did he \n     express doubts about the decision he joined in Richmond. He \n     and his colleagues on the majority also declined to remand \n     the case to the Board for assessment of a lesser penalty--as \n     one dissenting opinion urged and the Mississippi Supreme \n     Court later ordered in reversing the Court of Appeals. Judge \n     Southwick and the majority would have allowed the employee \n     full reinstatement with back pay in spite of the epithet.\n       In S.B. v. L.W., Judge Southwick joined a homophobic \n     concurrence arguing that sexual orientation was a perfectly \n     legitimate basis on which to deny a parent custody of one's \n     child. At his hearing, he attempted to explain this opinion \n     as a reflection of the intent of the legislature as to the \n     rights of gay parents. However, a dissenting opinion in S.B., \n     along with a subsequent Mississippi Supreme Court decision \n     stating that sexual orientation was not a basis on which to \n     deny child custody, demonstrate that Judge Southwick's \n     attempt to deflect criticism to the state legislature is \n     questionable indeed.\n       The Senate must be especially wary of Judge Southwick's \n     nomination because the president, in his six years in office \n     thus far, has engineered a transformation of the federal \n     courts to reflect an ideology that is hostile to the rights \n     of minorities and our society's most vulnerable members. \n     Moreover, the president has shown little willingness to \n     promote diversity on the bench. Astonishingly, there has \n     never been an African-American Fifth Circuit judge from \n     Mississippi, a state with a population that is 37% African-\n     American. Thus, it is particularly troubling that the \n     President has now nominated someone to this Mississippi seat \n     whose record raises such grave doubts about his racial \n     sensitivity and his commitment to equal justice for all \n     Americans.\n       President Bush and his Senate allies have exploited every \n     opportunity to confirm the nominees of the hard right, \n     steamrolling venerable Senate rules and traditions to achieve \n     this goal. The current Senate now faces a choice: stand up to \n     nominees who will make our courts even less friendly to our \n     most vulnerable citizens; or inherit a share of President \n     Bush's disturbing legacy of remaking the courts in the \n     partisan image of his right wing base. Judge Leslie Southwick \n     represents a crossroads, and the Senate should choose to \n     reject his nomination and insist that the President submit a \n     nominee with a demonstrated commitment to equal rights and \n     fairness to all Americans, regardless of their race, sexual \n     orientation or economic status.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Nan Aron,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I have the greatest \nrespect for my senior colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, who is always a gentleman in everything he does. I have worked \non the floor with Senator Lott during the time I was assistant leader, \nand I have the greatest respect for him. I appreciate the way they have \nhandled this and not making it personal in nature simply because I \noppose something they want.\n  I say in response to my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, \nthere is a different standard, as well there should be, for someone who \nis going to be placed on the trial court than somebody placed on the \nappellate court. So the reasoning that Senators approved in the \ncommittee a judge for a district court--clearly, the tradition in the \nSenate is, with rare exception, they are approved--so the argument that \nwe have approved somebody for a trial court so they should \nautomatically be approved for an appellate court simply is not valid.\n  Our Constitution outlines the shared responsibility between the \nSenate and the President of the United States to ensure that the \njudiciary is staffed with men and women who possess outstanding legal \nskills, suitable temperament, and high ethical standing.\n  As a leader, I have worked hard to ensure that the Senate carries out \nits work with respect to judicial nominees fairly and promptly, and \nwith a lot of transparency.\n  The judicial confirmation process today is working well, and all \nSenators should be pleased to know that the judicial vacancy rate is \ncurrently at an all-time low. For people who yell and shout and \ncomplain about the Democrats not allowing Republicans to assume the \nbench, the judicial vacancy rate today is at an all-time low. We\n\n[[Page S13299]]\n\nhave a Judiciary Committee that has helped this significantly. Senator \nPat Leahy, Senator Arlen Specter--the chairman and ranking member of \nthat committee--have as much collegiality as I have ever seen in a \ncommittee since I have been in the Senate. They have been fair, and \nthey have been fast.\n  This year alone, the Senate has confirmed 32 judicial nominees, \nincluding four court of appeals nominees--in addition to the more than \n250 others who have been approved during the past 6 years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  In contrast, my Republican colleagues and my Democratic colleagues \nwill clearly recall that during the Clinton administration, the \nRepublican-controlled Senate refused to confirm 70 nominees. Think \nabout that: 70 nominees. Many of them did not even have the courtesy of \na hearing. Some of them waited almost 4 years for a hearing.\n  I remember how we were treated. But we have chosen to live by the \nGolden Rule. We have chosen this is not ``get even time;'' this is a \ntime to be fair and to be open. The Golden Rule: Treat people as you \nwould want them to treat you. I am happy to say that is how we have \ndone this.\n  Judges with impeccable records, such as Ronnie White and Richard \nPaez, were maligned by Republicans merely for partisan political gain. \nThat is wrong. We do not intend to initiate any of that while we are in \ncharge of the Senate.\n  But today we face a judicial nomination that has attracted strong \nopposition. I turned in what is part of this Record a stack of \norganizations and individuals who simply oppose this nomination for \nlots of different reasons.\n  Opposition to the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick for the Fifth \nCircuit Court is neither partisan nor political. It is factual. These \nfacts are present deep within the fundamental American commitment to \ncivil justice and equal rights, which is something we must stand by.\n  In the past few weeks, our Nation has seen the recurrence of racial \nissues that we had assumed and hoped were behind us. Yet, the recent \nevents in Jena, LA, and at the U.S. Coast Guard academy--where nooses \nwere hung to intimidate, demean, and belittle people of color--\ndemonstrate that issues of race and intolerance are sorrowfully still \npresent in our society.\n  For many Americans, for many African Americans, and for the \nCongressional Black Caucus--of which this body only has one member. \nWhen I first came to the House of Representatives, there were about 20 \nmembers of the Congressional Black Caucus. Now there are 78. I believe \nthat is the number. That is good. That is good for our country. But \nthose individuals concerned know the Federal courts have historically \nrepresented the first, last, and often the only form of redress against \nracism and civil injustice. For that reason, I believe this body has \nlittle choice but to consider the nomination of Judge Southwick to the \nFifth Circuit Court in the context of race and civil rights.\n  I heard Senator Schumer here this morning talk about the demography \nof the State of Mississippi. That has to be something we take into \nconsideration.\n  President Bush is asking us to confirm Southwick for one of the \nhighest judicial positions in the United States: the United States \nCircuit Court of Appeals. It is a lifetime appointment. But for a court \nas important as the Fifth Circuit, Judge Southwick is the wrong choice. \nHis record on the Mississippi State court does not justify a promotion. \nThat is why I rise, once again, as I have many times regarding Judge \nSouthwick, to express my strong opposition to this nomination. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''\n  As a member of the Mississippi State appellate court, Judge Southwick \njoined decisions that demonstrate insensitivity to, and disinterest in, \nthe cause of civil rights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the hour of 11 o'clock \ntime for the vote be extended. I should be finished shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do believe that as a member of the \nMississippi State appellate court, Judge Southwick joined decisions \nthat demonstrate insensitivity to, and disinterest in, the cause of \ncivil rights.\n  For example, in the Richmond case, he voted to uphold the \nreinstatement with back pay of a White State employee who had used a \nracial epithet about an African-American coworker.\n  Judge Southwick says the decision was about technical legal issues, \nbut the dissent in the case by his colleague, Judge King, explains what \nwas at stake. It was not a technical legal issue. As I said when I \nbegan, it was based on the facts. Judge King wrote, regarding the ``N'' \nword--and I quote him:\n\n       There are some words, which by their nature and definition \n     are so inherently offensive, that their use establishes the \n     intent to offend.\n\n  It was clear in this decision that Judge Southwick should have joined \nwhat would have been the majority. The majority would have been with \nJudge King. He decided not to go with what would have been the majority \nand created his own majority to, in effect, agree that using this ``N'' \nword was nothing more than an offhand remark that meant nothing. It \ntook the courageous action of judges on the Fifth Circuit to carry out \nthe Supreme Court's desegregation decisions and destroy the vestiges of \nthe Jim Crow era.\n  Judge Southwick, from what I have learned about him, is not capable \nof being part of that. Yet Judge Southwick's record gives us absolutely \nno reason to hope that he will continue this tradition of delivering \njustice to the aggrieved.\n  That is why there is no shortage of opposition to this nomination, \nfirst and foremost, as I have said, from our colleagues, Members of \nCongress, the Black Caucus. They cite opposition by the Magnolia Bar, \nthe Mississippi NAACP, and countless other organizations that stand for \njustice. They have asked us to remember that their constituents are our \nconstituents--some 45 million of them--and they deserve representation \non this issue.\n  His decision in the Richmond case is his most serious problem, but \nJudge Southwick has failed in many other areas. He sides continually \nwith plaintiffs in bad cases. He always, with rare exception, joins \nwith corporations and not the workers. He appears to favor defendants.\n\n  There is no reason why the President can't find a nominee with a \nrecord fairly representing all people. If we reject Judge Southwick, \nthe President will still have an opportunity to nominate another \ncandidate. Judge Southwick's record has been fully documented by my \ncolleagues who have spoken before me. His most grievous failure--I \nrepeat--a failure to give full weight to the vile meaning and history \nof the ``N'' word--is deeply disturbing. I cannot overlook it.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting ``no,'' so we can find \na candidate truly befitting this important lifetime appointment--a \ncandidate who will give the people of the Fifth Circuit the confidence \nthey deserve that their claim to justice will be heard with the respect \nand equality every American citizen deserves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table, and the President is notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I opposed the nomination of Leslie \nSouthwick to serve a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit. His tenure as a judge on the Mississippi Court \nof Appeals reveals a record that fails to honor the principles of \nequality and justice and demonstrates a disregard for civil rights.\n  The American people deserve Federal judges--regardless of who \nnominates them--who are dedicated to an evenhanded and just application \nof our laws. In case after case, Judge Southwick has demonstrated a \nlack of respect and understanding for the civil rights of all \nAmericans, and particular indifference towards the real and enduring \nevils of discrimination against African Americans and gay and lesbian \nAmericans.\n  After reviewing his judicial opinions and examining his \nqualifications, I have concluded that Judge Southwick's regressive \ncivil rights record should disqualify him from serving a lifetime \nappointment on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I urge the \nPresident to select judicial nominees who embrace the principle that \nall are equal under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13300-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 20 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to S. 2205.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time so it does \nnot interfere with the 20 minutes allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier this year, we had a chance at \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I agree with the President of the \nUnited States that we should do comprehensive immigration reform. \nPresident Bush and I, I repeat, were in agreement. That effort brought \npeople together from both sides of the aisle, from all parts of the \npolitical spectrum. We agreed our current immigration system works well \nfor no one. That effort brought Democrats and Republicans together in \npursuit of a common good.\n  Many of us then were profoundly disappointed when this issue was \nstopped, not because of the President, but by Republicans in the Senate \nand a few Democrats. It was a real disappointment to me. We had spent \nso much time on the floor trying to move forward on comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n\n  I continue to believe that tough, fair, practical and comprehensive \nreform is the only way to get control of our broken immigration system \nand restore the rule of law. I remain committed to enacting \ncomprehensive legislation as soon as we can. But until we can once \nagain look forward to comprehensive immigration reform, we should, at \nthe very least, enact the DREAM Act. We tried to offer this crucial \nlegislation as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill, but we \nwere blocked from doing so by a small number of Republicans.\n  At that time, I committed to moving the DREAM Act for a vote before \nNovember 16. Today, that is where we are. We now turn to the DREAM Act \nas stand-alone legislation, and I once again rise to offer my strong \nsupport for this legislation. Anyone who believes as I do that \neducation unlocks doors to limitless opportunity should join me in \nvoting for this legislation.\n  We should vote for this legislation because the DREAM Act recognizes\n\n[[Page S13301]]\n\nthat children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents. \nMany of the children this bill addresses came here when they were very \nyoung. Many don't even remember their home countries--in fact, most of \nthem don't--or speak the language of their home countries. They are as \nloyal and devoted to our country as any American. Only children who \ncame to the United States when they were 15 years old or younger and \nhave been in the United States for at least 5 years and are now not yet \n30 years old can apply. Those who are eligible must earn a high school \ndiploma, demonstrate good moral character, and pass criminal and \nsecurity clearances. They must also either go to college or serve in \nthe military for 2 years.\n  I have met many star students in Nevada who qualify for the DREAM \nAct. With it, their futures are limitless. Without it, their hope is \ndiminished greatly. What a waste it is to make it more difficult for \nchildren--children in our country--to go to college and get jobs or \njoin the military when they can be making meaningful contributions to \ntheir communities and to our country. What good does it do anybody to \nprevent these young people from having a future? The answer is it does \nno good. It harms children who have done no wrong, and in the long run \nit greatly harms our country's economy.\n  I very much appreciate the hard work of Senator Durbin and Senator \nHatch to bring this legislation to the floor. They have worked \ntirelessly to ensure this important bipartisan bill does not go away. \nWe must now invoke cloture and pass this bill. Vote cloture and move to \nthis legislation. If we do, we will put the American dream within the \nreach of far more children in Nevada and across America who want \nnothing more than a fair chance at success. That will be an \naccomplishment of which we can all be proud.\n  A lot of what we do is based on personal experiences. My memory goes \nback many years to a small rural community in Nevada called Smith \nValley. It is one of the few farming areas we have left in the State of \nNevada. It is a beautiful place. I spoke to an assembly at a small \nschool, and I could tell this young lady wanted to speak to me when I \nfinished. She was embarrassed, of course. But I asked her if she wanted \nto talk to me, and she was embarrassed--clearly embarrassed. She said \nwords to this effect: I am the smartest kid in my class. I am \ngraduating from high school soon. I can't go to college. My parents are \nillegals.\n  I have thought about that so much. I don't know where she is today. \nIs she doing domestic work someplace? What is she doing? She should \nhave been able to go to college. Not a free education--that isn't what \nthis bill calls for--but an opportunity to go to college.\n  In Reno and in Las Vegas we have scores of gangs--many of them \nHispanic gangs--doing illegal things much of the time. Not all the time \nbut much of the time. There is no question--I have been told by police \nofficers, by high school counselors--that this legislation would give \nchildren an alternative, an alternative to going into the gangs.\n  So I appreciate this legislation. It is all-American legislation, \nwhich is so important for what we want to accomplish in this country. I \nwould hope my fellow Senators will allow this legislation to move \nforward by voting yea on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, every once in a while we disagree with the \nmajority leader. In this case, I do. When he says the immigration bill \nbrought us together, it didn't bring us together. Let us remember what \nhappened, though. The immigration bill: We came in on a Monday and \nexpected to vote on a bill that no one had seen until Saturday \nafternoon. Now, this is another sudden thing upon us, and let us keep \nin mind this is an amnesty bill. We are talking about people who came \nto this country illegally, regardless of age.\n  This says: If you have lived in the United States for more than 5 \nconsecutive years, even though you came in illegally, and if you \nentered this country at age 16 or before--and you could have been here \nfor as long as 14 years illegally, because they have the cutoff at age \n30--then you will be getting a conditional, lawful permanent \nresidence--a green card--for up to 6 years.\n  What can you do during that 6-year period? During that 6-year period \nyou can actually bring in other members, parents and others, who were \nbrought here illegally in the first place, so they can enjoy that same \ntype of citizenship.\n  Now, I know I am prejudiced on this issue because I have had the \nhonor of speaking at naturalization ceremonies. When you look at the \npeople who have done it right, done it legally--they have learned the \nlanguage and the history--this or any other type of an amnesty bill \nwould be a slap in the face to all those who came here legally.\n  So I would ask the question: When do we learn? We went through this \nthing before. I know we try to fast-track these things so people will \nnot catch on, but I can assure you, all of America is awake on this one \nand they know exactly what we are doing. This is another amnesty bill, \nand I believe we should not proceed to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend Senator Durbin and \nSenators Hatch, Lugar, Hagel, and Menendez for their commitment to this \nbill. This legislation would allow young people who have grown up in \nthe United States a chance at stability, and a chance to achieve the \nAmerican dream by attending college or serving in our military.\n  I do not believe it is the American way to punish young people for \nthe mistakes of their parents. When these young people have the \nopportunity to reach their potential by service in our Armed Forces or \nthrough higher education, we all win. Opening the door to opportunity, \nnot squandering the potential of young people, is part of what America \nis all about.\n  So let us take a first step toward sensible immigration policy and \nmove beyond the rhetoric and give these people a chance of fulfilling \nthe American dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial appearing in today's New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 24, 2007]\n\n                           A Chance To Dream\n\n       The Senate has a chance today to pluck a small gem from the \n     ashes of the immigration debate. A critical procedural vote \n     is scheduled on the Dream Act, a bill to open opportunities \n     for college and military service to the children of \n     undocumented immigrants.\n       Roughly 65,000 children graduate each year from high school \n     into a constrained future because they cannot work legally or \n     qualify for most college aid. These are the overlooked \n     bystanders to the ferocious bickering over immigration. They \n     did not ask to be brought here, have worked hard in school \n     and could, given the chance, hone their talents and become \n     members of the homegrown, high-skilled American work force.\n       The bill is one of the least controversial immigration \n     proposals that have been offered in the last five years. But \n     that doesn't mean much. Like everything else not directly \n     involving border barricades and punishment, it has been \n     branded as ``amnesty,'' and has languished.\n       But this bill is different, starting with its broad, \n     bipartisan support, from its original sponsor, the Utah \n     Republican Orrin Hatch, to its current champion, Richard \n     Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. Repeated defeats have forced \n     Mr. Durbin to pare away at the bill's ambitions. It focuses \n     now on a narrow sliver of a worthy group: children who \n     entered the country before age 16, lived here continuously \n     for at least five years and can show good moral character and \n     a high school diploma. They would receive conditional legal \n     status for six years, during which they could work, go to \n     college and serve in the military. If they completed at least \n     two years of college or military service, they would be \n     eligible for legalization.\n       These young people--their numbers are estimated at anywhere \n     from a million to fewer than 100,000--are in many ways fully \n     American, but their immigration status puts a lock on their \n     potential right after high school. They face the prospect of \n     living in the shadows as their parents do, fearing \n     deportation to countries they do not know, yearning to \n     educate themselves in a country that ignores their \n     aspirations.\n       The Dream Act rejects that unacceptable waste of young \n     talent. The opportunity is there, provided the votes are \n     there in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time to \nSenator Durbin.\n\n[[Page S13302]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many speeches are made on the floor, many \namendments are offered, many bills, and many resolutions. Very few of \nthem cause a ripple. A handful of people may follow them closely, a \nhandful of people may care. The DREAM Act is a different thing. The \nDREAM Act is a bill which I thought about and introduced years ago, and \nit has finally reached this moment of truth where it comes to the floor \nof the Senate. The reason why this bill will be noticed is that \nliterally thousands of young people across America know that their fate \nand future will be determined by this vote.\n  Yesterday, I had a press conference with three of these young people. \nA Congressman from the State of Colorado sent out a press release \narguing that these three young people should be arrested in the \nCapitol. Of course, he didn't take the time to determine that they are \nall here now with the understanding of and disclosure to the Department \nof Homeland Security. But his press release is an indication of how \nbadly this debate is going in America. To turn on these children and \ntreat them as criminals is an indication of the level of emotion and, \nin some cases, bigotry and hatred that is involved in this debate.\n  America is better than that. America is a better nation than what we \nhear from the likes of that Congressman. What crime did these children \ncommit? They committed the crime of obeying their parents; following \ntheir parents to this country. Do you think there was a vote in the \nhousehold about their future? I don't think so. Mom and dad said: We \nare leaving. And the kids packed their suitcases and followed. That is \ntheir crime. That is the only crime you can point to. What did they do \nafter they got here? To qualify under the DREAM Act, they had to make \ncertain they didn't commit a crime while living in America; they had to \nhave good moral character and beat the odds and graduate from high \nschool. That is the only way they can qualify for this.\n  Then what do we say? Not enough. If you want to be legal in America, \nyou have to do one of two things: Volunteer to serve in our military, \nto risk your life for America, and then we will give you a chance to be \ncitizens. But even that is not good enough for some. Some argue, no, we \ndon't want them in our military. We don't need them. Well, the people \ninvolved in our military know better. They know these are the kind of \nbright, promising young people who can serve our country with \ndistinction and they tell us that.\n  What else could they do? They can pursue their education to show they \nare serious about making something out of their lives. These are the \nonly two ways they get a chance. That is what the DREAM Act is all \nabout.\n  I could go for an hour or more with stories of these young people \nwhom I have met. They are hopeful and heartbreaking at the same time. \nThey are hopeful stories because these are young people who have the \nsame dreams my children have, the same dreams every American child has: \nto have a good life, a good family, and do something important in their \nlives. That is all they want.\n  The young woman from India I met in Chicago wants to be a dentist. \nThe young man from Mexico, who is now pursuing his graduate degree in \nbiomedical science, wants to go into research. A young girl from Texas \nis a graduate of nursing school but can't find a job because she is a \nperson without a country. Tomorrow's teachers and engineers and \nscientists. All they are asking for is a chance. That is the hopeful \nside of it.\n  The heartbreaking side of it is these are kids without a country. \nThey have nowhere to turn. Tam Tran, who is with us today and who \njoined me yesterday, has been through an arduous journey, starting in \nVietnam, going to Germany, then coming to the United States. Her family \ncan't return to Vietnam and face persecution, and Germany would not \nhave her. She doesn't even speak German. Yet our government tells her: \nLeave. She graduated from UCLA. She wants to pursue a degree and be a \nprofessor.\n  Leave. We don't want you. Is that the message? If it is, it is the \nwrong message. Because time and again we are told we need talent in \nAmerica to be a successful and prosperous nation. We are told we need \nto bring in talent from overseas with our H-1B visas and the H-2B \nvisas. Well, how can we, on one side of the argument, say we need more \ntalent and then turn these children away, turn these young people away? \nGive them a chance. Give them hope. Give them a chance to prove \nthemselves in this country.\n  This bill puts them through a long process. It will not be easy. Some \nwill not make it. Most will not make it. But those who do will make \nthis a better Nation. Isn't that what we should be about?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized for 2 \nminutes, and if you can announce when that time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I think there are millions of Americans \nall around the country who wish no ill will on these minors whom we are \ntalking about but are sitting at home following this debate, following \nthis procedure, and scratching their heads and saying: Haven't these \nMembers of Congress heard us? Don't they get it? Don't they understand \nwhat we have been saying loudly and clearly? Apparently, we don't.\n  I don't think the message could have been clearer from millions of \nAmericans across the country this summer. They said during our debate \non the overall so-called comprehensive immigration bill: No, you got it \nwrong. The enforcement in that bill is inadequate. It has not been \naccomplished. It is not done. We want that done first. And no, you got \nit wrong. We do not want amnesty.\n\n  Yet, even after that clear, compelling message from the American \npeople, a message so overwhelming it shut down the Senate phone system \nthe morning of the last vote which killed that bill, apparently a whole \nbunch of folks here still do not get it. They still are not listening. \nBecause this is a bill which has no enforcement but does have clear \namnesty.\n  The American people have no ill will toward these minors we are \ntalking about. But they do have complete confusion with regard to what \nwe are doing--not fixing the problem, making it worse. Inadequate \nenforcement plus amnesty, that is a recipe for disaster. They know that \nout of innate common sense. We do nothing to stop the magnet that \nattracts illegal aliens here because we have little or no workplace \nenforcement, in particular. Yet we continue with amnesty and other \nprograms.\n  Please vote no, my colleagues, on proceeding to the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am voting against the motion to \nproceed to the DREAM Act today. Even though I support the end goal of \nthis legislation; that is, to provide children with an education, I do \nnot think the bill is perfect. I would like to see changes made. The \nbill didn't go through the proper channels and was not approved by the \nJudiciary Committee. Moreover, the majority leader has indicated that \nhe will fill the tree and prevent the minority from offering amendments \nto the bill. ``Filling the tree'' by the majority leader is what this \nprocess is called and it freezes me out of offering amendments to \nimprove the DREAM Act. For these reasons, I will oppose proceeding to \nthe bill today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support the DREAM Act. This \nbill would give promising children, who played no part in their \nparents' decision to come to this country illegally, the chance to earn \nlegal status through college attendance or military service.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that this bill constitutes \namnesty. But the term ``amnesty'' implies that these children did \nsomething wrong and are being absolved of the consequences of their \nactions. It is difficult to imagine how these children can be blamed \nfor actions that their parents took when the children were too young to \nhave any say. The United States does not visit the sins of parents on \ntheir children in other contexts and should not do so here. \nFurthermore, to call the bill ``amnesty'' ignores the fact that these \nchildren would be required to earn their legal status through academic \nachievement or military service.\n\n[[Page S13303]]\n\n  The children who would be granted legal status under the DREAM Act \nare those who have shown through their actions that they can make an \nimportant contribution to our country. At a time when our economy and \nour military are in need, turning these children away squanders a \nvaluable resource. It also leaves these children in a permanent limbo, \nas many of them have little or no knowledge of the country from which \ntheir parents came and have known no home other than the United States.\n  It serves neither justice nor our national interest to deprive these \nchildren of a future and to deprive ourselves of their potential \ncontributions. That is why I support the DREAM Act, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of the DREAM Act, \nintroduced by Senators Durbin, Lugar, and myself. Each year, thousands \nof hard-working students who graduate from American high schools are \nunable to attend college or serve in the military because of their \nillegal immigration status.\n  These young people were brought to the United States by adults who \nwere breaking the law. In America, we have never held children \nresponsible for their parents' sins. It is not the habit of the United \nStates to punish children for the actions of their parents. Let's not \nstart now.\n  Many have been in our country nearly their entire lives, and most \nhave received their primary education here. They contribute to their \ncommunities and our country by earning higher education or serving in \nthe Armed Forces. It is in our national interest that they be given the \nopportunity to do so. These young people were forced into an \nunfortunate position, which have made them outcasts in our society, yet \nthey have proven their potential and ambition by meeting the several \nrequirements necessary to be eligible under the DREAM Act for legal \nstatus. We need more young people to contribute to our country, not \nless.\n  The DREAM Act would make it possible to bring these young people out \nof shadows and give them the opportunity to contribute, work, and pay \ntaxes--giving back to the communities in which they were raised.\n  The DREAM Act is not amnesty. It is a narrowly tailored piece of \nlegislation that would help only a limited, select group of young \npeople earn legal status. This is not an incentive for more illegal \nimmigrants to enter our country. To be eligible for legal status under \nthe DREAM Act, you must have good moral character, have graduated from \nan American high school, entered the country under the age of 15, and \nhave been in the United States for at least 5 years. There is an end \ndate to the DREAM Act.\n  The current system punishes children for the mistakes of their \nparents. The DREAM Act will provide a legal path for undocumented \nstudents to pursue the American dream based on their own \naccomplishments and hard work.\n  Immigration is a very complicated and difficult issue, for many \nreasons. Partly because we have deferred this issue for years. We have \nrefused to take a responsible position on all the different aspects of \nimmigration reform--inc1uding the DREAM Act.\n  Obviously border security is the core, the beginning of immigration \nreform. I am not aware of any Senator who has questioned or contested \nthat point. In July, the Senate approved $3 billion in funding for \nborder security and immigration enforcement--totaling $40.6 billion in \noverall funding for homeland security. From fiscal year 1993 to fiscal \nyear 2006, the budget for the Border Patrol has tripled from $362 \nmillion to $1.6 billion.\n  That is not the debate. The debate, of course, resides around the \ndifficult issues, the 11 to 12 million illegals now in this country. \nThe debate elicits great and deep emotions and passion--and it should. \nWe were sent here to deal with the great challenges of our time, to \nresolve the issues, find solutions, not go halfway. That is leadership.\n  Currently, we have provided no leadership for the American people. We \nhave not had the courage to deal with it because it is political, \nbecause it is emotional, because it cuts across every sector and every \nline of our society. It is about national security. It is about \nautonomy and our future. It is about our society, our schools, our \nhospitals. That is difficult.\n  Who are we helping with the current situation that we have today? \nPeople stay in the shadows, we don't collect taxes, we don't have the \ncomplete involvement in communities that we have always had from our \nimmigrants. There is a national security element to this. There is a \nlaw enforcement element to it, and there is certainly an economic \nelement to it. Are we really winning? No, we are losing. We are losing \neverywhere.\n  You can take pieces of each and pick and choose which might make you \nmore comfortable politically, but it doesn't work that way. It is all \nwrapped into the same enigma. It is woven into the same fabric. That is \nwhat we are dealing with.\n  It is leadership to take on the tough issues. Immigration is one of \nthose issues which tests and defines a society. It tests and defines a \ncountry. And the precious glue that has been indispensable in holding \nthis country together for over 200 years has been common interests and \nmutual respect. I don't know of an issue that is facing our country \ntoday that is more important, that is framed in that precious glue \nconcept more precisely than this issue. Crafting something for the \nfuture, for our history, for our children, and for our society--that is \nwhat it is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I don't know whether I am in control of \ntime or not, but how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 5 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nis left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 3 minutes 3 seconds.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to proceed on my leader time and \npreserve the remainder of time on this side for Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year, a bipartisan group \nof Senators took up the issue of illegal immigration. It was clear from \nthe debate that ensued that there are deeply held beliefs on both \nsides. It was also apparent that this is not a problem with a simple \nsolution; it is one that requires time and consideration.\n  And to live up to the expectation of our constituents, it seemed \nclear to me that Congress must take steps to secure our borders and \nprovide for our national security first. The Senate seemed to get the \nmessage, because it voted overwhelmingly in July to dedicate $3 billion \nin emergency spending to help promote our border and interior security.\n  I am disappointed my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nnot continuing on the bipartisan path of enhancing our security. \nInstead, they are bringing up a controversial issue with the DREAM Act. \nThis bill is an attempt to put illegal immigrants who graduate from a \nU.S. high school or obtain their GED on a special path to citizenship.\n  Though I recognize and appreciate the tremendous contributions to our \ncountry made by generations of immigrants, I do not believe we should \nreward illegal behavior. It is our duty to promote respect for \nAmerica's immigration laws and fairness for U.S. citizens and lawful \nimmigrants.\n  The DREAM Act fails that test and I will oppose it.\n  This is not an issue that can be solved in one day, and there are \npressing matters which we must address.\n  Here we are, 4 weeks into the new fiscal year and we have yet to send \na single appropriations bill to the President's desk. We should be \nfocused on funding our troops in the field, ensuring our intelligence \nforces have the tools they need to find and catch terrorists, and \nholding the line on budget-busting spending bills.\n  The Internet tax moratorium expires in exactly 1 week. Unless we act \nsoon, Internet users across the country will be hit with yet another \ntax.\n  And we still have yet to see any plan for addressing the looming \nmiddle class tax hike known as the alternative minimum tax. Secretary \nPaulson told Congress that we must act by early November if we don't \nwant to see 50 million taxpayers ensnared in a confused\n\n[[Page S13304]]\n\nfiling season next year. This deadline, too, is just around the corner.\n  We still have an enormous amount of work to complete, and we are \nrunning out of time.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this attempt to bring up a divisive \nissue, further delaying the essential, unfinished, business of the \nCongress.\n  The Senate has more than enough to do without also tackling issues \nthat divide both this body and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I wish to extend my time just 1 more minute.\n  It has been made clear to me in discussions that this will not be an \nopen amendment process if we get on the bill. It is my understanding \nthat the tree will be filled up, which, of course, would put the \nmajority in control of deciding what amendments, if any, are offered. \nSo this is not going to be an open debate, as far as I can tell.\n  Maybe the majority would decide to bless some amendment on this side \nand allow a vote on it. I guess that is possible. But for the balance \nof the people on this side of the aisle, on my side of the aisle, the \nRepublican side, I want them to understand that even if we get cloture \non the motion to proceed, there is certainly no guarantee that this \nwill be an open process that will allow a broad array of amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \ndistinguished Republican leader with regard to the process we can \nanticipate and the fact that the majority leader has indicated he will \nfill the amendment tree, blocking any ability of any Senator, both on \nthis side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle, to offer \namendments to improve the bill or perhaps add other provisions that cry \nout for some remedy.\n  I ask the distinguished Republican leader whether the types of \namendments or suggestions that have been discussed informally would \ninclude things like adding a requirement of securing the borders and \nhaving an enforceable system at the worksite, or a trigger, before any \nother provisions like the DREAM Act would be considered or implemented; \nwhether it would also consider--for example, we know that in the \nagricultural sector there is a lot of concern about a shortage of \nworkers--whether there would be an ability to provide an amendment \nwhich would allow for not a path to citizenship but for a temporary \nworkforce to satisfy that need in the agricultural sector; or, for \nexample, in places like Texas that are fast growing States, whether \nthere may be an opportunity to offer any amendments that would provide \nfor a temporary worker program--not a path to citizenship--that would \nsatisfy the legitimate needs of American business? Are those going to \nbe precluded under the plan by the majority leader?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, I don't \nknow for sure, but the way the process will work--we have seen it \nbefore under majorities of both parties--is the majority leader has the \nability to fill up the tree and then deny any amendments or pick \namendments. Only the majority leader would be able to answer the \nquestion whether an amendment dealing with workplace enforcement or an \namendment dealing with border security or, in the case of this Senator, \nan amendment dealing with the H-2A agricultural worker program, which \nis important to my State--all of that would be within the sole \nauthority of the majority leader, who would pick and choose if any \namendments were allowed, pick and choose which ones were given a chance \nto have a vote.\n  I say to my colleagues here on the minority side, we will have little \nor no control--or none, no control at all over what amendments would be \nallowed. It would be entirely controlled by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know Senator Sessions is seeking time. Is Senator \nHutchison trying to get some of the time on our side as well?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was really trying to have an \nopportunity to ask Senator Durbin a question and have a colloquy. I \ndon't want to take from your time on that. I ask if I could have a \ncolloquy with Senator Durbin on his time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been some conversation here \nabout procedure. If you would be kind enough--if the minority side will \nallow me 2 minutes for a colloquy with Senator Hutchison, and I would \noffer the same 2 minutes----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would that be off the time of the Senator from \nIllinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, no. I asked consent for an additional 2 minutes. I \nhave 3 minutes remaining, so it would be a total of 5 minutes, 2 \nminutes for a colloquy with Senator Hutchison and myself, and I would \nextend 2 minutes to the time of the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Unless the Senator from Alabama or Pennsylvania wants to \nspeak, I would enter into a colloquy with Senator Hutchison at this \npoint?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. I assume it \nis a colloquy--but I would not want to concede that rather small amount \nof time remaining on this side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We would lose no time, as I understand it. We would \nend up, actually, with more time, 7 minutes, which will allow the \nSenator from Alabama to have 5 and the Senator from Pennsylvania to \nhave the remaining 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of preparing this bill \nfor the floor, I have been working on both sides of the aisle. I hope \nthe vote in a few minutes will evidence that. I have had a constructive \nconversation with Senator Hutchison of Texas and Senator Martinez of \nFlorida and others about modifications of the DREAM Act. I believe the \nproposals they have made in principle are positive proposals that move \nus toward our goal.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, and I certainly am going to open \nthis to her comments when I finish, it is my intention to offer a \nsubstitute amendment as the first amendment that is brought forward by \nthe majority, a bipartisan amendment with Senator Hutchison which will \nachieve our mutual goals. I hope we can reach that agreement in the \nnext 30 hours, after this motion prevails. Failing that agreement, the \nminority is protected because it will require another cloture vote, \nanother 60-vote margin before this bill moves forward.\n  So they have my word to work in good faith on the substitute \nbipartisan amendment. Failing that, their protection is a cloture vote \nwhich they could join in defeating.\n  I yield to my colleague from Texas if she has any comment or \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nIllinois has said because I do believe there is a compromise approach \nto the DREAM Act that could have bipartisan support. As has been \nmentioned on the floor, there is no opportunity that has been laid out \nfor a substitute to be considered. But the Senator from Illinois has \ngiven me his word. I have been working on something that I think would \ntake us on the right path. This is such an important piece of \nlegislation, and I do think this is isolated from the entire \nimmigration issue because there----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, there are young people who have been \nbrought to this country as minors, not of their own doing, who have \ngone to American high schools, graduated, and who want to go to \nAmerican colleges. They are in a limbo situation. I believe we should \ndeal with this issue. We should do it in a way that helps assimilate \nthese young people with a college education into our country. They have \nlived here most of their lives. If we sent them home, they wouldn't \nknow what home is. There is a compassionate reason for us to try to \nwork this out. But I will say, if we cannot work on a bipartisan \namendment, we\n\n[[Page S13305]]\n\nwill have another vote, as has been promised. I will vote against the \nDurbin bill. But if we can work on a bipartisan solution, we should \ntry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans now have 8 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to Senator Specter, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that the DREAM Act is a good \nact, and I believe that its purposes are beneficial. I think it ought \nto be enacted. But I have grave reservations about seeing a part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform go forward because it weakens our \nposition to get a comprehensive bill.\n  Right now, we are witnessing a national disaster, a governmental \ndisaster, as States and counties and cities and townships and boroughs \nand municipalities--every level of government--are legislating on \nimmigration because the Congress of the United States is derelict in \nits duty to proceed.\n  We passed an immigration bill out of both Houses last year. It was \nnot conferenced. It was a disgrace that we couldn't get the people's \nbusiness done. We were unsuccessful in June in trying to pass an \nimmigration bill. I think we ought to be going back to it. I have \ndiscussed it with my colleagues.\n  I had proposed a modification to the bill defeated in June, which, \nmuch as I dislike it, would not have granted citizenship as part of the \nbill, but would have removed fugitive status only. That means someone \ncould not be arrested if the only violation was being in the country \nillegally. That would eliminate the opportunity for unscrupulous \nemployers to blackmail employees with squalid living conditions and low \nwages, and it would enable people to come out of the shadows, to \nregister within a year.\n  We cannot support 12 to 20 million undocumented immigrants, but we \ncould deport the criminal element if we could segregate those who would \nbe granted amnesty only.\n  I believe we ought to proceed with hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We ought to set up legislation. If we cannot act this year \nbecause of the appropriations logjam, we will have time in late \nJanuary. But as reluctant as I am to oppose this excellent idea of the \nSenator from Illinois, I do not think we ought to cherry-pick. It would \ntake the pressure off of comprehensive immigration reform, which is the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. We ought to act on it, and we \nought to act on it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I yield \nSenator DeMint the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Executive Office of the President of the United \nStates, OMB, has issued a veto threat on this bill and said they will \nveto it because they believe it is not part of comprehensive reform, as \nSenator Specter said. They also go forward to note a number of specific \nproblems with it.\n  They note that we:\n\n       [M]ust be careful not to provide incentives for recurrence \n     of the illegal conduct that has brought the Nation to this \n     point. By creating a special path to citizenship that is \n     unavailable to other prospective immigrants--including young \n     people whose parents respected our Nation's laws--S. 2205 \n     falls short.\n\n  They go on to note:\n\n       This path to citizenship is unavailable to any other alien, \n     no matter how much promise he or she may have, no matter how \n     much he or she may contribute to American society.\n\n  They note that it would:\n\n       [A]llow illegal aliens to obtain a green card before many \n     individuals who are currently lawfully waiting in line.\n\n  They note that they can:\n\n       [P]etition almost instantly to bring family members into \n     the country.\n\n  By the way, it would be 1.3 million people admitted under this \nprogram, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a fair and \nobjective--certainly not a conservative group, I will say it that way.\n  They go on to note that the persons would be ``eligible for welfare \nbenefits within 5 years.'' The bill would be indiscriminate in who it \nwould make eligible for the program through certain loopholes:\n\n       Certain aliens convicted of multiple misdemeanors and even \n     felonies.\n\n  They note that it would be vetoed. So that is President Bush who has \nbeen strongly favoring immigration reform. I have disagreed with him \nconsistently on many of his ideas.\n  Let me make mention of a couple of things that are fundamentally \nimportant. Most importantly, individuals are not going to take the \nmilitary route. I would estimate at least 90 percent would take the \noption of just 2 years of college without any requirement to have to \nattain a degree.\n  I submit this will strike a dagger, most importantly, in the heart of \nthe decided will of the American people which is to create a lawful \nsystem of immigration. It would put illegals ahead of legals. It will \nmake clear that even after our national debate and vote a few weeks \nago, the Congress still does not get it; that the Congress is still \ndetermined to stiff the will of the decent majority of American \ncitizens; that the Senate will move forward with an amnesty bill that \nputs 1.3 million people on a swift and guaranteed path to citizenship, \nahead of millions who applied and are waiting in line lawfully, to give \nthem every right of citizenship this country has to offer.\n  That is what I think amnesty is, giving every single right that we \nhave to offer to someone as a result of illegal conduct. So before--and \nthis is important--before we make any real progress toward a lawful \nsystem of immigration, we have less than 100 miles of the 700 miles of \nfencing this Congress called for. There is no workplace enforcement. A \nmodest attempt to do something like that has been blocked by the \ncourts, and nothing has been followed up. There has been little or no--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just conclude by saying, this would be the wrong \ndirection. This would be to signal that, once again, we are focused on \nrewarding illegality rather than taking the steps necessary to create a \nlawful system, and at that point we can more fairly go to the American \npeople and ask them to consider what to do in a compassionate way for \nthose here illegally.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to Senator DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the motives of those who sponsored the bill. \nIt is true that by us not enforcing our laws over many years we have \ncreated a lot of tragic circumstances. But the solution is not to \nreward lawbreaking and create incentives for more illegal immigration \nin the future.\n  America has asked us to secure our borders, create a worker ID \nsystem, and an immigration system that works. If we do this, if we \nbuild that foundation, then the possibility of comprehensive reform \nbecomes a reality.\n  I would encourage my colleagues not to chip away in the way of trying \nto provide compassion through amnesty, but let's fix the system like we \npromised and revisit this next year. Then, hopefully, we can achieve \nthe comprehensive reforms that my colleagues have talked about. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against proceeding to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 8 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what are we talking about? We are talking \nabout children. We are talking about children who are brought to this \ncountry by their parents. Since when in America do we visit the sins \nand crimes of parents on children?\n  If a parent commits a crime, does that mean the child goes to prison? \nIf a parent disqualifies himself or herself from American citizenship, \ndoes that mean the child can never have a chance? Is that what America \nhas come\n\n[[Page S13306]]\n\nto amidst the confusion and distortion and vitriol on this debate on \nimmigration, children such as Marie Gonzalez? She was brought to this \ncountry from Costa Rica by her parents at the age of 5. Her parents \nhave been deported as illegals. Because I have made a special request, \nshe has been allowed to continue to finish her college education at \nWestminister College in Missouri. Her goal is to be an American and to \ngive to the only country she has ever known. Costa Rica is not her \ncountry; America is her country.\n  What we are talking about is turning these children out. And what \nsin, what crime did they commit? They obeyed their parents; they \nfollowed their parents. And for some, that is going to be a mark of \nCain on their head forever in America. Is that what we are all about? \nGive these kids a chance. Meet them. Take time to see these children. \nMany of us have.\n  And what you will see in their eyes is the same kind of hope for this \ncountry we want to see in our own children's eyes, to be doctors and \nnurses and teachers, engineers, to find cures for diseases, start \nbusinesses, the things that make America grow.\n  Give these kids a chance. Do not take your anger out on illegal \nimmigration on children who have nothing to say about this. They were \nbrought to this country, they have lived a good life, they have proven \nthemselves, they have beaten the odds. We need them.\n  Do not turn around and tell me tomorrow that you need H1-B visas to \nbring in talented people to America because we do not have enough. Do \nnot tell me you need H2-B, H2-A, and all of the rest of them if you are \ngoing to turn away these children, if you are going to say: America \ndoesn't need you, go about your business, find someplace in the world. \nDo not come back to me and tell me that we need a bigger labor pool and \nmore talent in America.\n  How can we say no to hope? How can we say no to these kids when all \nthey want is a piece of the American dream? Please, vote to proceed to \nthe DREAM Act. I will work with Senator Hutchison on a bipartisan \namendment. We will do our best. I think we can come up with something. \nGive us a chance. Give these kids a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I need to correct one statement I made \npreviously. I said the President had issued a veto threat. He does not \nnormally do that on a motion for cloture situation. It was a statement \nof objection for the bill without an explicit threat of veto.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, either my colleague Senator Boxer or I \nhave updated the Senate each day on the California wildfire situation. \nSenator Boxer is in California now, and I believe the President is as \nwell. I wish to give a brief update to the Senate.\n  So far, this is the largest evacuation of people in California \nhistory. It is the largest evacuation in the United States since \nKatrina. San Diego remains the worst of the burning regions.\n  As of this morning, the President has approved individual assistance \nprograms that will allow FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nto make payments for rental assistance, home repair, and pay for some \nhome replacement costs.\n  As soon as the fires die down and the wind in places is easing, FEMA \nwill set up centers. I urge Californians, who have been evacuated from \ntheir homes, who have had their homes partially\n\n[[Page S13307]]\n\nburned or burned to the ground, to go to FEMA centers and see what \nassistance is available to you.\n  This morning, on television, I heard a family speak. I think they are \nfrom Escondido. I think they have a few acres--12. They had a home. \nThey have children. The home was burned down, but the father said: We \nhave fire insurance.\n  Then I heard of another family, with four young children, and no fire \ninsurance. The father has no relatives in the area. Fortunately, the \nwife has a mother with whom the family will be in the near term. But \nthey said: We don't know what we will do.\n  For those people who are in the ``We don't know what we will do'' \ncategory, this is the job of FEMA, to be out there, to open those \ncenters, and to offer help and aid to these people.\n  So please, Californians, use this.\n  More than 950,000 people have been ordered evacuated.\n  More than 420,000 acres have burned. That is roughly 656 square \nmiles. If you think of it, it is a huge area.\n  More than 6,000 firefighters are battling 19 active fires. They range \nfrom north of Los Angeles to San Diego, and they have crossed the \nMexican border.\n  More than 1,155 homes have been destroyed and 68,000 are threatened.\n  Two deaths are reported so far. I believe there are others.\n  Now, if the winds die down today, we will be able, hopefully, to get \na handle on it. The vast bulk of the damage now is occurring in \npopulated areas.\n  The good news: The canyon fire in Malibu is 75 percent contained.\n  The bad news: Most of the other fires are uncontained and out of \ncontrol.\n  Interstate 5, the main artery between San Diego and Los Angeles, was \nclosed in both directions earlier, near Camp Pendleton, because of \nsmoke. Northeast of San Diego, the town of Julian has been evacuated.\n  I am particularly concerned about the coming days and the Herculean \ntask of feeding, caring, and providing shelter to hundreds of thousands \nof displaced Californians. We have more than 10,000 in Qualcomm \nStadium, another 2,000 at the clubhouse at the Del Mar Race Track.\n  The Red Cross is doing great. Thank you, Red Cross. Thank you, Red \nCross volunteers. They are manning at least three shelters that I know \nabout, and up to this point food, water, and sanitary facilities have \nbeen adequate.\n  I think there is a lot of food for thought for Californians in what \nis happening in terms of the future, and perhaps it is too early to \nbegin to talk about it.\n  I do not think there is any blame to be cast on anyone. I think \neveryone is responding: the Governor, the mayors, Homeland Security, \nFEMA, and, of course, the President. I am very grateful for this, and I \nknow I am joined by my colleague Senator Boxer. She will be back \ntonight, and I know she will have stories to tell on the floor of the \nSenate tomorrow.\n  But I think we need to think a little bit in the future, particularly \nthose of us who come from local government. I spent 18 years in local \ngovernment, 9 as a county supervisor and 9 as a mayor, and there is one \nthing I know, and that is that local governments control zoning. I \nthink the local governments have to begin to look at their zoning about \nthe siting of new housing developments in floodplains in the northern \npart of the State, around levees and the siting of large subdivisions \nin the path of Santa Ana winds in parched, dry areas of the State where \nthese winds blow hard and hot.\n\n  In this case, at least up to this point, we believe power lines blew \ndown. The winds were so forceful they actually turned large container \ntrucks on their side, and the fires were so strong and burned so hot \nthat they melted the metal of automobiles so that, literally, nothing \nwas left. It could sweep off of a ridge and within minutes come down \nthat ridge and just devour homes and take pieces of board, which are \ncalled embers, and send them a mile or two away to start a new fire.\n  In San Diego 4 years ago, there was the cedar fire. It destroyed \n2,000 homes. And now there is this fire in the same area.\n  So the question comes: Would local officials be well advised to take \na look at zoning codes and to begin to protect areas that are prone to \ncatastrophic wildfire from housing developments?\n  Secondly, community fire plans. Community fire plans are very good. \nCommunities can come together--they did it in the cedar fire area, and \nthey have done it quite successfully--to be able to establish fire \nplans: how they keep a fire break from their house, what they can take \ndown, the kind of ground cover they should have, the kind of roof that \nis fire resistant, the siding that is fire resistant--and actually get \nsome Government help to implement these fire plans. This is now going \non in the Nevada Tahoe area and in the California Tahoe area as well.\n  So I believe very strongly that local officials should exercise their \nzoning control to see that citizens in the future are protected by \nstaying out of heavily fire-prone and heavily flood-prone areas. I will \nbe having more to say about that in the future.\n  It is also pretty clear to me that we have to develop some \nGovernment-helped catastrophic insurance. I have been very concerned. \nAllstate Insurance Company pulled out of California, and they pulled \nout of California because they said: It is catastrophe prone, it is \nfire prone, it is earthquake prone, and we--Allstate--don't want any \npart of it. So they are not insuring in California any longer. This \nmust not be allowed to happen. Companies must not be allowed to cherry-\npick the United States and only insure areas that are safe and secure \nand say to other areas: You are on your own.\n  So we are kind of rethinking this area. I think the State of \nCalifornia, which has an earthquake authority which helps underwrite \ninsurance in earthquake-prone areas, perhaps should also develop a \nflood and fire authority where they can enter into the same kind of \nundertaking. Just think about what it would be like to have four \nchildren standing in front of a television camera and saying: My house \nburned down. With it, all my possessions, all my children's \npossessions, all our photographs and albums and memories, and virtually \neverything we held dear, and we have no insurance. Think about it. \nThink about how you would feel if you were in that situation.\n  So I think there is going to be a lot of food for thought coming out \nof these fires in terms of public policy, and I am delighted that my \ncolleague, Senator Boxer, is there, and I look forward to her report \ntomorrow. I believe we will have much more to say about the public \npolicy that goes into the future for our State and other States that \nare catastrophe prone.\n  I will just tell my colleagues one other little story. I received a \ncall a while ago from the head of the San Francisco Fine Arts Museum \nsaying that they had an opportunity to bring two paintings to show in \nSan Francisco from the Met, and the insurance for those two paintings \nwas $8 billion, just to bring them out for show. Why? Because insurance \nwas being denied because California was a catastrophe-prone area. This \nis just one other example of what is ricocheting out there under the \nsurface now, and I think this body has to become involved. Any one of \nus can have a catastrophe. Any one of us can have a major bombing. Any \none of us can have a major earthquake, a major flood, or major fires. I \nthink it is up to us to see that we have in place the regulations and \nthe laws that enable people to get the insurance they need on a cost-\neffective basis to be able to restore their lives and rebuild once \nagain.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is there any pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business, with Senators \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in morning business. \nBefore I do, I just want to express my concern and sympathy to Senator \nFeinstein and the people of California. It has been horrendous. I \ncaught some of it last night, and my wife has been watching it off and \non all day. It is a horrifying spectacle to see the power of that fire \nand the helplessness you face when the winds are right. I think it \ndoes, I say to the Senator, indicate, as she has suggested, whether we \nare talking about hurricanes or earthquakes or fires or floods, we can \nprobably do a better job with policy and reaction to that. I look \nforward to working with the Senator from California.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13308-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13308-S13310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13308]]\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts on \nthe vote we cast on the DREAM Act. I really believe it was an important \nissue. It went beyond what some might think in that it dealt with some \nissues that are important to America, what we are thinking of as a \ncountry, and why we need to get the immigration issue correct. We can \ndo it. It is something that is important. But once again, we sort of \nfell into the trap of focusing on helping to meet what the needs or \ndesires are of people who are here illegally and not focusing on \nrestoring the rule of law to immigration enforcement. So I think the \nSenate leadership's commitment to moving this legislation would have \nbeen a step in exactly the wrong direction. I believe the strong \nbipartisan vote against it indicates that there remains grave concern \nabout this kind of amnesty proposal, particularly in light of the fact \nthat we have not achieved any significant progress toward enforcement \nof our laws at the border, at the workplace, and in other areas.\n  I would just say as a person who has worked on this with some \ndetermination in the last several years that I have absolutely come to \nbelieve that if we do a series of things, we can create a lawful system \nof immigration in America. That is important because I think a lot of \npeople think it is just not possible, that nothing we do will work. But \nthat is not true. If we have a good legal system, if we have a good \nenforcement system at the border, if we make it difficult for people to \nwork, eliminate the job magnet and create a work card, an \nidentification card that is biometric and can't be easily \ncounterfeited, we could see a dramatic return to lawfulness in \nimmigration. That would be so good for America. It would so reduce the \nfrustration and anger that is out there.\n  As I have said before, I don't think people are angry at immigrants, \nalthough some of the people who support these legislative acts that I \nthink have been bad have tried to suggest that the anger which is out \nthere among the American people is directed at immigrants. It is really \ndirected at us. The American people have been requesting for 30, 40 \nyears that we create a lawful system of immigration, and Congress has \ncontinued to stiff them--just refused to do it--and talks about it and \npromises and passes this bill or that bill or this provision or that \nprovision, all the time suggesting that these are going to make a \ndifference. Then, either we don't fund them adequately, so they never \nreally take place, or the bill is a discrete piece of legislation that \nnever has much impact on the overall situation we have confronted and \ndoes not do any significant--does not take us in any significant way \ntoward a lawful system.\n  I hope this strong vote sends a message that this Senate, prior to \ncreating a lawful system of immigration both at our border and in the \nworkplace, is not prepared to undertake the huge AgJOBS legislation. \nSenator Reid has said he would bring that up again, but maybe this vote \nwill encourage him not to do so.\n  The DREAM Act, which we just rejected, would have given, in short \norder, every benefit of citizenship--including citizenship--to 1.3 \nmillion persons. The AgJOBS bill that we keep hearing will be brought \nup will be an additional 3.3 million. So that is a third of the amount \nof people who would be provided the benefits of amnesty, a third of the \nnumber that was in the bill this summer that the American people \nrejected. The DREAM Act, as I said, would have provided amnesty for \nover 1.3 million, according to the Migration Policy Institute--not a \nconservative group. It would give current illegal aliens a financial \nbonus. They would be eligible for instate tuition, subsidized student \nloans, and Federal work study.\n  So if you have a problem with illegality--and I just want to share \nthis with my colleagues; these are not insignificant points I am \nmaking--if you are going to create a lawful system of immigration into \nAmerica, you are going to have to have some sanctions and punishments \nand prosecutions.\n  More than that, you absolutely can't give benefits to people who have \nviolated our laws, who have gotten past our borders, and then we start \nrewarding them with benefits. So a number of years ago, in 1996, we \nsaid that if you are a person coming to our country illegally and you \nwere illegally here, you at least shouldn't get instate tuition when \nyou go to college. You ought to not be in a better position than a \nlawful American who might live a few miles across the State line. That \nwas the deciding vote here. This would have reversed that--not only \nthat; as I said, it would give them subsidized student loans, Stafford \nloans and other loans, as well as work study benefits. So, as they say, \nif you are in a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. If you \nwould like to end and reduce illegal immigration, stop rewarding it, \nplease. That is what we are talking about.\n  So this bill I think went too far in a number of ways. I was actually \npleased that President Bush's administration analyzed it and strongly \nopposed it and sent us a letter to that effect. So even President Bush, \nwho strongly supports immigration into America and has supported a lot \nof the legislation here, opposed this bill. I think they were right in \ndoing so.\n  I would note that under the DREAM Act, individuals, once they have \nbeen here 5 years and did 2 years of college without a degree being \nrequired--they got 2 years of college--they would then be able to bring \ntheir family members.\n  Some say: Well, they were brought here as a young child and through \nno fault of their own, and so they ought to be given the benefits of \nthis amnesty. Well, that is not a uniform picture. It does tug at our \nheart strings, and we do care about that. It is something we are going \nto have to deal with sooner or later: how we are going to deal with \npeople who came here a long time ago?\n  But many people came here at age 15. You only have to be here prior \nto age 15. Maybe they came and lived with their brothers, sisters, \ncousins, aunts and uncles, and then they are immediately put on a path \nto citizenship. They are then able, after that, to become a citizen and \nto bring their parents or maybe the parents are here. They would also \nbe able to bring in their wife and children, plus bringing brothers and \nsisters. That is the way the system would work. I think it is not a \ngood process. I am pleased the Senate agreed with that.\n  I will conclude by making some points about policy and the question \nof the rule of law in our country. If we are serious about securing our \nborders, the first thing you do is stop providing benefits to those who \ncome illegally. That is the first and most obvious step we can take. \nThe principle is clear: If there are benefits to breaking the law, \npeople will continue to do it. When you subsidize something, you get \nmore of it. If you subsidize people who are here illegally by giving \nthem student loans and in-State tuition, you will encourage that. You \nwill also send a message that is even more important--that if you can \nget into America illegally and hold on a few years, you will be \nrewarded in advance of those who are here legally and are waiting in \nline.\n  This is an untenable position for our Nation. A nation that wants \nitself to be considered seriously, a nation that respects its laws and \ncares about that must follow through. We cannot abandon our commitment \nto the rule of law. You have to be consistent. That is what sends the \nmessage that builds respect for the law, and not just in the United \nStates, I submit; it would be sending that message and broadcasting \nthat message to the world. If we don't do it, the message we are \nbroadcasting to the world is that if you can bring, send or assist a \nteenager to come into the United States, the United States will educate \nthem all the way through college--and we do that. We don't require you \nto be a legal American citizen to go to schools in Alabama or anyplace \nin America, nor to college. But you are not supposed to get in-State \ntuition if you are here illegally.\n  Not only would you be able to carry through with that, but you would \nbe able to, in 5 years, get a permanent resident status, a citizenship, \nand then you would be able to bring your family in. That is not the \nright direction, I submit, we should be going in. We don't want to send \nthe wrong message.\n  The question sort of comes down to, do we have the will to enforce \nour immigration law? Do we have the will to do it? Will we stand on \nprinciple and law and sound public policy? Or will we allow emotion and \npolitics to further erode an already weak immigration\n\n[[Page S13309]]\n\nsystem and further erode the perception that we are serious about \ncreating a lawful system. Passing the DREAM Act today would, in the \nwake of failed comprehensive reform that we had this summer--if we had \ndone that before we have been able to secure our borders and before we \nhave been able to create a lawful system of immigration, that is not \nthe right way for us to go. It is not. It cannot be gotten around. It \nsends the wrong message. It will say we have immigration laws but no \nintent to enforce them. It will send a message that if you break our \nlaws, not only will that be forgiven, but you will be put at the head \nof the line and you will be financially rewarded for it.\n  That is not what we have to do to create a lawful system. The rule of \nlaw in this country is important. I was a Federal prosecutor for almost \n15 years. I was attorney general of Alabama. I have worked with law \nenforcement all my professional life. I remember distinctly talking \nwith law enforcement officers about the sale of marijuana in \nneighborhoods. Sometimes local police would say: You know, these are \nsmall amounts of marijuana and we cannot focus on the small cases. We \nonly focus on the dealers. That was a mindset a lot of police \ndepartments had. They discouraged that. I would tell them that, in \neffect, if you take that policy, you have legalized the sale of \nmarijuana in that neighborhood. Not only that, you have created an \nunlawful system in that neighborhood and you will have created violence \nand instability that adversely impacts the good and decent people who \nlive in that neighborhood. You cannot do that.\n  You see, there are moral and legal and practical consequences of \nhaving a legal system that is not enforced. It adds up. That is what we \nhave done in immigration. We have looked the other way and denied it is \nhappening, and we have let people with special interests dominate the \ndebate and we have talked about making the system lawful, but we have \nnever done it. That is why the American people are not happy with us. \nWe have not been trustworthy. We have not been reliable. We have not. \nIf we would get this system right, we could do a lot better job about \nmaking it work in an effective way. The American people want us to do \nthat.\n  I have to tell you, why do people want to come to America? They think \nthey can make a better life here. If there has been crime and \ninstability and theft and abuse and unfairness in the system that was \nin the place they came from, they feel like if they come to America and \nthey have a problem here, they can go to court and they will be \nprotected and they can make money and build assets and people will not \ncome and steal it from them. They can leave something for their \nchildren and they can work hard and send their children to college and \nthey will be able to do even better. That is why they want to come \nhere. It is all founded on the rule of law. The reason we are a unique \nnation--and you know that great hymn that says our liberty is in law--\nis that our legal system has made us great, prosperous, and free.\n\n  I don't think it is a good policy that we allow millions of people to \ncome to our country in violation of our law. I think that sends a wrong \nmessage to them and undermines the very legal system that makes the \ncountry so attractive. I remember in the debate, Senator Grassley, who \nis a direct speaker, a farmer from Iowa and now the ranking member on \nthe Finance Committee, made a speech. He said he was here in 1986 as a \nMember of this body. He remembered the debate. During those debates, it \nwas said that in 1986 this would be amnesty, but it is the last time, \nwe would never do it again. He said: Let me ask you why nobody this \ntime, in this debate, a few months ago this summer, is saying we will \nnot have anymore amnesty again. Why are people not saying that? He said \nthe answer is obvious. If we had amnesty in 1986, and 20 years later we \nhave it again, nobody with a straight face can stand up before the \nworld or the American people and say that we would not have amnesty \nafter this one, that this is going to be the last one. How silly is \nthat? We said that a few years ago.\n  So this is not a small matter. What principle can you utilize to say \nto a young person, or any other person who came into our country \nillegally today, 10, 15 years from now--what principle can you \narticulate as to why they should not be given amnesty when we gave it \nto people today? You see, this is a matter of seriousness. It cannot be \nignored. I feel strongly about that. I want my colleagues to know our \ncountry needs to create a lawful system of immigration. Once that is \naccomplished and the American people feel comfortable about that, we \ncan think about a way, I believe, that would be effective and \ncompassionate for those who are here today and that is rational and \nthat we can defend. I don't believe we can defend that today, when our \nsystem is not working.\n  I see my time has expired. I will wrap up and say I think we did the \nright thing in this vote today. Hopefully, we will continue to work \ntoward a lawful system of immigration and, if we do that, a lot of \nthings will become possible in the future that are not possible and \nappropriate and should not be done today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Statement of Administration Policy \nthat opposes the DREAM Act, which we rejected a short while ago, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Administration Policy--S. 2205, Development--Relief, and \n                 Education for Alien Minors Act of 2007\n\n  The administration continues to believe that the Nation's broken \nimmigration system requires comprehensive reform. This reform should \ninclude strong border and interior enforcement, a temporary worker \nprogram, a program to bring the millions of undocumented aliens out of \nthe shadows without amnesty and without animosity, and assistance that \nhelps newcomers assimilate into American society. Unless it provides \nadditional authorities in all of these areas, Congress will do little \nmore than perpetuate the unfortunate status quo.\n  The administration is sympathetic to the position of young people who \nwere brought here illegally as children and have come to know the \nUnited States as home. Any resolution of their status, however, must be \ncareful not to provide incentives for recurrence of the illegal conduct \nthat has brought the Nation to this point. By creating a special path \nto citizenship that is unavailable to other prospective immigrants--\nincluding young people whose parents respected the Nation's immigration \nlaws--S. 2205 falls short. The administration therefore opposes the \nbill.\n  The primary change wrought by S. 2205 would be to establish a \npreferential path to citizenship for a special class of illegal aliens. \nSpecifically, S. 2205 awards permanent status to any illegal alien who \nis under 30, has been in the United States for five years after \narriving as a child, and has completed two years of college or in the \nuniformed services. This path to citizenship is unavailable to any \nother alien, no matter how much promise he or she may have, no matter \nhow much he or she may contribute to American society. Moreover, the \npath that S. 2205 creates would allow illegal aliens to obtain a green \ncard before many individuals who are currently lawfully waiting in \nline.\n  Sponsors of S. 2205 argue that the bill is necessary in order to give \nchildren who are illegal aliens incentives to obtain an education. But \nit is difficult to reconcile that professed aim with the bill's \nretroactivity provisions: even those who attended college years earlier \nwill be eligible for a green card.\n  The legal status that the bill grants its beneficiaries means that \nthey can petition almost instantly to bring family members into the \ncountry. It also places them on the fast track to citizenship because \nthey can immediately begin accruing the residence time in the United \nStates that is necessary for naturalization. Finally, this legal status \nentitles the bill's beneficiaries to certain welfare benefits within 5 \nyears.\n  The bill is also indiscriminate in whom it would make eligible for \nthe program. For example, S. 2205 includes loopholes that would \nauthorize permanent status for certain aliens convicted of multiple \nmisdemeanors and even felonies.\n  The open-ended nature of S. 2205 is objectionable and will inevitably \nlead to large-scale document fraud. The path to citizenship remains \nopen for\n\n[[Page S13310]]\n\ndecades, thus creating a strong temptation for future illegal aliens to \npurchase fraudulent documents on a burgeoning black market. Moreover, \nthe bill's confidentiality provisions are drawn straight from the 1986 \namnesty law and will provide the same haven for fraud and criminality \nas that law did.\n  Immigration is one of the top concerns of the American people--and of \nthis administration--but it needs to be addressed in a comprehensive \nand balanced way that avoids creating incentives for problems in the \nfuture.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the sad \nstate of the appropriations process, as well as our long-term fiscal \nhealth. The new fiscal year began 23 days ago, and we are debating \nappropriations bills that haven't even passed the Senate yet, as \nGovernment agencies operate on temporary, stopgap funding. When we \nRepublicans were in the majority, we consistently failed to enact all \nof the appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year. We \nenacted short-term continuing resolutions, or CRs, to keep agencies \nfunded while we wrapped several of those bills into an end-of-the-year \nomnibus bill.\n  After the Democrats won control of the Senate, I sincerely hoped they \nwould fulfill their promises to manage the budget better. But while the \nparty in power has changed, the results have stayed the same. In fact, \nthe results, so far, have been even worse. Fiscal year 2008 has already \nstarted, and we have enacted exactly zero appropriation bills.\n  Government-by-CR has consequences. Agencies cannot plan for the \nfuture. They cannot make hiring decisions. They cannot sign contracts. \nAs a result, we get more waste and inefficiency from Government. We get \nlower quality services provided to the people. At the end of the day, \nwe get higher spending and less accountability and oversight of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  On September 23, the New York Times reported that our failures could \nhave a devastating effect on cancer research because scientists are \nwaiting around to hear if they will receive grants for their innovative \nresearch ideas. The same article quoted a transportation industry \nrepresentative as saying our failure could have major implications for \nanyone who rides in cars, trucks, trains, buses, and subways. If you \nwant more examples of how Congress's failure to do its job on time \naffects ordinary Americans, I invite you to visit my Web site, where I \nprovide several additional examples.\n  That is why a bipartisan group of Senators agree that we need to \nadopt biennial budgeting by the Federal Government, such as I had as \nGovernor of Ohio, so Congress can get its work done on time while also \nconducting the oversight necessary to ensure that programs and agencies \nare functioning effectively.\n  Senator Domenici has been a leader on biennial budgeting for years. \nWe should adopt it during this Congress and name it the Pete Domenici \nBiennial Budgeting Act as part of Pete's legacy to this country.\n  Putting aside our short-term failures and focusing on our long-term \nproblems, in January I introduced the Securing America's Future \nEconomy, or SAFE Commission Act, legislation that would create a \nbipartisan commission to look at our Nation's tax and entitlement \nsystems and recommend reforms to put us back on a fiscally sustainable \ncourse and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future \ngenerations.\n  I commend two of my colleagues, the Budget Committee chairman from \nNorth Dakota and the ranking member from New Hampshire, for recently \nintroducing a bipartisan bill that would create a tax and entitlement \nreform task force very similar to my SAFE commission. In fact, I saw \nthem on CNBC recently talking about it. The only major difference is \nthat Senators Conrad and Gregg require every congressional appointee to \nbe a sitting Member of Congress, whereas the SAFE commission would \ninclude outside experts. I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Conrad-\nGregg proposal, and I am pleased to learn they intend to hold a hearing \non the bill in the very near future. I look forward to working with \nthem to get the bill passed.\n  I also commend Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee and \nRepublican Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia who introduced a \nbipartisan SAFE commission bill in the House of Representatives. I have \nbeen working with Congressman Wolf for more than a year on this \nproposal, and I welcome Congressman Cooper's decision to join us.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral group has support from corporate \nexecutives, religious leaders, and think tanks across the political \nspectrum, from the Heritage Foundation to the Brookings Institution, \nand former Members from both parties, such as former Senators Warren \nRudman and Bob Kerrey, and former Congressmen Bill Frenzel and Leon \nPanetta.\n  Our entitlement programs are creaking under the strain of an aging \nsociety and runaway health care costs. Our Tax Code is imploding from \nthe hundreds of economic and social policies that Congress pursues \nthrough tax incentives and from the dozens of temporary tax provisions \nthat wreak havoc on families and businesses trying to plan their \naffairs.\n  Neither our major entitlement programs nor our Tax Code are \nsustainable in the current form. The appropriations bills that we are \ndebating this week are shrinking as a share of the budget as \nentitlements crowd out domestic discretionary spending. We must come \ntogether and develop a bipartisan consensus to fix these systems so our \nchildren and grandchildren can enjoy prosperity and increasing \nstandards of living.\n  I want to share with my colleagues some extraordinary numbers that \nreveal our Nation's looming fiscal crisis. I speak out of concern not \nonly for our generation but also for our children and our \ngrandchildren. They are going to bear the burden of reckless fiscal \npolicies.\n  Sir Edmund Burke, the father of conservative thought, said:\n\n       Society is . . . a partnership not only between those who \n     are living, but between those who are living, those who are \n     dead, and those who are to be born.\n\n  Unless we change course, we will break that partnership with those \nwho are yet to be born. This grave situation can be addressed only \nthrough hard bipartisan work, and we must begin our work now, for every \nday we wait, the solutions become more painful.\n  In the simplest of terms, the Federal Government continues to spend \nmore than it brings in. Running up the credit card for today's needs \nand leaving the bill for future generations should not be the policy of \nthis country, this Congress, or this administration. It represents a \nrecklessness that threatens our economic security, our global \ncompetitiveness, and our future quality of life. The Federal Government \nhas become the biggest violator of credit card abuse in the world.\n  Comptroller David Walker has said:\n\n       The greatest threat to our future is our fiscal \n     irresponsibility.\n\n  He added:\n\n       America suffers from a serious case of myopia, or \n     nearsightedness, both in the public sector and the private \n     sector. We need to start focusing more on the future. We need \n     to start recognizing the reality that we're on an imprudent \n     and unsustainable fiscal path, and we need to get started \n     now.\n\n  Everyone in this great body should heed Comptroller Walker's warning.\n  Our commitments to the war on terror, to securing our borders, to \neducating our workforce, and to investing in our Nation's \ninfrastructure demand tremendous resources and require long-term \nfinancial commitments. At the same time, we cannot ignore the \ndemographic tide that will soon overwhelm our resources. We need a \nsystem for raising the revenues necessary to fund these priorities that \ndoes as little damage to the economy as possible. In short, the need \nfor tax reform and entitlement reform has never been greater.\n  A historical perspective helps to highlight the gravity of our \ncurrent situation.\n  The fiscal year 2007 budget deficit was $163 billion, but that figure \nhides the true degree to which our fiscal situation has deteriorated, \nmainly because it uses every dime of the Social\n\n[[Page S13311]]\n\nSecurity surplus, as well as surpluses in other trust funds, to hide \nthe true size of the Government's operating deficit. The Social \nSecurity surplus, however, must be reserved for future retirees. As far \nas I know, you cannot spend the same money twice, but Congress keeps \npretending that it can.\n\n  If you wall off the Social Security surplus so Congress cannot spend \nit on other programs, as I believe we should do, then the Government's \noperating deficit more than doubles to $344 billion, not $163 billion. \nAnd if you add back the money the Government is borrowing from other \ntrust funds, such as Federal employee pensions, the deficit explodes to \n$441 billion, almost triple the reported deficit.\n  In other words, we are hiding from the public how much we are \nborrowing because we don't tell them about the money we are borrowing \nfrom trust funds. As a result, they see these numbers, such as the $163 \nbillion, and they think things are getting better, but we are hiding \nthe fact that we are spending every dime of these trust funds to keep \nthe Government going.\n  The annual difference between revenues and outlays is not what is \ntruly threatening our future. It is the cumulative, ongoing increase in \nour national debt that matters.\n  Remember, in 1992 when Ross Perot ran for President and he showed us \nthose frightening fiscal charts? Well, I have my own charts, and I call \nthese charts my Halloween charts. I call them that because, No. 1, the \nGovernment's new fiscal year starts in October and, No. 2, because the \nfiscal picture is terrifying.\n  Fifteen years ago, when Ross Perot was sounding the alarm, the \nnational debt was about $4 trillion. He showed a chart projecting that \nby 2007, the debt would increase to $8 trillion. Well, guess what. As \nof 2007, the national debt stands at almost $9 trillion. Ross Perot's \ndoomsday predictions turned out to be too rosy. In the more than 200 \nyears that have passed between the Declaration of Independence and Ross \nPerot's 1992 campaign, the U.S. Government accumulated $4 trillion in \ndebt. We have now added even more than that in the last 15 years.\n  This Congress has acknowledged that it will pass right by $9 \ntrillion. A few weeks ago, Congress very quietly voted to allow the \nnational debt to increase by another $800 billion, from about $9 \ntrillion to $9.8 trillion.\n  What does that mean, $9 trillion? How do we even fathom that number? \nFor one thing, it represents two-thirds of our entire national economy, \nthe worst number in 50 years. For another thing, it means that each \nman, woman, and child in the United States owes $30,000 of the Federal \nGovernment's debt. I want my colleagues to think about these young \npeople, the pages here today. All of you, every one of you, owe $30,000 \non the debt we have accumulated.\n  That $30,000 only represents the debt racked up by the Government in \nthe past. Because we continue borrowing more than we bring in, that \nnumber is increasing every single day. And those numbers pale in \ncomparison with the budget problems looming in our future as the baby \nboom generation begins to retire just 69 days from now, on January 1, \n2008. In fact, just last week, the first baby boomer applied for Social \nSecurity retirement benefits. Reality is setting in that this is not \njust a far-off prediction. It is a growing storm that threatens to \noverwhelm our economy if we do not act now.\n  Perhaps even more concerning is that 55 percent of the privately \nowned debt is held by foreign creditors, mostly foreign central banks. \nThat's up from 35 percent just 6 years ago. Foreign creditors provided \nmore than 80 percent of the funds the United States has borrowed since \n2001, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  And who are these foreign creditors? According to the Treasury \nDepartment, the three largest holders of U.S. debt are China, Japan, \nand the OPEC nations. Borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from \nChina and OPEC puts not only our future economy, but also our national \nsecurity, at risk. It is critical that we ensure that countries that \ncontrol our debt do not control our future.\n  If after hearing all this, one still thinks this is a problem that \nexists only in the distant future, consider recent projections by the \nmajor credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's. For decades, U.S. \nTreasuries have been considered the risk-free investment against which \nthe risks of all other investments are judged. A good place to invest, \nour Treasuries. In fact, the global financial system is largely based \non the notion of U.S. Treasuries as the only risk-free investment out \nthere.\n  But in just 5 years, that will cease to be true. According to \nStandard & Poor's, U.S. Treasuries will lose their triple-A credit \nrating in 2012 because of the Government's deteriorating long-term \nfiscal position. Don't think that the world markets aren't looking at \nwhat we are doing in the United States. What kind of global economic \nturmoil awaits us 5 years from now when the U.S. Government is \nconsidered as risky as a typical corporation? What happens if the \nforeign banks decide they are going to move their money out of the \nUnited States and send it somewhere else? And what economic catastrophe \nawaits our children and grandchildren in 2025 when Standard & Poor's \nprojects that U.S. Treasuries will be classified as junk bonds?\n  Why do we refuse to see the warning signs? A decade ago, who ever \nwould have imagined that the Canadian dollar would be worth just as \nmuch as a U.S. dollar? A few years ago, the Euro was worth 83 cents. \nNow it is worth $1.42. Meanwhile, our trade deficit has gone through \nthe roof as we Americans are forced to borrow the money we need to buy \nforeign products.\n  What is driving this train wreck? Certainly additional revenues have \nto be part of the solution. But this is not a problem that will be \nsolved simply by reaching deeper into the American people's pockets. \nMany colleagues are familiar with Pete Peterson, former Commerce \nSecretary. He made it clear that ``The minute you start looking at a \ntax increase as the primary solution, you're confronted with tax \nincreases that are clearly beyond anything anyone can imagine.''\n  Even the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee has acknowledged \nthat most of the heavy lifting will have to be done on the spending \nside. Revenues will be on the table for sure, but the coming storm will \nrequire significant changes to entitlement programs.\n  Here are some numbers tho help put this situation in perspective. \nForty years ago in 1967, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid made \nup only 3 percent of the GDP. In 2007, their cost has tripled as a \nshare of the economy to 9 percent. The Congressional Budget Office \nprojects that over the next 40 years, this number could double again to \n18 percent, a frightening thought when we consider that in 2006 total \nfederal revenues accounted for only 18 percent of GDP. It reminds me of \nwhen I was Governor of Ohio. I called Medicaid the Pac-Man in Ohio.\n  Well, today I would refer to entitlements as the Pac-Man in terms of \nour national finances. If entitlement spending continues on this path, \nwe will be required to use every cent of our Federal revenue to fulfill \nthese entitlement obligations. Our grandchildren will have no money for \nnational defense, energy security, education, the environment, or our \ninfrastructure. And, they'll look back at our generation and ask how we \ncould be so reckless with their futures.\n  Our Nation faces one of the most competitive environments in its \nhistory, and the question is, in this new world of global \ncompetitiveness, will future generations be able to enjoy the same \nstandard of living we are experiencing? Will my kids, will my \ngrandchildren be able to enjoy the same standard of living I have \nenjoyed? Will they have the opportunity for the same quality of life? \nWith the largest national debt in 50 years, will we be able to remain \ncompetitive with foreign economies?\n  Congress must view our Tax Code, entitlement system, and the budget \nprocess as three components or pillars of the Nation's fiscal \nfoundation, and not as separate problems. Each is linked to the other \ntwo pillars, and we must reform all three to raise the necessary \nrevenue to fund the Government in an economically efficient manner, to \nkeep our obligations to future generations, and to keep the size of \nGovernment to a manageable level.\n  We must enact fundamental tax reform to help make the Tax Code \nsimple, fair, transparent, and economically efficient. According to the \nPresident's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, headed by former \nSenators Connie\n\n[[Page S13312]]\n\nMack and John Breaux, only 13 percent--think of this, only 13 percent--\nof taxpayers file without the help of either a tax preparer or computer \nsoftware. Since enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1986, over 15,000 \nprovisions have been added to the Internal Revenue Code.\n  It is not just a matter of saving taxpayers' time and effort. This is \nabout saving real money. The Tax Foundation estimates that \ncomprehensive tax reform could save Americans as much as $265 billion a \nyear in compliance costs associated with preparing their returns. Now, \nthat would be a real tax reduction that wouldn't cost the Treasury one \ndime.\n  Mr. President, I have been working on tax reform for years. In 2003, \nI attached an amendment to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act that would have created a blue ribbon commission to \nstudy fundamental tax reform. The amendment was adopted by voice vote \nbut later removed in conference. Then, in the autumn of 2004, I offered \nmy tax reform commission amendment again, this time to the American \nJobs Creation Act. The Senate again adopted my amendment. During \nconference negotiations, the White House contacted me and requested I \nwithdraw my amendment because the President was preparing to take a \nleadership role by appointing his own tax reform panel. I \nenthusiastically agreed to defer to his leadership, and I withdrew my \namendment. It seemed to me that the tax reform bandwagon was finally \nstarting to roll.\n  In January 2005, President Bush announced the creation of the all-\nstar panel headed up by former Senators Connie Mack and John Breaux, \nand that panel spent most of the year engaging the American public to \ndevelop proposals to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more \nconducive to economic growth. In November of 2005, the panel issued its \nfinal report. While not perfect in everyone's mind, the panel's two \nplans provided a starting point for developing tax reform legislation \nthat would represent a huge improvement over the current system. The \npanel's proposals belong as a key part of the national discussion on \nfundamental tax reform.\n  Tinkering with the current Tax Code won't get it done. Tinkering is \nwhat has got us in this mess in the first place. It's time to rip the \nTax Code out by its roots and replace it with something that works.\n  The President's panel had a number of great ideas that we should \nincorporate into tax reform legislation. For example, we should \nsimplify the code by repealing the complex, unfair, and antigrowth \nalternative minimum tax. We should consolidate all the various tax-\npreferred savings plans into just two or three plans that average \nworkers and families can understand and utilize. We should scale back \nthe tax subsidies that we use to pursue social engineering and dictate \neconomic policy, forcing Americans who fail to qualify for tax breaks \nto pay higher rates to make up the lost revenue.\n  We must create a tax system that is conducive to job creation and \neconomic growth. We should start by addressing one of the biggest \nproblems with the current code, and that is it rewards moving \nproduction overseas. We are taxing our exports heavily and taxing our \nimports lightly. Such a system sounds absolutely perverse, but that's \nwhat we have in the United States.\n  In fact, a constituent of mine, Tom Secor, from Norwalk, OH, who owns \nhis own small business, came to my office and told a story about a \nbusiness trip he made to China. He said he saw an editorial in a \nChinese newspaper that was discussing the concerns of Americans about \nChinese competition. The conclusion of the editorial was that Americans \ncould solve most of their problems with Chinese competition if they \nwould just reform their own Tax Code. Imagine that, even Communist \nChina knows the United States needs tax reform to stay competitive. But \nfor some reason we refuse to learn that lesson ourselves.\n  We must also understand that unless we do tax reform, the lower \nmarginal rates, the lower capital gains taxes, the lower taxes on \ndividends will evaporate and we will have gained nothing in regard to \nfundamental tax reform and entitlement reform. And I think such reform, \nfolks, must take into account our failure to pay for the Iraq war. \nThis administration will have to explain why they are leaving us \nholding the bag and why they did not keep their promise for tax reform. \nThey promised us.\n\n  I know there is bipartisan support in this chamber to move forward on \nfundamental tax reform. Some of our colleagues have already taken steps \ntowards developing legislation that would represent a huge improvement \nover our current system. As I already mentioned, we have Senator Gregg \nand we have Senator Kent Conrad who want to get going, so we should \nendorse the approach they want to take and submit legislation that \nCongress could consider under fast-track procedures. The proposal \nbasically is to appoint eight Democrats and eight Republicans, \nincluding two top administration officials, and it would require a \nthree-fourths vote for submitting a proposal to Congress.\n  In other words, they do their work, and if three-fourths have said \nthis is what we want to do for tax reform and entitlement reform, we \nhave to vote on it up or down. That is really important because you \ncan't ask some of our colleagues to spend that kind of time on tax \nreform and entitlement reform and not guarantee them that if they agree \non something, they will get a vote on it.\n  Some say to me: George, it is too late to do something. Well, it is \nnot. And I think of Bill Bradley. Bill Bradley, in 1982, came up with a \ntax reform program. It took 4 years, but it was adopted in 1986. In \nother words, Ronald Reagan, working with Congress, reformed the Tax \nCode in 1986, and President Reagan is still fondly remembered as the \nleader who set the stage for years of prosperity at the end of the 20th \ncentury. He worked on a bipartisan basis. I think this President really \nhas an opportunity to do something in regard to this. I think the \nPresident and the administration should say to Congress: Everything is \non the table. No holds barred. I will sit down with you, and I will \nwork on it. And you know what. Maybe we will not get it done, but at \nleast we will start it. We will let the American people know that we \nunderstand that tax reform and entitlement reform is fundamental to the \nfuture of our country. What a nice legacy for our President, to at \nleast say he got into the game and did something about it and didn't \nsay you guys worry about it; it is your problem.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now. When you look at the numbers, \nit is self-evident we must confront our swelling national debt; that we \nmust make a concerted bipartisan effort to reform our tax system, slow \nthe growth of entitlement spending, and halt this freight train that is \nthreatening to crush our children and grandchildren's future.\n  Right now, in my lifetime, where I am at this stage, what I am \nworried about is the kids of America. I am worried about my \ngrandchildren and other people's grandchildren. What is the legacy that \nwe are going to leave those children and grandchildren? I don't know \nabout my colleagues, but I am worried. I am really worried. I am \nworried about whether we are going to develop the infrastructure of \ncompetitiveness so those kids can compete in that global marketplace.\n  It is in our hands. Folks back home sent us here to take on the tough \nproblems and make the tough decisions and do what is right for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13312-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13312-S13315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Nation was built on the belief that \nno matter where we start from in life, we all have a shot at the \nAmerican dream. I, for one, am very proud of this reputation, and I \nbelieve it is one we should continue to promote and maintain. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, somewhere along the way, amid politics \nand rhetoric, the belief that we\n\n[[Page S13313]]\n\nshould now turn our backs on certain children in our communities has \ngained a voice.\n  Mr. President, I am here on the floor of the Senate today because I \nbelieve we need to make sure that America remains a country of \nopportunity for all children, no matter where they come from, no matter \nwhat language they speak at home, and no matter what obstacles they \nhave to overcome. Earlier today in the Senate we had a chance to pay \nmore than just lipservice to the idea of opportunity for all. \nUnfortunately, a few Members of this body didn't think it was an \nAmerican priority.\n  I still believe in the DREAM Act and its power to not only give hope \nto many today but to make our country stronger in the future. In fact, \nwe can still give hope to many by passing the Development, Relief and \nEducation for Alien Minors Act. This DREAM Act was narrowly tailored \nbipartisan legislation that would give a select group of undocumented \nstudents the chance--the chance--to become permanent residents if they \ncame to this country as children, are long-term U.S. residents, have \ngood moral character, and attend college for at least 2 years or enlist \nin the military. Certainly, Mr. President, those are criteria that all \nof us would be very proud of.\n  Senator Durbin previously brought up the DREAM Act as an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill to address critical manpower shortages \nthat are facing our military forces. Under the DREAM Act, tens of \nthousands of well-qualified potential recruits would become eligible \nfor military service for the first time. These are young people who \nlove our country and are eager to serve in the Armed Forces during a \ntime of war. The DREAM Act would add a very strong incentive to enlist \nbecause it provides a path to permanent legal status.\n  The DREAM Act would also make qualified students eligible for \ntemporary, legal immigration status upon high school graduation that \nwould lead to permanent residency if--if--they attend college.\n  Mr. President, critics of this amendment would have you believe this \nis simply a matter of politics. Well, it is not. This is about real \npeople, and I want to tell you about one of them. Recently, the Seattle \nTimes, a newspaper in my State, featured the story of a young woman \nnamed Maria who has lived in the United States illegally since her \nparents brought her here at the age of 5. Maria completed high school \nin my home State of Washington. She did really well and was an active \nmember of the student body. In fact, she was elected class officer 3 \nyears in a row. Maria was accepted to the University of Washington. She \ngraduated with a high GPA and honors in her department of study.\n\n  Maria is now in her second year of law school, and to quote the \nSeattle Times:\n\n       By all rights, save one, she should have the world by the \n     tail. But she is dogged by the questions: When she graduates, \n     will she be able to take the bar exam? Will she be able to \n     keep helping low-income people as she's done during her \n     internship this summer with a non-profit legal-aid \n     corporation?\n\n  ``The DREAM Act is my only hope,'' Maria said in the article. ``I \nhope and I pray for it.''\n  Isn't Maria exactly the type of young person in whom we should be \ninvesting? She studied hard, she got good grades, she has served her \nschool, she has served her community, and now she wants to continue to \nserve her community and our country--the only home she has ever known.\n  It is not Maria's fault that her parents brought her to America when \nshe was 5 years old. It is not Maria's fault that Congress has not yet \npassed the comprehensive immigration reform we clearly need. But it is \nthe thousands of Marias out there who are living the consequences. We \ndo need comprehensive immigration reform, but we also need a Government \nthat invests in our children and understands that the face of the \nAmerican dream is not just one class or one race or one religion. Our \nNation is filled with young people who love this country, have beat the \nodds, and whom we should be investing in. We will reap the return we \ninvest.\n  The reason I know that is from personal experience. When I was young, \ngrowing up in a family of nine, I thought my family was doing fine. I \nknew we didn't have a lot of money. But my dad was stricken with \nmultiple sclerosis when I was a young teacher. All of a sudden, seven \nyoung kids under the age of 16 didn't know if they would ever be able \nto go to college, didn't know if they would ever even be able to \ngraduate from high school or how they were going to face the future.\n  Because this country was there for them and we had student loans and \nPell grants and a country that said: We are there with you, all seven \nof those children graduated from high school and graduated from \ncollege. Today, this country has a Microsoft employee. They have a \nlawyer who works very hard. They have a young mom who stays home with \nher two kids. They have a newspaper reporter who follows sports around \nthe country. They have an eighth grade teacher who has taught now, for \n25-plus years, eighth grade students. And they have a U.S. Senator. \nThat is a pretty good investment by our country for those seven kids \nwho thought they had lost their hope. That was my family.\n  I know what it is like to lose hope, and I know what it is like to \nhave hope behind you when your country steps in. That is what we are \ntalking about with the DREAM Act--young kids out there who are just \nlooking for a country to be behind them, who have the skills, who have \nthe capability, who are willing to be a part of this country, to give \nback if they could.\n  This is a real issue which touches real communities and real people \nacross our country. I actually got a letter from the superintendent of \nthe Lake Chelan School District in north central Washington. I wish to \nread what he wrote. He said:\n\n       Each year I watch students who have worked hard to be \n     successful during high school struggle to continue their \n     education after graduation because of their immigration \n     status. These students are an important part of America's \n     future and we must give them the opportunity to further their \n     education, contribute to society, and help build the American \n     dream for generations to come. Allowing these young people to \n     flourish is not only fair to them, but it also adds value to \n     our country's rich, vibrant, and diverse culture. They \n     deserve that opportunity to succeed regardless of the outcome \n     of the current immigration debate.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. I think it is important that we remember that \nthis debate is not just about immigration. It really is about what type \nof country we want to be. It is about what we stand for. It is about \nwhat type of future we want to build.\n  It is pretty easy to get caught up in the specifics of the policies \nwe debate. But I encourage all of my colleagues to not lose sight, \ntoday, as we struggle with this difficult debate, of the bigger \npicture, because this debate touches nearly every aspect of American \nlife, from our economy to our security, from our classrooms to our \nworkplaces. Most importantly, it speaks about our values.\n  I received a letter recently from a high school senior named Victor. \nVictor lives in Walla Walla, a small town on the Washington-Oregon \nborder. Victor wrote to me and he said:\n\n       I came to the U.S. when I was 10 years old. My most \n     difficult and only challenge I faced since I came to the U.S. \n     is education. I came to this country not knowing a single \n     word of English, therefore I had to learn it as fast as I \n     could. I was held back a grade and put into English as a \n     Second Language classes. It took me about a year to learn it \n     well enough to where I was able to be in classes with native \n     speakers.\n       I am currently part of the National Honors Society and I \n     also take part in fall and spring sports. I have been \n     accepted to the University of Washington and three other \n     Washington universities. . . . My plans are to go to the \n     University of Washington and get a degree in computer \n     science.\n       Unfortunately, I come from a low-income family, making it \n     hard for me to make further plans about my education. \n     Currently the federal government will not help with any \n     financial aid to any noncitizen in the United States. How do \n     you expect us to improve ourselves and succeed in this \n     country?\n\n  I would like to ask my colleagues how they answer Victor's question, \nhow they expect our Nation to continue to be one of hope, one of \nopportunity, if we close down our children's future rather than handing \nthem the keys to success. All of our children should have the \nopportunity to become more successful than their parents, and none of \nthem should be punished for their parents' decisions.\n  We have thousands of dedicated, motivated, and gifted students who \nhave been forced into the shadows through\n\n[[Page S13314]]\n\nno fault of their own. Like Victor, like Maria, they have beaten odds \nmany of us could never even imagine, and they want to serve now and \ncontribute back to America's future. It would be our mistake to say no.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider their votes today. I hope they \nwill say yes to the DREAM Act and yes to a richer, stronger, more \nvibrant American dream for all of us, for generations to come.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, more than 65,000 immigrant students will \ngraduate from U.S. high schools this year only to see the doors of \nopportunity closed to them. These are gifted and highly motivated \nchildren who grew up in the United States. For these children, many of \nwhom arrived to this country as babies, America is the only home they \nknow. They speak English fluently, and for many it is their first and \nonly language. Many have never even visited the country of their birth. \nThey have been educated in our public school system. They have stayed \nin school and stayed out of trouble. These kids are honor students, \nteam captains, student body presidents, and valedictorians.\n  Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country \nthey have ever known as home. But for these children, because of their \nimmigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a \npost-secondary education and reaching their full potential. Through no \nfault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied \ntheir chance at achieving their God-given potential.\n  What are we saying to these hard-working students? Well I will tell \nyou. We are saying they are not welcome in the only country they have \never known. We are telling them to go back to another country they \noften know little about, where they may not speak the language or \nunderstand the culture. These are children caught at a crossroads, and \nrather than providing them with an opportunity, we are holding them \naccountable for the actions of their parents.\n  That is not the America I know.\n  There is a solution to this crisis, but, sadly, the Senate today \nfailed to act. The DREAM Act--which I have proudly cosponsored for \nseveral years--would help expand opportunities for our Nation's \nimmigrant children. For those students who have grown up in the United \nStates, have demonstrated good moral character, and are pursuing a \ncollege education or have enlisted in the military, the DREAM Act will \nprovide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country.\n  There are many good reasons to enact the DREAM Act. In today's 21st \ncentury economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly becoming \nthe minimum requirement for higher earning jobs, we need to provide the \nchildren in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically, \nboth for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society. The \nDREAM Act would also strengthen our Nation's military readiness, \nallowing these well-qualified young men and women to serve their \ncountry with honor. But most importantly, the DREAM Act ensures that \nthe promise of the American dream becomes a reality for all our \nchildren.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act. The \nenactment of this legislation is long overdue, and I will continue to \nfight for its passage, for all of our children and our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their remarks \nthat were just concluded on the DREAM Act and for the vote in support \nof it. It is interesting to me that those who have taken no time to \nmeet the students who were involved in this issue come away with a much \ndifferent feeling. Once this goes beyond cliches and inflammatory \nrhetoric that you hear in what passes for entertainment--television and \nradio--and you actually sit down and hear these life stories, you just \ncan't help but have your heart touched by them. It happened to me a \nlong time ago, 6 years ago, and it continues to happen to me. But, \nunfortunately, we didn't have the votes. We had 52 votes when we needed \n60. In the Senate, 60 votes is a threshold requirement.\n  I thank the 11 Republicans who voted with me. I will tell you, it \ntook some courage for them to do it. It is not an easy vote for \nanybody. It is surely not an easy vote for them when the vast majority \nof their colleagues are going the other way.\n  I also thank the 41 Democrats who stood by me. Some of them did it \nwith pain in their eyes, thinking about: Now I have to go home and \nexplain this one. I understand that. I thank them for doing that.\n  After you have been around Capitol Hill for a few years--and I have--\nyou try to put things in perspective about your public service. I don't \nbelieve there are many, if any, who come to the Senate with the \nambition of retiring. Most of us come here with the ambition of doing \nsomething important for our Nation and serving our Nation. There \nreaches a point sometime in a career where risks have to be taken for \nimportant things to happen. What I did today was no great risk. I will \nprobably hear about it back home, and I already have a little bit, but \nI will just say in the course of our history the important things that \nhave occurred here in this Chamber have involved political risk and \ncontroversy--whether it is a question of voting on war or voting on \nissues involving civil rights and human rights. It is rare that you \nfind a great issue that makes a career that everybody agrees with.\n  I say to my colleagues who joined in this effort today, thank you \nfrom the bottom of my heart, but thanks also to the thousands of young \npeople across America who continue to follow this debate and follow \nthis issue so closely. The toughest part was not standing in the well \nand being told that I lost with only 52 votes; the toughest part was \nwalking up those stairs and facing 3 of the kids in my office. I didn't \nquite know what to expect. These young people have been through a lot, \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  One young man whose stepgrandfather failed to file the appropriate \ndocuments is 20 years old. A few years ago, he was arrested and \ndetained in jail over Christmas and New Year's. How is that for a high \nschool graduation present, to be told that you are illegal and subject \nto deportation?\n  Another young woman--her parents were outed as being illegal and \ndeported. I pled with the Department of Homeland Security to let her \nstay in school and finish her college degree, and they have allowed her \nto do that. I hope they will continue to. But she doesn't know where \nshe is going from here. She has lived in the United States since she \nwas a very young girl and this is her country, this is where she wants \nto be.\n  Another one is literally a young woman without a country. A refugee \nfrom Vietnam, she went to Germany and then came to the United States. \nVietnam is not a safe place for her to return to, and Germany doesn't \nwant her. She is without a country. She has a bachelor's degree and no \nplace to turn.\n  I didn't quite know what to expect when I went up to see them after \nthis disappointing vote, and they greeted me with smiles and \nencouragement. It is great to work around young people; they have such \ndetermination and energy, and they are not going to let anything get \nthem down. It made me feel better, and I am glad we did it even though \nwe weren't successful. It renewed my commitment to this issue.\n  I am not going to quit. I don't know when the next chance will be. I \nknow we have a busy schedule, and Senator Reid was kind enough to give \nme the chance today for a vote, but this is an idea whose time will \ncome because it is an idea based on justice and fairness. To think \nthese young people would see their lives ruined because their parents \nwere undocumented, because their parents brought them to this country, \nto think we would turn them away from America, saying we don't need any\n\n[[Page S13315]]\n\nmore electrical engineers, we don't need any more teachers and nurses \nand doctors--no, we know better than that. We need them. We need all of \nthem, and their strength makes us a stronger Nation.\n  So the day will come, and I hope soon, when we will have a chance for \nthose who follow the debate so closely and to those who understood \ntheir fate was in the hands of the Senators who voted this morning.\n  Do not give up. We have not given up yet and you should not give up. \nWe are going to keep pursuing this. We are in a sad and troubling \nmoment in American history when the issue of immigration is so \ndivisive. But let's be honest, it has always been divisive. There have \nalways been people saying: No more immigrants, please, in this nation \nof immigrants.\n  Immigrants have to play by the rules. They have to follow the law. I \nunderstand that. But let's not turn our back on our heritage as a \nnation. The strength of America is its diversity. The fact that we come \nfrom the four corners of the world to call this place home, the fact \nthat our parents and grandparents had the courage to pick up and move, \nrather than to be content with a life of mediocre opportunity--those \nare the people who made America, those are the ones who defined who we \nare. It is why we are special in this world, if we are, and I think we \nare.\n  We cannot let these young people go. We cannot afford to let them go. \nFor those several of the Senators today who stuck their necks out a \nmile, a political mile to cast this vote, I thank you from the bottom \nof my heart, and these DREAM Act kids thank you too. The American dream \nwill be there some day, and we will keep working until it happens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week marked the 5-year anniversary \nof President Bush's signing the Congressional resolution that \nauthorized him to use military force in Iraq. That resolution has \nproved to be a disaster for our country, opening the door to a war that \nhas undermined our top national security priority, the fight against \nal-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  More than 5 years after the authorization of war, America is mired in \na conflict that continues to have no end in sight. Nearly 4,000 of our \nsoldiers have died and more than 27,000 have been wounded. Hundreds of \nthousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed, if not more, and at \nleast 4.5 million have been displaced from their homes. The region is \nmore unstable, and our credibility throughout the international \ncommunity has been significantly damaged.\n  We have spent over a half trillion dollars and stretched our military \nto the breaking point. Who knows how many more billions will be spent \nand how many brave Americans will die while the President pursues a \nmilitary solution to problems that can only be solved by a political \nsettlement in Iraq.\n  At the same time, al-Qaida has reconstituted itself along the \nAfghanistan-Pakistan border region and has developed new affiliates \naround the globe. Al-Qaida has been strengthened, not weakened, since \nwe authorized military action against, and then want to war in, Iraq.\n  Indeed, this senseless war has made us more vulnerable, not more \nsecure. Yet it continues endlessly with only a small token drawdown of \nforces expected in the coming months, and no timeline from this \nadministration as to when more troops will come home.\n  The American people know this war does not make sense. They expect us \nto do everything in our power to end it. Now that does not mean \nneglecting domestic priorities, and there are plenty of those to \naddress, but it does mean we cannot, in good conscience, simply put \nIraq on the back burner. We cannot simply tell ourselves and our \nconstituents we have done everything we could. Finding the votes to end \nthis war is not an easy task, but for the sake of the country, we must \nkeep trying. I, for one, am not prepared to say, in late October, with \nweeks to go before we adjourn for the year, that Iraq can wait until we \ncome back in 2008. Believe me, the administration and its supporters \nwould like nothing better than to change the subject from Iraq. Every \ntime we insist on debates and votes on Iraq, they complain loudly that \nwe are taking time away from the country's true priorities. But as we \nwere reminded last November, however, ending the disastrous Iraq war is \none of the American people's top priorities. It may well be their top \npriority, and we owe it to them to make it our top priority as well.\n  While the administration continues to refuse to acknowledge that we \nhave severely strayed off course, the war drags on and on, and more \nbrave American soldiers are being wounded or killed. But it is not only \nthe President and his administration that is at fault; many of my \ncolleagues here in Congress have expressed concerns about the war but \nrefuse to take real action to end it. They have prevented Congress from \nacting to secure our country and restore our global leadership.\n  I will not stand idly by while this mistaken war continues. I will \ncontinue working to end this war and bring our troops home. I will \ncontinue looking in the days and weeks ahead for opportunities to \ndebate and vote on ending the war, this year, and, if necessary, next \nas well.\n  My colleagues may complain, they may be inconvenienced, they may \nprefer to focus on other matters. But this Congress has no greater \npriority than making right the mistake it made more than 5 years ago \nwhen it authorized this misguided war.\n  I do not want to have to come to the floor again in a year to mark \nanother anniversary of the war's authorization, and to again implore my \ncolleagues to act. I do not want the American people to lose faith in \ntheir elected leaders for pursuing a war they rightly oppose. I do not \nwant more American troops to be killed for a war that does not serve \nour national security interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this country is headed toward a total \nmeltdown on taxes. I am going to spend a few minutes this afternoon to \ntalk about how that can be cooled off for a bit.\n  Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Paulson warned that unless the Congress \nacts within the next month on the alternative minimum tax, up to 50 \nmillion households, more than a third of all taxpayers, could be \nclobbered with new taxes. Congress has known for some time that unless \nthe alternative minimum tax is addressed, 23 million taxpayers would be \nhit with the double whammy of having to calculate their taxes twice, \nand typically pay a higher tax bill.\n  First, they are going to have to do their taxes using the regular \n1040 form; then they will have to calculate their taxes using the \nalternative minimum tax, which has a completely different and more \ncomplex set of forms.\n  Having to do your taxes once is bad enough. On average, that takes \nsomething like 15 to 30 hours, depending on whether a taxpayer is \nitemizing. But having to do your taxes is simply bureaucratic water \ntorture.\n  Yesterday's announcement by Treasury Secretary Paulson revealed that \ntwice as many taxpayers as previously estimated could be put in \nbureaucratic limbo by the alternative minimum tax and face delays in \nprocessing their returns and getting a tax refund. The problem is going \nto get worse and worse each year, as more and more taxpaying Americans \nare dragged into the alternative minimum tax parallel universe of tax \nrules, because the tax law is now stuck in a time warp.\n  It was never indexed for inflation. If Congress does not act, an \nestimated 30 million taxpaying Americans are going to be hit by the \nalternative minimum tax double whammy in 2010.\n\n[[Page S13316]]\n\n  The Congress has not been able to get ahead of the problem. It is \nsimply, at this point, trying to keep the problem from getting worse. \nEach year, the cost of even the so-called temporary patch to keep the \nAMT from clobbering more persons goes up. This year it will cost $55 \nbillion to preserve the status quo. The next year the cost will go to \n$80 billion. Over 10 years the cost is an astounding $870 billion.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve, is trying to find a \nway to pay for a 1-year fix. Senators are working in good faith in a \nbipartisan fashion, but there is not a huge pot of money out there to \npay for a $55 billion patch for the alternative minimum tax.\n  I will be working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to look at \nevery conceivable possibility to come up with the money for 1 year of \nalternative minimum tax relief. But certainly the Congress ought to \nstart, and start now, to find a clear path out of the budgetary haze. I \nthink that path and all roads that the Congress ought to be looking at \nshould lead to comprehensive tax reform in our country.\n  This week the House Ways and Means chairman plans to unveil his \nproposal that would repeal the alternative minimum tax as part of a \nlarger tax reform effort. Over the summer, Treasury Secretary Paulson \ncalled for corporate tax reform.\n  Ways and Means Chairman Rangel has indicated he is going to look at \nthe issue of corporate reform as part of broader legislation he wants \nto consider. But I think there is an opportunity now, if the \nadministration would engage the Congress on tax reform, and there is a \nmodel. The model is one where a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, \nworked with the Democratic Congress to achieve historic reform in 1986. \nIt was based on a simple set of principles. Those principles were: It \nought to be possible for everybody in our country to get ahead. It \nought to be possible for people who work for a wage and people who make \nmoney through investments to get ahead.\n  It was a system that kept progressivity so that there was a sense of \nfairness for all Americans. It was a system based on cleaning out a lot \nof unnecessary tax breaks, clutter in the Tax Code, in order to finance \nreform.\n  That is what I have proposed to do in legislation that I call the \nFair Flat Tax Act. I believe there are real opportunities for \nbipartisan reform, starting with the issue of tax simplification. In \nour Fair Flat Tax Act we have a 1-page 1040 form, something like 30 \nlines long.\n\n  President Bush had a tax reform commission that looked at reform. \nTheir simplification process involved a form that was something like 34 \nlines long. For purposes of Government work, that is about the same \nthing. We could get a bipartisan agreement on tax simplification, if \nthe President engaged the Congress fairly quickly. Certainly, the other \nissues will take a great deal more thought and involve more complexity, \nbut I have been asking witnesses who come before the Finance Committee \ntheir views about tax reform. These are experts who come from across \nthe political spectrum. They share widely differing views. But of the \nwitnesses who came to the Finance Committee, 19 out of 20 witnesses \nagree with my fundamental premise that the model of 1986, holding down \nrates for everybody, keeping progressivity and financing it by getting \nrid of loopholes and breaks, those witnesses all said the 1986 model, \nput together by the late President Reagan and Democrats in Congress, is \nstill a model that makes sense for today.\n  One of the witnesses even said:\n\n       Baseball fans remember the moment when Babe Ruth pointed at \n     the stands and hit a home run, and tax geeks remember the \n     1986 Act with similar relish.\n\n  Like the 1986 act, I start with simplification, as I have outlined. \nThen I look to make the Tax Code flatter to make sure that instead of \nsix individual brackets, we would have perhaps three. I start with the \nrates Ronald Reagan started with, but I am not wedded to those \nparticular rates. Ronald Reagan and Bill Bradley and others in 1986 \nlooked at something in the vicinity of 15 and 28 percent. The point is, \nif Members of this body, working with the President on a bipartisan \nbasis, want to get into this, it would be possible to look at \ncomprehensive tax reform now. The alternatives, as the Senate sees how \ndifficult it is to fix the alternative minimum tax and deal with \nvarious proposals as it relates to investment and hedge funds, strike \nme as nowhere near as appealing as dealing with comprehensive tax \nreform.\n  Many have raised the question of the issue of the differential \ntreatment between work and wealth. It is a fact that the cop walking \nthe beat today who makes their money on wages pays taxes at a \nsignificantly higher rate than somebody who makes their money from \ninvestments. That is a fact that ought to trouble all Americans. What \nwe ought to be trying to do is not pit those two against each other but \nlook at an approach such as the one pursued in 1986 so that all \nAmericans have a chance to get ahead. That is what we are about as a \nnation, not pitting one group of people against another. We want people \nwho work for a wage to have a chance to get ahead as well as pay for \nnecessities for their families. We all understand how important \ninvestment is at a time when we face great economic challenges \nglobally. The fair flat tax of 2007 seeks to try to ensure that all \nAmericans would have an opportunity to get ahead and provides real \nrelief to the middle class through fewer exclusions, exemptions, \ndeductions, deferrals, credits, and special rates for certain \nbusinesses and activities and through the setting of one single flat \ncorporate rate.\n  On the individual side, the fair flat tax ends favoritism for \nitemizers while approving deductions across the board. The standard \ndeduction would be tripled for standard filers from $5,000 to $15,000 \nand raised from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples. As a result, \nthe vast majority of Americans would be better off claiming the \nstandard deduction than having to itemize their deductions, so filing \nwill be simplified for all Americans. We also keep the deductions most \nused by middle-class families, as Ronald Reagan and Bill Bradley and \nothers who worked so hard in 1986 did. We protect the home mortgage \ninterest break, the one for charitable contributions, and the credits \nfor children, education, and earned income. But nobody would have to \ncalculate their taxes twice under the Fair Flat Tax Act.\n  The alternative minimum tax would be eliminated. This is particularly \nimportant right now as citizens look at the challenges they are going \nto face next year.\n  What makes the Fair Flat Tax Act unique is it also corrects one of \nthe most glaring inequities in the current tax system; that is, \nregressive State and local taxes. Under current law, low and middle-\nincome taxpayers get hit with a double whammy once again. Compared to \nthose who are more fortunate, they pay more of their income in State \nand local taxes. Poor families pay more than 11 percent, and middle-\nincome families pay about 10 percent of their income in State and local \ntaxes, while more fortunate individuals pay only about half. Because \nmany low- and middle-income taxpayers don't itemize, they get no credit \non their Federal forms for paying State and local taxes. In fact, two-\nthirds of the Federal deduction for State and local taxes goes to those \nwith substantial incomes. Under the Fair Flat Tax Act, for the first \ntime the Federal code would look at the individual's entire tax \npicture, their combined Federal, State, and local tax burden, and give \ncredit to low and middle-income individuals to correct for regressive \nState and local taxes.\n  What this all means--and we had Jane Gravelle and her excellent team \nat the Congressional Research Service work on these numbers--is that \nthe typical middle-class family with wage and salary income up to \napproximately $150,000 a year would see tax relief in a way that would \nnot cause the Federal Government to lose revenue.\n  Finally, by simplifying the code, there are other benefits. With a \nsimpler system, it would be harder for individuals to take advantage of \nthe system and easier for the Internal Revenue Service to catch those \nwho do cheat. At present, there is a tax gap between taxes owed and \ncollected of over $300 billion per year. Chairman Baucus and Senator \nGrassley have done yeoman's work on this issue. I believe the Fair Flat \nTax Act can make, in addition, a significant dent in dealing with the \ntax gap, raising a significant amount of revenue from a source that \nwould not\n\n[[Page S13317]]\n\nincrease taxes. The Fair Flat Tax Act, as it relates to the tax gap \nissue, is a win for all Americans except for those who have been \ncheating the system.\n  I am obviously aware that the clock is ticking down on this session \nof Congress. Certainly, by early next year, in the thick of a \nPresidential election, something such as this is daunting. But it is \ntime for Congress to get started now on what witness after witness \nafter witness in the Finance Committee is saying; that is, the urgent \nneed, after scores of tax changes, to get about draining the swamp.\n  To give you an idea of what the numbers are with respect to tax \nchanges, the latest analysis shows we have had something akin to 15,000 \ntax changes. That comes to three for every working day. Even regional \nIRS offices, according to practitioners I talk to, cannot agree among \nthemselves as to how to apply this increasingly complicated Tax Code.\n  It is time to get started. The Bush tax cuts expire in 2010. \nCertainly, that is going to cause additional confusion and chaos for \ntaxpayers. With the problems the Congress is wrestling with now, such \nas the immediate crunch of the alternative minimum tax and with the \nhammer poised to come down in 2010 with all the other expiring tax \nlaws, there is a strong incentive for members of both political parties \nto come to the table and get to work on tax reform.\n  I hope colleagues will look at the Fair Flat Tax Act as a way to \nstart the debate. I don't consider it the last word on this \nextraordinarily important subject, but I hope we can begin the debate \nnow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, while we are in this morning business period \nand in anticipation of going to the next legislation, I wish to make \nsome opening comments about what happened here and make a plea to my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, but particularly my own side of \nthe aisle, that we not object to going to consideration of Amtrak \nlegislation.\n  I have been working on this issue for several years now. I think it \nis an important issue. It is an important part of our transportation \nsystem in America. I believe that for the future development of our \ncountry, for the mobility of our country, for the creation of jobs, the \nmaintaining of jobs, for safety, security, and access, we should pay \nattention to infrastructure in America, and lanes, planes, trains, \nports, and harbors. This is critical to our future economic development \nand to our American lifestyle.\n  I have been working for years to upgrade and improve the Federal \nAviation Administration, the air traffic control system so we can have \nless congestion in the airways and fewer delays, and modernization. We \nare still working on that. We did get FAA reauthorization a few years \nago. Now it is back up but, unfortunately, stalled right now. We did \npass a highway bill a few years ago that had many good things in it. \nBut here is my point: You can only build so many lanes until you can't \nbuild any more. You can only have so many planes in the sky until you \ncan't have any more. So what is the other alternative? Trains.\n  Now, I am not from a State that is hugely dependent on the rail \npassenger system. We get some of the benefits of it. But part of the \nproblem is we don't have enough access, enough opportunities in that \narea, or we have delays and problems such as that. Why do we have \ndelays? Because we haven't modernized the Amtrak system. Because we \nhave not worked through the Transportation Department to put in some \nreforms, decide what is needed in terms of money, and how to get more \ncapitalization. We haven't done the reforms.\n  I was pleased to be involved the last time we did some Amtrak \nlegislation. That was several years ago. I stood right in this very \nspot and told my friend John McCain from Arizona if it didn't work and \nif Amtrak didn't do a better job, I would eat it without salt. Well, I \nguess I should have probably eaten it without salt later on. It didn't \ndo everything I hoped it would. But what is the alternative? Do we want \na national rail passenger system or not? I think we do. I don't mean \nonly on the Northeast corridor, although I love the Northeast corridor. \nI have been delighted to work with my friend and colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, on this legislation, because I want good \nAmtrak service between Washington and New York City. Frankly, I would \nrather ride the Acela to New York City than the shuttle, the airline \nshuttle. You go to the airport; you wait; you are delayed. You get on \nthe train. You ride the Acela. You do your computer. You are not \ncrowded. It is nice, clean. It works. You can get a little something to \neat, and you arrive in New York City.\n  I realize Acela is one of the best in the country, but we need to do \nmore. In fact, putting money in it--and by the way, not enough--year \nafter year we are starving it to death and then we are saying, Why \ndidn't it do better? It is because we haven't given them more \nopportunities, we haven't had more requirements, we haven't had \nreforms. I tried for the past 2 years to get this legislation up. We \nhad some objections. We had some Senators who wanted to offer \namendments. My attitude is: Fine. If you have amendments, let's go with \nthem. Administration: If you have some reforms, fine, let's do it. But \nwe need to get this thing done.\n  Now here we are, we have a different majority. Senator Lautenberg is \nthe chairman of the committee. But basically, this is the bill he and I \nput together 3 years ago. It is time to do it. It is not perfect. It \nhas some reforms in it. It has some requirements in it. By the way, \nmore people are riding Amtrak, and they have more income. They are \ndoing better. If we give them more incentives, if we get them to close \nsome of the routes that are never going to be profitable, they are not \ngoing to work, it would be even better than that.\n  I am not going to give my full opening speech now, even though I \nsound like it. I am saying to my colleagues, we should not object to \nthe motion to proceed on every bill, and filibuster the motion to \nproceed. That is bad business. Do it judiciously? Yes. If you want to \nslow this place down time after time after time after time, yes, we can \ndo that. But I stood here on the floor earlier today and last night and \nsaid: If the Senate will do the right thing on this judicial \nnomination, Leslie Southwick, that will be a step forward to show that \nthis place can work together. We can be civil. We can be less partisan, \nand there will be some benefits. I am standing right here right now \nsaying this is the next step. Let's not tangle this bill up because we \nare not ready, or because we may not like it. You don't like it? Vote \nagainst it. You want more? Bring your amendments. Let's get this done. \nI hope my colleagues will not try to block the motion to proceed. \nSenator Reid is going to ask unanimous consent that we go to the bill, \nand I hope and pray that if it is objected to, he is going to file \ncloture and he is going to make us eat it, because we ought to take \nthis up and deal with it. If we want to kill it, shoot it down, but \ndoing nothing is unacceptable.\n\n  The Senate has become very proficient at doing nothing; not just this \nyear, but last year and the year before. We paid a price, because we \ndidn't get anything done in the previous 2 years. Are we going to do it \nagain or can we do something for the American people? This is one way \nwe can do it.\n  So I make that plea and I hope we can get something worked out when \nwe get on this bill. I will not be a party to try to ram it through so \nquickly people can't get their amendments ready.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to my distinguished colleague and \nleader on this effort now, and to my friend from New Jersey, and I look \nforward to working with him on this legislation.\n\n[[Page S13318]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the obvious obstinacy at getting this \non the floor seems to ignore the fact that you almost can't get \nanyplace from here or there without enormous delays, without enormous \ncongestion, and with pollution problems, et cetera. Is it understood, I \nask the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, how difficult it is for \nthe country right now? You can't get an airplane that will leave on \ntime or arrive on time with any degree of certainty. I, for instance, \ntravel from here up to Newark or to LaGuardia Airport, both of which \nare convenient to my home in New Jersey, and a flight that takes 36 \nminutes of air time takes 2\\1/2\\ hours to get there, more often than \nnot.\n  So do the Senator's friends understand that this is a crisis moment \nfor this country of ours? We have seen incidents so many times where \nthe absence of a rail system--for instance, we threw away billions of \ndollars some years ago because nuclear powerplants that were built, \nready to operate, couldn't get a license to go because there weren't \nsatisfactory evacuation routes and it had to be by rail because the \nhighways were unable to provide for it.\n  If we look at Katrina and we see how much better we could have done \nif rail was sufficiently employed down there, and we didn't get it, and \npeople were jammed and stuck in there.\n  There is no difference in what--when you cross the aisle, when you \nask the question: Do we want to get things operating better? Do we want \nto facilitate our corporations to operate efficiently? Do we want to \nprovide the jobs that go along when you have facilities for travel in \nplace? Would people do better if they could travel by rail rather than \nhave to get in a car and pay who knows what for gasoline? It is \npredicted that oil is going to go up to $200 a barrel one of these \ndays. Well, Heaven forbid that does come. We are not going to close \nshop and say we will go home and rest.\n  Do the Senator's colleagues recognize that those who don't want to \nlet us get this train of theirs started, do they realize that these \nproblems are in front of us, I ask?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey, I am sorry I went ahead and spoke first, because you are \nchairman of the committee and you have been providing real leadership \nin trying to get this legislation brought up. I did it because I wanted \nto make a plea to my colleagues on this side of the aisle to let this \nmove forward. Let me emphasize that I have no indication there will be \nobjection. They want to take a look at it. They want to make sure they \nwill have a chance to offer amendments or substitutes. I have assured \nthem we will work with them. I believe we are going to be able to clear \nthe hurdles, but I wanted to make a public plea so we could get on this \nlegislation and guarantee the Members that their amendments will be \nconsidered and, in fact, in the past, when we worked together, we have \naccepted amendments and fought some of them, and we had votes. It is a \nnovel idea in the Senate, to have a debate and have a vote.\n  But I want to say again I have enjoyed working with Senator \nLautenberg. This is a lot bigger issue in New Jersey and along the \neastern seaboard, I guess, but more and more it is important on the \nwest coast, it is important to the Chicago area, it is important all \nover America. This is not about one region or the other region, or \ntrying to accommodate business or labor; this is about American people. \nSo I think my colleagues, hopefully, are going to realize that we ought \nto do something about Amtrak, and this is the way to get it done.\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to respond to what my friend \nfrom Mississippi has said. We have worked together in the past and we \nhave gotten things done in the past. We know that Amtrak finally has \ncome into its place. We have a lot of work yet to do when you think \nabout what travel is like these days in all forms. The highways are too \ncongested. The airways are getting even more congested. The expectation \nis that delays are going to become even longer. So I hope those who \nwant to discuss it and those who want to amend it--the Senator is \nright, we should consider amendments. As a matter of fact, I think it \nis good if we do hear from people and see what problems they foresee. \nBut we can't get it done unless we talk about it, unless we prepare for \na vote.\n  Are we about to say to the American people: No, continue to suffer? \nStay stuck in traffic? Stay stuck at the airports? Time will take care \nof it? All you have to do is spend more time away from home, away from \nyour job and away from things you might enjoy.\n  American people, get used to spending more time away from home in \nuseless activities, such as listening to an idling engine or listening \nto the car radio or something like that. We cannot function this way.\n  Now the time is upon us where we have to do something about this. I \nbelieve this is an opportune time. I know a lot of colleagues on that \nside of the aisle want to see this happen. After all, we touch 40 \nStates across the country. Wherever you look and see where there has \nbeen new or upgraded rail service, people are responding to it: On the \nwest coast, and some of the routes out of Chicago--people are \nresponding to it, and they are getting on trains.\n  I use the trains frequently. The other day I got on an Amtrak train \nhere, and it was a full train with barely a seat left. So people are \ndemanding it. If we look at the example that exists, let's say in \nEurope or in Japan, and see what happens. When I wanted to take a plane \none time from Brussels, where a NATO meeting was ongoing, to go to \nParis, I tried to get a flight. They said: You cannot get an airplane \nfrom here because we go by train--200 miles in 1 hour and 20 minutes. \nImagine what it would do for travel in this country and business \nprogress.\n  So I am ready whenever my colleague and our friends on that side of \nthe aisle are ready. I am told we are all set here and ready to go.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, since I have worked with the \nSenator on this issue, some of my colleagues have taken to calling me \nSenator ``Lott-enberg.'' I know there is a bit of a regional \ndifference. It is not quite as crowded in our neck of the woods, so you \nmight come on down South and it would be a lot less crowded. However, I \nwould like for them to be able to get there on Amtrak, to be able to \ncatch that train in Washington or in Newark and run on down and come \nthrough Atlanta down to Jackson, MS. I think they would enjoy it once \nthey got there. I invite the Senator from New Jersey to take the ride \nto Jackson, and we will show him around down there.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In response, A, I would like to do it; and, B, I \nwonder if people realize how many new lines are being dreamt up--I say \n``dreamt'' up because unless we get the base going, nothing else is \ngoing to happen.\n  I hear from colleagues in other States besides mine who say, you \nknow, we could use train service here or there. We have seen something \nin New Jersey that exemplifies the value of rail service. We had a line \nopen from the southernmost tip of our State to Trenton, our State \ncapital. The ridership, at first, was very low. Before you knew it, we \nbegan to see buildings, factories, warehouses, et cetera, being built \nalong the transit way. And now the area is beginning to prosper where \nit was just dead and nothing was going on. That is what we have seen.\n  There is a lot of talk about something called transit villages. In \nNew Jersey, the most crowded State in the country, we don't think about \nvillages really, but we have transit villages centered around a rail \nhub. People know they can get back and forth, and companies know \nemployees can get back and forth to work and they can run an efficient \noperation.\n  So this is a point in time when opportunity presents itself, and we \nought not to miss it. If we cannot see it, we ought to let the public \nsee that. Certainly, at this point in time, we ought to be able to \ndiscuss it. We should not have any obstruction to bringing the issue to \nthe floor of the Senate. Let's get out in this public forum and have a \ndiscussion and see what we can do or whether there are problems that \ncan be dealt with or maybe we can go to some other kinds of travel--I \ndon't know what kind, but we at least ought to take the one nearest to \nus that is the best option.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are working on when we are going to be\n\n[[Page S13319]]\n\nable to get this up. I have a couple of points. One, we have a catch-\n22. Our Members want to make sure they have a chance to offer \namendments, and we want to do that. At the same time, our leadership on \nboth sides has to pay attention to when and how we get it to a \nconclusion. I think it is incumbent upon our leadership from the \ncommittee to work with Members to get amendments but also not to let \nthis become a punching bag and have Members throwing everything out but \nthe kitchen sink.\n  I believe we can move this through in a reasonable time. My attitude \nis, when Senators have amendments, come over and offer them. We will \ndebate them and then have a vote. We will not shove it over until 9 or \n10 o'clock tomorrow night. I think there is hesitation on both sides of \nthe aisle, and we have to work through that. But we have done this \nbefore. We did this bill 2 years ago, or so, and we got 90-something \nvotes. So we can do that.\n  Mr. President, one other observation: As I have worked on this, \nanother part of the equation of having a good national rail passage \nsystem is encouraging our States to be able to do more on their own and \nbuild lines like we have in San Francisco to the L.A. area--there is \nincentive to do more--and at the same time, not telling poorer States \nthat they have to do way more than they are capable of doing.\n  Also, a couple of weeks ago, I thought about this bill. I was at Big \nD's Barbeque at Pocahontas, MS. The City of New Orleans, a sleeper \nAmtrak train, came whizzing by Big D's Tee Pee. They were ballin' the \njack headed to New Orleans. It had about six or eight cars, which \nis relatively short. But the important thing was that they were going \nlickity-split.\n\n  If we are going to be able to get these trains, in a reasonable way, \nwhere they want to go, part of the problem is a problem the freight \nlines have. If they are going to get off on a side track and let the \nAmtrak go through, they have to build side tracks. We need more lines \nall across America. Union Pacific, Burlington Northern, Santa Fe--they \nneed to build more lines across this country. We need to encourage the \nfreight lines to build more capacity, more lines, and more side tracks, \nso they can work with Amtrak, so that Amtrak is not adding to the cost \nof doing business of the freight lines. So I am looking at that \nequation too. We don't want a conflict between Amtrak and freight \nlines. We want them both to be able to make a profit and deliver the \ngoods and services to the American people.\n  So we are working on that side of the equation too, to make sure that \nAmtrak has a way to be on time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Mississippi remembers that yesterday \nwe had a hearing on freight railroads, and that traffic is going to be \nup some 44 percent by 2020. They are concerned about how to get it \ndone. At the same time, we have to provide for passenger rail service. \nThis is a good time for all sides to get together and start moving.\n  Does the Senator remember this bill was processed on the Senate floor \nlast year? We had a vote that was 93 to 6. I lost a year. It was \nactually in 2005.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I think that is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The vote was 93 to 6, I remind everybody. This was \npopularly supported, totally understood. We were on our way to the next \nstation, and it just didn't work out. Things were a little tumultuous, \nto put it mildly. Now there is a cooler moment to think about it and \npresent it. We have time available on the floor, and I think to waste \nit would be a terrible loss when we can discuss this important problem \nwith a solution for the country.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. The occupant of the \nchair, the Senator from Maryland, I suspect, supports this too. I am \nready to do business when we get the go-ahead to take up this \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: Is the Senate \nin morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, with 10-\nminute grants.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wish to speak for a period of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13319-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13319-S13321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, in the last couple of hours, the \nPresident took the opportunity to speak at the State Department on the \ncondition of relations between the United States and Cuba. For me, as \nan immigrant from Cuba, born on that island and an immigrant to this \ncountry, it was a very moving and transcending kind of moment. The \nPresident, for the first time, I think, in many years that any American \nPresident might do this, detailed the problems in Cuba and the cruelty \nof that regime toward its own people.\n  The President put a human face on the suffering of the Cuban people \nby inviting to the stage with him three families of Cuban political \nprisoners. These families, each with their own tale of hardship and \nsuffering, were representatives of what I think is the now almost half \ncentury long suffering of the Cuban people. He spoke about their \nplight, the unjust nature of their relatives' incarceration, which is \nnothing more than a representative sampling of what the Cuban people \nhave suffered over so many years of brutal repression.\n  He also detailed the many failed promises of the Cuban revolution \ntoward its own people. He spoke of the failed promises; that the \nrevolution would bring a better life and so many other things that have \nsimply not occurred. He detailed frankly, the economic misery the Cuban \npeople suffer from today, the fact that housing is deplorable and \ndifficult and that many families have to, obviously, live together. He \nspoke about the irony that while the Cuban system touts the greatness \nof their medical prowess; in fact the Cuban people do not have access \nto the kind of quality medical care that medical tourists can obtain.\n  Just as an anecdote, sitting next to me was a foreign diplomat who \nmentioned to me that she had been to Cuba for eye surgery some years \nearlier. I mentioned to her that at about that same time--I think she \nsaid that was in 1992--I had a relative, an uncle of mine, whom we had \nbrought to this country so he could have eye surgery here because he \ncouldn't get it in Cuba. So foreign visitors, for dollar amounts, can \nget first-rate medical care in Cuba, but it is not always available to \nthe Cuban people.\n  He spoke about the oppression of those who seek to be a voice for \nchange and the fact that many of those in prison, these patriots, are \nin prison for nothing more than having a fax machine in their home or a \nwillingness to speak and talk about the human rights conditions on the \nisland. The fact is that each of these brave souls takes great risk in \norder to facilitate the opportunity for Cubans to speak to one another, \nfor the opportunity to speak in freedom, the opportunity to freely \nexpress an idea. These are things which are abhorrent to the Cuban \nregime.\n  The President made an offer. He made an offer that the United States, \nthrough non-governmental organizations and religious entities, would \nsend computers and provide Internet access to the Cuban people, if only \nthe Cuban Government would allow the average, everyday Cuban--what \ntoday is part of international trade, commerce, and communications--\nInternet access. Internet access in Cuba today is only allowed under \nthe strictest of Government authority, and it is a way in which the \nCuban people are held back from achieving the promise that the 21st \ncentury has for so many people, in so many other places.\n  He also spoke about the opportunity for Cuban children to be a part \nof a scholarship program and all they would have to do is to be freely \nallowed to participate.\n  He spoke to the international community using the example of the \nCzech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, which have, with such \ndetermination, stood clearly on the side of freedom, stood clearly on \nthe side of those in Cuba\n\n[[Page S13320]]\n\nwho are not satisfied with the current conditions but look to the \nmoment of their liberty, look to the moment of freedom. These new \ndemocracies in Europe, who still well remember the days of their \noppression at the hands of another Communist dictator, are very much \ninvolved in helping the Cuban dissident movement, in allowing them to \ncome to their embassies and just stand in their lobbies and have access \nto a magazine or a newspaper or a book that would otherwise not be \npermitted by the Cuban authorities.\n  We can all do more. The United States has been at the forefront of \nassistance to a free Cuba, but no doubt many other countries, many \nother capitals across the world could well heed the example these \nEastern European governments are today giving to the rest of the world \nas they stand clearly on the side of freedom.\n  The fact is that the most important take-away, if you will, that I \nheard today in this very moving, emotional, and I thought historic \nspeech was the fact that the President today said that in the future of \nCuba, we should be clearly on the side of freedom and not on the side \nof stability.\n  You see, the Cuban people are in the throes of change. Change is \nhappening on that imprisoned island today, and that change can take one \nof several forms. One of them would be for us to side with stability \nand more of the same, for the sake of stability. The other would be to \nchart that uncertain path that freedom often brings but a path that \nultimately leads to the opportunity for free people to live freely, \nthat opportunity to simply stand in a town square and speak your mind.\n\n  So often people ask me: Have you ever been back to Cuba?\n  And I say: No.\n  They ask: Will you ever go back?\n  And I say: Yes, I will go back the day I can stand in the park of my \nlittle town where I grew up, in Sagua La Grande, Cuba, and stand there \nand freely express my thoughts or the day I can pick up a book and read \nit freely.\n  Those are the times and those are the conditions under which the \nCuban people will really begin to taste freedom.\n  All of Latin America today in one measure or another is moving to the \nmarch of democratic governments and clearly enjoying the fruits of a \nfree market. The free-trade agreements currently pending with Latin \nAmerican countries will only continue to expand the wave of prosperity \nthat is today sweeping that continent. But one example remains, one \nexample of absolute tyranny, one example of an old-fashioned, brutal \nmilitary dictator, and that is Cuba.\n  The fact is, I do believe freedom is on the march and that freedom \ncan come to the Cuban people. I hope we can continue to encourage the \nvoices of freedom within the island.\n  The President spoke to the military, he spoke to the governmental \nstructures of the Cuban Government, and he pleaded with them to side \nwith the people of Cuba who seek to live free and not use the elements \nof repression at a critical and decisive moment in the future of Cuba.\n  I have no doubt that many of those who today might have been, at one \ntime, supporters of the Cuban regime, who believed in the promises of \nthe revolution, as at one time or another all of us did, that they \nwould now understand that this failed system has a limited lifespan and \nthat it is time to side with the forces of freedom and not with the \nforces of repression and tyranny. For those who have no blood on their \nhands, they do have a future in a free Cuba.\n  One of the more touching moments today was when the President \ndiscussed dissidents, such as Oscar Elias Biscet. Oscar Elias Biscet is \na physician who has been sentenced, to I believe 20 years, for merely \nspeaking and expressing his own beliefs and his desire to see a change \nwithin Cuba. He is in deplorable conditions, in rat-infested \nconditions, needing medical care and getting none. He is the face of \nthe future of Cuba. He is the face of the dissidents in Cuba. He is a \nyoung man, born and raised under the Castro regime. He does not belong \nto any rich families of the past. In fact, he happens to be an Afro-\nCuban. He is a physician. He believes in life at all stages, from \nconception to death, and that was one of the big sins for which he has \nbeen punished in Cuba.\n  So I would say that today is an important day in the history of U.S. \nrelations with Cuba. I hope it will also be a historic marker for the \nfuture of the Cuban people. The President spoke about a popular song, \nboth in Cuba and outside, and it basically talks about ``our day is \ncoming.'' I don't think there is any doubt that the freedom of the \nCuban people is coming and that our day, without a doubt, is coming.\n  I look forward to continuing to help the dissident movement inside \nCuba in any way that we can, to continuing to help the voices of \nfreedom that so much yearn for an opportunity. I believe the President \nmade it clear that the standard by which we should judge our future \nrelations with Cuba is the way in which the Cuban Government treats its \nown people; by releasing political prisoners, by allowing freedom of \nexpression, by allowing freedom of the press, and by ending these \ndespicable acts of repression or repudiation, which are nothing more \nthan a government-organized gang of neighbors ganging up on someone \nwho, for whatever reason, seems to be out of step with the orthodoxy of \nthe Government of the day. These are horrible beatings and harassment \nthat cut across age groups. It is not just about the head of the \nhousehold who has expressed himself in a way the Government deems \nnegative or maybe being guilty of that ill-defined crime of \ndangerousness. But the children of that family suffer, the elderly, and \nall of the members of any family who is chosen for these repudiation \nacts. They all suffer. Those are despicable acts. Those have to end--\nthat kind of repression--and the freeing of political prisoners. These \nsimple things.\n  When people talk about what is going to be the future, the future is \nin the hands of the Cuban people. I know the United States will stand \nclearly on the side of freedom. That is, what makes our country so very \ndifferent and so very special, is the fact we do put freedom first; \nthat we do put a value on every human being, every human life, and the \ndignity of each one; that we do understand there is a difference \nbetween freedom and oppression and we choose to stand clearly on the \nside of freedom.\n  I will always be proud to stand with our President, who so clearly \nspoke today about his desire to stand on the side of freedom. I hope \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate will take the time to read the \nspeech the President gave today. If you care about Latin America, if \nyou care about Cuba, if you care about the future of that oppressed \nisland, I think this was a very good moment.\n  I see my dear colleague from New Jersey and fellow Cuban American \nhere on the Senate floor, and I know we share the same passion for the \nopportunity for Cuba to be free. This isn't a partisan issue between \nus; this is about the right of the Cuban people to live freely. I say \nto Senator Menendez that it was a momentous speech and I think one that \nwill be a historic marker, as I said, in the relations between our \ncountries and the opportunity for the Cuban people to live in freedom. \nI think it was an important moment, and I hope my colleague will have \nan opportunity to see it and read it. It was the kind of speech so many \nof us have wished for and were delighted to hear today.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come to the floor primarily to speak \nabout a vote we took earlier today on the DREAM Act. I do appreciate my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida's comments about the President's \nspeech. We look forward to getting a further focus on what the \nPresident had to say. We certainly appreciate any movement, any policy \nthat tries to create an opportunity for freedom for the people of Cuba, \nfor them to be able to achieve what we enjoy here in the United \nStates--the right to choose our Representatives, to worship at the \naltar that we chose freely, to be able to associate with others freely, \nto be able to protest when we believe our Government is moving in the \nwrong direction. We have freedom of the press, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech. All of those things are denied the Cuban people.\n\n[[Page S13321]]\n\n  Certainly, the efforts the President speaks about, trying to move in \nthe direction that creates that moment in which those freedoms can be \nfulfilled for the people of Cuba, we applaud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13321-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13321-S13322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about the \nearlier vote on the DREAM Act. I have heard some of my colleagues \ndefine it in ways that make me believe the future of any other form of \nimmigration reform is going to be incredibly difficult. We did not get \nto cloture and cannot move to have a full debate on the bill and a vote \nto move in a direction in which we could give young people in this \ncountry--who did not choose to come to this country themselves, as they \nwere brought here by their parents at a young age, and who in many \ncases could achieve great success for the Nation--an opportunity to \nearn their way to a process of legalization. To see that those hopes \nhave been snuffed out by the votes that were taken here leads me to \nbelieve the future of any other form of immigration reform is going to \nbe incredibly difficult.\n  It was not the decision of these children to come to the United \nStates. It's hard to make a decision about where you are moving to when \nyou are in a stroller. If we cannot give hope to children, if we are \ngoing to insist that the children be responsible for the sins of their \nparents, in making the decision they did to come in an undocumented \nfashion to the United States, then this is not the America I know.\n  If, by no choice of your own, you came to this country and have now \ngrown up--for many of those children I have met across the landscape of \nthe country have grown up as Americans, and thought of themselves as \nAmericans--and then came a point in time in which they wanted to go to \ncollege or enlist in the Armed Forces, they found their status was not \nthat of an American. They wanted badly to either serve or to be able to \nfulfill their God-given abilities by achieving a college education. \nThey had to earn all of this. All we need to do is give them a chance.\n  I have colleagues who represent a lot of sectors, and they want \npeople to come to this country and use their human capital to do some \nof the toughest jobs that exist in America, to bend their backs and be \non their knees picking crops for Americans to be able to consume.\n  There are some who suggest we are going to even change the nature of \nwhat AgJOBS is, so even though you come year after year, you bend your \nback, you give your sweat, you do some of the toughest jobs no one \nwants to do--we will not give you any pathway to earn legalization.\n  I don't know how those who want to see the AgJOBS bill move think it \ncan move when we turn down children who had no choice of their own. Our \nfriends in industries that request H1-B visas say we need to bring \npeople from other countries in the world to America because we don't \nhave enough human capital here to meet our Nation's high-tech demands, \nbut in that case it doesn't make much sense to refuse to take advantage \nof the proven capacity of so many children in this country, some of \nwhom have graduated as valedictorians and salutatorians from high \nschool. A vote against the DREAM Act says, we are not going to use that \nintellect; no, let's bring in somebody from outside the country to \nperform that service.\n  Those in the service industries, such as the hotels and motels of our \ncities and highways, who want people to clean the toilets and the \nbathrooms, or those who want workers to pluck the chickens at poultry \nplants or work at seafood establishments and the list goes on and on--\nlet's give those people visas to come to this country and let's use \ntheir human capital. I am for any American who wants to do any of those \njobs first and foremost. Whatever is necessary to create that \nopportunity, I am for. But in the absence of it, I wish to challenge \nsome of our colleagues who talk about the big growers and their needs, \nwho talk about the high-tech industry and their needs, who talk about \nthe hotels and motels and poultry plants and seafood plants--and then \nvote against these children. I want to hear how they can justify the \ndifferences.\n  What the DREAM Act said was if you had no choice, you made no choice \nin coming to this country--your parents brought you here, you grew up \nhere and you have been a good citizen, you have lived the type of life \nwe want all our young people to live in terms of being good citizens, \nbeing of exemplary character, being individuals who have the \nintellectual capacity on their own to get into college--we want to give \nthem the opportunity to have the status to do that. I would rather have \nour kids going to school than hanging out on the streets, but I guess \nwe would rather have them hanging out on the streets rather than having \nthem get an education and serving our Nation.\n  I don't understand how a military that is straining, in terms of the \nvolunteer Armed Forces that we have, that has now downgraded whom they \nare willing to accept in the Armed Forces to include people who have \ncriminal records and those who are high school dropouts, we will have \nthose people serve, but we will not have young people who are \nincredibly talented, have no criminal record whatsoever, exemplary \nindividuals, and some of them, some very smart ones, but who want to \nserve America because they believe themselves to be Americans--oh, no, \nlet's not have them serve in the Armed forces of the United States. By \nvirtue of that service, including the possibility that they could die \non behalf of their adopted country, no, let's not give them that \nopportunity either. We would rather take people who have criminal \nrecords. We would rather take people who have not even finished high \nschool.\n\n  The first U.S. soldier who died in Iraq was someone who was not a \nU.S. citizen. Yet he died in Iraq in the service of the country he \nloved as his own.\n  I believe there are going to be challenges going forward. As Members \nof the Senate who represent different parts of our economy come forth \nand say, ``I need to help the farmers because we need to get people in \nthose fields, we can't get anybody to do the job;'' or, ``I need to \nhave someone at that poultry plant and make sure that we are able to \npluck chickens and go through the bone-breaking job, their hands are \ncut from the processing,'' I want to see how, in fact, that discussion \nis going to take place.\n  We will certainly be here to challenge our colleagues to think about \nhow can you promote those desires and yet snuff out the hopes and \ndreams and aspirations of a young person who did not do anything wrong. \nOn the contrary, they want to do everything they can to serve this \ncountry, and we say no to them. Yet we will bring in people from other \nparts of the world to do these things. It is going to be very \ndifficult. It is going to be very difficult, without reform of the \nprocess, to make sure we are not outsourcing jobs in the process, \nwithout labor protections. I think it is all going to be very \ndifficult.\n  I hope our colleagues will think about reconsidering their position \non the DREAM Act because they say it is an ``amnesty.'' Everything is \namnesty to them. I can't wait until the AgJOBS bill comes up. I am sure \nwe will get cries of ``amnesty.'' I can't wait until the H-1B issue \ncomes up. I can't wait until the H-2B issue comes up. I am sure it will \nbe cries of ``amnesty.'' So those sectors of the American economy will \nbe halted, and we will not get the productivity we need because I am \nsure they are not going to find a way to say that it is not \n``amnesty.''\n  At end of the day, I am looking forward to those debates as we move \nforward. I believe we have set a precedent in today's vote that people \nwill rue as they try to understand the essence of some of the economic \nsectors of our country that are going to need help, have needed help, \nand need help today.\n  We should, hopefully, have a little introspection and figure out \nwhether a process in which you have a journey to go through, in which \nyou have to start with an exemplary record, in which you have to be \nwilling to meet all types of challenges, in which you must give of \nyourself to the Nation or you must be able to create personal \nachievement that ultimately will be of value to the Nation--whether \nsnuffing out that opportunity is in the national interests of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as my colleagues know, earlier this \nweek President Bush announced he will ask this Congress to provide an \nadditional $46 billion for the war in Iraq next year. That is $46 \nbillion more than the $150 billion he already told us he would ask for. \nTaken together, that is close to $200 billion more than the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars the taxpayers of this country have already poured \ninto the sands and marshes of Iraq--for a war this President has made \nclear he has no intention of ending.\n  The people of Rhode Island are tired of watching their sons and \ndaughters, their neighbors and their friends, sent off to war by a \nPresident who won't trouble himself to make a plan to bring them home. \nThey are tired of spending money our country has to borrow on a war \nwith burdens our country should no longer have to bear. And they are \nsick and tired of hearing this President veto or threaten to veto \nlegislation passed by this Congress that supports the real and urgent \nneeds of Americans and their families--all because he says it costs too \nmuch.\n  Clearly, this President is an expert when it comes to irresponsible \nand excessive spending. Look at the war. Look at the private \ncontractors. Look at the national debt he has run up. But how can he \nkeep a straight face and tell the American people it is more important \nto borrow and spend $35 billion for 3\\1/2\\ more months of the Iraq war \nthan it is to provide budgeted health insurance for 5 years to 10 \nmillion American children? What a sobering revelation of this \nadministration's misplaced priorities.\n  No American should doubt for 1 minute what is going on here. Every \ntime President Bush vetoes a bill to fund children's health care, every \ntime he threatens to veto legislation that will send our Nation's \nchildren to college, keep families warm during the winter months, \ninvest in job training and technical education programs, or offer the \npromise of medical cures through research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, President Bush is making a choice. He is choosing prolonging a \nwar in Iraq over battling cancer. He is choosing his no-plan war over \nhelping families in poverty. It is a choice, and it is the wrong \nchoice.\n  Last night, the Senate passed a bill to provide funding for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and other \nagencies. On October 17, the administration expressed its opposition to \nthis appropriations bill based on what it calls ``an irresponsible and \nexcessive level of spending.'' As I said, this President is certainly \nexpert at irresponsible and excessive levels of spending, but what does \nhe mean? The President means that $10.8 billion spent to help millions \nof Americans lead healthier, more productive lives is irresponsible and \nexcessive, but the nearly $200 billion additional he wants to borrow \nand spend on the war in Iraq is just fine.\n\n  Let's look at two areas in this bill where the funding levels we \npropose exceed those in the administration's budget to see just how \nirresponsible and excessive we are.\n  The first is at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at NIH. \nOur bill funds the institute at $67 million more than the President's \nrequest. I want to introduce my colleagues to one man who does not \nthink this increase is irresponsible and excessive.\n  This is a picture of Richard Pezzillo on his last visit to \nWashington, DC. Rich is a bright, kind, thoughtful young man from North \nProvidence, RI, who hopes one day to become a meteorologist. Rich also \nsuffers from hemophilia and right now lies in a hospital bed in Rhode \nIsland, too sick to attend his classes at Western Connecticut State \nUniversity where he hopes to graduate this May. Sadly, Rich, now 24, \nhas missed 2\\1/2\\ years of school due to his illness.\n  One of these absences was caused by an activity most of us would \nnever even think about--something we do, in fact, to save lives--\nputting on a seatbelt. Three years ago, Rich unfastened his seatbelt \nfrom the airplane, collected his things, and walked off into the \nairport and suddenly started to feel tremendous pain. He started \nvomiting blood. Simply wearing his seatbelt had caused Rich to bleed \ninternally, inside of his stomach, eventually requiring that his gall \nbladder be removed. Rich spent roughly 3 weeks in the hospital, \naccumulating bills totaling nearly $1.5 million. Luckily, Blue Cross-\nBlue Shield of Rhode Island, his family's insurer, covered most of \nthese costs. But Rich is desperately afraid what will happen to him \nwhen he graduates from college and no longer qualifies under his \nparents' health care plan. Hemophilia is one of the most expensive \nconditions a person can have, one that few insurance companies will \nwant to take on.\n  Richard Pezzillo is a fighter. He is an example for us all. But he \nwill continue to face tremendous difficulties with his health \nthroughout his life. Soon, thanks to research going on at the National \nInstitutes of Health; specifically at the National Heart, Lung, and \nBlood Institute, hemophilia could be the first disease cured by gene \ntherapy. The funding in this appropriations bill will go toward \nresearch which could save Richard's life and the lives of 18,000 people \nacross this country who suffer from hemophilia. This spending is not \nirresponsible. This spending is not excessive. This spending is vital \nand it is working and it has the potential to save thousands of people \nlike Rich Pezzillo.\n  A second place where this bill calls for spending above the \nPresident's budget--$128 million above his budget to be exact--is at \nthe National Cancer Institute. Here I want to share the story of \nBenjamin Haight. I met Ben's parents this summer when they came down to \nmy office from Warwick, RI, to share their little boy's story. Ben was \ndiagnosed with neuroblastoma early in 1999 when he was just 4\\1/2\\ \nyears old. At the time, Ben's dad was a senior chief in the Navy, \nserving aboard the USS Miami. He was airlifted off the submarine to \njoin his son, as Ben underwent five rounds of chemo, surgery, \nradiation, and endured two stem cell transplants. These treatments left \nBen with no high frequency hearing, requiring him to wear the two \nhearing aids, and they left him with a severely compromised immune \nsystem. But Ben refused to let any of this keep him from being a kid. \nHe told his doctors there would be no treatments during science class, \nand that they would have to be out by 3 to go to Cub Scouts or baseball \nor soccer or other activities. He often left his chemotherapy sessions \ndressed in his Little League uniform. Ben was a snorkler, a sailor, a \nswimmer, a fisherman, a climber, an artist, and an animal lover. He \nwas, as his parents say, a child first and a child with cancer second.\n  Though Ben and his family enjoyed 2 years of remission, he relapsed \nagain in October 2001 at the start of second grade. This new round of \ntreatment consisted of more chemo and over 200 blood and platelet \ntransfusions. Ben lost his battle with neuroblastoma on August 8, 2003, \nat the age of 9. The night before he died, Ben turned to his mom and \nasked: ``Can't we try a stronger medicine?''\n  Well, Ben, at the pediatric oncology branch of the National Cancer \nInstitute, they are trying to create that stronger medicine. Ten phase \nI and four phase II clinical trials are currently being conducted on \nneuroblastoma, and scientists are closer and closer every day to the \nstronger medicine you asked for.\n  Is it really so irresponsible and excessive to provide the funding \nfor these studies, to find the treatments that could have saved Ben \nHaight and could save so many more children like him?\n  To me, irresponsible and excessive is borrowing and spending $450 \nbillion for an endless war that undermines our national security and \nthen asking the Congress for another $196.4 billion without a plan to \nbring our troops home, all while nearly 50 million Americans go without \nhealth insurance and millions of families hover at the door of poverty.\n\n[[Page S13323]]\n\n  We should be clear that the nearly $200 billion this President has \nrequested for the war in Iraq, on top of the hundreds of billions he \nhas already spent, is not even the whole story. When this \nadministration tells us about the financial costs of this disastrous \nwar, they don't tell us about the interest payments we will have to \npay. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that interest on the war \nwill total $415 billion by 2017, and then there will be more interest \non the additional $200 billion the President wants us to borrow and \nspend. The final interest costs of this war could approach $1 trillion, \npassed on to our children and grandchildren.\n  President Bush, I think most Americans would argue with you. I think \nmost Americans would argue that $22 billion to keep our families \nhealthy is a pretty sound investment in our country's future, and \ntrillions of dollars in spending and hundreds of billions of dollars in \ninterest for a war you won't take action to end, that is what is \nirresponsible and excessive.\n  The President's threatened veto of this appropriations bill is just \nanother illustration of his extraordinarily misplaced priorities. The \n$67 million increase this bill calls for to fund the National Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute is a few hours of the cost of the war in \nIraq--not even a full day, not even half a day, a few hours. In fact, \nthe entire NIH budget in this bill is only $1 billion above the \nPresident's request. One billion dollars sounds like a lot of money, of \ncourse, but it is, in fact, only a few days of the war in Iraq--not a \nmonth, not a week, only a few days.\n\n  President Bush would rather prolong the war in Iraq than fund \nadditional research at the National Institutes of Health into pediatric \ncancer, into hemophilia, and into other diseases such as diabetes, \nheart disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's, and \nAlzheimer's. He would rather fund a continuous war than provide hope \nfor millions of families around this country.\n  Well, I hope President Bush will listen to Rich Pezzillo's story. I \nhope he will listen to Ben Haight's parents. I hope he will listen to \nthe thousands of Rhode Islanders who have reached out to me to demand a \nnew direction, not only in Iraq but here at home in America. I hope he \nwill listen to Americans across this country who think that people such \nas Rich and Ben should be our first priorities.\n  I am proud this bill puts people such as Rich and Ben ahead of the \nextreme rightwing ideologies and reckless wars this President pursues, \nand I hope we in Congress will stand our ground when, of all people, \nthis President charges that putting Rich and Ben first is irresponsible \nand excessive.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In making \n     its determination or carrying out such an investigation, the \n     Board shall obtain information from all parties involved and \n     identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to \n     improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the \n     train.\n       ``(2) Problems caused by host rail carrier.--If the Board \n     determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum \n     standards investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable \n     to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak \n     over freight transportation as required under subsection (c), \n     the Board may award damages against the host rail carrier, \n     including prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it \n     determines to be reasonable and appropriate pursuant to \n     paragraph (3) of this subsection.\n       ``(3) Damages and relief.--In awarding damages and \n     prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board \n     shall consider such factors as--\n       ``(A) the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial loss as \n     a result of host rail carrier delays or failure to achieve \n     minimum standards; and\n       ``(B) what reasonable measures would adequately deter \n     future actions which may reasonably be expected to be likely \n     to result in delays to Amtrak on the route involved.\n       ``(4) Use of damages.--The Board shall, as it deems \n     appropriate, remit the damages awarded under this subsection \n     to Amtrak or\n\n[[Page S13327]]\n\n     to an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger \n     rail service. Such damages shall be used for capital or \n     operating expenditures on the routes over which delays or \n     failures to achieve minimum standards were the result of a \n     rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over \n     freight transportation as determined in accordance with \n     paragraph (2).''.\n       (b) Change of Reference.--Section 24308 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Interstate Commerce Commission'' in \n     subsection (a)(2)(A) and inserting ``Surface Transportation \n     Board'';\n       (2) by striking ``Commission'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``Board'';\n       (3) by striking ``Secretary of Transportation'' in \n     subsection (c) and inserting ``Board''; and\n       (4) by striking ``Secretary'' the last 3 places it appears \n     in subsection (c) and each place it appears in subsections \n     (d) and (e) and inserting ``Board''.\n\n     SEC. 210.

I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi for allowing me to proceed.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the bill managers, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our bill has been sent to the desk, \nand I want to start off by saying that I am pleased, obviously, that \nthe Senate is considering S. 294, the Passenger Rail Investment and \nImprovement Act of 2007.\n  The first thing I want to do is to say thanks to my friend and chief \ncosponsor of the bill, Senator Trent Lott. We have worked together on \nmatters related to transportation in the past, and there is no question \nthat he understands the potential for passenger rail, and his long-\nstanding efforts to improve our country's transportation systems are \nwell known and deeply appreciated.\n  Like him, I believe this is a critical moment--with delays, \nunavailability of reliable planning for work, personal opportunity to \nspend time with kids and family or other activities of choice. Anyone \nwho spends any significant time on our roads does not need reminders \nthat highway congestion is a major problem. In almost every city and \ntown of any size throughout our country, it is experienced.\n  A recent study by the Texas Transportation Institute showed that \nhighway congestion costs our country over $78 billion per year, \nincluding $4.2 billion in lost productivity and 2.9 billion gallons of \nwasted fuel and an indeterminable loss in the quality of our lives. \nThese things all cascade upon us.\n  Congestion, however, isn't just limited to our roads. One in four \nflights was late last year at our airports. At Newark Liberty \nInternational Airport, it is almost one in two flights. Other \nmetropolitan regions are experiencing worsening delays. The DOT finally \nhad to cap the number of flights at Chicago's O'Hare Airport a couple \nof years ago and is considering doing the same thing for Newark and \nKennedy Airport in New York. Even airlines are throwing in the towel. \nThe 38 minutes in the air between here and New York City is now \nscheduled to take almost 2 hours, gate to gate. It is on the schedule--\n38 minutes of flying time and almost 2 hours to make the trip. It is \noutrageous. Coupled with long security lines, these delays make air \ntravel increasingly stressful and inconvenient. How about those who are \nstranded in airplanes, for sometimes as long as 9 hours--stuck in an \nairplane without the amenities that necessarily should be there, like \nfood and potable water and working restrooms and so forth?\n\n  Everyone knows what a difficult day going to the airport can be, or \nthat air travel can be like. Further, everyone knows that the high \nprice of gas has created economic hardship for so many Americans. Some \nexperienced voices are predicting that oil prices in the future, not \ntoo distant, can be as high as $200 a barrel, more than twice the \ncurrent price. One reason why the United States is addicted to oil, as \nPresident Bush puts it, is because the Government has not provided \nother options for travelers. Where reliable rail service is available, \npeople will run to the trains.\n  Our Nation's passenger railroad, Amtrak, has enjoyed record ridership \nover the past several years and set a new company record of almost 26 \nmillion passengers in the last year. More travelers take the train \nbetween Washington and New York City than fly on all the airlines \ncombined between these cities. Amtrak is so popular in the Northeast \nbecause people can count on being on time; it is reliable service and \nit is economical and comfortable.\n  We see similar results outside of the Northeast corridor, where \nfrequent and reliable passenger service is available. I can tell you \nfrom personal experience that riding the train can be a pleasurable \nexperience. Passengers can use their laptops, talk on the phone, have a \nbite and be productive and not be exhausted when they get there.\n  Additionally, in most instances, rail service delivers passengers \ndirectly to where they need to go in the heart of a city. What a \ndifference that is. You don't have to spend a half hour or an hour to \nget to the airport a half hour or an hour before the plane takes off so \nyou are ready when the flight is ready to leave. Good passenger rail \nservice is not only good transportation policy, but it is something \npeople in this country are rushing to use.\n  Everyone is aware now also of the danger of pollution. In the battle \nagainst global warming, which is enveloping our country, with erratic \nweather raising havoc, rail is one of the most effective weapons. To \nmove one passenger a mile, Amtrak emits slightly more than half of the \ncarbon dioxide that airlines do and less than cars as well. Americans \nwant a cleaner option in the air and the water for their children, \ngrandchildren, and future generations than this constant assault on \nhealthy air and water.\n  In a time where conserving energy and reducing our dependency on \nforeign oil has never been more important, passenger rail service \noffers significant fuel-saving benefits. In a time when oil imports \ncontinue to expand while prices rise, the quality of life in America is \nbeing substantially eroded by these high prices. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, airlines on the average consume over 20 percent \nmore energy than Amtrak to move a passenger one mile, while we search \nfor ways to fight against poisoning our atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S13345]]\n\n  Passenger rail is not just a matter of convenience. It is also an \nimportant security asset. One of the lessons we learned on 9/11 was \nthat our country cannot afford to rely on any single mode of \ntransportation. When our aviation system shut down that terrible day, \nSeptember 11, and for days thereafter, Amtrak was a principal way to \nreunite thousands of travelers with their families. We also saw chaotic \nevacuations during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with resulting floods, \nwith evacuating motorists stuck for hours and some without cars were \nleft behind altogether. Some investigations showed that with better \npreparation, passenger trains could have been used to help move \nthousands out of harm's way.\n  It is clear that rail service can help move our citizens to safety \nduring emergencies, but you can't do it without the trains and the \ntrack that are part of the system. Other nations around the world \nunderstand these benefits and, unfortunately, we have been lagging \nbehind. I will never forget a trip I took from Paris to Brussels. There \nare 18 trains a day between these two cities. You cannot get an \nairplane that goes between the two. The 210-mile trip takes about 85 \nminutes. Think about it, 210 miles taking 85 minutes, with trains \nleaving practically every hour. If you go to Union Station here and \ntravel approximately 210 miles, it is a 3-hour or 2\\3/4\\-hour train \nride. We can do so much better.\n  The Europeans are not better at these things than we are. They are \nnot smarter than we are. But from Spain to Germany, they have simply \nmade the wise decision to invest in passenger rail. These investments \nextend worldwide.\n  Taiwan recently opened its $15 billion, 208-mile rail line this year, \nwhere riders can travel its length, 208 miles, in 90 minutes--\napproximately the length of the trip between Washington, DC, and New \nYork City.\n  The benefits of these systems are obvious to anyone who travels \nthere. We need the same world-class system in this country. The \npotential of new rail corridors in our country is enormous. Higher \nspeed, more frequent rail service between Chicago and other Midwestern \ncities, such as St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee, would revolutionize \nthe way people travel in an entire region of our country.\n  Likewise, expanded rail service between Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, \nand Washington would allow people options besides having to brave \ntraffic and trucks on Interstate 95.\n  I am reminded that the train service between Portland, Oregon, and \nSeattle, Washington, called the Cascades line, is enjoying tremendous \nridership, over 600,000 passengers each and every year. It is an \ninvaluable asset. We see something similar in California between San \nDiego and Los Angeles, where over two and a half million people took \nthe train this past year.\n\n  There is enthusiasm for passenger rail service in America, and States \nare planning rail corridors throughout the country. They are prepared \nto spend their limited funding for rail projects. But our Federal \npolicies encourage them to build more roads. That is why we need to \npass this bill that Senator Lott and I have presented. Our bill paves \nthe way for an improved modern passenger rail network. It authorizes \nfunding for Amtrak's capital needs as well as State grants for \npassenger rail. We already make a significant investment in roads. We \nspend $40 billion a year. By comparison, we spend almost half that \namount on airports and air traffic control towers. Our bill will start \nto address this investment gap by authorizing nearly $2 billion a year \nfor Amtrak in the States that participate over the next 6 years.\n  A yearly average of $237 million of this money will be used to create \na new State grant program for rail projects. Our Amtrak bill also funds \nthe rehabilitation of Amtrak's Northeast corridor and mandates that \nAmtrak work with the Department of Transportation and the States to \ndevelop plans to do so.\n  Our bill also requires changes at Amtrak--Senator Lott pursued this \ndiligently--to make sure these funds will help the railroad continue \nmoving in the right direction.\n  While we had record ridership and revenues last year, we can still \nimprove its efficiency and management practices. That is why our bill \nwould require Amtrak to reform its operations to reduce its Federal \noperating subsidy by 40 percent over the life of the bill. It also, at \nthe suggestion of the Department of Transportation's inspector general, \nwill allow the Federal Government to refinance Amtrak's $3 billion in \noutstanding debt.\n  With this bill, we are hitting so many of the areas of concern: it \nnot only addresses the funding, but it also helps the management to \nfocus on getting this railroad in a condition that it should be in.\n  One of these major reforms is for Amtrak to develop a new financial \naccounting system, which will provide more transparency into the \ncompany's financial management and better cost controls.\n  Most importantly, the Lautenberg-Lott Amtrak bill focuses on \nimproving service for passengers. I learned when I was in the private \nsector that if you provide a good product, people will buy it. We will \nrequire new standards for service quality--on-time performance, onboard \nand station services, cost recovery, connectivity, to name a few. The \npublic is going to know what Amtrak is doing and would be kept apprised \nof their performance through quarterly reports from the Federal \nRailroad Administration.\n  Our bill also addresses the problem of train delays. On many routes \noutside the Northeast, freight trains delay Amtrak riders from reaching \ntheir destination on time. It is against the Federal law. As we know in \nthe airline industry, delays frustrate passengers and hurt the \ncompany's bottom line. Our bill would authorize the Surface \nTransportation Board to issue fines to freight railroads that delay \nAmtrak trains. We all have to share the system and share it \nefficiently.\n  Some have suggested another provider could be more efficient than \nAmtrak. I doubt this claim, but our bill does authorize a program to \nallow a freight railroad to bid for Amtrak's subsidy on up to two long-\ndistance or State-supported corridor routes. So we are saying, even if \nthere is some skepticism on our part, the bill authorizes the States to \ngo ahead and work with the freight railroad to bid for an Amtrak \nsubsidy, on up to two long-distance or State-supported corridor routes.\n  I repeat that because it is very significant. We want the States to \nparticipate, and we want to open as much of a change in policy as can \nbe done with practical output. This pilot program could allow freight \nrailroads to maximize efficiencies because they own the tracks already. \nAs many Northeast corridor States have called for more involvement in \nhow that essential corridor is run, this bill will improve governance \nby giving Northeast States, such as New Jersey, a bigger voice in \ninfrastructure and operations decisions.\n  The State will join a newly formed commission that will develop \nrecommendations about the short- and long-term capital investments, \namong other things.\n  And speaking of governance, our bill restructures Amtrak's board of \ndirectors by ensuring a bipartisan nine-member board of qualified \nmembers. That gives an opportunity to bring more people into the \nmanagement decision process, and we think it will be a much more \nefficient and involved board. One board member, nominated by President \nBush, actually told me at his Senate confirmation hearing that he had \nnever even been on an Amtrak train. Well, it does not suggest he is \ngoing to be working with knowledge in hand that is significant or \nhelpful to the company.\n  Currently there is a seven-member board, no qualification \nrequirements, and for years the Administration had taken the position \nthat the board need not be bipartisan at all. Well, it was originally \nstructured as a bipartisan board to give all sides to the principal \nparties to be able to be engaged in this process.\n  We worked hard to forge this bipartisan compromise plan. Last \nCongress, our plan, which was nearly identical to this one, was \napproved by the Senate as an amendment to the budget bill by a vote of \n93 to 6. That tells us this is a well thought-out plan.\n  There are only slight changes to our bill from the last Congress, and \nwe will have a managers' amendment to address other minor \nmodifications. Our\n\n[[Page S13346]]\n\nNation's passenger rail programs have not been reauthorized for a \ndecade, and the result is chaos in our transportation system.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this Amtrak bill, to provide \nmillions of Americans with more transportation choices. It is fair to \nsay that the public has agreed with this change in droves. They are \nsick and tired of being delayed, paying more for fuel, and including a \nmore polluted atmosphere at the same time. It is time to make this \nchange.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3451\n\n  Madam President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell.)

Madam President, this amendment will strike the title \non security which has already become law this year. It adds a study on \ntrip time in the Northeast corridor, and makes several technical \ncorrections.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator \nLott.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say with regard to the package that was agreed to, \nthe changes, we did work together on that. It was cleared on both \nsides. I want to thank the leaders for allowing us to move forward on \nthis legislation. It is never easy to go straight to a bill these days. \nThere are Senators who have reservations about going to this particular \nbill at this time. Some Senators wanted to make sure they were going to \nhave an opportunity to look at the legislation and prepare thoughtful \namendments, amendments that might, frankly, improve the legislation, \nadd additional reforms, delete parts of it.\n  That is all well and good. I understand that maybe some Senators were \nnot aware we were going to try to go to Amtrak today, even though I \nknow an effort was made to try to inform both sides that would be the \nintent after we dealt with the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the \nSouthwick nomination, and the DREAM Act. Maybe it moved a little \nquicker than people thought because of some of the earlier actions \ntoday.\n  I want to emphasize this too. While I have been involved in working \non this legislation for some 3 years with Senator Lautenberg as \nchairman of this subcommittee and now as ranking member, and I think \nthere are some good things in here worth having, maybe we can even \nstrengthen it more. That would be positive for the future of Amtrak. I \nam perfectly willing and anxious to see if there are good ideas of how \nwe can make it even a stronger bill. I want Amtrak to succeed. If we \nare going to keep it, let's fix it where it will work. I do not think \nit is wise to continue putting money into a system that is not enough, \nand then complain because it is not doing the job. We are slowly \nstarving it, using it more, and complaining that it is not doing \nbetter. I think we need some reforms. I think we need to have \nauthorization. I think we need to expect more of the Amtrak board. We \nneed to expect good service from Amtrak. I think we ought to provide an \nopportunity for them to have a way to get the funds to do the job. That \nis what we are trying to do here.\n  As I said earlier today, this is not something people in my State are \ngoing to feel an immediate impact from. We do have Amtrak service that \nruns through my State, north and south, from New Orleans to Chicago. We \nhave even had it down along the coast. Probably some people would say: \nWell, it is not worth it.\n  I believe we need Amtrak. I believe we need a national passenger rail \nsystem. It is a part of the package. I support improving aviation and a \nmodernization of the aircraft control system. I want us to have safety \nin the airways. I want us to have less congestion. I want us to do what \nwe need to do to modernize the system. I want good passenger airline \nservice. I also want to continue to work to improve highways in this \ncountry. But I do not believe that lanes and planes will always be \nenough. There is a limit to what you can do in the air and on the \nground with highways. I think we need passenger rail service also.\n  This is not something, again, that is going to be critical in my \nState. But I think it is important for our country. My State will \nbenefit, too, when the rest of the country benefits.\n  I also think if we are going to have this system, it ought to not be \njust the Northeast corridor. I think we should continue to work to try \nto find ways to make other routes profitable, on time, provide good \nservice. That is what we are trying to do here.\n  Some of my friends look at me and say: Well, why are you trying to do \nthis? This is costing money. It is too overly subsidized. They have \nunion problems, this, that and the other. I admit it has problems. I \nthink we are part of the problem, because we are not engaged in trying \nto improve the law, give them more power to do what they need to do to \nmake the tough decisions, get outside advice, try to figure\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\nout how to do a better job. That is what we do here.\n  So this is an area I have worked on for most of my career in \nCongress, transportation and infrastructure. I believe they are \ncritical to the future of our country. It is about jobs. It is about \neconomic development. It is about opportunity. It is about movement. It \nis about America.\n  That is why I have been involved for some time, to the consternation \nof some of my friends. We have worked on this before. I worked on the \nlast Amtrak reform legislation. I had higher hopes from that \nlegislation than the results we got. But I think we have made some \nprogress. And when you do legislation that does not achieve all you \nwant it to do, my attitude is, come back and try again.\n  But to show you the amount of support we have, when we brought this \nup on the reconciliation package in 2005, it got 93 votes. Some people \nsaid: Well, it is not enough, or, we can do better. But when they \nvoted, 93 Senators voted for it. That is part of the process.\n\n  This time, hopefully, we can get it through here freestanding, get \nthe House to act, let us get to conference, let's bring in the \nadministration. If the administration has recommendations or concerns, \ngreat, let us hear them.\n  My problem with the administration is, they have tried to ignore it. \nSo let's try to get them involved. I am not going to be partisan about \nthis. I do not want to blast Amtrak, I don't want to blast the board or \nthe administration. I want us all to get together. That is part of the \neffort of what we are trying to do here.\n  This legislation, S. 294, makes a number of important reforms in \nAmtrak. It has three major themes: Amtrak reform and accountability; \ncost cutting; and creating funding options for States.\n  Now, whether are you from Illinois, California, or Missouri, or \nwhether you are from New Jersey, you ought to like this. And if you are \na conservative Republican, did you hear what I said? Cost cutting, \nreform, and accountability. This is made in heaven.\n  I think we should get this done, and work in good faith with each \nother. I think we need to increase the executive branch oversight and \ninvolvement in Amtrak. The bill ensures that taxpayer money is used \nmore effectively and it builds on the improvements that have been made \nin recent years. I think you have to give credit to the fact that David \nGunn, when he was the president of Amtrak, made some improvements in \nhis management. He did a good job. He finally wound up leaving because \nhe had other opportunities, and maybe some people were critical of him. \nBut I have to say I think he did a great job, and he moved it in the \nright direction.\n  The bill requires Amtrak to develop better financial systems and to \nevaluate its operations objectively. It forces Amtrak to improve the \nefficiency of long-distance train service. There are some lines that \nare losing way too much money. I think the Amtrak officials should look \nat it and try to make those lines more profitable, put some guidelines \non them, put some pressure on them, and if they do not meet them, cut \nthem off. I cannot defend a line that is losing money and is costing \n$400 a head subsidy for a passenger.\n  So the bill reduces Amtrak's operating subsidy by 40 percent by 2012 \nby requiring Amtrak to use its funds more effectively.\n  But it does not just say ``do it,'' it provides a number of things \nthat will lead to making that possible. The bill promotes a greater \nrole for the private sector by allowing private companies to bid on \noperating Amtrak lines.\n  The bill also creates a new rail capital grant program that States \ncan use to start new inner city passenger rail service. There has been \na real increase, and that is where we had a lot of boardings, a lot of \npassengers. They are using that service where that opportunity has \nexisted. This would be the first time that States will have a Federal \nprogram they can use for passenger rail, putting inner city passenger \nrail on similar footing with highway transit and airports, all of which \nhave Federal assistance programs for infrastructure.\n  Some people complain about the money in Amtrak, and yet if you look \nat what we have in these other areas, highways and transit and \nairports, Amtrak is terribly shortchanged. We provide all of this \ninfrastructure in these other areas, and then we are not prepared to do \nthat with the passenger rail system.\n  States will not have to rely only on Amtrak for their inner city \npassenger rail service. It gives them more opportunity, more for \nthemselves, and to have a Federal program work with them to achieve \nthat.\n  Now, while discussing reform, we should not forget there is good news \nhere. Some people will only say: Well, it is still losing money. In \nfiscal year 2007, there was a record number of 25.8 million passengers \nwho traveled on Amtrak. People are using it and using it more. It is \nthe chicken-and-egg deal. Once you get better equipment, on-time \nservice, better food, going to places people want to go, they will \nride. In the past they haven't done it because maybe the equipment was \nold or they got delayed. As they have provided better service, more \npeople started riding. The boarding ticket revenues increased 11 \npercent to $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2007. Of course, the Acela \nExpress, I guess the old standard of what Amtrak should do, can do--and \nwe use it here in this corridor--had a 20-percent increase in ridership \nand achieved an on-time performance of 87.8 percent, proving it can be \ndone. Passenger service can be on time. The Acela is so popular that \nanother round-trip between New York and Washington was created in July.\n\n  We should not focus solely on the Northeast corridor though. I want \nto make sure we have some service in the South and the Midwest and the \nWest and in the Northwest. The Capital Corridor operating in California \nbetween Auburn and San Jose increased ridership by 15 percent and has \nan ontime performance of 75 percent. Most notably, the Lincoln service \nconnecting Chicago to St. Louis is up 42 percent. Chicago to St. Louis, \nthat is a tremendous increase. It is a direct result of the State more \nthan doubling its contract with Amtrak. Across the country, States are \ninterested in passenger service, and passengers are responding in \nrecord numbers to the better service.\n  S. 294 is the best mechanism to reform Amtrak. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bill. Read it. It is not a long, complicated \nbill. But if you have a better idea, come on out here. Let's hear it. \nTomorrow we will be ready for business. We will have some amendments. \nThe way I like to do business, with the cooperation of our chairman, if \nyou have an amendment, let's have you offer it. Let's talk about it, \nand let's vote. Let's don't be setting them aside and piling them up \nfor later on in the day. Let's do business. I think that is one way you \nget Senators to actually be here and doing work, actually have some \nvotes. I don't want to go on too long.\n  Let me just run down some of the areas where we have concentrated in \nthis bill. It does provide for management improvement. The bill \nrequires a financial accounting system for Amtrak operations and a 5-\nyear financial plan. Why in the world wouldn't they have that? I don't \nknow. Families have plans for their budgets and what they are going to \ndo in the future. Amtrak ought to do that.\n  It deals with debt. The bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury, \nin consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak, to \nnegotiate the restructuring of Amtrak's debt within 1 year. This is \nsomething Senator Lautenberg has talked about. They can actually save \nmoney. Why would they not do that? So we would direct that in the bill.\n  It does improve corporate governance. It adds the Amtrak president to \nthe Amtrak board, bringing the total number of members of the board to \nnine. Think about that, the Amtrak president was not on the board. That \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  It calls for metrics and standards. In consultation with the Surface \nTransportation Board and the operating freight railroads, the Federal \nRailroad Administration and Amtrak shall jointly develop metrics and \nstandards for measuring the performance and service quality of \nintercity train operations. They should include cost recovery, ontime \nperformance, ridership per train mile, onboard and station services, \nthe whole package.\n  It does improve the route methodology. It would provide access to \nAmtrak equipment and services.\n  States wishing to use operators other than Amtrak would be able to do \nso\n\n[[Page S13348]]\n\nunder this legislation. It would improve the Northeast corridor. It \nwould work to improve the long distance routes.\n  I think we have touched on the very important areas, but the one I \nthink that is going to make the greatest difference is the State \nCapital Grant Program for intercity passenger rail. When I have talked \nto Governors and transportation officials, railroad people, they say \nthis is what we need. This could really make a difference. I see the \nPresiding Officer nodding her head. I suspect her State is one that \nwould have an interest up there in the northwest corner of Washington \nand Oregon.\n  So there are significant reforms. This is a good effort. This is the \nkind of work we ought to do more of in the Senate. We have managed for \nthe last few years to find what we could disagree about, something we \ncould fight about. We haven't taken the time to take up issues that \naffect real people's lives that we can agree on, that are bipartisan. I \nappreciate the leader putting this in the agenda. He did it at the \nrequest of a number of Senators who care about this. Senator Carper \nobviously is one of them, Senator Lautenberg, myself, and others. We \nhave been pleading with them. I pleaded with the previous majority \nleader. Let's get this bill up.\n  Some people say there are other things more important we could be \ndoing. Why aren't you doing something about health care, more \nappropriations bills? That is a good question. All I know is, this is \nan issue that matters. We don't know when we are going to have another \nincident in America with aviation, or somewhere else, when we need \ntrains. We need good service. I am also working in the Finance \nCommittee to see if we can't get a tax credit so that we can continue \nto improve the capacity of our freight rail and allow them to build off \nramps so the freight trains can get out of the way so Amtrak can run \nwithout losing time and money. We are looking at that side of the \nequation too. I know some of our friends in the freight rail industry \nare not all that excited about this legislation because we want Amtrak \nto be on time and to get by the slower moving freight trains. Sometimes \nthat costs them money, and it is an inconvenience for them. After all, \nAmtrak is running on their tracks. But we will work with the freight \nlines and make sure their points of view are considered in the process.\n  I won't go on any longer. I would like for us to get to some \namendments that may be available on Amtrak. I know Senator Sununu has \nsome. We will continue tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, once again, it is obvious to all \nthat Senator Lott understands what we have to do to get things done \naround here, and that it can't be all one way because each of us does \nrepresent a different State. We are brought here to bring in the \nopinions of the people whom we serve, our constituents, so we do get a \nmix of views. Sometimes I wish we didn't, but for the most part that is \nlife in the real world.\n  The thing we sometimes fail to see is, when we do something for the \ninfrastructure, when we do something for rail service, it is in the \nnational interest, even though there are currently many more riders in \nthe very densely populated Northeast corridor. The fact is, as I \nrelated before, other places around the country are examining rail \nservice as an alternative to their own congestion and pollution \nproblems. When we look at something called essential air service, it is \nessential. That is why it is done. The Government does subsidize its \nexistence because communities need that. So it is with rail service.\n  Interestingly enough, only four States have no contact with Amtrak. \nOne of them is Hawaii, which involves a very long train ride. The other \nis Alaska. We have heard Senator Stevens talk about having a railroad \nthat goes to Alaska. But otherwise we have 46 States that have contact \nwith Amtrak. Some of them are more active than others. But as was said \nby our colleague, Senator Lott, some of these States don't have the \ntraffic or they are not en route enough. The mission is to get as many \nStates involved with Amtrak, with rail service as we can, national rail \npassenger service.\n  We look at ways of improving the management of Amtrak, that which we \nwould with any business. I spent much of my life in business before I \ncame to the Senate. Businesses run differently than government. But \nthere are some principles that are the same; for instance, investments \nin product. If you don't put the money in, you don't get the money out. \nWhat we found here is, since the creation of Amtrak, which goes back to \n1971--1971 was the creation of the Amtrak quasi-government corporation. \nIt had been in private hands under different names for many years and \nnever succeeded. Why? The thing that is obvious; that is, with rail \npassenger rail service, there is going to always be some assistance \nrequired from government, just as there is for the aviation system and \nthe highway system. As a matter of fact, we spend more on highways in a \nyear than we have spent on Amtrak since its creation, never having \nquite put in enough resources to bring the infrastructure up to the \nlevel it should be related to the period of time we are talking about.\n  In Germany, there was a program to establish a rail system that cost \nabout $70 billion in a 10-year period. China now is establishing a \npassenger rail service which could cost up to $200 billion. And here we \nare in the most powerful nation in the world playing catchup. We are \nnot talking about insignificant sums of money, but we are talking about \nsubstantial opportunities for us to improve what we are doing with this \nbill that will run almost $2 billion a year for 6 years, plus some \nadditional funding in another bill raised by bonding authority. Senator \nLott has been very helpful in the Finance Committee to get this system \nup to where it ought to be. Whenever we look for opportunities to \nimprove life in America, certainly this looms high on the horizon.\n  We have made it clear that we are ready to accept amendments. We \nwould like them brought to the floor this evening or tomorrow. But we \nwill not be able to stay here and not see any response, if there isn't \nenough interest by fellow Members to come down and bring us their \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previously agreed to committee \namendments be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendments; that the pending managers' amendment be considered and \nagreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendments; that the bill, as amended, be considered as original text \nfor the purpose of further amendments; that no points of order be \nconsidered waived by virtue of this agreement.\n  As Senator Lott well knows, this is kind of professional language for \nthe institution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will not object. I just want to say, we \nhave worked through this, and it is cleared on our side. We have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3451) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, we are moving on into the early hours of \nthe evening, and I appreciate the work that the bill managers, Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Lott, have done on this legislation.\n  I am a member of the Commerce Committee as well, and there is no \nquestion that there was strong support for this legislation when we \nvoted on it last year. As Senator Lautenberg indicated, it was a 93-to-\n6 vote. I am sorry to say, at least from his perspective, I was one of \nthe six who voted ``no.''\n  Despite the work that has gone into this legislation, I do think it \nhas some real weaknesses. Both Senators Lott and Lautenberg touched on \nsome of those weaknesses in their opening remarks--that at times Amtrak \nhas not delivered the kind of quality service we would expect; at times \nthey have not delivered, year after year, the kind of financial results \nwe would hope for and\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\nexpect as taxpayers who are providing the subsidies and the support for \nAmtrak.\n  Since its creation well over 25 years ago, the Federal subsidies have \namounted to over $20 billion. Amtrak was originally created with the \nintention of becoming self-sufficient. There was an Amtrak reform bill \npassed in 1997, recommitting to this goal, and yet it still has not \nhappened.\n  As a taxpayer and as a Senator, it causes me great concern we have \nnot done better--better both in terms of performance on the service and \nthe quality side--but also on the financial side.\n  There was discussion of the Northeast Corridor. The Northeast \nCorridor does provide for a great opportunity to serve millions of \npeople running from my State of New Hampshire all the way down to \nWashington, DC, and beyond--some of the more densely populated areas \nwhere it makes the most sense to have a train service. But even in the \nNortheast Corridor, the operation is not what we would want.\n  I think it is fair to expect more; not just in the financial \noversight that is in the legislation, not just in some of the new \nprograms that are in the legislation, but, for example, in the long-\ndistance train service. For the long-distance train routes--I think \nthere are 15 or 16 now--they lose $200 per passenger. That is not \nacceptable.\n  I have a couple amendments I will be offering. One deals with that \nhuge per-passenger subsidy, to say if we are losing $200 per \npassenger--every single passenger: a $200 subsidy--on some of those \nlong-distance routes, we should not continue to operate that route.\n  There are some proposals for allowing route competition. I think that \nis also a good idea, but one we can build on and expand on, allowing \nmore and different routes to be offered on a competitive basis.\n  So I think there are ways to improve the bill that we need to take a \nlook at, and that I hope are at least part of the debate.\n  I do not necessarily expect to win on all of those amendments, but I \nthink it is important we be realistic about some of the weaknesses that \nare in the system.\n  I also want to address an issue that was spoken about early this \nevening by Senator Alexander. He discussed at some length the Internet \ntax moratorium and what that would mean to American consumers.\n  Right now, we have a ban on Internet access taxes. You cannot levy an \naccess tax on the Internet for consumers, or for businesses, for that \nmatter. Everyone talks about the importance of broadband to our \neconomy. Without question, the Internet is important to our economy, \nnot just because it gives us information or brings data into our homes, \nbut because it represents a national--in effect, a global--network for \ncommunication and for commerce.\n  That is something that is the responsibility of Congress to protect--\nto protect from onerous regulation, to protect from taxes that would \ndiscourage long-term investment that would raise costs for consumers or \nbusinesses.\n  We have had that ban on Internet taxes in place, and I think it is \nimportant we make that tax ban permanent. Unfortunately, after \nintroducing legislation at the beginning of this year, we have not had \na single vote on this issue. We have not voted on it in the Commerce \nCommittee or any subcommittee. They have not voted on it in the Finance \nCommittee. We have not had a vote on it on this floor.\n  Many of us have been trying very hard to get a vote to make this \nInternet tax moratorium permanent. The moratorium expires on Halloween, \nof all days. On that day, because the ban will no longer be in effect, \nStates, cities, towns, and counties would be in the position to levy \nnew taxes on Internet access. That is not right. It is not good for \nconsumers. It is not good for the economy. It is not good for the \ncommunication system, the data system, and the commerce system we have \ncome to count on with the Internet.\n  A number of Senators--Senator Wyden; Senator McCain; Senator \nMcConnell; Senator Lott and numerous House Members, such as Anna Eshoo \nfrom California--have worked very hard on making this ban permanent. \nFor those who have listened to this debate from around the country, I \nam sure they wonder why it is we cannot do anything in a consistent \nway. We have research and development tax credits that lasts only for a \nyear. We have a death tax that is repealed in 2011 and comes back from \nthe dead in 2012.

Madam President, this legislation would simply take what \nhas already been done in the House--which is to pass a 4-year \nextension--and to make it permanent. A lot of good work was done in the \nHouse to strengthen the current moratorium and ban on Internet access \ntaxes. Unfortunately, despite the fact there were over 240 Democrats \nand Republicans who supported this legislation, it did not receive an \nup-or-down vote to make the ban on Internet taxes permanent.\n  So what we do is take the House language in this amendment and make \nit permanent. It provides clarification with regard to services and \ntechnologies that are dealt with and not dealt with. If you are an \nInternet business, you still pay property taxes and payroll taxes. You \npay business income taxes. But the Government should not be allowed to \nlevy a tax on access to the Internet for the consumers themselves.\n  There are certain States that are affected by grandfather clauses \nthat were included in the House language. We maintain that language. \nAll we do is fully extend it permanently so that if you are a consumer \nyou know the Internet will not be taxed. If you are a small business, \nyou know your cost of Internet access will not go up. If you are doing \nbusiness over the Internet, you know there will continue to be \ninvestments in the infrastructure necessary to increase broadband \ndeployment.\n  I think at the very least we should have an opportunity to vote on \nmaking this Internet tax moratorium permanent. I think it is a \ncommonsense approach. We can always come back and look at the technical \nissues associated with the language if it needs to be modified in 5 \nyears or 10 years or 15 years. That is what Congress does. But we \nshould say, once and for all, we are not going to tax Internet access \nat the Federal level, at the State level, at the local level.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the consideration and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for offering this important amendment. We are running out of \ntime. The Internet tax moratorium does expire in a week. As the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has indicated, State and local governments across \nour country could impose taxes on Internet access as soon as a week \nfrom now.\n  I think it is important we address this issue--not that the \nunderlying measure is not important as well. I know it is important to \nmany Senators. But the Internet needs to be protected. Here is our \nchance to go on record: Are we for a tax on Internet access or not?\n  The Internet has been at the heart of America's economic growth over \nthe past decade--all because Government has not gotten in the way. \nThose days are over if we open the Internet to new taxes. I think there \nis bipartisan support for a permanent ban, for continuing the \nmoratorium forever, and I think the Senate ought to have an opportunity \nto go on record.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The only way, Madam President, in the parliamentary situation we find \nourselves in, that a vote on a permanent moratorium could be achieved \nis if I were to offer a motion to invoke cloture, which I send to the \ndesk now, on the Sununu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     amendment No. 3452 to make the moratorium on Internet access \n     taxes and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce permanent.\n         Mitch McConnell, John E. Sununu, John Ensign, Ted \n           Stevens, Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Barrasso, R.F. \n           Bennett, Larry Craig, Lindsey Graham, Wayne Allard, \n           Trent Lott, Jim Bunning, Jim DeMint, Mel Martinez, \n           Richard Burr, David Vitter.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I thank the Republican leader for his \nremarks and for the support he has provided to us. He is not a member \nof the Commerce Committee. He has a lot of other duties in the Senate, \nbut he has taken a great interest in this issue, as I think most any \nlegislator would, because the Internet is something we all understand, \nwe deal with, we work with at one level or another. Our families, our \nfriends, our neighbors, and businesses we may have worked for before, \ndepend on it in different ways.\n  Everyone understands when you tax something, you raise its cost; when \nyou tax something, you end up getting less of it--especially in the \nlong run.\n  Some people stood up and said: Well, there are some States that have \nsome taxes on the Internet, but there has still been broadband \ndeployment in their State. That may well be, but you\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\ncannot argue with the economic fact that when you tax something, you \nraise its cost; and when you raise its cost, you create a barrier to \ninvestment. Those are economic facts of life we cannot change, and \nthose are the economic factors that make implementing a permanent ban \non Internet taxes so important.\n  Opponents of making this ban permanent have also suggested it is an \nunfunded mandate to tell States they cannot tax the Internet, that it \nis an unfunded mandate because if we allow them to tax, they could \nraise money, but because we are telling them they cannot tax Internet \naccess, they cannot raise that money, so there is a cost.\n  I think that is classic Washington-speak, a classic inside-the-\nbeltway mentality, that if we prevent a State from imposing taxes, we \nhave to compensate the State for that. That is plain wrong. If that \nwere true, then we should be compensating every State in the Union \nbecause we do not allow them to arbitrarily impose taxes, fees, and \ntolls on every mile of interstate highway in the country, or because we \ndo not allow every State in the Union to impose unique taxes on any \nflight or aviation that comes into or leaves their State. We do not \nallow that because we recognize our aviation system is a national \nsystem, because we recognize our interstate highway system is a \nnational system. We do not allow States to tax exports for the same \nreason. And yet, we do not call those examples unfunded mandates. We do \nnot compensate the States for these activities because the Federal \nGovernment has recognized these are important facets to interstate \ncommerce that need to be dealt with in a systematic and uniform way at \nthe Federal level. So I think it is an enormous mistake and very \nmisleading to refer to this as an unfunded mandate.\n  The second objection that some have made is they recognize: Well, the \ntechnologies may change, so defining what is Internet access or data \nservice or voice service--those definitions may have to be modified, as \nwe have modified them over the last 6 or 8 years since the first ban on \nInternet access taxes was first put in place in 1998.\n  But if the fact that technology may change is a reason for not \nlegislating or not making something permanent, we could use that as an \nexcuse not to do anything ever or at least to do every bill on a 1- or \n2-year basis. Especially in an area where we are dealing with \ninvestment and taxation, it is counterproductive at times to do such \nshort-term legislation because those in the economy who are taking \nrisks, making investments, creating jobs and economic opportunity for \nother people, will not be able to calculate and estimate what long-term \nreturns and benefits might come from a given investment. They do not \nknow what the tax rate will be or they do not know what the regulatory \nburden will be. As a result, you get fewer investments in that area. So \nwe know that technology, services, and the approach to the Internet \nthat businesses take may change in the future, but Congress can always \nand should always revisit laws, rules, or regulations, whether it has \nto do with Internet access or any other area.\n\n  So this is a piece of legislation whose time has come. I hope we can \nget expeditious consideration and approval because I think this is \nsomething that has been shown to have bipartisan support in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  At this time, I would like to turn my attention to another amendment \nI mentioned earlier in my remarks, and that has to do with the long-\ndistance train routes. As I said, I think there are 14, 15, or 16 \nroutes in operation now. None of these long-distance train routes make \nany money. They do not make any operating profit. They all lose money. \nThey all lose money at different levels. Some of the long-distance \nroutes, by GAO accounting estimates, lose as much as $200 per \npassenger. That means there is a Federal taxpayer subsidy, not of $1, \nor $10, or $20, or $40, but $200 for every passenger riding that route \nover the course of a year. That is a level of cost and subsidy which \njust can't be justified; especially at a time when we are trying to \ndeal with difficult Federal priorities.\n  Today and throughout this week, there has been a lot of discussion \nabout SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and the \nfact that SCHIP is an important program. I agree. I supported the \nlegislation here in the Senate. Its goal is to provide coverage for \nlower income families who aren't covered by Medicaid, but may not be \ncovered at their place of employment by a health care policy. As we are \nhaving a debate about providing that funding and targeting it to the \nmost needy, whether it is health care or any other high-priority \ninitiative, it is so hard to justify running trains across the country \nthat have a subsidy of $200 for every passenger riding that train \nthrough the year.\n  So what I would propose is that we set a standard of $200. If your \nper-passenger subsidy through the course of a year is less than $200, \nwe will allow the train to operate. Now, we hope it improves. We hope \nthe reforms that were described at the beginning of the evening work--\nimprove the management, reduce the costs, improve the efficiency, and \nimprove the performance. But if they do not, and that subsidy level \nremains above $200 over the course of a year, that route should not \nremain in operation. Then, in subsequent years, we bring that threshold \ndown, and the second year after this amendment would be in effect, the \nthreshold would be $175. So if you have to subsidize passengers at $170 \nfor every passenger who rides that train in a year, you can remain in \noperation, but if it is more than $175, that route would have to be \nclosed. So on over the lifetime, until at the end of the authorization \nperiod for this bill we would have a cap of $100 subsidy per rider. I \nthink that is still too high, but I certainly don't think it is too \nmuch to ask in an authorization bill of this type.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3453\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside any \npending amendment and send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3453.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3453\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit Federal subsidies in excess of specified amounts \n                       on any Amtrak train route)\n\n       On page 32, before line 21, insert the following:\n       (c) Limit on Passenger Subsidies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     prohibit any Federal funds to be used for the operation of an \n     Amtrak train route that has a per passenger subsidy, as \n     determined by the Inspector General under paragraph (2), of \n     not less than--\n       (A) $200 during the first fiscal year beginning after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act;\n       (B) $175 during the second fiscal year beginning after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act;\n       (C) $150 during the third fiscal year beginning after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act;\n       (D) $125 during the fourth fiscal year beginning after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (E) $100 during any fiscal year beginning after the time \n     period described in subparagraph (D).\n       (2) Determination of subsidy level.--The Inspector General \n     of the Department of Transportation, using data provided by \n     Amtrak, shall determine the difference between the average \n     fully allocated operating cost per passenger and the average \n     ticket price collected for each train route operated by \n     Amtrak during the most recent 12-month period for which data \n     is available.\n       (3) Report.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 6 months before the end of \n     each fiscal year, and every 6 months thereafter, the \n     Inspector General shall publish a report that--\n       (i) lists the subsidy levels determined under paragraph \n     (2); and\n       (ii) includes a statement that Amtrak will terminate any \n     train route that has a per passenger subsidy in excess of the \n     limits set forth in paragraph (1).\n       (B) Distribution.--The Inspector General shall display the \n     report published under subparagraph (A) on the Internet and \n     submit a copy of such report to--\n       (i) the President of Amtrak;\n       (ii) the Secretary of Transportation;\n       (iii) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate; and\n       (iv) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \n     the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I thank you for the time. The amendment I\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\nhave just submitted is as I have described, and I hope this is an idea \nand an approach which can be incorporated into the legislation. I think \nit is common sense. I know a lot of Members of the Senate believe \nstrongly that we should have long-distance trains, with long routes \nacross the country. I would like to see those routes maintained and \nsustained as well, if it can be done in an economically reasonable way.\n  But the last years have shown that for some of these routes, the \npassenger levels are so low, the costs of operating are so high, they \njust can't compete. They can't compete with buses, they can't compete \nwith automobiles, and they can't compete with airplanes in terms of \ncost and efficiency. So I think a step like this is long overdue. \nAgain, I thank the bill managers, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott, \nfor their time and consideration and for allowing me to offer these \namendments this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             2007 Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Senator from \nPennsylvania in the chair. We were both in the Agriculture Committee \ntoday. I thank him for his leadership for dairy farmers and for \nnutrition and feeding kids and all that he did that way.\n  The 2007 farm bill is a chance for Congress to make historic strides \nin agriculture, alternative energy, and to literally help improve the \nlives of millions of families across the country--families struggling \nfrom Harrisburg to Erie, from Ashtabula to Gallipolis, from Lima to \nToledo.\n  In a State such as Ohio, with a long and rich agricultural history, \nthis means a bright future for our agriculture industry, for our family \nfarmers, and for our families.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Harkin. I am proud, as Ohio's \nfirst Senator to sit on the Agriculture Committee in four decades, to \nbe part of this process.\n  This bill could mean that low-income families will have more access \nto better nutrition by increasing Food Stamp Programs and access to \naffordable healthy foods. That means more fruits and vegetables into \nthe schools in Hamilton, Middletown, and Akron, and more fruits and \nvegetables available, grown by local farmers, to go into farmers \nmarkets in Columbus and Zanesville and all over our State.\n  Earlier this year, as the occupant of the chair and I and others \ngathered in the committee, we heard from Rhonda Stewart of Hamilton, \nOH. Rhonda is perhaps in her early thirties and has, I believe, a 9-\nyear-old son. She is a single mother, struggling and working full-time \nand making about $8, $9, or $10 an hour, with no health insurance. She \nwas president of the local PTA and her son is involved in the Cub \nScouts and she is a food stamp beneficiary. She struggled every month. \nAt the beginning of the month, she told the committee back in February, \nshe would serve her son pork chops that first week, which is his \nfavorite meal. By the middle of the month, they went to McDonald's or \nanother fast-food place maybe twice. But by the end of the month, as \ntimes got tough and she struggled financially, she would almost \ninvariably sit at the dinner table, at the kitchen table with her son, \nhe would be eating and she would not. He would say: What's wrong, Mom? \nAren't you hungry? She would say: No, I don't feel well. She simply ran \nout of money at the end of the month.\n  In the farm bill, we are helping people like her and her family who \nwork hard and play by the rules and do everything in the workplace and \nin their homes that we ask them to do as citizen of their communities \nand our country. This bill could mean new investment and a new \ndirection for farmers in Ohio.\n  The 2007 farm bill reflects the values of farmers across Ohio: \nforward-thinking, responsible, and working to protect our natural \nresources and our rural communities.\n  This bill will help family farmers in my State and in Pennsylvania \nand across the country by strengthening the farm safety net, one that \nwill provide better protection for farmers against disasters, such as \neither low yield or low prices. Either one can be obviously devastating \nto farmers.\n  The Average Crop Revenue Program, which Senator Durbin and I \nintroduced a bill to create as part of the farm bill--amended by \nChairman Harkin into the farm bill--offers a much needed choice to \nfarmers. It represents significant reform for farmers and huge \nsavings--literally $3.5 billion--for taxpayers.\n  Farmers can stay in the current or old program that does little to \nprotect against drops in revenue or, for the first time ever, farmers \nwill be able to switch to a forward-looking policy that better protects \nagainst volatile crop prices, natural disasters, and rising production \ncosts. If farmers are doing well and prices and yields are good, \nfarmers would not get tax dollars. If times are bad--the yield is low \nor there are floods or tornadoes that cause major crop yield drops or \nif the price is low--then the farmer will get help. That is the way \nthat agriculture should be. That is the way most farmers I find in \nnorthwest Ohio and all over my State want to do it too. I traveled \nthroughout Ohio this Spring--to Chillicothe, where we did roundtables \nwith fruit and vegetable farmers, and in Montgomery County, not too far \nfrom Troy, and Piqua, near Dayton. We talked to farmers there, and near \nWooster, OH. We talked to dairy farmers. In Lake County we talked to \nspecialty farmers, especially those who do landscaping and greenhouses. \nIn northwest Ohio we talked to farmers who grow corn and soybeans.\n  I met with a corn farmer in Henry County who will be supplying corn \nto one of the first ethanol plants in Ohio. I met with a hog farmer in \nMontgomery County who uses wind turbines to provide on-farm energy.\n  This farm bill makes a commitment to move beyond antiquated energy \nsources and wean ourselves from Middle Eastern oil and prepare American \nagriculture to lead the world in renewable energy production.\n  With the right resources and the right incentives, farmers can help \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil and produce clean, sustainable, \nrenewable energy.\n  In a State such as Ohio, with a talented labor force and a proud \nlead-the-nation manufacturing history, that doesn't just mean stronger \nfarms and more prosperous farmers; it means a stronger economy.\n  Rural communities across the Nation will benefit from additional \nFederal assistance in the farm bill and small towns not far from where \nI grew up in Lexington, OH, places like Butler and Belleville, will \nbenefit from funding for infrastructure and hospitals, while expanding \naccess to broadband for all of my State, especially southeast Ohio, \nwhich doesn't have the access it needs.\n  This bill will also provide more than $4 billion in additional \nfunding for conservation programs to help farmers protect our water \nquality, expand wildlife habitat, and preserve endangered farmland.\n  While I am pleased with the bill overall, it can be improved. The \npublic is perfectly willing to help family farmers when they need it, \nbut taxpayers will not support massive payments to farms that have \nsubstantial net incomes.\n  We should not be sending tax dollars to Florida real estate \ndevelopers, to city farmers who live in New York, to NBA players, or to \nmedia personalities. Those are not the people who should benefit from \nthe farm bill.\n  I regret that we have not funded the McGovern-Dole international \nfeeding program. I hope as this legislation progresses, we will do so.\n  The agricultural industry in Ohio has experienced unprecedented \nchange in recent years, but the values of Ohio farmers--hard work, \nstewardship of the\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\nland, caring for their families--remains steadfast.\n  We, too, must be steadfast in our support for farmers, but we must \nalso change how we go about providing that support.\n  I applaud the proposal put before us in the Agriculture Committee \ntoday. I hope we can even improve upon it in the weeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, the House voted recently 405 to 2 to \nextend the current Internet tax moratorium which expires at the end of \nthis month. They voted to extend it for 4 more years. I believe the \nSenate should do the same thing and do it before the end of the month \nrather than enact a permanent moratorium, as some want to do, because \npermanent action is likely to invoke a far higher law--the law of \nunintended consequences.\n  We can't imagine the future impact of the World Wide Web, and a \npermanent moratorium could produce at least two unintended \nconsequences: No. 1, a big unintended tax increase, or No. 2, a big \nunintended, unfunded Federal mandate.\n  Here is an example of how a permanent moratorium could produce an \nunintended new tax. At the time the original moratorium was enacted in \n1998, Internet access meant dial-up. Today, Internet access also \nincludes broadband. Fortunately, Congress updated the moratorium \ndefinition in 2004 so that access to broadband is exempt from taxation.\n  Or, here is an example of how an outdated moratorium could produce an \nunintended, unfunded Federal mandate on States, cities, and counties. \nStates and local governments collect billions of dollars in sales tax \non telephone services to pay for schools, roads, police, and hospital \nworkers. Under the old definition of Internet access, telephone calls \nmade over the Internet might have escaped such taxation. That might \nsound good to conservatives like me who favor lower taxes, but most \nmembers of my Republican Party were elected promising to end the \npractice of unfunded Federal mandates--that is, those of us in \nWashington telling Governors, mayors, and county commissioners what \nservices to provide and how to pay for them. In fact, Republican \ncandidates for Congress stood with Newt Gingrich on the Capitol steps \nin 1994 and said, as part of a Contract With America, ``No more \nunfunded mandates. If we break our promise, throw us out.'' In 1995, \nthe new Republican Congress enacted a new Federal Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act, banning unfunded mandates.\n  Make no mistake, Mr. President, the permanent extension that is \nproposed would be an unfunded Federal mandate because it would not \nallow the grandfathered States--and there are currently nine of them \ncollecting this tax--the ability to continue to make their own \ndecisions about what revenues to collect. It would freeze into place \nforever an Internet access definition that might not be wise for \nindustry and that might not be wise for State and local governments.\n  That is why so many people support the idea of a 4-year moratorium on \ntaxation of Internet access. It has the support of the National \nGovernors Association, the National Association of Counties, The U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the Multistate Tax \nCommission, and the AFL-CIO.\n  In addition to that, even though many in the industry would like to \nhave a longer moratorium, the Don't Tax Our Web Coalition has written a \nletter to John Conyers, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nsaying that they prefer the permanent extension but that they believe \nthe House-passed bill is a step forward and one they can support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the letter from the Don't Tax Our Web Coalition and also a \ncopy of the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate from September 9, \n2003, which makes absolutely clear that such a law would be an unfunded \nFederal mandate under the terms of the 1995 Unfunded Federal Mandate \nAct.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Don't Tax Our Web Coalition,\n\n                                                  October 2, 2007.\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conyers: On behalf of the Don't Tax Our Web \n     Coalition (``Coalition''), I am pleased to express the \n     Coalition's support of your effort to extend the Internet tax \n     moratorium. Your continued leadership on these and other \n     important matters affecting our industry is critical to \n     consumers, and to strengthening the economy and job creation.\n       H.R. 3678, if enacted, would provide a temporary, four-year \n     extension of the moratorium that is set to expire on November \n     1. Your bill also contains important definitional and \n     statutory changes that improve current law. H.R. 3678 will \n     provide much needed clarity to the communications and \n     internet industries. By helping keep Internet access \n     affordable, the moratorium promotes ubiquitous broadband \n     access.\n       As you know, the Coalition has long endorsed H.R. 743, the \n     Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. While we prefer a \n     permanent extension, we believe that H.R. 3678 is a step \n     forward and thus a bill we can support.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you on this most \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Broderick D. Johnson.\n     S. 150--Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act\n       Summary: S. 150 would permanently extend a moratorium on \n     certain state and local taxation of online services and \n     electronic commerce, and after October 1, 2006, would \n     eliminate an exception to that prohibition for certain \n     states. Under current law, the moratorium is set to expire on \n     November 1, 2003. CBO estimates that enacting S. 150 would \n     have no impact on the federal budget, but beginning in 2007, \n     it would impose significant annual costs on some state and \n     local governments.\n       By extending and expanding the moratorium on certain types \n     of state and local taxes, S. 150 would impose an \n     intergovernmental mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the mandate would cause \n     state and local governments to lose revenue beginning in \n     October 2006; those losses would exceed the threshold \n     established in UMRA ($64 million in 2007, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) by 2007. While there is some uncertainty about \n     the number of states affected, CBO estimates that the direct \n     costs to states and local governments would probably total \n     between $80 million and $120 million annually, beginning in \n     2007. The bill contains no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 150 would have no impact on the federal \n     budget.\n       Intergovernmental mandates contained in the bill: The \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) currently prohibits state and \n     local governments from imposing taxes on Internet access \n     until November 1, 2003. The ITFA, enacted as Public Law 105-\n     277 on October 21, 1998, also contains an exception to this \n     moratorium, sometimes referred to as the ``grandfather \n     clause,'' which allows certain state and local governments to \n     tax Internet access if such tax was generally imposed and \n     actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998.\n       S. 150 would make the moratorium permanent and, after \n     October 1, 2006, would eliminate the grandfather clause. The \n     bill also would state that the term ``Internet access'' or \n     ``Internet access services'' as defined in ITFA would not \n     include telecommunications services except to the extent that \n     such services are used to provide Internet access (known as \n     ``aggregating'' or ``bundling'' of services). These \n     extensions and expansions of the moratorium constitute \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA because they \n     would prohibit states from collecting taxes that they \n     otherwise could collect.\n       Estimated direct costs of mandates to state and local \n     governments: CBO estimates that repealing the grandfather \n     clause would result in revenue losses for as many as 10 \n     states and for several local governments totaling between $80 \n     million and $120 million annually, beginning in 2007. We also \n     estimate that the change in the definition of Internet access \n     could affect tax revenues for many states and local \n     governments, but we cannot estimate the magnitude or the \n     timing of any such additional impacts at this time.\n       UMRA includes in its definition of the direct costs of a \n     mandate the amounts that state and local governments would be \n     prohibited from raising in revenues to comply with the \n     mandate. The direct costs of eliminating the grandfather \n     clause would be the tax revenues that state and local \n     governments are currently collecting but would be precluded \n     from collecting under S. 150. States also could lose revenues \n     that they currently collect on certain services, if those \n     services are redefined as Internet access under the bill.\n       Over the next five years there will likely be changes in \n     the technology and the market for Internet access. Such \n     changes are likely to affect, at minimum, the price for \n     access to the Internet as well as the demand for and the \n     methods of such access. How these technological and market \n     changes will ultimately affect state and local tax revenues \n     is\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\n     unclear, but for the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes \n     that over the next five years, these effects will largely \n     offset each other, keeping revenues from taxes on Internet \n     access within the current range.\n     The grandfather clause\n       The primary budget impact of this bill would be the revenue \n     losses starting in October 2006--resulting from eliminating \n     the grandfather clause that currently allows some state and \n     local governments to collect taxes on Internet access. While \n     there is some uncertainty about the number of jurisdictions \n     currently collecting such taxes--and the precise amount of \n     those collections--CBO believes that as many as 10 states \n     (Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South \n     Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin) and several \n     local jurisdictions in Colorado, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, \n     Washington, and Wisconsin are currently collecting such taxes \n     and that these taxes total between $80 million and $120 \n     million annually. This estimate is based on information from \n     the states involved, from industry sources, and from the \n     Department of Commerce. In arriving at this estimate, CBO \n     took into account the fact that some companies are \n     challenging the applicability of the tax to the service they \n     provide and thus may not be collecting or remitting the taxes \n     even though the states feel they are obligated to do so. Such \n     potential liabilities are not included in the estimate.\n       It is possible that if the moratorium were allowed to \n     expire as scheduled under current law, some state and local \n     governments would enact new taxes or decide to apply existing \n     taxes to Internet access during the next five years. It is \n     also possible that some governments would repeal existing \n     taxes or preclude their application to these services. \n     Because such changes are difficult to predict, for the \n     purposes of estimating the direct costs of the mandate, CBO \n     considered only the revenues from taxes that are currently in \n     place and actually being collected.\n     Definition of Internet access\n       Depending on how the language altering the definition of \n     what telecommunications services are taxable is interpreted, \n     that language also could result in substantial revenue losses \n     for states and local governments. It is possible that states \n     could lose revenue if services that are currently taxed are \n     redefined as Internet ``access'' under the definition in S. \n     150. Revenues could also be lost if Internet access providers \n     choose to bundle products and call the product Internet \n     access. Such changes would reduce state and local revenues \n     from telecommunications taxes and possibly revenues from \n     content currently subject to sales and use taxes. However, \n     CBO cannot estimate the magnitude of these losses.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On July 21, 2003, CBO transmitted a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 49, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination \n     Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the \n     Judiciary on July 16, 2003. Unlike H.R. 49, which would \n     eliminate the grandfather clause upon passage, S. 150 would \n     allow the grandfather clause to remain in effect until \n     October 2006. Thus, while both bills contain an \n     intergovernmental mandate with costs above the threshold, the \n     enactment of S. 150 would not result in revenue losses to \n     states until October 2006.\n       Estimate prepared by: Impact on State, Local, and Tribal \n     Governments: Sarah Puro; Federal Costs: Melissa Zimmerman; \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Paige Piper/Bach.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13355-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13355-S13356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Jarred Seth Fontenot\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of SSG \nJarred Seth Fontenot of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nInfantry Division, out of Fort Carson, CO. Sergeant Fontenot was killed \nlast Thursday in an engagement with insurgents in Baghdad. He died of \ninjuries from an explosion and small arms fire that rained down on his \npatrol. Sergeant Fontenot was 35 years old, a loving husband, and a \nfather of four.\n  Jarred Fontenot grew up in a family steeped in military tradition. \nHis grandfather, who helped raise Jarred after his parents died at an \nearly age, served in the Army. His two great uncles attended West \nPoint, later joining the Navy and Marines. One of his great uncles died \nin Korea, a place Jarred would later serve.\n  Jarred's family speaks of him as a man who loved his job and who \nembraced the virtues of military service. ``He loved being a soldier,'' \nhis grandmother recalls, ``and he died doing what he loved.''\n  Sergeant Fontenot was on his second tour in Iraq, on a mission to \nhelp bring security and stability to a region torn by violence and \ntragedy. Every day, he and his unit put themselves in harm's way to \ngive Iraqi citizens a chance at a society governed by the rule of law, \nfree from the threats of sectarian strife, terrorism or autocratic \nrule. He served bravely and was highly decorated, earning the Overseas \nService Ribbon, the Parachute Badge, and the Army Commendation Medal, \nan honor bestowed upon those who have distinguished themselves by their \nservice and acts of heroism.\n  Between deployments, Jarred devoted himself to law enforcement in his \nhometown of Port Barre, LA. On his days off, he would volunteer his \nexpertise and his time to help his fellow peace officers. Needless to \nsay, he earned the respect and appreciation of those with whom he \nserved.\n  Mr. President, how can we properly honor the deeds of a man such as \nJarred Fontenot, so devoted to his country, his family, and to those \nwith whom he served? No words can match the magnitude of his virtue.\n  Pericles, the great Athenian general, suggested that we honor the \nsacrifices of soldiers like Jarred Fontenot by reflecting not only on \nhis life and loss, but also on the rewards that he and other soldiers \nhave delivered to the nation for which they fought.\n  At a funeral oration to honor soldiers who had died in one of the \nfirst battles of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles told the crowd that:\n\n       Any one can discourse to you for ever about the advantages \n     of a brave defense, which you know already. But instead of \n     listening to him I would have you day by day fix your eyes \n     upon the greatness of Athens, until you become filled with \n     the love of her; and when you are impressed by the spectacle \n     of her glory, reflect that this empire has been acquired by \n     men who knew their duty and had the courage to do it, who in \n     the hour of conflict had the fear of dishonor always present \n     to them, and who, if ever they failed in an enterprise, would \n     not allow their virtues to be lost to their country, but \n     freely gave their lives to her as the fairest offering which \n     they could present at her feast.\n\n  In this Chamber, the greatest deliberative body in the world, I ask \nthat we honor Sergeant Fontenot by fixing our eyes on those freedoms \nwhich, for more than two centuries, have endured and prospered in this \nChamber and across America. Our freedom of speech, our freedom of \nassembly, our freedom of self-determination, our freedom from tyranny \nand violence--these are the rewards that the American soldier has \ndelivered, generation after generation, to a grateful and humble \nnation. So long as the United States remains a beacon for freedom, \ndemocracy, and justice, their sacrifices will never be forgotten.\n  To the family of SSG Jarred Fontenot--to his wife, Dana, his four \nchildren, to his grandparents Charles and Dorthy, and to his sister--I \nknow of no words that can describe or assuage the pain you feel. I pray \nthat in time you can find comfort in the knowledge that Jarred was \ndoing something he truly loved, of which he was extraordinarily proud, \nand for which his country is eternally grateful.\n  ``For where the rewards of virtue are greatest,'' Pericles reminded \nthe departing Athenian crowd, ``there the noblest citizens are enlisted \nin the service of the state.'' Jarred Fontenot was among the noblest of \nour citizens. May his legacy endure in the strength of our democracy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another 2 months have passed, and more \nAmerican troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nis only right that we take a few moments in the U.S. Senate to honor \nthem. Outside my office here in Washington, we have a tribute called \n``Faces of the Fallen.'' Visitors to the Senate from across the country \nhave stopped by the memorial. I encourage my colleagues to come see \nthis tribute on the third floor of the Hart Building.\n  I last came to the Senate floor to honor our fallen troops in early \nAugust. Since that time, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 182 \ntroops in Iraq and in Operation Enduring Freedom, including in \nAfghanistan. They will not be forgotten. So today I will read their \nnames into the Record:\n\n     PO3 Mark R.

Mr. President, I voted, yesterday, in favor of the Ensign \namendment to deny credit toward Social Security benefits claimed in \nviolation of the Social Security Act. This would deny benefits to \npeople, including undocumented workers, who have, in the words of the \nact, ``willfully, knowingly, and with the intent to deceive used false \nSocial Security numbers.''\n  The Ensign amendment was more carefully focused on denying benefits \nbased on illegal use of a fake Social Security number, unlike previous \nEnsign amendments which I did not support.\n  Yesterday's Ensign amendment requires the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity to deny Social Security benefits for work performed by any \nindividual using a Social Security account number which was not his, in \nviolation of section 208 of the Social Security Act at 42 U.S.C. 408.\n  The Ensign amendment was adopted yesterday by the Senate.\n  This amendment differs from a previous amendment offered by Senator \nEnsign in the 109th Congress, which could have harmed senior citizens \nand other individuals who may have made an honest error.\n  That amendment was rejected by the Senate.\n  In July of 2007, Senator Ensign proposed an amendment to the College \nCost Reduction Act which could have\n\n[[Page S13357]]\n\nled to a highly unfair loss of benefits to naturalized citizens or \nothers who are legally present. The provisions of that amendment would \nhave posed great problems because it would have denied Social Security \nbenefits to legally naturalized citizens, for instance, unless the \nSocial Security Administration could affirmatively determine that the \nindividual was legally authorized to work. This amendment would have \nplaced an unmanageable burden on the Social Security Administration and \nseniors who have been legally present for decades, who could have \nunfairly lost their benefits.\n  This amendment also failed in the Senate.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the Social Security Administration, SSA, is \ncurrently facing nothing short of a crisis when it comes to processing \ndisability claims. Indeed, SSA Commissioner Michael Astrue has called \nthis issue his agency's most pressing challenge. Currently, there are \nover 756,000 individuals who are waiting for a hearing to have their \nclaims adjudicated, and the average wait time is a staggering 512 days. \nThat is the longest amount of time in SSA's history. In contrast, in \n2001, disability applicants had to wait an average of 308 days for a \nhearing. While that was still far too long, individuals now have to \nwait 66 percent longer. Sadly, some people have died waiting for a \nhearing.\n  To help the SSA process disability claims more quickly, I was proud \nthat, yesterday, the Senate voted 88 to 6 to approve an amendment to \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act that Senators Bingaman, Baucus, and \nI offered to increase funds dedicated to the agency's administrative \ncosts by $150 million. We believe that this added funding will help the \nSSA reduce its disability backlog and enable individuals to access the \nbenefits to which they are entitled and need for their basic living \nexpenses. Because of the financial strains on applicants and their \nfamilies, it is simply unconscionable to have individuals waiting for \nupwards of 2 years before they receive ruling on their disability \nclaims. We can and must do better--it is our moral obligation.\n  Although I strongly believe that providing the SSA with additional \nresources is warranted, I would like to thank the two managers of the \nLabor-HHS bill--Senators Harkin and Specter--for working so hard to \nincrease funding for the SSA and for supporting our amendment. It is \nnotable that the underlying bill they brought to the Senate floor would \nhave provided $9.72 billion for the SSA in fiscal year 2008, an \nincrease of $426.4 million over fiscal year 2007 and $125 million over \nPresident Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget.\n  The fact is that we have underfunded the SSA for years and must begin \nto reverse this trend. Indeed, according to SSA data, one reason wait \ntimes for disability hearings have risen so precipitously is that \nbetween fiscal years 2001 and 2007, Congress provided on average $150 \nmillion less than President Bush requested for the agency. At the same \ntime, Congress gave SSA more work, including the responsibility to \nreview Medicare beneficiaries' income and determine whether they should \nbe charged higher premiums or if they are eligible for assistance to \npay for premiums and fees in the Medicare prescription drug program. I \nwould note that last year, Congress had to include an additional $36.6 \nmillion in the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution just to prevent \nthe agency from furloughing each of its employees for 10 days, as well \nas close offices around the Nation.\n  Finally, I would also like to thank the Senate for unanimously \nadopting a second amendment on Monday that I offered to require the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, to evaluate the SSA's plan to \nboth reduce the disability hearing backlog and improve disability \nbenefits processing. Senators Harkin and Specter presciently asked for \nthe SSA to produce this report when the Appropriations Committee \napproved the underlying Labor-HHS bill. Commissioner Astrue submitted \nhis Agency's plan to Congress on September 13.\n  I believe it would be extraordinarily useful for GAO to look at the \nSSA's plan and make recommendations to make it even more effective. The \nbottom line is that we know that it is crucial that we ensure that the \nplan to rectify problems of disability processing will be productive. \nWhile the SSA has been among our most efficient agencies, this GAO \nevaluation will help ensure that the plan put in place will best use \nthe funds we are acting to provide.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I hope that conferees will retain the two \nSSA administrative costs amendments the Senate adopted so resoundingly \nthis week in the forthcoming Labor-HHS conference report, so that \nPresident Bush may sign them into law. This Nation's disabled deserve \nnothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13357-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13357-S13358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to bring the attention of the \nSenate to a provision of the fiscal year 08 Defense Authorization Act, \nnow in conference. Section 3122 of the bill undermines the Senate's \nposition on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, without \nthe benefit of neither the historical treaty consideration process nor \na senous policy debate.\n  It has been 9 years since the CTBT was the subject of any \ndeliberation by the Senate, which ultimately concluded that its \nratification was not in the Nation's interests. There were numerous \nobjections that proved determinative then and remain true today.\n  First, the U.S. deterrent cannot be maintained without testing. U.S. \nnuclear weapons have the highest average age of any in the world. Some, \nlike the W-76 warhead, the backbone of the submarine-based component of \nour nuclear triad, date back to 1966, making them more than four times \nas old as the average American car.\n  Given the high average age, now at its highest point in the six \ndecade history of nuclear weapons, they require substantial, ongoing \nmodification if they are to be maintained as a viable deterrent. As the \nthen-Director of Sandia National Laboratories, Dr. C. Paul Robinson, \ntestified to the Senate, ``To forego validation through testing is, in \nshort, to live with uncertainty.'' We cannot afford uncertainty when it \ncomes to the reliability, safety, and credibility of our most important \nweaponry.\n  Some believe that the reliable replacement warhead, RRW, can be \ndeveloped and introduced without underground testing. Even if that \njudgment proves correct, it will be many years before we no longer need \nto rely on the older designs in the current arsenal for deterrence. As \nthe administration noted in a recent statement by Secretaries Bodman, \nGates, and Rice, ``delays on RRW also raise the prospect of having to \nreturn to underground nuclear testing to certify existing weapons.'' \nBut, underground testing would be an option permanently denied to the \nUnited States through ratification of CTBT as section 3122 endorses.\n  This permanent loss of the testing option would be even more \nproblematic if we need to continue to rely on these aging designs for \ndecades more as we would if current plans, including those passed by \nthe House and proposed in the Senate, that eliminate RRW funding are \nnot rejected.\n  Further, the cuts proposed to RRW compound the impact of current \nplans to cut more than $500 million in funding for the nuclear weapons \ncomplex that supports, maintains, and refurbishes the weapons currently \nin the complex. These proposed cuts to RRW and the nuclear weapons \ncomplex have been rejected by individuals of great authority, including \nSecretaries Kissinger and Schultz, and Dr. Sidney Drell.\n  The second reason the Senate rejected the treaty in 1999, and would \ndo so again today, is that the treaty is not verifiable. Militarily \nsignificant covert nuclear testing can--and almost certainly will--be \nconducted at low yields or in other ways aimed at masking the force of \nan explosion.\n  Assistant Secretary Paula DeSutter of the State Department's Bureau \nof Verification, Compliance, and Implementation recently made this \npoint. She stated that the International Monitoring System set up to \nmonitor compliance with CTBT is ``aimed to detect detonations over 1 \nkiloton; smaller or concealed detonations are less likely to be \nidentified. Evasion techniques can easily reduce the signature of a \nnuclear explosion by factors of 50 or 100.''\n  Third, CTBT's unverifiability means a ban will not have uniform \neffects.\n\n[[Page S13358]]\n\nOur inability under CTBT to monitor the state of foreign nuclear \nweapons programs effectively means that hostile or potentially hostile \ncountries will be able to modernize their weapons even as the U.S. \narsenal steadily degrades. As a result, the long-term effect of CTBT \naccession would translate into the inevitable, if gradual, unilateral \ndisarmament of our Nation's deterrent.\n  Fourth, CTBT would damage the struggle against proliferation. On the \none hand, the inherent unverifiability of the CTBT can be expected to \nencourage rogue state regimes to believe they could pursue nuclear \nweapons programs with impunity. On the other, the attendant erosion of \nour deterrent would mean that allied countries--notably, Japan, Taiwan \nand perhaps South Korea--that currently rely on the U.S. deterrent \n``umbrella'' would be more likely to develop their own nuclear weapons.\n  As Dr. James Schlesinger remarked in testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee in 1999, ``the chief barrier to proliferation in \nthese last 55 years since Hiroshima has been confidence in the \nprotection offered by the American deterrent. It is the reason, quite \nsimply, that nations like [South] Korea or Japan, or more complicated, \nin the case of Germany, have not sought nuclear weapons. Because of the \nNATO agreement, because of the Japan Treaty, because of our agreements \nwith the Koreans, they have not felt the necessity of taking that final \nplunge. As confidence on their part in the U.S. deterrent wanes over a \nperiod of . . . years, what is the likelihood that those nations will \nrefrain from seeking nuclear weapons? I think that it is very modest.''\n  Finally, the Senate rejected the CTBT in 1999 because it realized \nthat the Stockpile Stewardship Program, SSP, is a ``crap-shoot,'' as \nTroy Wade, a retired Department of Energy nuclear scientist, referred \nto it in his testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations in \n1999. It remains doubtful whether the SSP, supported by CTBT advocates \nas a substitute for nuclear testing, can adequately meet the \nmaintenance and refurbishment needs of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. As a \nresult, it will become ever more likely that dangerous anomalies in our \nweapons will pass unnoticed.\n  Despite these abiding concerns and the Senate vote in 1999, the 2008 \nDefense authorization bill would put the Senate on record in support of \nCTBT's ratification without hearings or debate. How can new Senators--\n37 since 1999--be expected to have reached such a conclusion?\n  Preordaining the ratification of a treaty, as is done in section 3122 \nof this bill, does a disservice to the Senate's history of thoughtful \nconsideration of treaties proposed for ratification, especially when \nthe treaties were on issues with the gravity of the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't reference the comments of Secretary of \nState Rice in a recent letter. She stated that the administration does \nnot support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and ``does not \nintend to seek Senate advice and consent to its ratification.''\n  I also call the attention of the Senate to the Statement of \nAdministration Policy on this bill which states strong opposition to \nsection 3122 due to its dangerous implications for the reliability of \nour nuclear deterrent.\n  Mr. President, I note that these are not simply the concerns of this \nSenator. The letter I will ask to have printed in the Congressional \nRecord makes clear that 40 of my fellow Senators share many of these \nconcerns about the CTBT and the unprecedented approach taken by this \nbill. My colleagues recognize as I do that since the reasons for the \nrejection of this treaty in 1999 have not changed, neither should the \nSenate's position.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I \njust referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2007.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: One of the Senate's most important \n     national security debates of the last decade was whether to \n     ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). In \n     the end, following a rigorous and thorough debate, 51 \n     Senators voted to reject the CTBT, 17 more than necessary to \n     assure its defeat.\n       The principal reasons the Senate rejected the CTBT were its \n     lack of verifiability, adverse effect on the safety and \n     reliability of our nuclear stockpile, and potential to \n     increase nuclear proliferation.\n       We are not aware of any congressional hearings on this \n     treaty since its rejection in 1999. The total absence of \n     discussion in the more than eight years since its rejection \n     belies the assertion in section 3122 of S. 1547 that the CTBT \n     now should be ratified. Moreover, the 37 Senators who have \n     joined the Senate since this treaty was rejected deserve to \n     have the benefit of a careful and measured review of this \n     treaty. There is no basis on which they can conclude that \n     CTBT should be ratified.\n       The Constitution of the United States invests an \n     extraordinary responsibility in the Senate to provide \n     measured and thoughtful review of treaties when submitted by \n     the President for our consideration. The Senate has not had \n     the opportunity for such review since 1999. In a recent \n     letter, Secretary of State Rice stated that the \n     Administration does not support the Comprehensive Nuclear-\n     Test-Ban Treaty and ``does not intend to seek Senate advice \n     and consent to its ratification.'' The Statement of \n     Administration Policy on S. 1547 likewise states strong \n     opposition to section 3122 due to its dangerous implications \n     for the reliability of our nuclear deterrent.\n       Under all of these circumstances, we believe it denigrates \n     the serious role of the U.S. Senate to claim in section 3122 \n     to express the ``sense of the Congress'' that the CTBT should \n     be ratified.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon Kyl, John McCain, Johnny Isakson, James Inhofe, Mike \n           Crapo, Wayne Allard, Jeff Sessions, Michael B.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Moosehead \nManufacturing Company, a small firm in Monson, Maine, that will soon be \nreopening its doors. For 60 years, Moosehead Manufacturing had been a \nthriving business that exemplified the quality of Maine production. \nUnfortunately, after facing tough challenges from the global economy \nearlier this year, Moosehead ceased production. With the help of new \ninvestors, the company recently announced that it will recommence \nproduction and hire 40 employees in Monson, continuing its legacy of \nproviding quality furniture to the State of Maine and beyond.\n  Moosehead Manufacturing specializes in producing exceptional Maine-\nmade furniture. The company prides itself on the durable and hand-\nfinished aspects of its products, which it offers to consumers at \ncompetitive prices. Not only does Moosehead Manufacturing provide \nvaluable employment opportunities, it procures all of its production \nresources from within the State, helping Maine's economy. The furniture \nis built from hardwoods harvested from neighboring forests, cut in \nMoosehead's own saw mills, and dried in its own kilns. Moosehead has \nbeen described as ``an amazing corporate citizen'' by Tom Lizotte, a \nPiscataquis county commissioner.\n  Moosehead Manufacturing was founded in 1947 by the Wentworth family. \nAt its peak of production in the late 1990s, it was the largest \nprivately owned furniture factory in New England, employing about 250 \nworkers. Recently, increasing imports of cheap, foreign-made furniture \nhave threatened Moosehead's business. In 2003, Moosehead Manufacturing \njoined a group of furniture makers nationwide in petitioning the \nGovernment to place duties on some of the furniture that China imports \nto the United States. I echoed their sentiments in a letter I sent to \nSecretary of Commerce Evans stating my deep concern with the impact \nChinese imports were having on\n\n[[Page S13359]]\n\nthe small and midsized American companies fighting to compete. The \nproblem reached a climax when Moosehead announced its closure in \nFebruary 2007. The communities of Monson and Dover-Foxcroft, where the \ncompany maintained its factories, were dealt great blows with the loss \nof nearly 130 jobs. And while I was disappointed that Moosehead was \nforced to shut down its facilities, I fully supported trade adjustment \nassistance funds to workers who lost their jobs.\n  However, three new buyers recently stepped forward to save Moosehead \nManufacturing: Joshua Tardy, the minority leader of the Maine House of \nRepresentatives; Dana Connors, president of the Maine State Chamber of \nCommerce; and Ed Skovron, a financier from Rhode Island. Under the \ncontinued management of John Wentworth, Moosehead will soon resume \nproduction in Monson, much to the relief of Piscataquis County, and \nwill return to making longlasting furniture in which Mainers can take \npride.\n  Moosehead Manufacturing's reopening is exciting for the economic \nprospects of both Monson and Maine. Not only does it provide necessary \nemployment opportunities, but it also sets a precedent for continued, \nMaine-based manufacturing established on quality and durability in the \nface of an increasingly competitive global market. I wish the owners \nand employees of Moosehead Manufacturing Company continued success in \nthe coming years. I look forward to its exciting return to Maine's \nbusiness scene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13359-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. EILEEN SCHMITT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, at the end of this year, Dr. Eileen \nSchmitt, a friend and fixture in our Wilmington community, is retiring, \nand I want to share her inspirational story because there is much all \nof us can learn from her.\n  As we debate health care, again, and again, and again in this \nChamber, Dr. Schmitt has lived the life Mother Teresa called for when \nshe said: Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.\n  A talented medical doctor who rose to become president and chief \nexecutive officer of St. Francis Hospital, she walked away from her \nfancy title and big desk in 2001 to do her true calling, healing the \npoorest in our community. She became the medical director for the St. \nClare Medical Van, making her rounds in a mobile van to provide free \nhealth care to those who have no insurance.\n  The van pulls up, and there may be 20 people waiting--some earn \nminimum wage, some don't have a job, some are homeless, many are \nchildren--and she asks for no money, no insurance. She just sees to \ntheir medical needs.\n  As part of her work, she arranges for doctors to donate their time, \nand launched drives to create a pharmaceutical fund for prescription \nmedicines for her patients. If funds are low or a patient needs \nsomething right away, she buys it herself. That is the type of person \nshe is.\n  And in her spare time, you can find her teaching her patients \nEnglish, and bringing clothes to the families she visits.\n  When someone asked her why she does it, she explained:\n\n       When I first went into medicine, I wanted to do missionary \n     work. I think getting back to taking care of people--\n     especially people who don't have the means to get medical \n     care--helps to fulfill my initial calling.\n\n  The acts of love and compassion she provides every day may seem small \nin our prosperous country of 300 million people, but America would be \nmuch less of a Nation were it not for Dr. Schmitt.\n  Her patients call her their angel, and indeed she has been one to \nthem. But she also is an inspiration to all Americans, reminding us \nthat small acts, one person at a time, touch and change our \nneighborhoods.\n  I know Senator Carper, Congressman Castle, and all my colleagues \nthank Dr. Schmitt and wish her happiness and health as she \nretires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13359-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING GEORGE F. POTARACKE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \ncongratulate Mr. George F. Potaracke on his retirement from the \nWisconsin Board on Aging and Long Term Care, where he has served as \nexecutive director since 1981.\n  Mr. Potaracke has been with the Board on Aging and Long Term Care \nsince its inception in the early 1980s and was selected as its first \nexecutive director. Under his leadership, the Board on Aging and Long \nTerm Care has grown from an agency of only 3 employees to an agency of \n30 employees with offices throughout the State.\n  Along with his duties as executive director of the Board on Aging and \nLongterm Care, Mr. Potaracke directs the Wisconsin Medigap hotline, \nwhich provides counseling services for Medicare beneficiaries in \nWisconsin. He is the treasurer of the National Citizens Coalition for \nNursing Home Reform and an adviser to the National Health Policy \nCouncil and the Aging Leadership Council. He has served as president of \nthe National Association of State Long Term Care Programs and leads \nfundraising efforts for this organization.\n  In addition to his work on behalf of seniors, Mr. Potaracke is \nactively involved with the national Human Rights Campaign, the AIDS \nSupport Network of Southern Wisconsin, Frontier Men of Dane County, and \nthe New Harvest Foundation, where he chairs fund-raising efforts.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Potaracke has dedicated himself to a wide \nrange of aging services. As chair of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, I have had the distinct privilege of working with Mr. Potaracke \non a variety of issues and hold his opinion in the highest regard. He \nis nationally recognized as an advocate for our aging population and \nhas truly made a difference on behalf of all seniors.\n  On behalf of our State and Nation, I thank Mr. Potaracke for his \nservice and wish him good health, happiness, and prosperity for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13359-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO WALGREENS' 6000TH STORE IN NEW ORLEANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Walgreens, a leading national \ndrug store chain, is today hosting a celebration for the opening of its \n6,000th store, which is located in New Orleans, LA. I am thrilled that \nfor this milestone the company has chosen my hometown, which is \nenduring a long recovery from Hurricane Katrina.\n  The greater New Orleans area is one of Walgreens' oldest and most \ndistinct markets. The first store in the region opened in 1938, and the \nnew store in the historic Carrollton neighborhood is the city's 48th. \nThe company currently employs nearly 1,400 people in the area who serve \nthousands of patients and customers every day. Walgreens will become a \nwellness resource for Carrollton residents, some of whom have \nunderserved health care needs.\n  In honor of the grand opening, Walgreens is today offering free blood \nglucose screenings in every New Orleans store to drive greater \nawareness of the diabetes epidemic and get more people on the path to \nprevention or early detection and treatment.\n  The Walgreens wellness tour bus will also travel to locations \nthroughout the area today to provide a variety of tests, including \ncholesterol, blood pressure, bone density, and body mass index for \nindividuals who otherwise may not have access to basic health \nscreenings.\n  Immediately following Katrina, 74 Walgreens stores had to close \nbecause of physical damage and loss of power. It was the most \nsignificant operational challenge in the company's 106-year history. \nMore than 700 Walgreens employee volunteers traveled from across the \ncountry to help with recovery efforts, filling hundreds of thousands of \nemergency prescriptions and providing vital supplies to evacuees. \nWalgreens was one of the first retailers to reopen, proving New Orleans \nwas on the road to recovery. I am grateful for their great help to our \nregion during the extremely challenging days following the storm and \nthe flood that followed.\n  Through its investment, Walgreens is demonstrating its continued \ncommitment to our great city and region. By next summer, Walgreens will \nhave more stores in the New Orleans area than it did prior to the \nhurricane. I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Walgreens and \nNew Orleans for this longstanding and growing relationship.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13360-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13360]]\n          IN MEMORY OF DELAWARE STATE SENATOR JAMES T. VAUGHN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this month James T. Vaughn, \na long-time State Senator who was a legend in Delaware, passed away, \nand I want to pay tribute to him.\n  Jim spent a lifetime in public service, enlisting in the Marine Corps \nduring World War II; serving as a Delaware State Police trooper for two \ndecades and as the State Corrections Commissioner; and entering our \nState Senate 27 years ago.\n  His seniority put him in powerful positions either as the chairman or \nmember of the committees that oversaw budgets, revenues, taxation, \njudiciary, and corrections matters. In other words, he had his hand in \neverything, and most recently that meant establishing a veterans' home \nat Milford.\n  Jim had this tough image, always set in his way, and always an honest \nman, who scrutinized every matter and paid incredible attention to the \ntaxpayers' dollars. Throughout his career no one worked harder for the \npeople of Delaware than Jim Vaughan.\n  His constituents were his No. 1 priority, and last year when he \nbecame ill and was unable to campaign during his re-election, the \nvoters still handily put him in office, recognizing a lifetime of \nresponsiveness to their needs. It set a standard we can all admire.\n  Like this Senator, Jim was a lifetime Yankees fan. And he had a \nspecial place in his heart for Little League baseball. Babe Ruth once \nsaid:\n\n       I won't be happy until we have every boy in America between \n     the ages of six and sixteen wearing a glove and swinging a \n     bat.\n\n  Babe Ruth would have appreciated Jim. For four decades he volunteered \nwith the Smyrna-Clayton Little League, a group he originally helped \norganize. He served as its director, treasurer, equipment manager, and \ngrass cutter--in fact, his wife Sylvia would joke that he loved to cut \nthe grass there, but not at the family home in Clayton.\n  A few times I had the high honor of throwing the first pitch to start \nthe season, and today the Smyrna-Clayton Little League Park is named \nfor Jim.\n  The people of Delaware will miss Jim, and I extend my prayers and \nthoughts to his loving family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13360-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RETIREMENT OF AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL ROGER P. LEMPKE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute \nto one of America's finest military leaders, Air Force MG Roger P. \nLempke, on the occasion of his retirement as adjutant general of the \nNebraska National Guard.\n  The National Guard has been tested by the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan more than any period since World War II. Nationally, it has \nbeen a true test of the Guard to maintain strength at home and abroad \nduring a time of lengthy deployments, mounting casualties, declining \nrecruitment, and a shortage of equipment. Yet, in Nebraska during this \nperiod, under the competent leadership of General Lempke, the Nebraska \nNational Guard has continued to thrive, pulling in record numbers of \nrecruits, increasing retention, and establishing an active family \nsupport program.\n  General Lempke instills confidence, not only in the troops he \ncommands and their families but in the elected officials he serves. \nSince the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, and during the time of \nwar that has followed, we are fortunate to have had his very capable \nleadership as he oversaw the National Guard's changing role into an \nactive duty combat force. The American people have seen vividly that \nthe National Guard is no longer a supplemental force; it serves in \nseamless fashion with the active duty.\n  As past president of the National Association of State Adjutants \nGeneral, General Lempke has been a vocal advocate for the National \nGuard, working with the Pentagon to help shape policies on issues \nranging from base closures to troop strength. A graduate of the Air \nForce Academy, this even-tempered Nebraska farm boy and devoted husband \nand father rose through the ranks to become a respected military \nleader, not only in Nebraska but among his peers nationally. He and I \nhave worked closely together on many projects which benefited not only \nNebraska but helped our Nation's military as a whole.\n  I will miss that close association with the general as our \nprofessional relationship comes to a close, but on a personal level, I \nwill always be proud to call Roger P. Lempke a trusted and respected \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13360-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED IN \nEXECUTIVE ORDER 13413 WITH RESPECT TO BLOCKING THE PROPERTY OF PERSONS \nCONTRIBUTING TO THE CONFLICT TAKING PLACE IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF \n                            THE CONGO--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that \ncontinue to threaten regional stability and was addressed by the United \nNations Security Council in Resolution 1596 of April 18, 2005, \nResolution 1649 of December 21, 2005, and Resolution 1698 of July 31, \n2006, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nforeign policy of the United States.

Res. 355\n\n       Whereas, on October 24, 2007, the legacy of the Little Rock \n     Nine will be celebrated in Boston's Faneuil Hall;\n       Whereas, in Faneuil Hall, abolitionists of the 19th Century \n     publicly attacked the evils of slavery in the United States;\n       Whereas Massachusetts was the center of the United States \n     abolitionist movement and a national leader in providing \n     public education to all students, regardless of race or \n     ethnicity;\n       Whereas abolitionist leader and Newburyport, Massachusetts \n     native William Lloyd Garrison fueled the abolitionist \n     movement through his powerful writing in his newspaper, ``The \n     Liberator'', and fiery public oratory;\n       Whereas the ``Father of American public education'', \n     Franklin, Massachusetts native Horace Mann, advocated for the \n     end of slavery and improved access for all students to \n     quality public education;\n       Whereas, in 1832, Garrison and other abolitionists gathered \n     at the African Meeting House on Boston's Beacon Hill and \n     founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society;\n       Whereas, in 1855, the Massachusetts legislature outlawed \n     segregation in the State's public schools;\n       Whereas, on May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court \n     issued its ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education \n     of Topeka and declared that segregated education was \n     unconstitutional;\n       Whereas many elementary and high schools and colleges and \n     universities throughout the United States continued to \n     enforce a system of educational inequality in\n\n[[Page S13367]]\n\n     which students of color were denied access to their right to \n     a quality public education;\n       Whereas, 3 years after the ruling in Brown v. Board of \n     Education of Topeka, the school board of Little Rock, \n     Arkansas, announced it would implement a gradual integration \n     of its school system beginning in September 1957;\n       Whereas the Little Rock chapter of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People selected 9 outstanding \n     African-American students to attend previously all-White \n     Little Rock Central High School;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1957, those 9 African-American \n     students, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, \n     Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence \n     Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls attempted to \n     enter Central High School;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1957, Arkansas Governor Orval \n     Faubus mobilized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered the \n     armed soldiers to block the 9 African-American students from \n     entering Central High School;\n       Whereas, after a Federal judge ordered Governor Faubus to \n     remove the National Guard, police officers and citizens of \n     Little Rock took up positions at the entrances to Central \n     High School and continued to block the African-American \n     students from entering;\n       Whereas, on September 23, 1957, after learning that the 9 \n     African-American students had successfully entered the \n     school, a segregationist mob gathered at Central High School \n     and the African-American students had to be escorted from the \n     school for fear that they would be killed;\n       Whereas, on September 23, 1957, Little Rock Mayor Woodrow \n     Mann, in a telegram to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \n     appealed to the President to send Federal troops to protect \n     the students and ensure the integration of Central High \n     School;\n       Whereas on September 24, 1957, President Eisenhower ordered \n     the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army to \n     Little Rock and federalized the entire Arkansas National \n     Guard;\n       Whereas, on September 25, 1957, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth \n     Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, \n     Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta \n     Walls walked through the front doors of Central High School, \n     as thousands of White students had done before them;\n       Whereas despite the constant presence of United States \n     soldiers, the 9 African-American students were physically and \n     verbally harassed throughout the school year;\n       Whereas Minnijean Brown, after enduring months of physical \n     and verbal harassment and assaults, was expelled from Central \n     High School for a verbal retort aimed at one of her \n     antagonists;\n       Whereas, at the end of the 1957-1958 school year, Ernest \n     Green became the first African-American graduate in the \n     history of Central High School;\n       Whereas Minnijean Brown Trickery became a prominent social \n     activist and works as a writer and social worker in Ontario, \n     Canada;\n       Whereas Ernest Green attended Michigan State University, \n     later served as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Affairs under President Jimmy Carter, and currently is a \n     managing partner and vice president of Lehman Brothers;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Eckford had a successful career in the \n     same United States Army that protected her at Central High \n     School, raised 2 sons in Little Rock, and now works as a \n     social worker;\n       Whereas Thelma Mothershed-Wair returned to school as a \n     teacher and now volunteers in a program for abused women;\n       Whereas Melba Pattillo Beals is an author and journalist \n     for People Magazine and NBC Universal;\n       Whereas Gloria Ray Karlmark graduated from Illinois \n     Technical College and is a successful computer science writer \n     whose work has been published in 39 countries;\n       Whereas Terrence Roberts is now Dr. Terrence Roberts and \n     teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) \n     and Antioch College and also works as a clinical \n     psychologist;\n       Whereas Jefferson Thomas graduated from Central High School \n     in 1960 and works for the Department of Defense as an \n     accountant;\n       Whereas Carlotta Walls Lanier graduated from Central High \n     School in 1959, attended Michigan State University, and has \n     found success in the field of real estate;\n       Whereas the Little Rock Nine, in brave defiance of \n     segregation, proved that with access to educational \n     opportunity all students are capable of greatness, regardless \n     of race or ethnicity;\n       Whereas the courage of the Little Rock Nine, broadcast for \n     the entire world to see, inspired other students of all \n     colors to take a stand on behalf of tolerance, integration, \n     and equality;\n       Whereas the courage of the Little Rock Nine demonstrated to \n     segregationists throughout the United States that hatred and \n     intolerance were no match for the bravery of 9 high school \n     students; and\n       Whereas, 50 years after the integration of Central High \n     School, all Americans must remain vigilant in order to ensure \n     that every child has access to quality public education, \n     regardless of race or ethnicity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) joins with the people of Massachusetts in honoring the \n     courage of the Little Rock Nine;\n       (2) pledges to advance the legacy of the Little Rock Nine;\n       (3) endeavors to ensure that no American is denied access \n     to education because of race or ethnicity; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to \n     remember--\n       (A) the courage of the Little Rock Nine; and\n       (B) the vital importance of equal opportunity in education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/24/senate-section/article/S13367-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3451.
