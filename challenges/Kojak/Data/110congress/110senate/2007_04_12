Mr. President, last November, the call for change in \nWashington rang out from coast to coast. The Presiding Officer was one \nof the results of that historic vote on November 7, which has been good \nfor the people of the State of Maryland and for the people of this \ncountry. The American people called for us to put partisanship aside in \npursuit of common ground, to end the culture of corruption, to cast \naway the rubber stamp, and, most importantly, to change the course in \nIraq. This Congress has heard that call. As we reach our 100th day, we \nare well on our way to delivering a government as good and honest as \nthe people it serves.\n  From the very first day, we knew all our progress would depend on \nrenewing the people's faith in the integrity of Congress. And just as \nan aside, Mr. President, I would note that while I am not much of a \npoll watcher, it was brought to my attention earlier this week that the \npolls showed the American people are much more supportive of the \nCongress than they were just a few months ago. A lot of that is as a \nresult of what we have been able to do here.\n  Our first order of business was passing the toughest lobbying ethics \nreform legislation in the Nation's history, and we have done that. We \nvoted to give working Americans a much deserved and long overdue raise \nin the\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nminimum wage. We passed a continuing resolution that enacted tough \nspending limitations, and earmarks were eliminated. We passed every \nsingle recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, after they languished in \nthe Congress for years with nothing being done. We passed a responsible \npay-as-you-go budget that cut taxes for working people and invested \nmore in education, veterans, and health care. And I might say that as a \nresult of Senator Johnson being incapacitated for the next few weeks, \nwe were able to pass that budget even though the margin here was 50 to \n49. We had two brave Republicans to join with us on this very sound \nbudget, which we appreciate very much--Senators Snowe and Collins--and \nit was done even though in the past the Republicans couldn't pass the \nbudget with a much larger majority than we have.\n  Yesterday, we passed legislation offering the promise of stem cell \nresearch in a responsible, ethical way, with 66 votes--or actually 63, \nbut three Democratic Senators were unable to be here. They would have \nvoted for that. So 66--1 short of being able to override the promised \nveto of the President. I think it is very possible we will get this \nbill, and it will be the first to override the President's veto. I \nthink we can do that. There must be another Republican who will step \nforward, in a profile in courage, and vote with us and give hope to \nmillions of Americans.\n  In the weeks ahead, we will turn our focus to reducing drug costs for \nsenior citizens. That is going to be a battle because the wealthy, \nstrong, powerful pharmaceutical industry has hired nearly every \nlobbyist in town--those with Gucci shoes and chauffeur-driven \nlimousines--and they have been flooding this Capitol to prevent the \nAmerican people from having the benefit of Medicare being able to \nnegotiate for lower priced drugs. The big HMOs, the health care \nproviders, and the insurance companies can but not Medicare. What does \nthat say? It says the pharmaceutical industry is way too powerful. But \nwe are going to have a shot at it. We will see how much power the \npharmaceutical industry has over the Senate. On this side of the \naisle, they have very little power, but we will see how much power they \nhave over on the other side of the aisle. So we are going to try to \nallow Medicare to negotiate for lower priced drugs.\n\n  We are going to do our very best to develop a new strategy for \nenergy, and we are going to act as quickly as we can to see what we can \ncome up with regarding comprehensive immigration reform. We passed \nsomething here last year. We did it without the help of the President. \nWith the help of the President this year, maybe we can do better. I \ncertainly hope so. He says he wants to help, but actions speak louder \nthan words.\n  All the while, during these first 100 days, as I mentioned, we \nretired the rubber stamp and restored Congress to its rightful, \nconstitutionally mandated role as a coequal branch of Government. The \nBush administration is finally being held accountable for some of its \nfailures--and I say some of them, whether the political manipulation at \nthe Department of Justice, where we learned today that all the e-mails \ndealing with their so-called political computers appear to have been \ndestroyed or hidden--just part of the manipulations of this very \nhistoric Justice Department, and I mean historic in the sense of being \nthe most corrupt ever, the most inept ever. We have also been able to \nlook at this administration for its failures at Walter Reed, the \ndeplorable conditions at Walter Reed, and the tragic mishandling of the \nwar in Iraq.\n  No message was more clear in November than the call for a new \ndirection in Iraq. Yet, in the months that have passed, President Bush \nhas only dug us deeper, deeper in this intractable civil war going on \nin Iraq. Now we hear the Army will be forced to put further strain on \nthe troops by extending their tours of duty from 12 to 15 months. Next, \nthe Marine Corps will have added time to their already strained forces.\n  Today, although you didn't read it in the paper because it happened \nsince the papers went to print, a bridge in Iraq was blown up right in \nthe city of Baghdad, with cars piled up off of that. They do not know \nhow many are dead as a result of that. In the Green Zone, inside the \nIraqi Parliament, a bomb went off today, killing members of Parliament. \nThey do not know how many, maybe only a couple. We don't know at this \nstage. But many were injured right in the Iraqi Parliament.\n  Policing the civil war was never supposed to be the mission, and \nevery day the price we pay grows worse and worse--3,300 American lives \nlost, tens of thousands more wounded, and about $\\1/2\\ trillion spent. \nThat is $\\1/2\\ trillion that could go to health care for the 47 million \nAmericans who have no health care and to look at what we are going to \ndo about the children dropping out of school and to do something to \nprovide monies for the Leave No Child Behind Act, which could help \neducation around our country. This $\\1/2\\ trillion spent, yet no end in \nsight, according to our President, for the troops. More of the same.\n  It takes more than saying we support our troops to make it so, and in \nthese first 100 days, this Congress put words to action. Our emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill gives the troops every single penny \nrequested by the commanders on the ground, plus it gives more than the \nPresident requested. It provides a reasonable, realistic strategy to \ndraw them out from the crossfire of another country's civil war, and it \nprovides funds that the President's budget left out to make right the \nunconscionable situations at Walter Reed and other VA medical \nfacilities, because our troops do deserve that support. The support of \nthe American troops doesn't end when they leave Iraq; it must continue \nwhen they come home to American soil.\n  No single piece of legislation will bring this tragic war to a \nclimax. The American people understand that, but they elected us to \nlead the way, to chart a new course, showing President Bush the way \nforward, and in these first 100 days, we have done precisely that on \nthe war in Iraq and the issues here at home.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to do the very best \nwe can to change the direction at home and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to join our distinguished leader, \nmy friend, Senator Reid, and to thank him and our whip, Senator Durbin, \nfor their leadership and commitment to this body and to the American \npeople.\n  Last November, the American people asked us to do three things: No. \n1, change course in Iraq; No. 2, make middle-class families' lives a \nlittle better; and No. 3, oversee an administration that is out of \ntouch and has had virtually no oversight for 6 years.\n  Over the past 100 days, we have made significant progress. Change, \naccountability, and oversight have become more than words; they have \nbecome our mission. We are demanding the change in Iraq that the \nAmerican people want. The President is ordering us to send him a blank \ncheck to continue to fund a failed policy, no questions asked. In fact, \nanyone who asks questions, their integrity is often impugned. That is \nbecause the President thinks the only way to support our troops is to \nrubberstamp what he wants.\n  We in the Congress are keeping faith with the American people. We \nhave passed a bill that funds our troops and at the same time changes \nour mission from policing a civil war to focusing on counterterrorism. \nWe have worked on resolutions that offer alternatives to the \nPresident's head-in-the-sand policy in Iraq. We have held hearings to \nask\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nthe tough questions that have gone unasked over the past 4 years of the \nwar. We have also made our country safer and more secure by \nimplementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  We have funded homeland security grant programs, improved \ncommunications for first responders, increased information-sharing \namong our intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and strengthened \nthe visa waiver program while boosting civil liberties protections.\n  In the first 100 days, we also passed an increase in the minimum wage \nthat will put real money into the pockets of hard-working individuals \nand families. A minimum wage increase was long overdue. While the costs \nof everyday life continue to rise, wages for the middle class and those \naspiring to be middle class have not kept pace.\n  We passed a bill to open the hope of stem cell research for millions \nof families who suffer from debilitating diseases and, in the first 100 \ndays, Congress has resumed one of its fundamental responsibilities--\noversight of the White House and the administration. From the Justice \nDepartment to the Defense Department, Democrats are asking tough \nquestions that have needed to be asked.\n  On U.S. attorneys, our investigation--not in a partisan manner but \nbipartisan, both parties seeking the truth--continues, and we will work \nuntil we receive every document we need and until we have talked to all \nthe key figures involved, whether they be in the Justice Department or \nthe White House.\n  Already, we passed legislation that will make sure the Senate has a \nsay in the confirmation of U.S. attorneys because we must put the \nfinest people in these positions, not simply cronies. We cannot allow \nthe deprofessionalization of the U.S. attorneys.\n  Our oversight also meant that when major failures were disclosed, \nsuch as the disgraceful treatment of our veterans at Walter Reed and at \nVA centers around the country, we did not let them get swept under the \nrug. We held hearings to get to the bottom of things and it is clear we \nneed accountability from those who were in charge and we need to make \nchanges in our veterans system so our veterans do not fall through the \ncracks again. There is no higher priority than giving our soldiers the \nmedical care they need, and that is why we put over $4 billion in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for veterans health care. When it \ncomes to our vets, money is no object. It never should be.\n  It only has been 100 days, but there are marked changes in the way \nthis Congress is being run. We are not rubberstamping the President's \nfailed agenda, unlike the previous Congress. We have accomplished a \ngreat deal and we know there is a lot more to do.\n  As we move forward, we hope our colleagues across the aisle will join \nus and the vast majority of the American people who are with us in \nforging a new direction for the country, especially when it comes to \nIraq. Let us use the next 100 days to show we support the troops by \nproviding them with the funding they need and the change in mission the \nsituation requires.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we mark the 100th day of the new \nCongress. We have much more to do on behalf of the American people, but \nwe have already accomplished an awful lot.\n  We have heard the American people's call for accountability and \ncompetence in their Government, and we started making those goals a \nreality. We have returned the focus to the rights and interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  As I have commended the members of the Judiciary Committee--and I \ncommend the distinguished Presiding Officer as well as the other \nmembers for their help and active participation in the work of our \ncommittee--I come to the Senate today to thank the majority leader and \nthose Senators who have been working so hard to restore balance to our \nGovernment, protect the liberties and rights of all Americans, and also \nto revive America's leadership in the world.\n  First and foremost, we are making progress restoring the Senate and \nCongress to their proper constitutional role. From the FBI's illegal \nand improper use of national security letters to the politically \nmotivated dismissal of so many of the Nation's U.S. attorneys, there \nare concerns about the competence--but especially the independence--of \nthe Department of Justice. This pattern of abuse of authority and \nmismanagement causes me, and I might say many Republicans as well as \nDemocrats, to wonder whether the FBI and Department of Justice have \nbeen faithful stewards of the great trust the Congress and the American \npeople have placed in them.\n  We need to keep our Nation safe, but we also have to respect the \nrights and the liberties of all Americans. In the previous Congress, \nthe administration sought expanded powers in the PATRIOT Act to appoint \nU.S. attorneys without Senate confirmation and to more freely use \nnational security letters. You know, the administration got those \npowers, and almost immediately they bungled them. They bungled them \nbadly.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, early oversight efforts included our \nJanuary 18 hearing with Attorney General Gonzales. There we examined \nthe change in course of this administration, which had engaged in \nwarrantless wiretapping of Americans, contrary to the law, for years. \nUnder the watchful eye of the new Congress, the President's program for \nwarrantless wiretaps on Americans has been revised, and now the \nGovernment has to seek approval for those wiretaps from the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court--something we have always expected. If \nour Government is going to inspect our papers, our computers, our \nvoices, they should get a court order first.\n\n  We must engage in all surveillance necessary to prevent acts of \nterrorism, but we can and should do so in ways that protect the basic \nrights of all Americans, including the right to privacy. The issue has \nnever been whether to monitor suspected terrorists but doing it legally \nand with proper checks and balances to prevent abuses. The \nAdministration's recent reversal of course was a good first step.\n  Last month we held oversight hearings with FBI Director Mueller, and \nwe called him to task for the longstanding FBI abuses of national \nsecurity letters. The inspector general's report we insisted be \nprovided included troubling findings of widespread illegal and improper \nuse of national security letters to obtain Americans' phone and \nfinancial and credit and other records.\n  Nobody would stand for it if you had somebody--agents--walk into your \nhome in the middle of the night grabbing these records. It is the same \nthing when they grab them electronically.\n  Inspector General Glenn Fine testified there could be thousands of \nadditional violations among the tens of thousands of national security \nletters the FBI is now using, willy-nilly, each year.\n  The inspector general also found widespread use by the FBI of so-\ncalled ``exigent letters.'' These letters, which are not authorized by \nany statute, were issued at least 739 times to obtain Americans' phone \nrecords when there was often no emergency and never a follow-up \nsubpoena, as the FBI had promised. Despite these extensive abuses, the \ntop leadership at the FBI sat idly by for years, doing nothing to stop \nthis practice.\n  We questioned the FBI Director about these matters and reports that \nthe FBI has repeatedly submitted inaccurate information to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court in its efforts to obtain secret \nwarrants in terrorism and espionage cases. It severely undermines the \nGovernment's credibility in the eyes of the Chief Judge of that court.\n  If the people charged with law enforcement in this country don't \nfollow the law themselves, it all breaks down. Every one of us, every \none of the 100 Senators, every one of us are required to follow the \nlaw. None of us--no American--is above the law, but it becomes even \nworse if those who are supposed to enforce the law do not follow\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nthe law. These abuses are unacceptable. Director Mueller now knows that \nand knows these abuses and violations can no longer be continued or \nrepeated.\n  The Judiciary Committee is now in the midst of an investigation in \nwhich we are uncovering an abuse of power that threatens the \nindependence of U.S. Attorneys' Offices around the country. It \nundermines the trust and confidence of all Americans in Federal law \nenforcement. We are examining the mass firing of U.S. attorneys. We are \ntrying to get to the truth of what happened so these abuses do not \nhappen again. I want the American people, all Americans, to have a \nJustice Department and U.S. Attorneys' Offices that enforce the law \nwithout regard to political influence and partisanship. I want the \nAmerican people to have confidence in Federal law enforcement. I want \nour Federal law enforcement officers to have the independence they need \nto be effective and merit the trust of the American people.\n  Sadly, what we have heard from the administration has been a series \nof shifting explanations and excuses and a lack of accountability or \nacknowledgment of the seriousness of this matter. The women and men \nreplaced and whose reputations were then stained by those seeking to \njustify these firings as ``performance related'' were appointees of \nPresident Bush. Several had significant achievements in office and \nglowing performance reviews.\n  As we learn more details about the ousters of these U.S. attorneys, \nthe story grows more troubling. Had we believed and accepted the \ninitial testimony of the Attorney General of the United States and the \nother Department officials, then we would not have gotten to the truth. \nThe White House and the Attorney General dodged Congress's questions. \nThey ducked real accountability for years. In the past, they counted on \na rubberstamping Congress to avoid accountability. The American people \nhave a new Congress, and this is a Congress that asks questions and \nwants the truth, and we will get the truth. The Attorney General has \nadmitted ``mistakes were made,'' but somehow he doesn't say what those \nmistakes were.\n  He will have another chance, yet another chance to tell the truth and \nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth next Tuesday at our Judiciary \nCommittee oversight hearing. The days when he could come by once a year \nand not answer questions are over.\n  I made no secret during his confirmation hearing of my concern \nwhether Mr. Gonzales could serve as an independent Attorney General of \nthe United States on behalf of the American people and leave behind his \nrole as counselor to President Bush.\n  The Department of Justice should serve the American people by making \nsure the law is enforced without fear or favor. It is an oath I took \nwhen I was a prosecutor. That is the oath all prosecutors take, but it \nis an oath the Attorney General has to remember. The Department of \nJustice cannot be turned into a political arm of the White House.\n  Accountability has been lacking in this administration because there \nhas been a ``rubberstamp'' Congress. Loyalty to the President is \nrewarded over all else. That lack of accountability and the lack of the \nchecks and balances that foster it must end, and I hope it has ended. \nWe do not need another commendation for the ``heckuva job'' for those \nwho failed in their essential duties to the American people. True \naccountability means being forthcoming, and it means there are \nconsequences for improper actions.\n  The White House continues to stand by the firings of the U.S. \nattorneys and despite assurances by the President that we would receive \ncooperation, documents and access to witnesses, the White House has yet \nto produce a single document or make any witnesses available.\n  Now we are learning that people in the White House were having ``off-\nbook'' communications by using Republican political e-mail addresses, \nand they say these e-mails have not been preserved. I don't believe \nthat. I don't believe that. You can't erase e-mails, not today. These \ne-mails have gone through too many servers. They can't say they have \nbeen lost. That is akin to saying the dog ate my homework. It doesn't \nwork that way. Those e-mails are there, the White House just doesn't \nwant to produce them. It is similar to the famous 18-minute gap in the \nNixon White House tapes. They say these e-mails have been erased or \nmisplaced.\n  They are there. The White House knows they are there, and we will \nsubpoena them, if necessary, and we will have them because now, when \nthe administration suddenly is facing meaningful oversight, they say \nthey cannot produce the information. They have the information. They \nhave to bring it out and show it to the American people. The \nadministration has worn out the benefit of the doubt. They have \nundermined whatever credibility they had left.\n  The American people are right that they are entitled to full and \nhonest testimony of the White House staff responsible for this debacle.\n  We have asked for administration officials and now former officials \nto cooperate with the Judiciary Committee in its inquiry, and I hope \nthat they will. Through the committee's oversight work so far, we know \nsome of the answers to some of the questions we have been asking, and \nthe answers are troubling. We have learned that most of the U.S. \nattorneys that were asked to resign were doing their jobs well and were \nfired for not bending to the political will of some in Washington. \nApparently, their reward for their efforts at rooting out serious \npublic corruption is a kick out the door.\n  Along with these oversight matters, the Judiciary Committee has taken \nup questions relating to the war in Iraq and congressional authority to \ncondition funding, the plight of Iraqi refugees, the recommendation of \nthe Iraq Study Group on policing and the administration of justice in \nIraq, and contracting fraud and abuse in Iraq.\n  We have examined enforcing our antitrust laws, restoring open \ngovernment by reinvigorating the Freedom of Information Act, ending \nantitrust immunity for insurers, increasing drug competition, \nstrengthening protections against identity theft, and providing for \nfair and comprehensive immigration reform.\n  We have also moved legislative initiatives. Indeed, I think the first \nlegislation passed by the Senate this year was our bill to restore the \ncost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges. We have passed a bill to \namend the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act to honor the \ncontribution of Cesar Chavez and other outstanding Americans. We passed \nby a bipartisan vote of 94 to 2 a bill to repeal that part of the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization that had contributed to the U.S. attorney \nfirings and thereby moved decisively to repeal the Attorney General's \nunlimited authority to appoint so-called interim U.S. attorneys without \nSenate consideration. At long last, we have given final passage to the \nbill against animal fighting that has languished for so many years. And \nwe have passed the Genocide Accountability Act, the first legislative \nresult of the new subcommittee I worked with Senator Durbin to create \nwithin the Judiciary Committee on Human Rights and the Law.\n  I hope that the Senate will soon be considering a number of our other \nlegislative initiatives. We have reported a court security bill, S. \n378; a bill to increase drug competition by giving the FTC authority to \nstop drug companies from paying other companies not to compete, S. 316; \na bill to establish a school loan program for those willing to serve as \nprosecutors and public defenders, S. 442; and legislation to \nreauthorize the successful Byrne grant program for law enforcement, S. \n231. A number of additional items are not far behind, including a bill \nto reauthorize the COPS program, S. 368; and a bill that Senator \nSessions and Senator Landrieu cosponsored attacking fraud in disaster \nand emergency relief funding. I hope to see action on our bill against \nwar profiteering, S. 119, as well.\n  It is a new Congress. It is a new Congress that is off to a strong \nstart in restoring accountability, revitalizing the checks and balances \nof our system, and earning back the public's trust in Government which \nwas eroded during the rubberstamp Congress. Much remains to be done, \nbut we have made meaningful progress in just 100 days.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if my colleague would yield to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I will yield.\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just want to thank our chair and leader \non the Judiciary Committee for the amazing job he has done on the U.S. \nattorney's issue and on so many others. One of the things that has been \nlacking for 6 years in this administration is oversight. There has been \nvirtually none.\n  As to what the chairman of the Judiciary Committee alluded to, in the \nU.S. attorney's area, it has been appalling what has happened, and \nagain with no oversight. It has been on issue after issue after issue. \nSo many of the things that we have begun to uncover, whether it is with \nthe NSA wiretaps, whether it is with the security letters, whether it \nis with some of the other things going on, have been done under his \nwatch.\n  I thank my colleague for his remarks and for the great job he has \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. Of course, he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \none of the most active members we have. He has spent countless hours on \nthis issue. We talk every single day. We have worked together. I have \nbeen so proud of what he has done on that committee. He made my job a \nlot easier.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I would ask \nthat the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4403-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4403-S4406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last month I came to the Senate floor to \nexpress my doubts about the emergency supplemental spending bill put \nforth by the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate.\n  The supplemental was, and still is, a flawed bill that will do little \nto advance the cause of either liberty or victory in Iraq. It is a \npoorly crafted bill that includes language directing the President to \nbegin a phased withdrawal of American troops, essentially tying the \nhands of the Commander in Chief, and signaling to our enemies that this \nis the day on which we will wave the white flag and surrender.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats believe the war in Iraq is a civil war \nbetween Sunni and Shia, and that America has no place in their war. I \nsee the war in Iraq as a war between Islamic fascists and everyone \nelse.\n  Contrary to the belief of many of my Democratic colleagues, we are in \nthe middle of that war, be it in Baghdad, New York, Pennsylvania, Bali, \nLondon, or Madrid. What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfail to realize is that diplomacy and the exertion of military force \nare not mutually exclusive of one another. You can and must have both, \nand they must be effective.\n  But it is naive to think that you can have diplomacy in a vacuum, \nespecially when you are dealing with a country such as Iran, a country \nbent on developing nuclear weapons, increasing its ballistic missile \ncapability, and providing weapons and training to our enemies in Iraq.\n  However, this is all moot because the Democratic leadership on the \nwar supplemental spending bill has been absent these last couple of \nweeks. Here we are, almost 3 weeks after the bill was passed in the \nSenate. There has been no conference of the bill. And the other body, \nthe House of Representatives, has yet to appoint conferees. What are we \nwaiting for? Why are we asking our men and women in uniform to wait?\n  Well, unfortunately, waiting is what our military is going to do. The \nDemocratic leadership has thus far decided to purposefully send a bill \nto the White House that they know will be vetoed in order to set up a \nconfrontation with the President to score political points.\n  I find it ironic that many of the Democrats who are so insistent on \nmicromanaging the war and usurping the power of the President cannot \neven show up and show the requisite leadership to pass an emergency \nbill that funds our troops. Our troops deserve more from this Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues across the aisle will do what is right and get a \nbill passed that the President can sign into law. If you look at what \nthe consequences of us not acting are, it has been very clear. \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates said: This kind of disruption to key \nprograms will have a genuinely adverse effect on the readiness of the \nArmy and the quality of life for soldiers and their families.\n  The supplemental is necessary to pay for training and equipping our \nsoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. If the supplemental is not passed by \nApril 15, the military will be forced to consider the following steps: \nCurtailing and suspending home station training for Reserve and Guard \nunits; slowing the training of units slated to deploy next to Iraq and \nAfghanistan; cutting the funding for the upgrade or renovation of \nbarracks and other facilities that support quality of life for troops \nand their families; stopping the repair of equipment necessary to \nsupport predeployment training; reducing the repair work being done at \nArmy depots; delaying or curtailing the deployment of brigade combat \nteams to their training rotation; this, in turn, will cause additional \nunits in theater to have their tours extended because other units are \nnot ready to take their place; delaying formation of new brigade combat \nteams; implementation of a civilian hiring freeze; prohibiting the \nexecution of new contracts and service orders, including service orders \nfor training events and facilities; holding or canceling the order of \nrepair parts to nondeployed units in the Army.\n\n  These are all things that can result simply because this Congress has \nnot acted in a way that is consistent with what is in the best interest \nof our men and women in uniform who are serving their country in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. It is about the politics of whether we ought to be \nwithdrawing. Of course, as I said, the legislation that has passed both \nthe House and Senate, including time lines for withdrawal, which ties \nthe hands of our Commander in Chief, ties the hands of our generals in \nthe field, sends a very clear message to our troops that we don't \nbelieve in their mission, that we don't believe it is possible for them \nto attain victory. It sends a very clear message to our enemies that on \nthis date certain, we are going to pull out. What does that say to \nthem, other than all they to have do is to wait us out?\n  Irrespective of where you are on this particular war--I know it is \ndivisive in the United States--when it comes to the fundamental \nquestion of making sure our troops have the resources they need to do \nthe job we have asked them to do, to make sure we are supporting the \nimportant work they are doing and giving them the impression we believe \nthey can win and that we want them to win, there is nothing more \nimportant in the Senate for us to be dealing with. I know there are a \nlot of important issues the Senate has to deal with. We have an \nIntelligence authorization bill we are deliberating. We had stem cell \nresearch in the last couple of days. We ought to be dealing with issues \nsuch as immigration and health care and energy, all issues that are \nimportant to the people.\n  I submit nothing is more important than making sure the men and women \nin uniform, serving our country in theaters of conflict, have the \nresources they need to do the job we have asked of them.\n  Meanwhile, while the House is out of session and has yet to appoint \nconferees so even our staffs in the House and Senate could get together \nand begin discussing the differences between the House and Senate bills \nto get a bill to send to the President, which the President can \nsubsequently veto and send back here so we can have an override vote, \nwhich will fail--then we will be right back where we started--the \ntroops don't have any funding. Hopefully, at that point, perhaps, the \nDemocrats in the House and Senate will come to the realization that all \nthese theatrics and shenanigans being played on the floor of the House \nand Senate are not doing anything but sending a message to our enemies \nthat we are weakening in our resolve and not doing what we need to be \ndoing, and that is funding our troops to make\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nsure they have the necessary training and equipment and ability to \nconduct and win this mission we have asked them to complete.\n  The ironic thing about it is, while all this is not going on here, \nthe absence of activity in the Congress where we ought to be \nconferencing the supplemental bill so we can get the process moving \nforward and hopefully get a bill back from the President that will have \nbeen vetoed so we can send him another bill that has funding in it for \nour troops, while all this is not going on in Washington, the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives, while the House is out of session this \nweek in recess, is traveling around the world conducting foreign \npolicy. Where and since when is it the job of the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives to conduct foreign policy, going to other countries \nin the world, particularly countries with which we don't have a \nrelationship, countries that harbor and sponsor terrorist activities, \nmeeting with them to deliver messages from other countries around the \nworld?\n  I know we have a President and Vice President, we have a State \nDepartment and a diplomatic corps, all of which are tasked with that \nimportant job. But the Speaker of the House of Representatives somehow \ndecided she should be the courier of messages between Israel and Syria.\n  It should come as no surprise that the Israeli Prime Minister took \nissue with the Speaker of the House of Representatives conducting \nIsraeli foreign policy as well, not to mention the fact that she didn't \nhave the authority to do it, nor was the message she delivered the \ncorrect message. It seems to me what we ought to be focused on as a \nCongress is not running around the world meeting with leaders who are \naiding and abetting the very people our men and women in uniform are \nfighting against in Iraq but, rather, being in Washington, dealing with \nthe important issue of funding our men and women in uniform who are \ninvolved in a very important mission for the future of our country. I \nknow this is an issue on which this country has great debate. I know \npeople in my State, as in many States, are weary of the conflict in \nIraq.\n  We have in place a new strategy that includes additional troops, a \nchange in rules of engagement, new conditions and benchmarks for the \nIraqi Government, for the Iraqi military. I want to see it work. I want \nto see our troops succeed. I believe a majority of the people want to \nsee our mission in Iraq succeed, knowing full well the consequences of \nfailure will be detrimental and disastrous to the United States and to \nour security in the future. Yet here we are. The Senate is here. We \ncan't conduct a conference because the House of Representatives is not \nin session, nor did they, before they departed for a 2-week recess, \nappoint conferees to the supplemental appropriations bill that would \nenable us to go about this important work.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. About the conference process, when an emergency \nsupplemental is passed, even though it had language in it that I know \nthe Senator opposes, and so do I, it would normally have to go to a \nconference committee of Members of the House of Representatives and \nMembers of the Senate. Sometimes it takes a good while, does it not, \nhistorically, for differences in the House and Senate bills to be \nworked out? It sometimes takes a good while; would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct. The Senator is absolutely right. He well \nknows, anytime the House and Senate act on separate pieces of \nlegislation, it has to go to a conference committee. Differences have \nto be worked out before the conference report can come back to the \nHouse and Senate and be passed and ultimately sent to the President.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Those conference committee appointments are decided by \nthe leaders of the Senate for the Senate conferees and the leaders of \nthe House, the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, would appoint those \nconferees. If it were something they wanted to have done badly, that \nwas high on her agenda, would not they have appointed conferees before \nwe recessed almost 2 weeks ago so the conferees could have begun work \nduring this interim period, staffs could have been working on these \nissues and been ready to move rapidly when the House comes back in \nsession? If they had wanted to, couldn't they have done that?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I serve with my colleague from Alabama on \nthe Armed Services Committee. This is an issue he cares deeply about, \nmaking sure our men and women are well cared for and that they are in a \nposition to do the work we ask them to do. It would make sense--I think \nit is fair to say--that the House, knowing they were going to take a 2-\nweek recess, to appoint the conferees so the important work of the \nconference committee could get underway, so we wouldn't have to wait \nanother several weeks to get this legislation through the conference \ncommittee, ultimately sent to the President, where it is certain to be \nvetoed, so that it has to come back here and start all over again. It \nseems that would be a fair expectation of our colleagues in the other \nbody when it comes to appointing conferees for this important \nlegislation.\n  Having served three terms in the House of Representatives, I had the \nprivilege during those terms to represent my class as a Member of the \nHouse leadership. On a weekly basis, I had the opportunity, under both \nSpeakers Gingrich and Hastert, to be a part of the process. I know how \nmany pressures and how much responsibility comes with the job of \nSpeaker of the House. Our Senate leaders on both sides have a caucus of \nabout 50 people, thereabouts, that they have to deal with. The Speaker \nof the House has a responsibility for making sure that 435 Members of \nthe House of Representatives are moving forward with a legislative \nagenda. There is a lot of responsibility, a lot of pressure. I have \nexperienced and seen firsthand much of that.\n  What I don't understand, however, is where in the job description of \nthe Speaker of the House comes this notion that somehow the Speaker of \nthe House ought to be going out and meeting with Syrian leaders, \ncountries and leadership that are aiding and abetting the people we are \nfighting against, our enemies in Iraq, and trying to conduct foreign \npolicy, representing the interests of one of our allies, the Nation of \nIsrael, and not only misrepresenting their views but, frankly, \nexercising authority that clearly they didn't give her to exercise. I \nam at a loss to explain why we would be here waiting to conference an \nimportant supplemental appropriations bill that will fund the troops \nwhile the leadership of the other body is traveling the world, \nconducting meetings that clearly ought to be in the purview of our \nrepresentation at the State Department and the White House and \ndiplomatic corps.\n  If the Senator from Alabama would like to make some comments on this \nparticular subject, I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from South Dakota. I believe his National Guard \nper capita is one of the largest National Guards in the country. I know \nmine is, both on a per-capita and aggregate basis. We have soldiers in \nIraq right now from our home States. I talked to the mother of a \nsoldier who was recently killed, and this is a painful subject for us \nall. At this very moment throughout Baghdad, Al Anbar Province, \nAmerican soldiers are walking those streets, working closely with Iraqi \nsoldiers, Iraqi police officers, in an effort to create stability so \nthat political agreements can be reached that could lead to a stable \nand successful Iraq. This is an extremely, deeply important matter. Now \nwe are in a situation in which our leader in the Senate, Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, has said they intend to fund our troops. They \nintend to provide the money the President needs to conduct this war, \nbut at the same time they want to tell the generals how to conduct it. \nThey want to say that on a given date we have to move troops in this \ndirection or that direction, and we will begin to bring troops home 4 \nmonths from today, regardless of the conditions in Iraq, regardless of \nwhat the military experts say, without any real thought, if you want to \nknow the truth.\n  I have been to Iraq four times and will be soon going my fifth. Very \nfew\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\npeople in the Senate have been there so often. I submit we don't know \nsufficiently how to direct the deployment of our troops. I don't know. \nWho knows the best? General Petraeus? This is his third full tour over \nthere. He has studied insurgencies and written a Department of Defense \nmanual on how to defeat an insurgency.\n  Who is the best qualified to make these decisions? This is not a \nlittle matter. We voted, over three-fourths of this Senate, to \nauthorize military force in Iraq. Our soldiers are doing what we asked \nthem to do--not what they want to do, what their duty is.\n  A father of a military Army officer told me right out here a few \nweeks ago--his son was about to go to Iraq--he said: Senator, they are \nwatching you like a hawk. Our soldiers over there are watching what we \nin Congress do. They wonder what is going on.\n  They are putting their necks on the line for the policies we asked \nthem to do, and they hear this kind of talk, they hear of this delay. \nWe can't get even the emergency supplemental passed. It is very \ndiscouraging to me. I don't believe this is an action worthy of a \nresponsible Senate. We know this Senate has the power, this Congress \nhas the power to shut off funding for the war in Iraq and bring our \ntroops home immediately.\n  But if we are not going to do that--and the Democratic leader said we \nare not going to do that, we are going to give them the money they need \nunder this supplemental--if we are not going to bring them home, and we \nare going to give them the money, for Heaven's sakes, let's don't \nmicromanage what they do, and let's don't demand commitments from the \nCommander in Chief he cannot agree to.\n  He cannot agree to 100 Senators telling him when and how to deploy \nthe troops. What would General Petraeus think? What would his \nresponsibility be to his general whom he asked to serve, who is \nserving, whom he told would be given responsibility to be successful in \nIraq and bring stability there, with his whole effort focused on that?\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a deep concern that we not get \ninto some sort of game of chicken with the President and the Congress. \nI must say, I am glad the Democratic leaders apparently said last \nnight, after earlier saying no, now they will meet with the President \nat his request to discuss their differences.\n  But it is not just a political game of chicken between the Congress \nand the President; we have soldiers in the field whose lives are at \nrisk this very moment. They need better support than that. Our allies \nneed to know we are not going to be acting in a way this Senate \nresolution suggests. The enemy needs to know we are not going to be \nacting in that fashion, in my view.\n  We have a tough challenge over there, there is no doubt about it. \nGeneral Petraeus committed, at my request, that if he thought what we \nwere doing would not be successful, he would not hesitate to tell the \nCongress and the American people exactly that. I believe he will. Right \nnow, he believes he can be successful. If we allow him to do so, I \nbelieve he will be.\n  Mr. President, I see others on the floor. I conclude by saying I \nbelieve we ought not to be in this posture of brinksmanship over this \nissue. I believe it is irresponsible. I believe it places those \nsoldiers we have sent at greater risk for their lives, and their \nmission is placed in a situation where it would be more difficult to \naccomplish. That is something we should not do. I hope cooler heads \nwill prevail.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Alabama if he will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I agree with \neverything he said. The thing I guess that has troubled me about this \nprocess since the inception of the debate we have had in the Senate, \nthat has been swirling around in Washington for some time, has to do \nwith the way this supplemental bill was constructed and the \nproscriptive language that was put in it relative to tying the hands of \nour Commander in Chief, tying the hands of our generals, essentially \nsubstituting the judgment of politics in Washington for the judgment of \nour generals in the field.\n  I am extremely troubled by that language, as is the President, which \nis why he has indicated he is going to veto this bill when it comes \nbefore him. They knew that. They knew that when it was passed. They \nknew when it went down there, it was going to be an issue which the \nPresident, absolutely, in his constitutional role as Commander in \nChief, could not allow--that type of language and that type of \nrestriction--to be imposed on his ability to prosecute and win wars.\n  But I guess my question to the Senator from Alabama has to do with: \nIf the Senate or the House wanted to stop what is happening in Iraq, \nwanted to withdraw, get our troops home immediately--in spite of the \nfact that under this new strategy we now have more troops there, we \nhave different rules of engagement, we have more buy-in from the \nIraqis; the Iraqis are coming more into the fight; we have an \nopportunity, in my view, at least, hopefully, to have success there--\nwhat is the step the Congress, if they wanted to basically end our \ninvolvement there, could do? Is it not to cut off funding? Would that \nnot be?\n  If the Senate and the House were serious about this, why is it they \nare going about all these shenanigans, trying to provoke this \nconfrontation with the President over this particular language that \nties his hands relative to time lines, when in fact the real \nconstitutional role the Congress has is funding? Is funding not the \nway, if the Senate and the House wanted to be heard on this, they would \ngo about doing that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I could not agree with the Senator more. \nHaving been in the Department of Justice a number of years as U.S. \nattorney and having had a few occasions to deal with this specific \nissue, money not appropriated by Congress cannot be spent by the \nGovernment. In fact, there is an Antideficiency Act that makes it a \ncriminal offense for a governmental official to spend money that \nCongress has not appropriated.\n  So that is our responsibility: to fund or not fund. The Democratic \nleader said they are going to fund. It is not our responsibility to \nmicromanage the war, however. So I would say we absolutely as a \nCongress--if we reach that decision--can shut off funding, and tomorrow \nthe troops would have to be brought home, or shortly thereafter.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Alabama \nbecause I think it is an important point to make--I have heard the \ndebate here a lot, and, again, as it continues in this city and across \nthe country, that there has to be a political or diplomatic solution \nthat somehow we have to reach; the sides have to come together, which I \ndo not disagree with. However, I would also argue, in order for that to \nhappen, you have to have security. You cannot have a functioning \ndemocracy or government absent security; in the last several hours, a \ncouple of lawmakers in Iraq were killed in the Green Zone.\n  How is a government to function, how is a political process to work, \nif there is not adequate security, which is the point I believe many of \nus have made all along. I say to my colleague from Alabama, there has \nto be not only a political solution, but there has to be security \nestablished. That is what this new strategy is designed to accomplish, \nto allow that process to work. We ought to allow this strategy an \nopportunity to work, rather than pass bills out of here that tie the \nhands of the President, tie the hands of our generals, substitute the \njudgment of politicians in Washington for the judgment of our generals \nin the field. Furthermore, we need to get funding to our troops.\n  So I think the Senator from Alabama has put it very eloquently, and I \njoin him in urging the rest of our colleagues in the Senate--and, \nobviously, hopefully, very soon in the House--to get this process \nwrapped up, to get a bill to the President that he will ultimately \nveto, send it back here, start over again, and let's at least get the \nfunding to our troops so we can get this situation in Iraq secure so \nthis political process can function and work and, hopefully, create a \nstable democracy.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to Senator Thune, I agree, and \nwill recall for our colleagues that--I believe it was postelection--\nGeneral Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of the Army,\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\npleaded with us not to allow what happened last year to happen this \nyear. He was referring to delaying passing the supplemental because it \ncauses all kinds of problems.\n  A few weeks ago, he testified again, and he was passionate about \nthis. It is his soldiers, predominantly, Army soldiers in Iraq. He \npleaded with us not to delay this supplemental. He said you have to \ntake money from all kinds of accounts, and time and effort the \nleadership in the Department of Defense needs to be spending helping \nthe soldiers being successful has to be redirected to bringing money \ntogether in ways that are not easy to fund the effort. He described it \nas trying to walk through a marsh waste deep in water--those were his \nwords--in the muck.\n  We are creating a political muck that makes it very difficult and \nadds additional burdens to our Defense Department when they have so \nmany important things to do. We should not do that.\n  I thank the Senator for his eloquent remarks and his leadership on \nthe Armed Services Committee and for his commitment to our soldiers and \ncommitment to the United States of America and the good foreign policy \nwe have had, we seek to accomplish.\n  Our foreign policy is a foreign policy designed to improve the Middle \nEast. It is designed to improve the lives of the people in Iraq. It is \nnot an imperialistic attempt to gain wealth or power at their expense. \nWe want them to be successful.

Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to \nextend my deep appreciation to my good friend, Senator Reid, for his \nvery genuine persistence in pursuing this Intelligence authorization \nbill. He has worked hard, both as minority leader and as majority \nleader, to try to make this happen.\n  I suspect Senator Bond and I will have some fairly strong words to \nsay in agreement about this because I think both of us are very \ndismayed that despite the very considerable efforts of Vice Chairman \nBond and myself--we operate very closely together--to get agreement on \nthis bill, there is still an objection to its consideration, as I \nunderstand.\n  It is almost inconceivable to me we are forced to come to this point \nof cloture and motions to proceed and all kinds of things on a national \nsecurity bill. I do not understand that, where that comes from, why the \nmotivation, how that happens.\n  In any event, we are talking about the authorization bill of the \nIntelligence Committee for 2007; and this is already the period for the \n2008 authorization bill. It is inexcusable. From 1978 through 2004--\nthat is a long time, 1978 to 2004--every year, there was an \nauthorization bill, like every year there is a military authorization, \nArmed Services authorization bill. It happens in all major committees. \nThe Senate had an unbroken 27-year record of having authorization bills \nevery single year. This year and the last year--and I think the \npreceding year--we did not.\n  It is very frustrating to the Senator from Missouri and myself. This \nshould be considered, and is considered, must-pass legislation. It is \nin the national interest. We are in the middle of a war on terror. Our \ncontinued military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan calls for an \nanalysis of what is going on in the intelligence community, putting it \ninto authorization form so it can go on to be discussed and debated on \nthe floor.\n  It is a matter of life and death. But we are being blocked again from \nconsidering a bill that provides the legislative roadmap for America's \nintelligence programs. America is not meant to work that way. Similar \nto the bills I have mentioned, you have to get authorization. It is \ndone routinely. It is very puzzling.\n  Now, there are 16 separate provisions under our 2007 authorization \nbill--we are in the period for the 2008 authorization bill--enhancing \nand clarifying the authority of the Director of National Intelligence. \nThese provisions include improvements to the way we approach and manage \nhuman intelligence, which the vice chairman and I feel very strongly \nabout, information sharing, and the ability to manage intelligence \ncommunity resources. Those are words with a great deal behind them.\n\n  I, like many of my colleagues, have been increasingly concerned about \nthe seemingly endless stream of leaks of classified information. This \nbill includes provisions improving the authority of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, whom we put in charge to look at matters such as \nthese, and the Director of the CIA to protect intelligence sources and \nmethods and a provision to increase the penalties for unauthorized \ndisclosure of the identity of a covert agent.\n  The bill also contains numerous provisions intended to improve \noversight of the intelligence community. We have not been doing that in \nthe sense that we should, and Vice Chairman Bond and I worked very \nclosely together on this issue. He is a ferocious pursuer of \nintelligence wherever he can find it, and he usually manages to bring \nit back with him. Section 408 will establish a statutory inspector \ngeneral for the intelligence community. The DNI, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, has used his power to create an IG, but the \npower to do so doesn't mean a requirement to do so. So we would \nstrengthen that position in this legislation and make it more \naccountable to Congress.\n  Section 434 of the bill strengthens accountability and oversight of \nthe technical intelligence agencies by providing a very important \nmatter: that the heads of the National Security Agency, the National \nReconnaissance Office, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency \nare to be appointed by the President, as they have been but with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. That has not been the case. This is \nan enormous fountain of intelligence, and we think they ought to be \nresponsive to the two Intelligence Committees in the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  My colleagues may be surprised that the head of an agency with as \ncentral a role in the intelligence community as the National Security \nAgency or an agency with the enormous budget of the National \nReconnaissance Office is not appointed with Senate confirmation. It is \nreally shocking. Whether it was an oversight or not, I have no idea, \nbut it is wrong. Senator Mikulski pointed this out. This bill would \ncorrect that.\n  Section 108, cosponsored in committee last year by Senators Levin and \nHagel, seeks to improve the timely flow of information to congressional \nintelligence committees. In other words, things can't be put off for a \nyear or 2 years, 6 months or whatever. We try to enforce our view that \nwe are an oversight group and we intend to be treated as such and we \nwill not be treated in a lesser way. Similar language was included in \nthe intelligence reform legislation that passed the Senate in 2004 and \nin S. 4, which passed the Senate last month.\n  There are requirements for the provision of specific information, \nincluding a report on the implementation of the Detainee Treatment Act \nand a separate report on the operation of clandestine detention \nfacilities. These are not trivial matters, as the Presiding Officer \nunderstands, and they cannot be dealt with trivially by this body, and \ntherefore we need this bill.\n  These provisions are all intended to improve our ability to make \ndecisions\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nleading to better intelligence for the military and policymakers. There \nis no reason the Senate cannot pass the bill and do so quickly so that \nwe can conference with the House and do that quickly so that we can \npass the bill, the authorization bill of 2007, here in April of 2007 \nand proceed on.\n  I will close by saying: I would remind my colleagues that we are at \nwar in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and we are at war in scores--or \npotentially at war in scores of countries around the world where al-\nQaida is strong and growing, or groups such as the Taliban or others \nare growing. We can't have delay. This is an important bill. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for the motion to invoke cloture and \nallow this process to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly join with my new chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, in urging \nour colleagues to work constructively with us in reestablishing \ncongressional oversight of our intelligence community.\n  More than 30 years ago, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nwas formed to address a serious problem, and that problem was \npreviously a complete lack of congressional oversight of the U.S. \nintelligence operations. The attacks of September 11, 2001, and the \nfindings of the 9/11 Commission confirmed that congressional oversight \nof intelligence was still seriously lacking in many areas.\n  With the painful lessons of 9/11 in mind and the threats laid out by \nChairman Rockefeller, it is more important than ever that we perform \nour oversight role. Unfortunately, the last Congress failed to see an \nintelligence authorization bill pass the Senate, although Chairman \nRoberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller tried hard to pass one. There \nwere political reasons--neither side of the aisle was blameless in that \nregard--but it did not happen.\n  When Senator McConnell asked me to be vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee for this session of Congress, I wrote a letter \nwith suggestions to the chairman on the priorities, and at the top of \nthe list was passing the fiscal year 2007 Intelligence Authorization \nAct. Chairman Rockefeller and I strongly agreed that if we were to be \nable to conduct constructive oversight and make our suggestions and our \nrequests and demands known, we would have to pass this bill. We have to \npass authorization bills. We have been in agreement on that matter \nsince the beginning.\n  We have a managers' amendment we will be describing in more detail \nwhich we will offer which addresses some of the serious concerns other \nMembers and I have had for some time, and I would ask anybody who has \nconcerns about the underlying bill to look at the managers' amendment, \nwhich I think addresses most, if not all, of the serious concerns that \nmight be raised.\n\n  We have to reassert our oversight. Now, there may be some officials \nin the executive branch who prefer a lack of congressional oversight. I \nsure understand their positions. If I were running an agency, I \nwouldn't want to have Congress looking over my shoulder. But that is \nnot how the system works. We have a responsibility to provide the \nfunding and oversee how they are carrying out their duties, and I \nsuggest this bill will give us the power to do so and ensure \nconstructive accountability. One of the most significant means of \nproviding such accountability is authorizing the appropriations for the \nintelligence community's national intelligence program, or NIP. For \nthat reason, the authorization of the appropriations section in this \nbill may be its most important section.\n  Is this bill perfect? No. There is no such thing as perfect \nlegislation--I have never seen one, and I don't expect to see one--but \nwe all get an opportunity and will have an opportunity to vote to \nimprove it.\n  The bill, as reported, is largely the same bill as last year and \ncontains many provisions sought by intelligence community agencies to \nhelp them in their job. For example, the bill provides the Director of \nNational Intelligence with additional authorities to improve \ninformation access across the intelligence community. So there can no \nlonger be stovepipes of information not shared among the agencies \ncollecting it. The DNI is given full access to human intelligence and \nthe authority to improve access and coordination across the community.\n  Nearly half of the provisions contained in this bill were requested \nby the intelligence community for fiscal year 2006 and 2007. We are in \nthe process of receiving the IC request for 2008, as it clears OMB. \nWhen we pass this bill, we will have addressed 23 of the 31 cleared \nprovisions that are contained in the IC's fiscal 2008 request.\n  There is also included an example of where our committee wants to \ntake some initiative. The bill creates within the office of the DNI a \nNational Space Intelligence Center--or we may call it an office--to \naddress intelligence collections related to our space assets or threats \nto the United States from space. The need for this office was \nemphasized recently by the successful antisatellite weapons test by the \nPeople's Republic of China. Creating this new office or center is an \nexample of the forward-leaning oversight that corrects a present \ndeficiency within the IC.\n  It is time the Senate reassert its constitutional role in oversight. \nDoes the process have warts? As I said, of course it does, but it is a \ncritical component of our national security.\n  I urge all Senators to work with us constructively to pass the bill. \nWe look forward to hearing from both sides on the amendments they have, \nand maybe we will be able to clear many of them and get this bill \npassed. We ask that Members bring those amendments to us as soon as \npossible.\n  Again, I strongly urge and request my colleagues who recognize that \nintelligence is so important in this global war on terror declared on \nus by al-Qaida and radical Islamists--not a war we started but a war \nthey started, that can only be countered by good intelligence--help us \nget to the process of improving our intelligence community and our \nintelligence performance.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his leadership, I thank the \nChair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4407-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4407-S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATOR TED STEVENS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to honor a colleague and a \nfriend, Senator Ted Stevens, who this week becomes history's longest \nserving Republican member of the Senate. This is an outsized \naccomplishment for a man whose name is virtually synonymous with the \nNation's largest State. Yet no one who ever crossed paths with Senator \nStevens is surprised that he has achieved it.\n  The long list of things he has done for the people of Alaska in the \ncourse of a remarkable 39 years in the Senate traces an arc as vast as \nthe State itself. His love for that State and this country is \nlegendary. This milestone is merely an occasion to recall and retell \nthat legend. As the Republican leader, an admirer, and a friend, I \nwelcome it.\n  It is a story that takes us back to a day when transistor radios were \nnew to the White House and construction workers had just cleared a \nspace in the Bronx for Yankee Stadium. America was changing quickly, \nand Theodore Fulton Stevens would take as much of it as he could.\n  Born in Indianapolis, he moved to Redondo, CA, as a boy and learned \nto surf along the beaches of the South Bay. His pioneering spirit took \nhim to Oregon and Montana for college and then to even more exotic \nplaces as an Army Air Corps pilot in World War II. At 19 years old, he \nwas flying C-46 transport planes over the Himalayas and into China \nsupporting the legendary Flying Tigers. He left the Army after \nachieving the rank of lieutenant and in recognition of his bravery \nreceived a Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal.\n  A decorated war veteran in his early 20s, Ted returned to California \nto resume his studies and later enrolled at Harvard Law School. A \nconsummate tough guy, the man who would one day prepare for tough \nlegislative fights by donning ties that featured the Incredible Hulk \nhelped pay his way through law school by tending bar and selling his \nown blood.\n  After law school, Ted showed up in Washington to practice his trade. \nHe\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nmarried a girl named Ann, and together they set out on yet another \nadventure. With an appetite for risk and a passion for service, Ted \nwould carve a life for himself and his young family out of the vast \nexpanse of the Alaska territory. He would devote the rest of his life \nto helping people there achieve the same rights and privileges that \nthose in the lower 48 took for granted. As a result of decades of work \nin the service of that goal, the name ``Ted Stevens'' would one day be \nsynonymous with an area one-sixth the size of the entire United States.\n  He was there at the creation. As a young lawyer at the Department of \nthe Interior, Ted Stevens stood over a map with President Eisenhower \nand traced out the borders of the 49th State. He returned there in \n1961, started a law firm of his own, and soon won a seat for himself in \nthe Alaska House of Representatives. Four years after that, Democratic \nSenator Bob Bartlett passed away, and on Christmas Eve, the State's \nRepublican Governor chose Ted to replace him.\n  Now, Ted Stevens wasn't well known outside his home State, but \ncurious folks in Washington could have found this brief description of \nhim in Newsweek. Here is how they summed him up:\n\n       Stevens is a 5'6\" cigar smoker who hunts moose and earned a \n     reputation as a scrapper in the Alaska House of \n     Representatives.\n  It was brief, but it wasn't far off. Ted didn't leave his scrappiness \nin Juneau. He would bring it to Washington.\n       A story about the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 \n     illustrates the point. Ted was a first term minority senator \n     at the time, but he was determined to find a way to get this \n     piece of legislation enacted into law.\n       The story goes that Ted was carpooling into work one \n     morning with the Democratic chairman who could make it \n     happen, and he got him to agree to a vote on his amendment \n     that day.\n       Well, the day passed without any action. They called the \n     bill up on the floor, and the thing went through second \n     reading, third reading, and then onto a final vote. No \n     amendment.\n       Ted ran right up to the Chairman and yelled at him right to \n     his face: ``You SOB, you promised me a vote!' Hearing the \n     commotion, the Democratic leader, Mike Mansfield, came over \n     to chastise Ted. Nobody swears in this chamber, he said.\n       But then Ted told Mansfield what had happened, and how \n     important the bill was to his State. Mansfield turned to the \n     chairman and asked whether the story was true. When he found \n     out it was, he took the bill back to a second reading, \n     offered the Stevens amendment in his own name, and the \n     amendment passed.\n       This was just one of the major pieces of critical \n     legislation Ted has fought for on behalf of Alaskans. There \n     have been many others. Ted never tires of fighting for the \n     people of Alaska. But if you ask his staff, they'll say he \n     just never tires.\n       His chief of staff, George Lowe, remembers his first trip \n     to Alaska with the boss. A staff assistant at the time, \n     George was a little taken back when he picked Ted up at 6 \n     a.m. and the Senator had already gone through the briefing \n     book he'd been given the night before, already read the \n     papers, and already been on the phone to Washington for a \n     couple hours.\n       I needed a vacation after doing for two weeks what he'd \n     been doing for 39 years,' he said.\n       After Ann's tragic death, Ted met his beloved Catherine. \n     They would add a sixth child to Ted's brood, Lily, who many \n     of us remember running around the Senate as a little girl.\n       Catherine had to get used to Ted's tenacity early on. The \n     day after their wedding, he agreed to fill in for a colleague \n     on a trip to tout Reaganomics in China. She had never let him \n     live down that ``Honeymoon.''\n       As chief of staff, George says nothing's changed. He's \n     learned to put his Blackberry in the basement when he goes to \n     bed at night, or the boss would keep him up with e-mails.\n       Ted will tell you he works so hard because there's so much \n     work to do. Alaskans don't have the benefit of centuries of \n     infrastructure and planning that much of the rest of the \n     country does. Of the giant State's more than 200 villages, \n     only a handful had running water when Ted came to the Senate. \n     But largely thanks to him, roughly half of them do now.\n       He's tried to make sure that people on the outside \n     understand the challenges. And turning down an invitation to \n     Alaska from Ted Stevens isn't recommended if you ever expect \n     to appear before him at a committee hearing. An entire \n     generation of Federal officials has trekked up there at Ted's \n     invitation.\n       Elaine and I have spent six of the last seven July recesses \n     at the Kenai River King Salmon Classic and, like everybody \n     else who's been there, we never leave without being impressed \n     by two things: the magnificence of the scenery, and just how \n     much of Alaska's progress is a direct result of Ted Stevens.\n       It starts at the airport: Ted Stevens Anchorage \n     International. It runs through the pipeline; the land \n     settlement claims; the double-hulled tankers that move along \n     the shore; and through all the homes in the remotest reaches \n     of Alaska that have radio and television because of Ted. And \n     it continues with his epic battle to open up the Artic \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       `They sent me here to stand up for the State of Alaska,' \n     Ted once said. That's just what he's done. And Alaskans love \n     him for it: on March 22, 2000, the Alaska State Legislature \n     named Ted Stevens Alaskan of the Century.\n       But he's done a lot more for the rest of us besides. Thanks \n     to a remarkable 35-year tenure on the Appropriations \n     Committee, no one has done more for the U.S. military than \n     Ted Stevens. Never one to deny or delay materials or supplies \n     to troops at home or in the field, he's secured funds to \n     continue funding the F-117, to replace Air Force One, for \n     Unmanned Aerial Vehicles like the Predator and Global Hawk, \n     and for a replacement Coast Guard Icebreaker and the F-16 \n     program.\n       He was instrumental in ensuring funds for early military \n     research on everything from breast cancer to AIDS.\n       I remember asking myself when I first arrived in the Senate \n     whether Stevens was ever in a good mood.\n       But I learned, as everyone else who knows him does, that, \n     like Hamlet, Ted Stevens ``speaks daggers but uses none.'' \n     And in this, ``his tongue and his soul be hypocrites.''\n       Those who weren't convinced of this changed their minds \n     during that sad week in September 2003, when we learned about \n     the death of Senator Gordon Smith's son, Garrett. Senator \n     Smith opposed Ted on ANWR, the biggest issue of his life. And \n     a lesser man might have held a grudge. Yet it was Ted who \n     arranged to fly himself and his colleagues in the Senate to \n     the funeral.\n       They say the only way to have a friend is to be one. And \n     Ted's friendship with Senator Inouye, is one of the great \n     models of bipartisanship this building has ever known. We all \n     know the two men call each other brothers. But some might not \n     recall that Ted has actually donaTed money from his own \n     Political Action Committee to Senator Inouye's re-election \n     campaign.\n       How does Ted do all this?\n       He's always looking forward. Thirty-nine years in the \n     Senate, and he doesn't reminisce. He hasn't slowed down a \n     bit. He plays tennis and enjoys fishing. He tries to get in \n     an hour at the Senate gym every day. And when he says he's a \n     fighter, he means it: his staff assures me he still trains on \n     a speed bag.\n       When Ted got to the Senate, he had a motto: ``To hell with \n     the politics, do what's right for Alaska.'' Over the years, \n     he changed that motto, just slightly. Now it's: ``To hell \n     with the politics, do what's right for the Nation.'' But in \n     one of the most distinguished careers in the history of this \n     body, he's done both.\n       The people of Alaska and this Nation are better for having \n     Ted Stevens around. We'd hardly know what to do without him. \n     And in appreciation of his friendship and his noble service \n     to State and country, I honor him today for his historic \n     achievement and wish him many more years of good health and \n     service.\n\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am a proud Democrat. Ted Stevens is a \nproud Republican. People have said, how can you two ever get together? \nWell, as the leader has indicated, we call each other brothers.\n  I know this is a violation of our party rules, but I have contributed \nto Ted's campaign, and he has contributed to my campaign. Last election \nwas one of the most negative and partisan ones that I have ever \nexperienced. The issue was Iraq, as it is today. Ted Stevens came up to \nme and said: You know, this election is sending a bad message to the \nfellows and the women in Iraq. We should send another message. So he \nproposed that we do our very best to pass the Defense appropriations \nbill in a timely fashion unanimously. The record will show that the \nsubcommittee came out and voted unanimously for the Defense \nappropriations bill. The full committee responded by unanimously voting \nfor it, and the Senate, for the first time in history, voted 100 to 0.\n  That is bipartisanship, Mr. President. We have demonstrated that it \ncan be done, and it has been done many times. We have many things in \ncommon, but I think more things uncommon. He represents glaciers; I \nrepresent coconut trees. But we do have many things in common. We \nfought in World War II--he in China with the Flying Tigers, and I was \nin Europe fighting the Germans. We represented territories. So we came \nin as new Members of the Senate, and he and I have received the crown \nof being ``pork men of the year.'' We are No. 1 in add-ons in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to call Ted Stevens my brother. I hope we \ncan\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\ncontinue this brothership for as long as we are here. We have just \ngiven him a new title: the Strom Thurmond of the Arctic Circle.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in recognizing \nSenator Ted Stevens upon this milestone of his serving longer in this \nbody than any other Republican Senator. This is a significant moment \nand our former President pro tempore of the Senate has set an \nimpressive, historic accomplishment.\n  I think this is most significant not because we are recognizing Ted \nStevens for his length of service in this body, but rather because we \nare recognizing what Ted Stevens has accomplished in this institution \nas a U.S. Senator. There are few individuals who can equal his service \nand accomplishments as a true leader.\n  As Alaska's Senior Senator, his steadfast and tenacious advocacy of \nhis State and constituents is widely known. His career transcends \nAlaska's transition from a frontier and U.S. territory to an important \nand vibrant State.\n  After earning his law degree at Harvard University, Ted Stevens moved \nto the heart of Alaska, the Chena River and Fairbanks, where he became \na prosecutor and a U.S. attorney in the early 1950s.\n  Ted quickly became a leader in the statehood movement and in 1956 he \nserved his first assignment in Washington as the Department of \nInterior's legislative counsel and later Solicitor General. He later \nreturned to Alaska and was elected to the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives where he became the majority leader and speaker pro \ntempore. In 1968 he was appointed to fill Senator Bartlett's seat in \nthe U.S. Senate. He was elected to retain that seat in 1970 and has \nbeen a part of this institution ever since.\n  Ted is a forceful and dedicated advocate for the people of Alaska. He \nhas brought about significant economic development, be it clearing the \nway for North Slope petroleum development and the construction of the \nAlaska pipeline, the upcoming natural gas pipeline, countless small \nairports and aviation improvements, or overall basic infrastructure. He \nhas been a tenacious advocate for the Alaskan fishing industry, \nincluding creation of the Exclusive Economic Zone to allow the \nsustainable harvest of the largest and most valuable fishery in the \nUnited States. It is not by chance that the basic law governing \nfisheries in this Nation is called the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  Like most Alaskans, Ted is a true sportsman with a rich appreciation \nfor the unique and special environmental resources of his State. Men \nand women fishing on the Kenai River or trolling off Cape Chacon or \nother waters need just look next to them, through sunshine or inclement \nweather, to see the Senior Senator from Alaska fishing for kings, or \nreds or silvers or halibut.\n  Ted Stevens is an American Senator who has made tremendous \ncontributions to U.S. security policy and defense posture since the \n1960s.\n  Ted Stevens left college to fight in the Second World War. Senator \nStevens served in the Army Air Corps and flew support missions over the \nHimalayas to General Stillwell and our forces in the China/Burma \ntheater.\n  Since 1980, Senator Stevens has served as either chairman or ranking \nmember of the Senate's Department of Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The aircraft, the ships, the missiles, the tanks and \ncombat vehicles, and the weapons systems that are manned by our \ndedicated men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces have been developed, \nprocured and supported under Ted Stevens's steady and pragmatic \nleadership. The training, pay and support of our personnel have been \ncarried out by programs that he championed and shepherded through the \nCongress. The ``operating tempos'' and readiness levels are items of \npersonal interest for him. He is a champion of research and development \nto ensure our Nation's leadership is not diminished, and that America \nremains prepared to take on threats to its national security.\n  As an appropriator, Ted Stevens has often focused on the business of \nnational defense. Like others, he has been a champion of the ``top \nline'' for the Defense Budget, seeking to ensure that national security \nis remains a priority and receives appropriate funding. He has also \ndedicated long hours to ensuring that funds are not wasted and that \npriorities are addressed.\n  Finally, Ted Stevens should be recognized for his work as a \nlegislator in this body. Ted Stevens has authored and championed \nlegislation far too numerous to list. He has left his mark on so many \nlaws, policies and programs that benefit Americans across this Nation. \nFor example, Ted Stevens has played a leadership role in our national \nspace programs, and it was his personal effort that allowed NASA to \nrecover from the Challenger disaster in 1986. He helped create the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has been the \nsponsor or cosponsor of countless significant pieces of environmental \nlegislation. He has championed remote sensing satellites that protect \nour Nation from severe weather and is the author and foremost supporter \nof our Nation's ocean exploration program.\n  Ted Stevens has also left his mark on every piece of \ntelecommunications legislation over the past 20 years. He has put \nforward legislation that provides for our airports and air \ntransportation systems, and terrorism countermeasures. He is a strong \nadvocate for the Coast Guard and has overseen fleet, aircraft, and \nsystem modernization during the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Ted Stevens has been a leader on issues as diverse as reform of U.S. \ncivil service retirement programs, to the rules governing the operation \nof the U.S. Senate. So often it is Senator Stevens's style to be the \nworkhorse and moving force behind legislation, but to let others \nreceive the credit. He is a Senator who pulls up his sleeves and works \nand he is a man of his word.\n  Ted is a dedicated family man--to his wife Catherine and his daughter \nLily, and his children from his first marriage to Ann Stevens. Ted \nStevens is a Senator who lives every day to the fullest. He is \ntireless.\n  So Mr. President, it is very appropriate that the Senate convene here \ntoday to recognize and congratulate our Republican President pro \ntempore, the vice chairman of the Commerce Committee and the former \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We are here today to \nrecognize the length of his service and the accomplishments of his \nSenate service.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend \nand colleague, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. Today, Senator Stevens \nhas the distinct honor of becoming the longest serving Republican \nSenator in this Chamber.\n  I know of no greater patriot and lover of freedom than Ted Stevens. \nWhether flying his C-47 with the Flying Tigers in World War II, or \nserving in the Alaska House of Representatives, Senator Stevens' life \nis a model of heroism and personal integrity.\n  Ted's tenure in the Senate has been equally impressive. He chaired \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee for 6 years, the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee for 2 years, and served as the Senate \nPresident pro tempore for 4 years. In each and every one of these high \noffices, Ted served with dignity and distinction.\n  As one who has had a stewardship over our Nation's military for many \nyears, there is no greater friend to our men and women in the military \nthan Senator Stevens. No one in Congress has done more to make our \nNation's military the great institution it is today. We all rely \nheavily on Ted's expertise on so many defense-related matters, as I \nbelieve many in this body and throughout the Federal Government do. He \nis the Senate's greatest asset with regard to the needs of the \nmilitary, and his knowledge about defense issues has proven invaluable \nevery time this Nation has faced a crisis in the last four decades.\n  Although Ted is not the tallest man in the Senate, my colleagues and \nI all look up to the senior Senator from Alaska. When he comes to work \nin his Incredible Hulk tie, you know he means business and is ready to \ndo whatever it takes to ensure legislation which improves the lives of \nAmericans gets safely sheparded through the Senate.\n  It has been my privilege to know and work with Ted for many years \nhere in the Senate, and even though he has been described by some as \ngruff and grouchy, I have always found him to be very helpful and \npatient. Take for example a few months ago when I was\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nmeeting with several constituents from Utah in my DC office. During our \nconversations, we found that we needed some expertise that only Ted \ncould provide. I hurriedly called him at home in Alaska without pausing \nto calculate the time difference. Although it was midmorning where I \nwas sitting in DC, it was quite early in the morning in Alaska where a \ngroggy Ted Stevens courteously took my call, helped me with the \ninformation I needed, and--I hope--promptly went back to bed to finish \nhis night's sleep. Ted has shown similar types of courtesy and kindness \nto several Members of this body and he has always proven able to \nbalance the delicate, yet competing, needs to maintain good friendships \nand still move the work of the country forward even when all sides are \nnot in agreement.\n  Ted's wisdom and his character have served as an example to everyone \nhe meets, and I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to serve the \npeople of the United States alongside my dear, dear friend, Senator Ted \nStevens.\n  So, from one old bull to another old bull, I would like to thank my \ngood friend Ted for his friendship and leadership. Also, I would like \nto thank his wife Catherine for her selflessness and willingness to \nshare her husband. The hours kept by a hard-working Senator are long \nand can be very demanding on families, but Catherine has been extremely \npatient and our Nation is grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am embarrassed but very grateful to my \nfriends, our leader, Mr. McConnell, and my great friend and brother, \nDan Inouye. Dan and I have been here a long time. Actually, he came to \nthe Senate before I got here. I was downtown with the Eisenhower \nadministration when he arrived in the Department of the Interior. I \nwent home after that Presidency ended to Alaska and never expected to \ncome back. But I did, and I am grateful for the outline of my service \nthat our Republican leader has presented in the Senate.\n  I can only say two or three things. One is that I would not be here \nnow if it wasn't for a real understanding family. My first wife was, \nand my current wife, Katherine, has been supportive beyond anyone's \nunderstanding. It is a long way to go home. I remember one year I flew \nhome 35 times--one day up and one day back, almost. But I have been \naway from my family a great deal. I have 6 children and 11 \ngrandchildren and they have understood my commitment to the Senate. I \ndo believe that it would be impossible to be here without that type of \nsupport.\n\n  I also have been privileged and ask that after my remarks, I be \npermitted later to have printed in the Record a list of the dedicated \nyoung Alaskans who have come down and worked with me in various \npositions; also, those who have worked with me at home. I have had a \nseries of distinguished chiefs of staff who have gone on to other \nfunctions and have shown what training in the Senate can do for a young \nperson. I think over a dozen of my chiefs of staff have gone through \nlaw school working full time in my office and going to school full \ntime. We sort of run a separate adjunct of the Senate, and that is a \nlaw school on the side, I think.\n  I do believe I have had the honor of serving with many great people. \nI served with the people who were here when I came here--Senator Baker, \nSenator Mansfield, Senator Scott, Senator Magnuson, Senator Dole, \nSenator Jackson, Senator Cook, Senator Bible, Senator Bell, Senator \nHollings--there are so many.\n  I remember the time when Senator McClellan, who was chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, took the whole committee up to Alaska because \nhe was tired of asking me why I was seeking so much money. He decided \nto take the whole committee up there. We traveled through the State for \n2 weeks. That doesn't happen now.\n  I am surrounded by friends here on both sides of the aisle, and I am \nstill very honored to be here.\n  Let me close by saying I really think I am here because of the \nmentors I had in Alaska. Two publishers--Bill Snedden, publisher of the \nFairbanks Daily News-Miner, and Bob Atwood, publisher of the Anchorage \nTimes--urged me to come to Washington to participate in the Eisenhower \nadministration during our fight for statehood. I was lucky enough to \ntie into former Senator Fred Seaton who was Secretary of the Interior. \nI worked with him for a period of almost 4 years and left Washington as \nthe Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, his reward to me for \nour working together.\n  I was also honored to follow a good friend, a friend I got to know \nduring the territorial days as we fought for statehood, and that was \nBob Bartlett. He was my predecessor. He was, during the time we were \nfighting for statehood, the delegate from the Territory of Alaska as a \nDemocrat.\n  I think our relationship was almost as close as the relationship I \nhave with Senator Inouye. He was a fine man, a great and distinguished \npublic servant for Alaska. I am honored to hold what Alaskans call the \nBartlett seat.\n  I thank my colleagues again for the courtesy all have shown me. I \npassed a milestone only because Strom made the mistake of being a \nDemocrat for two terms. I am honored to have this recognition today.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I came to Washington, Senator Inouye--I \nam sorry, Senator Stevens. They are like brothers, and it is easy to \nget them mixed up--Senator Stevens had already been here 12 or 13 \nyears. He has a distinguished service: 38 years in this Chamber, going \non 15,000 votes, decorated pilot in World War II. But there are a \nnumber of instances that I want to spread on this record regarding \nSenator Stevens.\n  First of all, he has a relationship that has already been mentioned \nwith one of America's great people, Senator Dan Inouye. Dan Inouye, of \ncourse, is a Medal of Honor winner. A gentleman describes who he is. \nBut the relationship between Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, when \nthe history books are written, will be legendary. They are friends, a \nRepublican and a Democrat, who are like a couple of brothers.\n  They have traveled the world over many times, and the relationship is \nsomething we should all recognize as being possible in this Chamber. \nPeople of different parties from different parts of our United States \ncan become friends. Party affiliation is secondary to their \nrelationship.\n  For me, the example they have set has paved the way for the \nrelationship Senator Ensign and I have. We are from the same State, \nwith totally different political philosophies, but our friendship is, \nin our own minds, comparable to that of Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye. Thank you very much, I say to Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye, for the example you have set for us.\n  I also want to relate to everyone something that is remarkable to me. \nI was serving in the House of Representatives when Senator Alan Bible \ndied. Senator Bible served in the Senate for 20 years. He was a great \npublic servant from the State of Nevada and a dignified Senator who, \nbecause of illness, left the Senate after 20 years.\n  When he died, there was a plane available to take anyone who wanted \nto go to the State of Nevada to his funeral. I went, and the only other \nMember of Congress who traveled to Nevada was Ted Stevens. It was a \nlong way to Reno, NV, where Senator Bible was buried, but Ted Stevens \nwent. Why did he go? Because on a very important vote to Senator \nStevens that made the difference between Senator Stevens carrying the \nday or losing the day, Senator Bible stepped forward, as Senator \nStevens said, courageously and voted with this Republican Senator.\n  Think about that: Senator Bible was long gone, hadn't been in the \nSenate for many years. He died. But Senator Stevens remembered Senator \nBible doing something that he thought was beyond the call of his \ndemocratic duty. And so Senator Stevens and I took this lonely flight \nto Reno, NV, to attend the funeral of my friend and Senator Stevens' \nfriend, Senator Bible. That speaks volumes about the kind of person \nSenator Stevens is.\n  One of the highlights of my congressional service has been the \nability to travel all over the world. It is part of our obligation as \nMembers of Congress to go see what American interests are doing around \nthe world. On one of those trips, I signed up to go as a\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nyoung Senator and was led by the great John Glenn and Ted Stevens. It \nwas a memorable trip. I can remember--the Iron Curtain was down--\nleaving Austria and going into Czechoslovakia. They stopped the train. \nIn came the KGB and other Iron Curtain soldiers. They looked under the \ntrain, in the train, and looked at all of us. We went into Prague, and \nin a little diner, bar, that evening, a man came in wearing a flight \njacket, a World War II flight jacket. Of course, Senator Glenn and \nSenator Stevens had worn those flight jackets representing the United \nStates as they flew airplanes: one a marine, one a member of the Army \nAir Corps.\n\n  The conversation that night with that man, who probably was a KGB \nplant, as we talked later, developed into a great conversation. We were \nable to be regaled with conversations about Senator Glenn in World War \nII and Senator Stevens in World War II flying airplanes for America's \ninterests around the world. I always will remember that.\n  Finally, I say to Senator Stevens, at this desk right here, you \nwatched me manage a few bills. We were able to finish an appropriations \nbill. You thought I helped a lot. So you gave me the distinct honor of \ngiving me one of your Hulk ties, which I still have.\n  (Laughter.)\n  We laugh and joke about that, but it meant a lot to me that Senator \nStevens thought enough of me to give me one of his ties.\n  So I say to Senator Stevens, at this important occasion for you, of \ncourse, and our country, recognizing you, your service in this body, \nthe longest serving Republican in the history of the Republic, I extend \nto you my appreciation and my friendship.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Alaska is on \nher feet. I wanted to make sure you saw her. She will be seeking \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it gives me enormous pride to pay \ntribute to our senior Senator, to my senior Senator, Mr. Stevens, and \nto listen to the comments, to listen to the stories from so many of you \nas colleagues and friends.\n  For so many years--I think my whole life--I have grown up hearing the \nstories about Senator Stevens, and to understand how today--tomorrow, \nactually--he makes history as the longest serving Republican Senator.\n  What you all need to appreciate is that so much of the history of Ted \nStevens is also the history of the State of Alaska. They are \ninextricably tied, and we know that. So to be able to share that with \nhis friends and colleagues for so many years is so important.\n  I truly appreciate the words of the Republican leader outlining the \nhistory, the very storied military career that Senator Stevens had, \nunderstanding how he went on to be the U.S. attorney for the territory \nat the time, his schooling through UCLA, through Harvard. Coming back \nto the State of Alaska is where we all kind of pick up with the history \nthat is now legendary and is seen in so many places.\n  Someone mentioned the Ted Stevens International Airport. We look \naround to so many of the monuments in the State, whether it is the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline that has been delivering oil to the lower 48 for \nthe past 25-some-odd years--we look at those and we think: Ted Stevens.\n  I don't know how many of you are aware of the history of our State as \nit relates to our lands and knowing and understanding that it was Ted \nStevens who moved these forward, whether it was ANILCA, our land \nconservation act, the Native Claims Settlement Act, the effort to build \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Act, the \nDenali Commission--these are living legends, if you will, through \nlegislation that came about through the dedication, through the \npersistence, through the urging of Senator Stevens.\n  We all want to believe, certainly, that we work on behalf of the \npeople we represent, but as we look to these legislative victories, \nthese legislative successes that Senator Stevens has put in place over \nthe years, I believe that truly demonstrates his commitment to the \npeople of Alaska. When we think about providing the Native peoples with \ntitle to their lands, when we think about the educational challenges \nthat face us in this enormous State with geographic and rural \nchallenges that we can only imagine, when we think about how we provide \nhealth care in a State such as Alaska, all we need to do is look to the \ninitiatives that have been put in place.\n  Senator Stevens has always--always--kept Alaska first and has been \nvery selfless in his efforts to put his State, to put the people of \nAlaska first.\n  We lovingly call him throughout the State ``Uncle Ted.''\n  And you chuckle, but I think it is fair to say. They might not say it \nto your face, Ted, but behind your back they are always calling you \nUncle Ted, because I hear it. They love it. The people of Alaska love \nit when you put on your Super Hero tie, when you wear the Hulk tie, \nbecause that is your signal that you mean business on behalf of the \npeople of the State of Alaska.\n  You know, talk about people who have minds as sharp as a tack, Ted \nwill come up to me and we will be talking about something and he will \nsay, You remember back in 1973 when so-and-so said something to so-and-\nso? And I am thinking, I was still in high school back then; no, I \ndon't remember that. But he has such a grasp of the history and the \nfacts. I appreciated his comment that he doesn't reminisce, but he is \nnot going to let go of the factual background that has gotten us to \nwhere we are today.\n  Senator Stevens mentioned those who have worked for him, and he and I \nhave a unique relationship in that I was an intern for him. I credit \nhim as my first political mentor here. Whether that means your staff \nwill go on to succeed both you and me, who knows, but I look to what \nyou have provided me as I have joined the family of the Senate here. I \ncould not have asked for a better mentor, a better colleague to work \nside by side with as we move forward to advance the interests of the \nState of Alaska.\n  I know I will have you to work together with for years to come, and I \njoin my colleagues again in acknowledging you on this truly historic \noccasion. I think it is fair to say, as an Alaskan, I feel personally \nblessed to have you and your leadership for our State and our Nation, \nand for that I thank you very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of \nfamily and Senate staff to which I previously referred, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Family\n\n       My wife, Catherine Ann Stevens, my deceased wife, Ann \n     Cherrington Stevens, who left us due to our 1978 accident.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I also ask unanimous consent that the time be charged to \nthe postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the situation in \nIraq, notwithstanding that the headlines and the television shows over \nthe last days have been consumed by discussions about what happened \nwith the Duke lacrosse team and comments made by Don Imus and other \nthings.\n  Yesterday, I attended another funeral for a young soldier, a sergeant \nin the U.S. Army, 10th Mountain Division, Chris Wilson, at Arlington. \nThat is where the real focus of our country ought to be right now, on \nthe war in Iraq, about which yesterday the Senator from Arizona gave a \nspeech that I thought was divisive, a speech that was more political \nthan one that offered a solution, because the solution is not more of \nthe same. The solution is not to characterize the war as it has been \ncharacterized over the course of the last 4\\1/2\\ years, as a do-or-die \nfight against al-Qaida over there or it is going to be over here. This \nis the most amazing scare tactic we have seen employed over the last \nyears. It avoids reality, and it draws the United States deeper and \ndeeper into a position of loss of credibility and loss of leverage in \nour ability to do what we need to do.\n  I don't know one person in the Senate who cheers for surrender or \ncheers for loss or for chaos in Iraq. To suggest that is an insult to \nthe Members of the Senate. It is an insult to those of us who care as \nmuch about victory and as much about success and as much about the \nlives and support of our troops as anybody in public life today. The \ndevastating attack in Baghdad yesterday, the lack of any real political \nprogress as a result of the President's escalation, and the incredible \ntoll this is taking on our Armed Forces deserves a real debate, not a \npolarized, divisive appeal to the lowest common denominator of fear in \nAmerican politics.\n  It also deserves a debate about what this administration could learn \nif it listened to our generals. We are now more than 4 years into the \nwar in Iraq and, tragically, it is only now that the administration \nsuddenly realizes: Wow, maybe we ought to find one individual who can \ncoordinate the war efforts between Afghanistan and Iraq and have the \nauthority to coordinate the military efforts and civilian efforts. But \nthey are doing it at a time where apparently no one wants the job, and \nno one wants the job in the most extraordinary way. It says a lot, when \nthe President finally decides to appoint a war czar in order to get \neverybody on the same page, that the situation in Iraq is actually so \nbad and the administration's stubborn willingness to change course so \npersistent that they can't, at least as of now, find anybody to take \nthe job.\n  I read yesterday's articles on the front pages of our paper in \nWashington. I was really stunned. This administration has approached \nthree retired four-star generals about taking on this task. Maybe \nSenator McCain ought to stop and think about why those generals \nresisted an appeal to their patriotism, to their sense of duty, to \ntheir service to country after years of a career in the U.S. military. \nWhat did Marine GEN Jack Sheehan say? He is not an opponent of this \nadministration, nor is Army GEN Jack Keane, nor retired Air Force GEN \nJoseph Ralston. All three declined. None of them are opponents of this \nadministration. In fact, they all have established ties with this \nadministration. Why would our top military commanders decline such a \nhigh-level position?\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  General Sheehan, a 35-year marine who once served as the top NATO \ncommander, summed it up pretty well in what I thought was an \nextraordinary statement.\n  He said:\n\n       The very fundamental issue is they [the administration] \n     don't know where the hell they're going.\n\n  That is a 35-year retired Marine general:\n\n        . . . they don't know where the hell they're going.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       So rather than go over there, develop an ulcer and \n     eventually leave, I said no thanks.\n\n  It is pretty incredible that three retired four-star generals, whose \ncareers, whose service to the Nation, whose understanding of the \nmilitary is a lifetime of experience, all said no to the Commander in \nChief.\n  The President insists he listens to the generals, not the \npoliticians. He ought to heed his own advice and end the disgraceful \nrecord of ignoring the very military administration he professes to \nbelieve in. Again and again this administration has turned its back on \nthe best advice of the military. Each time they have done so at our \nperil. Start with General Shinseki, who we all now agree was right when \nhe said we needed a lot more troops and was met with dismissal. As the \nformer top operating officer at the Pentagon, a different Marine \nlieutenant general put it:\n\n       The commitment of our forces to this fight was done with a \n     casualness and swagger that are the special province of those \n     who have never had to execute these missions--or bury the \n     results.\n\n  Instead of listening to General Shinseki, the administration decided \nto push him aside, give him the cold shoulder, and eventually \nretirement.\n  Last year, retired high-ranking military leaders, many of whom played \nkey combat or planning roles in Afghanistan and Iraq, came forward and \npublicly called for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald \nRumsfeld. Across the administration, the warnings of those who wore the \nuniform of their country all their lives and who, retired or not, did \nnot resign their citizenship in order to serve their country all were \ndismissed as acts of disloyalty or as threats to civilian control of \nthe Armed Forces. Think about that. A retired military officer who \nisn't wearing the uniform, earned their retirement, speaks out about a \nwar they were personally involved in helping to plan, saying: We have \nto change course. They are somehow called unpatriotic and disloyal, and \nsomehow that threatens the civilian control of the Armed Forces. How \ndoes an ex-military officer who has the right to speak out threaten \ncivilian control of the Armed Forces? It is the scare tactic, the usual \napproach of this administration--try to throw out a big red herring, \nput the straw man out there and debate the straw man instead of \ndebating the real strategy of the war.\n\n  In the end, it took an election. The American people spoke out. That \nis what replaced Secretary Rumsfeld, not the advice of the men and \nwomen who had seen him nearly break the military they had served for \ndecades. That was the administration's choice. But it didn't stop \nthere. Ask General Casey or General Abizaid, who warned that more U.S. \ntroops would not solve Iraq's security problem and could actually slow \nthe process of getting Iraqi security forces to assume more \nresponsibility. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, who unanimously opposed this \nescalation--what happened to listening to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \ntheir recommendation? General Abizaid was replaced. General Casey was \nreassigned. The Joint Chiefs were overruled. Yesterday, we learned that \nthe Pentagon is going to stretch our overextended military even further \nby extending combat tours and reducing the time between rotations to \nprovide the additional troops necessary for the President's misguided \nescalation. What do our military leaders have to say about that? Robert \nScales, a retired Army two-star general, said that to sustain this \ndeployment while giving soldiers the training and the rest they need \nwould require twice as many Army and Marine Corps brigades as we have \ntoday. Then he warned, this two-star Army general, that the Army is \nabout to be ``broken.''\n  We are hearing our own generals talk to us again about what is \nhappening to our military that is overstretched and about to be broken. \nThose are not our words; those are the words of military personnel. \nBarry McCaffrey, retired Army four-star general, who recently returned \nfrom another factfinding trip to Iraq, tells us that combat equipment \nfor both the Active and Reserve components ``is shot.'' His conclusion \nwas simple:\n\n       There is no argument of whether the U.S. Army is rapidly \n     unravelling.\n\n  At a time when mistake after mistake is being compounded by the very \ncivilian leadership that ignored expert military advice in the invasion \nand occupation of Iraq, those who understand that the price for each \nmistake is being paid by our troops must be heard. The message from the \ngenerals who were offered the war czar position has been crystal clear. \nIf they really thought the administration had a strategy that could \nsucceed in Iraq, why would they turn down the job? There is a very good \nreason for their skepticism. This administration simply refuses to \naccept the reality of how you change course or even that you must \nfundamentally change course in Iraq.\n  We keep hearing that the escalation is showing progress. While the \nlevel of Iraqi civilian casualties may have gone down in Baghdad, it \nhas gone up in other parts of the country. Why? For the obvious reason \nthat they have the flexibility of choosing where they will engage. \nAlmost a certainty, some came to the floor and predicted: Put more \ntroops into Baghdad, they will retreat into the shadows, into other \ncommunities. They will probe, they will find the weaknesses, and that \nis where they will reengage. That is precisely what has happened. The \noverall casualty rate in Iraq has remained essentially the same.\n  Just today we learned of a devastating suicide bombing in the Iraqi \nParliament, right in the heart of the heavily fortified Green Zone. Ten \npeople died, including two Iraqi lawmakers, along with any sense of \npersonal security in what is supposed to be the safest part of Baghdad. \nIt is a strange definition of the progress we have been hearing about. \nHow are more American troops going to stop a single fanatic with \nexplosives strapped to his or her chest?\n  One thing we do know is American troops are paying the ultimate price \nfor this escalation. In the first 7 weeks, the number of U.S. troops \nwho died in Baghdad doubled. On Monday alone, we learned of two more \nsoldiers from Massachusetts who died in Iraq, CAPT Anthony Palermo, age \n26, of Boston, MA, and SGT Adam P. Kennedy, 25, of Norfolk, MA. The \nadministration says that these men and women are giving their lives \nbecause the purpose of this escalation is to allow the Iraqis space to \nmake the political deals that we all agree are the only hope for ending \nthe civil war. But if the violence is going down in Baghdad, where is \nthe political progress? We keep hearing that the Iraqis are getting \ncloser to a deal on sharing oil revenues. I think we have had the \nSecretary of State in front of the Foreign Relations Committee at least \ntwice that I can think of in which she has said: We are almost there, \nwe are nearing a deal. The last time was a month and a half ago, maybe \n2 months ago. Where is the deal? Every time, hopes for a final deal \nturn out to be an illusion. Where is the rapidity of the Iraqi response \nto the political compromises that need to be made to resolve this?\n  The de-Baathification law that is a key part of the national \nreconciliation process was recently denounced by Ayatollah Sistani and \nis nowhere near completion. The Iraqis are still at square one when it \ncomes to amending the Constitution and disarming the militias. Still \nthe President refuses to impose any meaningful consequences on the \nIraqis for failure to meet these benchmarks.\n  Now, again, I listened to the speech of the Senator from Arizona \nyesterday in which he talked about those who advocate surrender and \nthose who cheer for the potential of loss. Again and again, our \nmilitary leaders have said there is no military solution in Iraq. \nGeneral Abizaid said it. General Casey said it. Most recently, General \nPetraeus--new on the job--reiterated there is no military solution. The \nPresident has said it. The Secretary of State has said it. Donald \nRumsfeld said it.\n  But where is the diplomatic effort necessary within the whole Middle\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nEast, let alone in Iraq alone, to leverage the kind of transformation \nthat is necessary to end the civil war? And how dare the Senator from \nArizona only talk about the fundamentals of al-Qaida and how if we \ndon't fight them over there we will fight them over here, when the \nfight is really one between civil parties in Iraq?\n  Yes, al-Qaida is in Iraq. We understand that. Yes, al-Qaida has the \nability to be able to bomb something and create trouble as a \nconsequence of that. But the real violence, the fundamental divisions, \nthe piece of this which is extending the stalemate and the American \npresence at the same time is the unwillingness of the Shia and Sunni \nand the politicians who are fighting for position and for the future \nspoils of Iraq itself--their unwillingness to resolve those \ndifferences.\n  The longer the U.S. military stays there saying: We are here, we are \ngoing to do this, we are going to go out and do the pacification, we \nwill do the military backup--as long as that security blanket is there, \nthose politicians know they can take as long as they want to come to \nany compromise.\n  I have heard some of our own diplomats in the region express their \nconcern about the open-endedness and express the lack of leverage over \nthe Iraqis themselves that helps us bring a resolution here.\n  The only way in which you can change the dynamic on the ground is \nwhen the administration accepts the simple reality that this Congress \nhas now voted on, that the Iraqi politicians have repeatedly shown they \nonly respond to a deadline, a deadline to transfer the authority. \nRemember that, back when Ambassador Bremer was there and we said: ``We \nare going to change the provisional government. We are going to \ntransfer authority to Iraq,'' and they said: ``Oh, no, we're not ready. \nDon't do this.''? But we said: ``It is going to happen. It is going to \nhappen on this date. Get ready.'' And it did, and we did transfer the \nauthority. The same thing for the two elections and the referendum. I \nremember them saying: ``We have to push this off. We are not ready for \nthe election. Can't participate.'' We said: ``No. We're going to have \nthis firm date. We're going to have an election.'' And guess what. We \nhad the two elections. We had the referendum. We got the Constitution, \nflawed as it is. But we pushed people to understand this was not open-\nended and interminable.\n  The fact is, I do not believe young Americans ought to be dying or \nmaimed to provide a window of opportunity for Iraqi politicians to \ncontinue to procrastinate, to give them the cover they need and want to \nbe able to manipulate and maneuver and position themselves for power. \nThat is not what our troops went over there to do. If you go back and \nreread the resolution we voted on here, it was to deal with Saddam \nHussein, it was to deal with the weapons of mass destruction; it was \nnot to put our troops in the middle of a civil war and engage in the \nkind of struggle we are involved in today.\n  Mr. President, another thought about this issue. Again, there are \nthose running for President on the Republican side who I guess have \nfound that the orthodoxy of their primaries requires them to go out and \nsuggest that Democrats want something they do not want. So maybe we \nhave not learned anything about the truth in American politics. But the \nfact is, no Democrat whom I know of has suggested abandoning Iraq. No \nDemocrat has suggested inviting chaos--more than the chaos that exists \ntoday.\n  In fact, we have what we believe is a plan for success, and it does \nnot leave Iraq without the presence of American troops--I might add, to \nthe chagrin of some people in this country who think it ought to. It \nleaves the President the discretion to finish the training of Iraqis. \nThat is the principal thing we ought to be there to do. And it leaves \nthe President the ability to be able to decide how many troops are \nnecessary to complete the task of training the Iraqis. It also leaves \nthe President the discretion to decide what the President needs in \norder to prosecute al-Qaida. It does not walk away from the battle \nagainst al-Qaida. It leaves those special forces and special operations \nand intelligence-gathering and other operations necessary to continue \nto prosecute al-Qaida. Finally, it leaves the President the discretion \nto be able to leave such forces as are necessary to protect American \nfacilities and personnel.\n  Now, how much more discretion, at this point in time, after 4-plus \nyears of war, when they have made every decision wrong, should we allow \nthe President? People say: Don't micromanage the war. Somebody has to \nmanage this war because the folks who are in there, obviously, are not \ndoing it effectively. When you have your own generals coming back and \ntelling you the troops still do not have the armor, they still do not \nhave the level of up-armored Humvees, they are still going out on \npatrols in ways that are, in many cases, provocatively dangerous and \ninvite the kinds of injuries they are getting, without the gain on the \nback end as a consequence of the risk they have taken, I think that is \nunacceptable.\n  Last month, Iraq's neighbors and key players from the international \ncommunity finally got together at a conference in Baghdad. Guess what. \nNothing tangible came out of the conference. There is no sense of \nurgency about the upcoming meeting in Egypt, which is why a deadline is \nso essential. The countries in the region need to know this dynamic is \ngoing to change.\n  To the degree they are concerned about Iran, to the degree they are \nconcerned about their Sunni brothers--and they are; Saudi Arabians, \nJordanians, Egyptians are predominantly Sunni, and they are deeply \nconcerned about the Sunni minority in Iraq. But they need to translate \nthat concern into a regional security plan where there is a greater \nlevel of assistance in order to force the kinds of compromises \nnecessary between the parties. Absent that, this is just going to go \non.\n\n  We owe it to our troops and to our country to have an honest debate \nand to try to work together to find the way forward in Iraq. I think \nthe speech Senator McCain gave yesterday, in which he said Democrats \nwere cheering for defeat and surrender in Iraq, does a disservice to \nthe Senator from Arizona as well as to the U.S. Senate. I think he \nknows better. And he knows full well that no one here wants to see Iraq \nfall apart. But we have a different plan for how you prevent it. We \nhave a different plan for how you achieve success.\n  It seems to me that a plan that says the President has the discretion \nto leave troops that are necessary to complete the training is not, on \nits face, an abandonment of Iraq. It is an alternative way of achieving \nthe leverage necessary to be able to get the responses we have not \ngotten over the last 4 years.\n  So, Mr. President, we disagree on the strategy, but we do not \ndisagree on the stakes. The Vice President hides behind similar \nrhetoric. He dares to claim that those who offer a new way forward are \n``undermining'' our troops. Well, I have had enough of that rhetoric. I \nhave had enough. And I think most of my colleagues have.\n  Undermining our troops? Let's have that debate, Mr. Vice President. \nThis is a Vice President who helped send them into combat without \nadequate protection, without adequate numbers of troops, without an \nadequate plan, without the guarding of the ammo dumps, without the kind \nof engagement diplomatically that helps them, without the humvees that \nwere up-armored, without the armor--that's why parents in America are \ngoing out and buying the state-of-the-art armor for those troops. And \nthis President and Vice President want to talk about undermining the \ntroops?\n  Let's have a debate with an administration that sent them into battle \nin Iraq with serious injuries and other medical problems, including \nsome whose doctors said they were too injured to even wear their body \narmor. You want to have a debate about undermining the troops? Then how \nabout failing to provide them with the proper medical care when they \ncome home with broken bodies and minds, with a VA budget that is \ninadequate, with a hospital situation that does not follow up and honor \nthe sacrifice they have made? How about the extended tours in Iraq, \nwhere people have given up their jobs and their livelihoods because \nthey are in the National Guard and they have been called up repeatedly, \nand they are the sole proprietor of a business? How about that?\n  It seems to me Congress has done what the President and this \nadministration have stubbornly refused to do.\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nWe have recognized the best way you support the troops is to change a \nfailed policy. The best way you support the troops is to implement a \nstrategy that works for those troops. The best way you support the \ntroops is to guarantee we put in place a strategy that honors their \nsacrifice and really leverages the real interests and real stakes of \nthe United States in the region.\n  I think we ought to honor the lives lost, not with words and not with \ndivisive speeches, but we ought to honor them with lives saved. That \nstarts by putting aside the hollow rhetoric and the straw men that have \nundermined a real debate for far too long and by supporting an exit \nstrategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq, a strategy that \nnegotiates a new security arrangement for the region; helps to leverage \nthe kind of participation of other countries that have an interest in \nstanding up to Iran; and regains our credibility in the region, which \nhas been tattered with Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, not to mention the \npolicies in Iraq themselves.\n  Our own CIA has told us the current strategy is creating more \nterrorists, that it is emboldening the radical Islam extremists. What \nwe are offering is a strategy that we believe better speaks to \nAmerica's values, to America's interests, and, most of all, to our \nobligation to the troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                            American Workers\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is a poignant story about the days \nfollowing the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As his body lie in \nstate here in the U.S. Capitol, long lines of people formed in order to \nfile past the body of the dead President. A journalist interviewed a \nworker who was standing there, with his hat in his hand held in front \nof him, with tears in his eyes. The journalist asked this working man, \nwho had been standing in line for some long while: Did you know \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt? The working man looked back at him and said: \nNo, I didn't. But he knew me.\n  The question is, Who knows American workers today? I ask that \nquestion because I read in the paper that Circuit City, a pretty well-\nknown corporation in this country, has decided it wants to lay off \n3,400 workers. Here is what Circuit City said about those workers:\n\n       It had nothing to do with their skills or whether they were \n     a good worker or not.\n\n  That is according to a Circuit City spokesperson.\n  Now, this sort of thing follows on the heels of the offshore \noutsourcing of many other American jobs, American companies shutting \ndown. There is no more Fruit of the Loom underwear made in America, no \nmore Levi's made in America, no more Huffy bicycles made here, no more \nFig Newton cookies made here. There are no more Radio Flyer little red \nwagons made in America. It is all gone. It is all outsourced. Those \nworkers all got fired. Pennsylvania House Furniture. I could go through \nthe long list.\n\n  We understand that even as companies outsource jobs to China in \nsearch of 30-cents-an-hour labor, other companies that keep their jobs \nhere have decided to put downward pressure on wages to be competitive, \nso we see the announcement of Circuit City. Three thousand four hundred \nworkers need to be laid off because they are paid an average of $10 to \n$11 an hour; they are firing workers making 50 cents above the average. \nThey plan to replace them with new workers who will work for \nsubstantially less, and they say they are going to save $110 million \nthrough these firings and replacements.\n  But Circuit City executives actually seem to be doing a little better \nthan the workers. The employees are losing their jobs, but the CEO gets \n$10 million a year. The chairman gets $10 million, the CEO gets $10 \nmillion, the executive VP gets $6 million. This is from a company that \nlost money. I don't know. Maybe in some towns that seems to work. In my \nhometown, it wouldn't work very long.\n  It seems to me we are becoming a society of disposable workers, run \nby those who don't think workers make much of a difference in this \ncountry. Circuit City said they will start hiring replacements \nimmediately. Anybody can apply for the jobs except for the Circuit City \nworkers who were fired. They have to wait 10 weeks, and then they can \nreapply for the job at a lower salary.\n  So let's put some names to these 3,400 workers. I pulled some out of \nthe newspaper.\n  Bobby Young worked 20 years for Circuit City. He got a letter from \nhis boss saying he was fired. It was addressed ``To Whom It May \nConcern.'' It is unbelievable. He said he is 47 years old. ``What they \ndid as a company to me, it's not the American way,'' he says. To Whom \nIt May Concern: You are fired. It tells you a little something about \nthe concern about the workers, doesn't it?\n  Alan Hartley, Charlotte, NC. He thought he and other top employees \nwere being called into a special meeting because he thought they were \ngoing to be recognized for outstanding performance, but it wasn't quite \nthat way. They decided they were going to be recognized to be laid off \nbecause they should be replaced with lower paid workers. Now he says \nthey are going to hire people who aren't properly trained for the jobs \nto help take care of the customers.\n\n       I haven't told my kids yet. They don't know I just got \n     fired for doing a good job.\n\n  Steven Rash made $11.59 an hour; worked for the company 7 years. He \nwas working another full-time job as well--two jobs to pay off his \nstudent debt.\n  It is not just Circuit City. There are other companies. I will not go \nthrough the whole list of companies. David Leonhart of the New York \nTimes said that companies are wringing out what they see as \ninefficiencies. The inefficiency of paying $11.50 an hour; God forbid \nwe should overpay people by $11.50 an hour, plus give them a little \nhealth insurance and retirement as part of their compensation. Well, \nwhen pensions and health insurance and $11.50-an-hour salary is viewed \nas an inefficiency, there is something wrong in this country. He also \nsays this is a corporate safety net that is being taken away. There is \nno corporate safety net. It is a basic American standard of living that \nworkers have bargained for.\n  Let me ask the question whether this applies to everybody. No, it \ndoesn't. It just applies to workers, the people who take a shower after \nwork. It just applies to those people. Top executives--in 2006 there \nwere 35 chief executives who were fired for poor performance and, \ncombined, they got $799 million payment as they went out the door. \nPfizer's chairman, he got $200 million when he bailed out of that \ncompany, despite the fact the company had lost more than $130 billion \nin value. Home Depot chairman, he got fired on the very first day of \n2007. He got $210 million as he went out the door. United Health Group, \nhe somehow ended up with $1.1 billion in stock options as he went out \nthe door. I don't quite understand all these things.\n  Jack Welch, a celebrated CEO, wrote the book ``Winning,'' and after \nhe retired from General Electric, he got a package he was sufficiently \nembarrassed about, once it was disclosed, that he decided to give some \nof it back.\n  His package included an $80,000-a-month Central Park apartment during \nhis retirement, lifetime use of the company jet, membership at an array \nof country clubs, maid service at multiple homes, limousines and prime \ntickets and several homes.\n  I don't understand how we have come to the point where the average \nCEO in this country, the average CEO of Standard & Poor's 500 \ncompanies, made $14.7 million. CEOs on average are paid 411 times more \nthan the average workers in this company. Think of that. In 1965, CEOs \non average were paid 25 times more than the average worker. Now it is \n411 times more. Yesterday I opened the paper and read that Sprint CEO \ngot a compensation package of $21.3 million, the former Nextel chairman \ngot $36.2 million. Sallie Mae, by the way, in the business of providing \nstudent loans, their chief executive officer got a package of $16.6 \nmillion and a bonus of $2.5 million as a part of that. Ford Motor lost \n$12.6 billion last year. It went out and recruited a new chairman--oh, \nby the way, for the chairman, when the company lost $12.6 billion, that \nchairman got $10.5 million last year. They just went to hire a new guy \nand he got a $28 million package which includes an $18 million bonus.\n  The average CEO who was fired last year got $9 million in severance.\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\n  Abraham Lincoln once said there is no America without labor and to \nfleece the one is to rob the other.\n  There is a man named Bob Negley. Bob Negley is quite a remarkable \nbusinessman, a very unusual businessman. He ran a company called \nRollerblade. Most of us know about Rollerblade. I like to rollerblade, \npersonally--inline skates. I think it is a great sport. I haven't even \nbroken a bone. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I like to rollerblade. \nBob Negley ran Rollerblade and then he sold it. After he sold it, he \ndid something that is very unusual in this country. He moved to \nFlorida, midyear, sold his position in Rollerblade, that controlling \nposition, and moved to Florida. Then Christmastime came around and all \nthe workers who worked for Bob Negley who made Rollerblades began to \nget Christmas cards from Bob Negley and his wife. In the Christmas card \nas they opened it up was a check from this man who had previously owned \nthe company 6 months before. With the check was a note and it said \nthis: I sold this company and I made a lot of money, but I understand \nwhat made this company successful. It was all of you. You worked out \nthere in the plants and in the factories, you worked in engineering, \nyou worked in marketing, you are the ones who made this company \nsuccessful and, as a result, I made a lot of money. I want to share \nsome of it with you. He included in the Christmas card a check computed \non the number of years of service which some employees found to be over \n$20,000, and, by the way, he said, I have prepaid your Federal income \ntaxes on this money. Accept this as a token of my appreciation because \nyou were the company, you made this company successful.\n\n  Contrast that, if you will, with these days all the discussions in \nthe newspaper about Circuit City who has to get rid of 3,400 workers. \nWhy? Because we want to hire less-experienced workers, and we want to \nbring them on for less money; $11 an hour is too much.\n  Or, perhaps, Wal-Mart, which sends an internal memorandum around. A \ntop executive writes a memo in Wal-Mart and says the cost of an \nassociate--that is an employee, by the way, but you know this notion of \n``associate.'' In my hometown there was a one-eyed, 3-legged dog with \nfleas they named ``Lucky,'' so names don't mean very much.\n  So he says, the cost of an associate with 7 years of tenure is 55 \npercent more than the cost of an associate with 1 year of tenure, and \nyet there is no difference in his or her productivity. Message? Don't \nlet people stay around very long. Let's have a lot of turnover here. \nLet's have people around who don't know anything so we can pay them \nnothing. This is going on in this country, and the question is, Who is \ngoing to stand up for American workers? Who decides for a change that \nthe expansion of the middle class in this country, where workers were \npaid well, was something that represented the success of the American \neconomic engine? Who is going to decide that? These companies that \ndecide that workers are like wrenches: use them up and throw them away, \nit doesn't matter, or will they decide, once again, as Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt did, or as did that worker standing with his hat in his hands \nsaid: I know American workers. That President knew American workers. \nWill we decide finally that American workers have value in this \neconomic system?\n  Sure, we can outsource everything. We can ship all these jobs to \nChina and pay people 30 cents an hour to make bicycles to be sold in \nAmerica. We can decide that we are going to get rid of all these \nworkers and replace them with $8- or $6-an-hour people. Is that what is \ngoing to build a better country? Is that what is going to expand the \nmiddle class? There is no social program in this Chamber that we debate \nand talk about that is as important to the American people as a good \njob that pays well with good benefits. It is time, long past the time \nwe start to remember that.\n  Yes, I used some company names here and I have described some \nseverance packages. Perhaps I shouldn't single those companies out, but \nthe fact is they put themselves on the front section of the business \nsection of these newspapers with their own news: We want to get rid of \n3,400 employees; that's what Circuit City says. I am saying that is a \nvalue system which ignores the fact that workers are your company. I \ntold a company that was in to see me not so long ago: Your brand is a \nbrand all of us recognize. Your brand is not just something painted \nsomeplace; it is the people who work for your company. If you don't \nunderstand that, at some point that brand will be worth virtually \nnothing. This country needs to begin to understand, once again, and \nhonor, once again, work and working men and women who struggle every \nday. They get up, they work, they work hard, they give you an honest \nday's work, and they come home and try and raise a family and do all \nthe things that make life in this country worthwhile. All too often \nthese days we see this notion that somehow, by some companies, workers \ndon't have value, don't have worth. That is a very serious mistake. \nBoth in public policy and I hope in the private sector, we need to turn \nthis around and understand this country's success depends on expanding \nthe middle class, on providing opportunities for the people in this \ncountry--opportunities, yes, for a good job that pays well, to take \ncare of families and provide the things you want for a good life in \nthis country's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when I am done--and I think that will be \nin about 15 or 20 minutes--I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Cornyn, follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Budget\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago we passed the budget \nresolution in the Senate. One week after that, the House passed their \nbudget resolution. So we are in a position of being conferenced between \nthe House and the Senate on a budget resolution, and I thought at this \npoint I ought to give some updates, particularly as it relates to the \nwork of the Committee on Finance, and particularly as it relates to the \nissue of taxes and an impending tax increase that is out there--\ntomorrow, almost--a few years away if we don't do anything to stop the \nbiggest tax increase in the country, or that will be, in fact, the \nbiggest tax increase in the country.\n  So as the budget resolution slowly works its way through Congress, \none especially important issue wrapped up in this whole great big \nbudget resolution and document is the longevity of the bipartisan tax \nrelief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003, and this very day those tax \ndecreases for working men and women are still in place and will be in \nplace through the year 2010. It has always been my goal, when you have \nChairman Greenspan saying that this tax relief for working men and \nwomen is the reason the economy has rebounded, that we should continue \nthis tax relief into the future, because if it is the goose that laid \nthe golden egg of 7.8 billion new jobs being created since the \nrecession, then we ought to keep that golden egg working for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Some people may not give the contents of a budget resolution much \nconsideration since it does not get signed into law by the President \nbut is merely a set of guidelines for tax and spending decisions that \napply to Congress as we make permanent law and as we make decisions on \ntax policy for the future. Those tax and spending decisions must go to \nthe President for his acting on them and then become law.\n  For this reason, along with anyone who supports tax relief, we are \nvery concerned about the budget resolutions passed by the Democratic \nmajorities in the House and Senate that are now in conference. Yes, \nthis is a Republican Senator. I am in the minority now since the last \nelection. So I want to raise these concerns as a responsibility of the \nmajority and to alert the American people about what the majority might \nbe up to, or if they are not up to it, what the consequences are if \nnothing happens.\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\n  This concern is derived from the fact that the two budget \nresolutions--the one in the House and the one in the Senate--do not \nprovide for the extension of tax relief beyond 2010. What does it mean \nwhen I use the words the budget resolutions do not provide for ``the \nextension'' of tax relief beyond 2010? That means, if Congress takes no \naction, we will have the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry, and we will have that tax increase without even a vote of the \nCongress.\n  For the first time in more than 6 years, Congress is sending a \nmessage, then, that there is no guarantee of continued tax relief. In \nfact, the Democratic budget resolutions say the very opposite. The \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate only provides 44 percent of the \nrevenue necessary to extend these popular, bipartisan--and let me \nemphasize bipartisan--tax relief bills of 2001. Mr. President, 44 \npercent is not enough, but that 44 percent is more than the big fat \nzero percent in the House-passed budget resolution. The House-passed \nbudget resolution provides no revenue room for the extension of tax \nrelief, meaning that the majority of the House of Representatives right \nnow is taking a position on the budget to let the biggest tax increase \nin the history of our country go into effect without a vote of \nCongress.\n  What does that mean, besides the biggest tax increase in history? It \nmeans things such as no tuition deduction for people sending their kids \nto college, no teacher deduction for the supplies the teacher might buy \nout of their own pocket. Those are just a couple of popular items that \nwould expire at that particular time that would be a small part of the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the country, happening without \nthe vote of the people.\n  I would like to think that I am an optimist, but in conferencing two \nresolutions, which cover 44 percent on the part of the Senate and zero \npercent on the part of the House, I am doubtful of reaching a number \ngreater than the already inadequate number of 44 percent provided in \nthe Senate. This stands in stark contrast to the budget that the \nPresident submitted this February and to the budgets the President has \nsubmitted over each of the last 6 years. All of those budgets provided \nthe revenue room to make bipartisan tax relief permanent. In other \nwords, the President is asking Congress to take action so that the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of our country would not happen; \nand if it did happen, it would happen without a vote of the people. He \nthinks that Congress making a decision for tax relief for working men \nand women provided the incentive, according to Chairman Greenspan, for \nthe economic recovery--and we have now created 7.8 million new jobs--\nand ought to be made permanent tax policy. In other words, don't kill \nthe goose that has laid the golden egg.\n  The Democratic budget resolutions can be best represented by a chart \nthat I have here which shows that in terms of the guaranteed tax relief \nproposal, they amount to a big goose egg for the American taxpayer. We \nhave it right here on the chart. That is a big fat zero. If they are \nlucky, I suppose college-bound taxpayers could sell this goose egg back \nto the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate because they will \nneed the money if they are not able to deduct the cost of tuition.\n  What is even more inexplicable than the Democrats' failure to extend \nthe popular and bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 are some \nof the reasons given. The chairman of the Budget Committee this year \nbasically said that since the Republicans wrote that law--forgetting \nthat it was bipartisan in 2001; how clever to ignore that fact--it is \nour problem. The leftwing of the blogosphere has echoed that message of \nthe Democratic leadership.\n  In regard to the left side of the blogosphere, I will briefly \ndescribe two posts my staff found on the Internet. The first comes from \na scholar of government who posts the Daily Kos under the name of \n``piec.'' I may be mispronouncing that, and if so, it is unintentional.\n  According to piec's analysis, the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005, which was signed last May by President \nBush, was a ``poison pill'' designed to sabotage the economy to \nincrease the prospects of Republican candidates in 2012. The argument \nseems to be that having popular and bipartisan tax relief from 2001 and \n2003 all sunset at the end of 2010 would cause such an economic mess \nthat the Democrats, assumed by the blogger, piec, to be in power at \nthat time, will take the blame and suffer at the polls.\n  Wouldn't it have been nice if I could think as chairman, when we \nwrote that bill, that I was smart enough to see ahead from 2001 to \n2012? Thank you, piec, for giving me that credit. But I didn't know \nthat. We passed it because of the rules in place at that particular \ntime. It had to sunset.\n  Another observer of Government posted comments under the name of \n``Blue Bunting'' to the ``Care2 News Network.'' In a posting titled \n``The Monster Republican Tax Hike,'' Blue Bunting says that the \n``Republican Congresses chose not to make their tax cuts . . . \npermanent.'' Her argument seems to be that Republicans put sunset \nclauses in a bill solely to improve the long-term budget projections \nand that responsibility for the expiration of tax relief rests \ncompletely with the Republicans, even though the Republicans are in the \nminority. The implication is that by lowering taxes, Republicans are \nresponsible for a tax increase that would occur when the Democratic \nmajorities control both Houses of Congress, even though taxes coming in \nfrom all the taxes that the Federal Government collects run to a 50-\nyear average of what they have been, 18.6 percent of GDP. If it has \nbeen that way for 50 years, what is the problem?\n  Now, these blogs I have just referred to, these commentaries, are \navailable to anyone if you want to read them online. But to make it \neasier, I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Daily Kos, Feb. 27, 2007]\n\n                 TIPRA, the Poison Pill (A Commentary)\n\n                               (By Piec)\n\n       I was reading the diary, ``Capital Gains and Dividend Tax \n     Cuts Are Robbery'' by Dean Nut 2/18/2007. Interesting thought \n     . . . to have all your income coming from investment just to \n     have a lower tax.\n       I'd say, though, that is a very risky way to live because \n     then you're totally at the mercy of selfish, economy \n     saboteurs who we have stupidly elected to our very own \n     government. What a shameful group of individuals they are, \n     too! Caring nothing for their country. Caring only for their \n     selfish, hogging selves! Everyone of them should be tried as \n     traitors!\n       Look back to recent history, to May 17, 2006. What happened \n     on that day? Bush signed the extension of the Jobs and Growth \n     Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). The new bill, \n     called the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n     2005 (TIPRA), didn't have anything to do with stimulating the \n     economy in a post-911 period. Bush and his fellow Republicans \n     knew that the war wasn't going well and that the U.S. people \n     were down on them for it. The mood of the country was \n     becoming increasing more anti-Republican with every U.S. \n     soldier that came home in a coffin. The Republican party was \n     bleakly looking toward the November 2006 elections and surely \n     would lose their tails off. The party needed to do some long-\n     range planning. Thus, the TIPRA passed legislature: The House \n     of Representatives approved (H.R. 4297) by a vote of 244 \n     Republicans to 185 Democrats opposed, and the Senate approved \n     it 54 Republicans to 44 Democrats opposed.\n       Yes, this was long-range planning. TIPRA was a poison pill \n     for the U.S. economy because it extended the pain that people \n     would start feeling in their pocket books beginning on \n     January 1, 2008. Originally, 2008, a presidential election \n     year, was set up to be the ONLY year that the capital gains \n     tax rates for 10 percent and 15 percent bracketed filers \n     would drop from 5 percent to 0 percent. Short term, this \n     bottoming out of tax rates in those tax brackets would \n     stimulate the market and, thus, the economy. But because of \n     the extension created with TIPRA, the rock bottom percentage \n     would not be a ``good thing'', but a huge market-swinger, a \n     market-swinger toward recession--simply because the \n     Republicans wished the ``good thing'' to become a poison pill \n     and, thereby, drag controlling-democrats down into a \n     spiraling hole for the duration of three, entire years.\n       On January 1, 2011, as the law now stands, everything will \n     sunset. This, 2011, is the third year of the next \n     presidential election cycle. Right when the country will be \n     deepening into recession, the tax brackets will sunset. This \n     means that everything tax-wise will be as it was pre-911. Ten \n     percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and \n     35 percent tax brackets will become, once again, 15 percent, \n     28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent, and 39.6 brackets. Actual \n     cash dollars will be squeezed out of every man, women, and \n     child in the form of raised taxes, and just when they thought \n     that they couldn't bleed anymore. The capital gains tax rates \n     will also sunset. The post-911 tax\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n     brackets of capital gains and qualifying dividend rates of 0 \n     percent for 10 percent and 15 percent bracketed filers and 15 \n     percent for everyone else will become the old 10 percent for \n     gains in the 15 percent bracket and all others will be 20 \n     percent. Plus, that screwing five-year holding period rule \n     will be back to trap people again for good. Yes, TIPRA's only \n     purpose was to sabotage the U.S. economy and drive the power \n     of Congress back to Republicans in 2012.\n       It absolutely makes me sick to see fellow Americans operate \n     like this . . . tear the whole country and weaken it, just to \n     satisfy some evil, selfish desire for power. We never sent \n     them to government to serve ONLY themselves!\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. To begin with, it is completely ridiculous to suggest \nthat President Bush and Republicans in general did not intend or desire \nthe permanence of tax relief. President Bush and my party generally \nhave favored permanence of tax relief--not just because it brings in \nless money, but because permanence of tax policy--when investors and \nlaborers can depend on the tax policy, you are going to get better \nplanning long term. It is better for the economy.\n  Mr. President, you need to look no further than the budgets to which \nI have referred. The administration and the Republican Congress have \nbudgeted for an extension of the bipartisan tax relief provisions. That \naction has affected the bottom lines of these budgets. And as we heard \nover and over again, the Democratic leadership, the liberal think \ntanks, and sympathetic east coast media have criticized the bottom \nlines of those budgets. So the Democratic leadership, the liberal think \ntanks, and the sympathetic east coast media cannot have it both ways. \nWe are not going to let them have it both ways. They cannot shut off \nthe bipartisan tax relief, take credit for the supposed deficit \nreduction, and also claim that there is tax relief in this budget that \npassed the Senate 2 weeks ago and the House a week ago.\n  Getting back to the blog I referred to, the Daily Kos, one posted as \n``Ortcutt'' agrees with this point. Ortcutt, however, incorrectly \nidentifies the purveyor of the phony logic. The blogger puts it on \nCongressional Republicans and President Bush. As the hard, cold numbers \nin the Democratic budget resolutions and floor debate in the \nCongressional Record show, Democrats claim that expired tax relief is \nnot a tax hike. Let me emphasize that.\n  Are we going to let people get away with that, when they know what \nthe law is on December 31, 2010, and the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country is going to happen, without a vote of the \npeople? And when that happens, they are saying it is not a tax hike?\n  Surely, they don't think the American people are that stupid. The \nDemocratic leadership are the folks trying to claim that their budgets, \nwhich don't provide the revenue room for expired tax relief, don't \ncontain tax hikes. Hogwash.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Ortcutt \ncomment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Having It Both Ways\n\n       The Republicans want it both ways on budgets and expiring \n     tax cuts. If you look at the CBO's budget outlook, there will \n     be a surplus in 2012. However, the only reason for that is \n     that the temporary tax cuts of the so-called Economic Growth \n     and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 will expire on \n     January 1, 2011. When a temporary tax cut expires is that a \n     tax increase or not? When the President Bush brags that the \n     budget will be balanced in 2012 without tax increases, he is \n     saying that letting a tax cut expire is not a tax increase. \n     But when Republicans debate extending the tax cuts, how many \n     Republicans do you think will cast letting a tax cut expire \n     as a tax increase. All of them. It's fundamentally dishonest \n     and disgusting. I just hope that we can get this fact through \n     to the American people.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, responding to another criticism, it is \ncompletely off the mark to say the tax relief bills were written by \nRepublicans. It is almost as if the Democratic leadership is saying \nthat tax relief was passed by a National Republican Congress and not by \nthe Congress.\n  The 2001 bill was written by a bipartisan majority and was opposed by \na partisan minority led by the Democratic leadership. The conference \nreport to accompany the law that was entitled the Economic Growth and \nTax Relief and Reconciliation Act passed the Senate on May 26, 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the information pertaining to that \nrollcall be printed in the Congressional Record so we can show it was a \nbipartisan rollcall.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in

Mr. President, the 2001 tax relief bill passed the \nSenate with 58 yeas. At that time, the Senate was evenly divided--50 \nRepublicans and 50 Democrats--with the Republicans technically having \ncontrol because of the Vice President's vote. However, not every single \nRepublican voted for that tax relief measure. Those 58 yeas included 12 \nDemocrats, nearly one-quarter of the 50 Democrats sitting in the Senate \nat that particular time. If all of those Democrats had voted against \nthe conference report, it would have failed.\n  Clearly, it is ridiculous to say this was purely a Republican bill. \nGiven the experience the Democratic leadership has had with cloture \nvotes in the past few months, I would expect them to appreciate the \nnecessity of working on a bipartisan basis in this body. This is the \nonly political institution of our system where minority views are \nprotected and must be respected because of no limit on debate, called a \nfilibuster, and it takes 60 percent, a supermajority, to overcome a \nfilibuster to get to finality. That is where Democrats were protected \nwhen they were in the minority for the last 6 years. This is where \nRepublicans are going to be protected for the next 2 years--and \nhopefully no longer than 2 years--as a minority.\n  It takes 60 votes to get permanent tax relief. The bottom line is, we \ndidn't have the 60 votes in 2001 and 2003 for making these bipartisan \ntax relief plans permanent. And with a couple exceptions I will discuss \nshortly, over the last 6 years, we haven't had the 60 votes for \npermanent tax relief.\n  So tax relief in 2001 was not made permanent because the Democratic \nleadership and the liberal core of the Democratic caucus have refused \nto support permanence, and that is apparent now more than ever with the \nbudget that is in conference between the House and Senate.\n  Of course, last November, the Democrats won control of both Houses of \nCongress. I wonder if the House Democratic leadership will be sending \nover any bills to make tax relief permanent. I doubt it. Even if the \nHouse Democratic leadership did send over such a bill, I would not \nexpect the Senate Democratic leadership to take it up. When in \nRepublican hands, the House regularly sent over bills to provide \npermanence for various components of the bipartisan tax relief bill \nwhich they couldn't get through the Senate.\n  Senate Democrats are clearly capable of working with Republicans to \nmake tax relief provisions permanent if they like what they want to \nmake permanent. And we have done it in the past. The Holocaust \nRestitution Tax Fairness Act of 2001 repealed the sunset of a provision \noriginally contained in the 2001 tax relief bill that allowed Holocaust \nsurvivors and their heirs and estates to receive restitution payments \ntax free. Making this provision permanent was absolutely the right \nthing to do, and the fact that it passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent proves that, and it passed it during a period when the \nDemocrats controlled the Chamber, indicating the level of cooperation \nthat occurred between Senate Republicans and Democrats when Democrats \nwant to make a provision of the tax law permanent law.\n  As I go through these examples, everyone needs to remember that \nholding the majority in the Senate is not a\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nticket for either party to force its agenda down the other party's \nthroat. Senate rules encourage cooperation by giving the minority many \nopportunities to check the majority, and this becomes even more evident \nwhen those majorities are very slim as they are right now--51 \nDemocrats, 49 Republicans. And they have been very slim for the last \nseveral Congresses.\n  I say this to point out that the Holocaust Restitution Act became \npermanent because Republicans and Democrats worked together to make it \npermanent, and it would not have been sent to the President if one side \nor the other wanted to block it.\n  I will give one more example that occurred last summer as part of the \npension reform bill. We call that the Pension Protection Act of 2001. \nIt passed the Senate 93 yea votes and made permanent--now here we have \nbipartisan cooperation to make permanent other parts of the tax bill--\nthe retirement security provisions of that 2001 tax bill. Even if every \nRepublican supported the bill, a united Democratic caucus could have \nheld back the five additional votes needed for final passage if they \nchose.\n  Clearly, Democrats have a record of working with Republicans to make \ntax relief provisions permanent when they choose to do it. So why not \nwork in the same way to make the rest of that tax law of 2001 and 2003 \npermanent so we don't have the biggest tax increase in the history of \nthe country without a vote of the American people, so we will have \npermanence of tax law, so working men and women can plan on the future, \nso investors who create jobs can plan on the future as well? That is \nbetter for the economy.\n  Let me return to the present day. The House and Senate, then, as I \nhave said so many times, passed separate budget resolutions, now in \nconference, but currently would end up subjecting Americans to the \nlargest tax increase in history, and the Democrats have responded by \nbasically declaring it is not their responsibility. How can a majority \nso avoid the responsibility of being a majority?\n\n  The Democratic leadership and the liberal core have the power to make \nthese provisions permanent. I assure my colleagues we will be there \nworking with them as we did on the retirement portions of the pension \nbill, as we did on the Holocaust relief bill, to make sure it becomes \npermanent law.\n  I think they should, but I realize they may not agree with me. \nHowever, if they do let tax relief expire, they have to take \nresponsibility for letting that happen. They have to take \nresponsibility for the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry happening without a vote of the people when they would have had \nthe cooperation of Republicans to make sure it was permanent and to \nmake sure this biggest tax increase doesn't happen.\n  Several times since November, I have heard that elections have \nconsequences, and one of those consequences is for the winner having \nincreased responsibility. Since Democrats have made tax relief \nprovisions permanent in the past--and I have given only two examples--\nthey can likewise do it again, and they will have Republican \ncooperation to make it happen.\n  One of the bloggers I cited earlier points out the economic calamity \nthat would befall our country if all tax relief was allowed to expire \nat the end of 2010. On this specific point, he is correct, and I gave a \nspeech to this effect right here on this floor on March 1 where I cited \na study done by the Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs.\n  If something is not done to extend or make permanent tax relief \nbefore the end of 2010, American families, working families, will be \nhit with a wall of tax increases that is currently built into the \nDemocratic budget resolution.\n  I have a chart. This chart shows, according to the U.S. Treasury, not \naccording to this Senator from Iowa, a family of four with $40,000 of \nincome will be subjected to an average tax increase of $2,052 all at \nonce. The Democrats, now in the driver's seat, need to decide whether \nthey are going to let that wall go up, whether that wall is going to \nstand between this taxpayer and more money for them to spend instead of \nmore money for me to spend for them, or are they going to take \nadvantage of the opportunity we give them to cooperate to prevent that \nbig tax increase of 2,000 and more dollars to go into effect for a \nfamily with an income of $40,000, as though there is something about \nbeing rich making $40,000 a year.\n  I want to conclude with a reference to a story about a man who cared \na great deal about the typical taxpayer, President Ronald Reagan. \nDuring the Cold War, while in West Berlin, President Reagan challenged \nSoviet President Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. I challenge \nthe Democratic leadership to tear down the wall of tax increases built \ninto their budgets. I hope my liberal friends in the core of the \nDemocratic caucus will urge the Democratic leaders to tear down the \nwall of tax increases they have built. This is not a wall Republicans \nbuilt. This is a wall Democrats through their budget built because they \nhave the power, they have a minority that is willing to cooperate with \nthem, as we have on two other instances I have given in these remarks. \nJoin with us in the Republican conference and tear down the wall of tax \nincreases that has been built.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cornyn pertaining to the introduction of S. 1096 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Senator Ted Stevens, Longest Serving Republican Senator\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, Senator Ted Stevens is not on the floor at \nthe moment. I am going to wait, if I may. I have the floor, do I not, \nMadam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am going to wait. I understand that Senator Stevens is on \nhis way. He will be here in a couple of minutes. I will await the \narrival, if the Chair will allow me, of Senator Ted Stevens. I \nunderstand he is on his way, and I want him to be present to hear what \nI am going to say.\n  Madam President, tomorrow, April 13, the very distinguished senior \nSenator from Alaska, my dear friend, Senator Ted Stevens, will become, \nif it is the good Lord's will, the longest serving Republican Senator \nin the history of these United States. It will mark his, Senator Ted \nStevens's, 13,990th day as a Senator. Senator Stevens, on tomorrow, if \nthe Lord let's him live, will surpass the late Senator Strom Thurmond \nof South Carolina, who served 13,989 days as a Republican Senator. \nTomorrow, Senator Stevens will serve, the good Lord willing, 13,990 \ndays.\n  This is a great honor and an important milestone in the Senate career \nof our esteemed colleague, my friend, Ted Stevens. I congratulate \nSenator Ted Stevens for this monumental, historic achievement. As the \nlongest serving Democratic Senator in the history of the Senate, I, \nRobert C. Byrd, welcome my friend, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, into \nthis most exclusive club. In fact, it is probably the most exclusive \nclub I know. There are only two of us, one Democrat and one Republican, \nin it.\n  I have served in this Chamber with Senator Ted Stevens for nearly \nfour decades. He came here in 1968. Senator Stevens and I have served \ntogether on the Senate Appropriations Committee since 1972. I was on \nthe committee a long time before that, but we, Senator Stevens and I, \nhave served together on the Senate Appropriations Committee\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nsince 1972. During these years of service together, we have developed a \nprofound respect and admiration for each other. We now share many \nmemories, both on and off the Senate floor.\n  One of my favorite memories is a very special personal one. I recall \nhow Senator Stevens would bring his baby daughter Lily with him to the \nSenate and carry her around the Capitol in a basket. Over the years, I \nhave become very close to Lily as well as her father. Lily is all grown \nup now. As a matter of fact, she will finish law school this year. But \nSenator Stevens remains the proud, loving father he always has been.\n  A couple of years ago, when the Senate was working into the late \nhours of the night and tensions were running high, as they occasionally \ndo around here, Senator Ted Stevens took me by the arm and pulled me \naside because he had something he wanted to show me. It was an article \nthat Lily had written about the U.S. Capitol that had just been \npublished by the U.S. Historical Society, and he, Senator Stevens, \nwanted to share it with me. I remarked at the time how touched I was by \nthis. It was a father's pride in his child's accomplishment. I recall \nit now as a loving reminder that the Senate is a family--the Senate is \na family.\n\n  Senator Ted Stevens is a Republican. I am a Democrat. Of course, we \nhave had a few differences in our lives. We have been here for a long \ntime on this floor--right here on this floor. But, actually, some of \nthem became quite heated. Senator Stevens, as you know, says what he \nthinks. He is a man. He is a gentleman. He is a Senator. He says what \nhe thinks. Oh, here he is, right here on the floor. I had to look \naround now to remind me he was there.\n  Now, some of these things have become quite heated. We both tend--\nSenator Stevens and I--to be strong-willed persons, U.S. Senators, with \ndifferent political philosophies. And each of us is determined to \nrepresent the best interests of his and my home State and the people--\nthe people--who send us here. So, naturally, at times, we are going to \ndisagree.\n  But I feel I can say before God and man and Senators--I feel I can \nsay without fear of contradiction--that not once--not once--have we \nallowed our political differences to become personal ones.\n  I have come to admire Senator Ted Stevens as a man of immense \nintegrity, high personal principles, and unqualified honesty.\n  I admire Senator Ted Stevens as a great American. He is a patriot. He \nis a patriot whose devotion for our country--this country, yours and \nmine--led him to join the Army Air Corps during World War II, where he, \nSenator Stevens, flew support missions for the Flying Tigers of the \n14th Air Force. For his service, Senator Stevens--he was not a Senator \nthen--but Senator Stevens, for his service at that time, was awarded \nnumerous medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross. Let me say \nthat again. For his service, he was awarded numerous medals, \nincluding--including--the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  In the 1950s, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Senator \nStevens began his long and remarkable career in public service by \nserving in various positions in the Eisenhower administration.\n  Senator Stevens is also a great legislator. In our nearly four \ndecades in the Senate, Senator Stevens and I have also worked together \non numerous bills. We have even cosponsored some together. This \nincludes S. 880, the Senate Family Leave Act, which is currently under \nconsideration in the Senate.\n  I especially admire Senator Stevens for his work on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. During his years as chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, he was bipartisan, cooperative, and \nrespectful of everyone, just the way the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, or any Senate committee, ought to be.\n  While noting that Senator Stevens has served as chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, allow me to point out that I have \nalways been impressed by the similarity of our careers.\n  As I have already mentioned, I am the longest serving Democratic \nSenator ever. Tomorrow, Senator Ted Stevens will become the longest \nserving Republican Senator.\n  Both of us have served as President pro tempore of the Senate and \nPresident pro tempore emeritus.\n  Both of us--Senator Stevens and I--have served as our party's whip in \nthe Senate. The ``whip'' is an old term. When the fox hunters went out, \nand they brought the hounds in, they used whips, and they knew how to \nuse them. So both of us--Senator Stevens and I--have served as our \nindividual party's--his is the Republican Party; mine is the Democratic \nParty--each of us has served as his party's whip in the Senate. The \nterm ``whip'' goes back a long way. It goes back to England and the \nHouse of Commons.\n  Both of us--Senator Stevens and I--have chaired the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and each has served as ranking member on the \ncommittee.\n  Both of us have been honored with recognition as the ``King of \nPork''--the ``King of Pork''--while I am sure the organization that \ngave us that title intended it to be something less than a compliment.\n  Madam President, I again congratulate this great Senator, this fine \nlegislator, this outstanding American for his historic achievement. \nSenator Stevens is truly the kind of man whom our country and this \nChamber need.\n  I close with a poem. I know it by memory. I am going to read it into \nthe Record:\n\n     Not gold, but only men can make a Nation great and strong; \n           men who for truth and honor's sake, stand fast and \n           labor long.\n     Real men who work while others sleep, who dare while others \n           fly. They build a Nation's pillars deep and lift them \n           to the sky.\n\n  Madam President, for the record, I will yield the floor soon, but for \nright now, I see on the other side of the aisle three very \ndistinguished Senators. I see Senator Ted Stevens, I see Senator \nCochran, Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Now, we are not supposed to say \nthese things such as this--and I see the great Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Isakson. By the way, let me tell my colleagues, Senator Isakson \ncomes over to my desk here every day I am here and he takes the time to \nshake my hand. He does. He takes the time to speak with me and to talk \nwith me. One day I may make a little speech on the Senate floor, God \nwilling, and I am going to talk about Senator Isakson. But today, I \nsalute my friend Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, does the Senator yield the floor at \nthis time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I regret I wasn't here at the \ncommencement of the comments of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, but I am overwhelmed and honored that he would make these \ncomments, and particularly that he would reference his relationship to \nour youngest daughter Lily who has great love and affection for Senator \nByrd. We have come through a lot of travails, each of us, during our \ntimes in the Senate, and I have always found Senator Byrd to be a warm \nand great friend in times of trouble and very gracious when in times \nsuch as this. We could stand here and I would tell the Senate some of \nthe times I have spent with Senator Byrd, including the time once in \nBritain when we gathered together a group of British and United States \nmembers of the British-American Parliamentary Conference and we \nlistened to Senator Byrd tell us about his life and some of the things \nhe had done as a child, and we listened to him recite many of the great \npoems he knows. He has one of the most prodigious memories I have ever \nknown, and he is the most gracious Member of the Senate. He always has \nbeen very kind and helpful.\n  I came here as an appointed Senator and took the position of--we \ncalled it the Bartlett seat, Senator Bob Bartlett's seat. Senator Byrd \nwas very gracious to Senator Bartlett as Alaska's first senior Senator, \nand he extended greetings to me as Senator Bartlett's replacement, and \nthroughout these nearly 40 years he has been a great friend. We have \nhad differences of opinion, but we have never had a disagreeable word \nbetween us. God willing, that will never happen.\n  So I thank my friend. He honors me, he honors my family, and he \nhonors the Senate by the remarks he made about the Senate itself. We \nare a family. This aisle ought not to be a canyon; it ought to be very \neasy to step across that aisle and shake hands with\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\na friend as I have just done. I thank the Senator for what he has said \nand for giving me the opportunity to be here when he said it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the very able and distinguished \nSenator from Alaska yield so I might say a few words?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator, my friend, for what he has said. I \nsalute him, my friend. I wish Erma, my darling wife, were here, sitting \nup in the gallery. We have rules that we don't speak to the gallery, \nbut I wish she were here. She knew Senator Stevens. She knew Mrs. \nStevens. She knew us, my wife, and Mrs. Stevens, who is not here today, \nbut my wife knew us, Senator Stevens and me, her childhood sweetheart, \nRobert C. Byrd, she knew we were friends, Senator Stevens and I, the \nclosest of friends. Now, when I say the closest of friends, Senators \nknow what that means. That doesn't mean Senator Stevens and I go out \ntogether at night and drink booze together or anything such as that. We \nare the closest of friends. I don't have anything against Senators or \nanybody else who wants to go out and drink booze. I don't. I won't say \nwhat I have done in my lifetime, but I know a little bit about what \nbooze is. I know what we are talking about.\n  Senators Stevens and I are the dearest of friends. I happen to be, \nthrough the good Lord's will, in my ninetieth year. I will be 90 in \nNovember, if it is the good Lord's will and I live to see the 20th day \nof November. I don't mind talking out loud, because as Popeye the \nSailor Man used to say: I yam what I yam, and that is all I yam.\n  Now, Senator Stevens--I am not supposed to address him, a colleague, \nlike this, but I am going to do that with the Senate's permission. This \nis not in accordance with the rules. Senator Stevens, I want to say to \nyou--I want to say to you in the presence of Senator Cochran, who is a \nSenator on the Appropriations Committee, along with Senator Stevens and \nme--I know the right grammar, you see--along with the Senator from \nMississippi, and me. Some might think I should say the Senator from \nMississippi and I.\n  I am supposed to say it, because I am talking in a different vein, \nbut Senator Cochran serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee with \nme. And he and I--in other words, he, Senator Thad Cochran and I--serve \non the Senate Appropriations Committee together, and Senator Stevens \nhas at times been the chairman of that Appropriations Committee. I was \nthe ranking member. What I am going to say, Senator Stevens and I--I am \nnot supposed to talk in the first person. We usually in the Senate talk \nto the distinguished Senator from Alaska. I want to say to Senator \nStevens, though, in the Senate, he is my friend. He knows that. Senator \nStevens, I admire you. I respect you. You are a great Senator from a \ngreat State. Under the Constitution, he and I, as Senators, belong to \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world. I respect the history of \nEngland and the House of Commons. That is a great body. The House of \nLords, that is a great body. But the U.S. Senate is the upper House, \nthe so-called upper House, and it is the upper House. There are two \nHouses, and the Senate is the upper House, because it used to be up \nthere in the old days, and so the Members referred to the Senate as the \nupper House.\n  Senator Stevens--I am going to speak to him as I shouldn't--I know \nwhat the rules are, but I am going to say to Senator Stevens directly \nthis may be the last time--who knows; it may not be--that I will ever \nspeak to him on the floor like this. Senator Stevens, I love you, I \nrespect you, and I admire you. I hope God will always bless you and \nhold you in the hollow of his hand. In the name of our Lord Jesus \nChrist, I pray and ask for the forgiveness of my own shortcomings. \nSenator Stevens, you are my friend, and we will let it go at that.\n  Madam President, I am going to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, all I can say to my friend is that I am \nalready blessed by God to be your friend, and I thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Mississippi \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here to hear the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my good \nfriend, and to join with others who have honored and paid tribute to \nSenator Stevens on the occasion of his reaching a milestone where he \nhas served in the Senate longer than any other Republican Member in \nhistory.\n  I had the privilege, when I was a new Member of the House of \nRepresentatives after my election in 1972, to observe Senator Stevens \nas he worked with Howard Baker as the Republican leaders of the Senate \nand to come to respect him and know him and then to join the Senate \nbody after the election of 1978. He has been a mentor and a dear friend \nthroughout my career in the Senate, and I can say one could have no \ngreater fortune than to serve in the presence of Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens and others who were the true leaders of the Senate when \nI was a new Member.\n  I have come to appreciate and respect them more as time has gone on. \nI recall Senator Stevens becoming chairman, after Senator Byrd had \nserved as chairman, of the Appropriations Committee. It was my good \nfortune to become a member of that committee after only 2 years in the \nSenate. I have appreciated the opportunity to work closely with him \never since.\n  Senator Stevens, of course, was our President pro tempore. I don't \nrecall a more diligent and hard-working President pro tempore than was \nSenator Stevens. He had some big shoes to fill: Strom Thurmond, Jim \nEastland from my State of Mississippi, and Senator Byrd; and all were \ndutiful. I recall Senator Stevens personally being there every morning \nto open the Senate, usually a duty delegated to others; and he probably \npresided personally over the Senate as much as any person who has \noccupied that position of responsibility.\n  To be here today and to hear Dan Inouye talk about his early \nrecollections of their service together in the Senate, and other \nSenators who have spoken on this special occasion in the life of our \nSenate, has made me happy to be here and to be able to observe and \nappreciate this day in the history of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to tell a quick story. I was in my \noffice working and watching the beginning of Senator Byrd's speech \nabout Senator Stevens. I was reminded that I had a picture of two \nfellows who came up from Georgia to cook for the Senate at a barbecue. \nIt is a picture of Senator Stevens, myself, and those two gentlemen. \nThe reason I ran over here is to say this: When I asked who the two \ngentlemen wanted to have their picture taken with, they said Senator \nTed Stevens. I think that is a testimony to his reach, which is far \nbeyond Alaska and to my home in Georgia.\n  Secondly, when I saw Senator Byrd speak, I knew he was speaking about \nSenator Stevens, and I realized the embodiment of history in the Senate \nthat these two gentlemen represent. To come and sit down as Senator \nThad Cochran came into the Chamber, I realized this 2-year rookie of \nthe Senate was sitting among greatness.\n  My favorite book of all time is ``The Greatest Generation'' because \nit tells true stories of those great men and women who, in the most \ncritical test in the history of our country, defeated the axis powers \nin Germany and in the Pacific and saw to it that this democracy \ncontinued. Senator Stevens fought bravely for this country in the \nPacific. As I was born in 1944, his generation was seeing to it that I \nwould have the opportunity to live the life I have and one day actually \ncome to the Senate.\n  Senator Stevens, I wanted to say, as a youngster in the Senate, thank \nyou for what you have done. You sacrificed, and you have allowed me to \nbe able to take advantage and eventually come to the Senate. I pass \nthose same compliments on to Mr. Cochran and Mr. Byrd. These are three \ngreat Americans with whom I am honored to share a moment today. \nCongratulations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran, I thank Senator \nStevens, and I thank the great Senator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, \nfor their kind words.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank God we were here today. I thank our \nHeavenly Father, especially, for this man, this Senator, Ted Stevens, \nand for his service to our country and to the Senate. I salute him as \none of the great Senators of my time--and I have been here a long time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                TAX DAY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today because it is that time of \nyear again. Tax day is almost upon us. As millions of Americans rush to \nget their taxes done this weekend, and many having just completed the \nprocess, we all know what a pain it is to have your hard-earned dollars \ntaken away by the Government.\n  Mr. President, if you thought this year was painful, I have terrible \nnews for you. It is going to get a lot worse. Under the new management \nin Congress, the Democrats have proposed a budget that would result in \nthe largest tax increase in America's history. That means more money \nwill be taken away from families and small businesses. Since we all \njust completed one, or are about to do so, I want to have us look at \nhow the Democrats are going to increase America's taxes on a typical \n1040 tax form.\n  Let's start up here with filing status. Say you are a married couple \nfiling jointly. The marriage penalty is back. That means married \ncouples are going to pay somewhere in the range of another $1,360 more \nin higher taxes because of the return of the marriage penalty.\n  Some taxpayers are going to find their exemption of $3,300 get cut to \nzero.\n  Go down to dividends and senior citizens. Anybody who has a dividend \nin this country is going to see their taxes increased on dividends to \n39.6 percent, which is an increase from the current tax rate on \ndividends of 15 percent.\n  Capital gains. Let's say you are a senior citizen and you have \ncapital gains income. Your tax rate is going to go from 15 percent to \n20 percent.\n  How about those families that are putting kids through college and \nare now taking advantage of the student loan interest deduction? Well, \nthat, too, is going to be capped for families making more than $60,000 \na year.\n  Let's move over to the taxpayers who itemize deductions, such as \nmortgage interest, charitable contributions, State and local tax \ndeduction. What is going to happen there is you are going to see this \ngo up; it will be capped, the amount they can deduct.\n  Take the alternative minimum tax, right down here. The alternative \nminimum tax is going to affect an additional 20 million Americans who \nare going to have to pay that.\n  How about the credit for child and dependent care expenses, which is \nsomething the working families in this country take advantage of. There \nagain, that credit is going to be slashed by 31 percent.\n  The child tax credit that a lot of working families in this country \ntake advantage of is currently at $1,000. That also is going to be \nslashed in half from $1,000 down to $500.\n  Let's take a look at the earned-income tax credit. Again, this is a \ncredit which is taken advantage of by a lot of lower income working \nAmericans and a lot of people who are serving their country--soldiers, \nmen and women in uniform--slashed.\n  Let's take a look at the tax rate schedule, too, because I think this \nis very important. If you are a taxpayer today paying at the 10-percent \ntax rate, the 10-percent tax rate is boom, gone, boom, gone, boom, \ngone, boom, gone. If you are paying at the 25-percent tax rates, your \ntaxes are going to go up to 28 percent. You lose the 25-percent rate. \nIf you are paying at the 28-percent rate, your taxes are going to go up \nto 31 percent. If you are someone who is paying currently at the 33-\npercent rate, your taxes are going to go up--boom--to 36 percent. If \nyou are someone who is currently paying taxes at the 35-percent rate, \nyour taxes are going to go up to 39.6 percent.\n  So what does all this mean? Everybody wants to know, when they do \ntheir taxes, what the bottom line is; how does it affect me when it \ncomes to the actual amount of taxes I am going to pay?\n  We took a typical family in South Dakota to see how it would impact \nthem. A typical family in South Dakota, when it comes down to computing \nthe amount they are going to owe in taxes under this Democratic budget, \nwill pay an additional $2,596 in taxes on top of what they are already \npaying this year if this Democratic budget is enacted.\n  The point I am simply making is this: When you get behind and read \nthrough all the fine print in the Democratic budget, you come down to \none simple conclusion: higher taxes--higher taxes for married couples \nbecause of the return of the marriage penalty. You are going to get \npenalized for being married. That is the ``benefit'' for being married, \nif the Democratic budget is enacted; higher taxes for seniors, who are \ngoing to pay a 39-percent tax rate on dividend income; a 20-percent tax \nincrease, from 15 percent, on capital gains distributions; higher taxes \non working families in this country who are trying to put their kids \nthrough college and who are going to lose some of the deductions they \ncurrently get for student loan interest.\n  If I take it over to the next chart, the credit for child dependent \ncare expenses, child tax credit, impacting working families, higher \ntaxes for working families, higher taxes for low-income Americans \nbecause of the earned-income tax credit, and again, most importantly \nprobably in all of this, the 10-percent rate lower income Americans \ncurrently pay is gone, it is eliminated--gone, boom. Every tax rate on \nthe rate schedule today is going to go up, from 25 percent to 28 \npercent, from 28 percent to 31 percent, from 33 percent to 36 percent, \nand from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. Every person in this country who \npays taxes today is going to see a higher tax bill because of this \nDemocratic budget. And as I said--every State can check this out for \nthemselves--in my State of South Dakota, a typical bill is going to go \nup by $2,596 over this year.\n  That is the bottom line. That is the bottom line on the Democratic \nbudget--higher taxes, the highest, biggest increase in taxes in \nAmerica's history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Congratulating Senator Stevens\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow our colleague and friend Ted \nStevens will mark his 13,990th day as a Senator. It is an auspicious \noccasion because he will pass Strom Thurmond as the Senator who served \nlongest as a member of the Republican Party.\n  I remember well when Ted Stevens came to the Senate in 1968. It seems \nlike only yesterday. It is a great honor to say we have served together \nhere for more than 38 years.\n  Ted was appointed to fill the seat of a true giant of public service, \nBob Bartlett, the architect of Alaska statehood, who had passed away \njust before Christmas in 1968. I can't help but think all these years \nlater that Bob Bartlett would be the first to pay tribute to what his \nfriend Ted Stevens has accomplished as his successor in the Senate.\n  I admire many things about my colleague from Alaska, the first and \nforemost being that he knows why he is here. He came to the Senate 9 \nyears after Alaska was admitted to the Union, a State nearly a quarter \nthe size of the continental United States and encompassing some of the \nmost unforgiving geography and weather in the world. It is a State of \ntremendous natural beauty and indomitable spirit, but also enormous \nchallenges brought about by its immense size, its distance\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nfrom the lower 48, and its close proximity to the North Pole.\n  Ted Stevens came to the Senate to fight for the State of Alaska and \nthe wonderful people who call it home. More than 38 years later, his \npurpose continues just as clearly and his determination just as strong. \nHis skill and passion in championing the people of his State are a \nremarkable tribute to the bond he has formed with the people of Alaska \nand his colleagues in Congress.\n  In fact, Ted Stevens has given his entire career in service to others \nand to his country. He is a true public servant, a servant in the \nfinest sense of the word. As a member of the Army Air Corps, he flew \nwith the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force and earned two \nDistinguished Flying Crosses. The slogan of the Army Air Corps in those \ndays was: The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a \nlittle longer.\n  That has certainly been true of his service in the Senate, too. He \nhas been a respected leader on military issues and a strong defender of \nsome of the bravest workers in the world, our Nation's fishermen. We \nshare that love for fishermen and for the sea, as our two States are \ndefined by their relationship with the sea, its bounty, its beauty, and \nits mystery.\n  He has answered the call of public service in countless ways time and \ntime again. I saw his passion and determination to improve the lives of \nNative Alaskans when I traveled with him in his first year as a Senator \nto visit remote villages in Alaska back in April of 1969, and it is the \nsame passion and determination I see today.\n  Ted, Walter Mondale, and I traveled over 3,600 miles throughout the \nState visiting Anchorage, Pilot Station, Arctic Village, and other \nvillages. We traveled at times by ski plane and even by dogsled.\n  We were traveling with the Senate Subcommittee on Indian Education, \nand I will never forget what we saw. There were no Native Alaskan \nteachers and few spoke native languages, making it nearly impossible \nfor the schoolchildren to learn, many of whom had never even heard \nEnglish. We saw villages where people had to walk 2 miles through \nfrozen tundra to find drinking water and other villages where only 8 \nout of 100 Native Alaskans were graduating from high school.\n  I remember our subcommittee hearing in Fairbanks and the Pilot \nStation teacher who told us that the warmest she could ever get her \nclassroom was zero degrees Fahrenheit. Imagine children trying to learn \nwhen it is that cold in the classroom.\n  More than anything else, I remember Ted Stevens determination to \nimprove the lives of the people and give them the opportunity to build \na better future. We were able to pass legislation to improve water \ntreatment facilities in Native Alaskan villages and improve education \nfor the children as a result of that trip--and none of it would have \nhappened without Ted Stevens.\n  I also feel a special closeness with Ted because in addition to the \nmany years we have served side by side, we both share the same soft-\nspoken and gentle approach for advancing our priorities and the many \ncauses we care about so deeply. I only wish he were a Democrat.\n  I also pay tribute to Ted's wonderful wife Catherine. She is an \nextraordinary woman, a person of enormous kindness and compassion who \nhas been so understanding over the years of the demanding and often \nbizarre schedules we keep in this Chamber.\n  I have come to know her through her impressive service to the Kennedy \nCenter, where she has made such a great impact on the Board of \nTrustees. This milestone is very much hers as well. We know the \ninnumerable sacrifices a Senator's spouse has to make--especially those \nwho make their home on the farthest side of the continent.\n  So I congratulate both Ted Stevens and Catherine Stevens on this \nextraordinary milestone. Well done, my friends, and best wishes for \nmany more record-breaking days among us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again, I am indebted to my friend from \nMassachusetts. We have spent many times together and, as he says, \nshared a great many goals. I am very pleased that he would make these \nremarks. I think that it sort of reminds me of a little bit of a little \ntoo much ado about nothing, but I do appreciate him being here. Thank \nyou very much.\n  As Senator Kennedy leaves, I should repeat something I have told \noften, and that is, back in 1969, as a brandnew appointed Senator, I \njoined Senator Kennedy and others in going to the villages of Alaska. \nWe found mold on the hospital walls in Bethel. When we came back, we \nstarted the process of replacing it, and it is a beautiful hospital \ntoday.\n  But we also went to the small villages. We went down to Pilots \nStation, and we were walking through this little village. All of a \nsudden, a little boy, baby boy, came running out, had a top on, but he \nobviously had lost his diaper.\n  My friend scooped him up, unzipped his parka, and put him inside. We \nwalked around to find out where his home was. We came to this nice, \nsmall, well-kept native cabin. It was obvious that the mother was \nlooking for her son.\n  We went in and Senator Kennedy gave her the boy, and there on the \nwall of that little cabin was his brother, President Kennedy's \nphotograph. It is a small world. I will never forget it. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Another Warning on Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to again address the terrible \ncrisis in Darfur and the surrounding region. For the last few months, I \nhave come to the floor on a weekly basis to remind my colleagues and \nthose who follow the transactions in the Senate that while we have \ndebated many important issues, we have not done enough when it comes to \nthe genocide in Darfur.\n  About 4 years ago, President Bush acknowledged that a genocide was \ntaking place. It is a rare occurrence for a President of the United \nStates to make that admission. I saluted him for that and praised him \nbecause it took courage. He said what others were afraid to say, that \nthe killing in Darfur of hundreds of thousands of people was, in fact, \na genocide--a calculated effort to wipe a people off the map. Several \nhundred thousand have died, and more than a million have been displaced \nfrom their homes. The genocide in Darfur continues to this day. \nAlthough we have pronounced this situation to be one of the most \nuncivilized in the history of our planet, the fact is that little or \nnothing has been done to save these poor innocent people.\n  This week's newspapers across the country were full of stories about \nSudan. The papers illustrate both the expansion of death, destruction, \nand chaos in and around Darfur and the inability or unwillingness of \nthe United States and other countries to stop this violence.\n  Wednesday's Washington Post described how Sudanese jingaweit \nmilitiamen crossed over the border into neighboring Chad and killed \nhundreds of people. This article, which I came across as I was reading \nthe paper, is graphic. A report in the Washington Post through the \nAssociated Press on April 10 says that:\n\n       Sudanese Janjaweed militiamen killed as many as 400 people \n     in the volatile eastern border region near Sudan, leaving an \n     ``apocalyptic'' scene of mass graves and destruction, the \n     U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.\n\n  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in this article:\n\n       Estimates of the number of dead have increased \n     substantially and now range between 200 and 400. Because most \n     of the dead were buried where their bodies were found--often \n     in common graves owing to their numbers--we may never know \n     the exact number.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The attackers encircled the villages, opened fire, pursued \n     fleeing villagers, robbed women and shot the men, the U.N. \n     High Commissioner for Refugees said. Many who\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\n     survived the initial attack died later from exhaustion and \n     dehydration, often while fleeing.\n\n  Some have argued that the genocide is over, as sad and tragic as it \nwas, that it is finished, but this news article tells us a different \nstory. The report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \nthat 200 to 400 people were slaughtered is a grim reminder that this \ncountry, having declared a genocide in Darfur, cannot stand idly by as \nthese reports are made.\n  When I consider the situation in Darfur, I understand that it is a \nchallenge for the United States to think about what we might do to make \nthis situation better. We know that violence is not only spreading \nacross the border into eastern Chad but continues virtually unabated in \nthis country of Sudan.\n  Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is traveling to Sudan this \nweek to deliver a message to Khartoum. I am hopeful. John Negroponte is \na seasoned diplomat. He is being sent on an important mission. I hope \nhis message is nothing short of a final warning that the Government of \nSudan must accept the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping \nmission and that these peacekeeping forces must have the numbers, the \nequipment, and the mandate to truly protect the innocent people of that \ncountry.\n  I have read newspaper accounts that President Bush is angry and \nfrustrated over Sudan's refusal to accept the peacekeepers and our \ncollective failure to do anything about it. I have spoken personally to \nthe President twice about this issue, and both times I have urged him, \nhaving shown the courage to declare a genocide in Darfur, to show the \nsame courage in ordering an action by the United States that will start \nto protect these people. My frustration and anger grows by the day, but \nmy sadness grows more when I read these press accounts.\n  I have been told by members of the administration that one thing that \nwould help would be stronger civil penalties to levy against persons \nwho currently violate our sanctions laws against Sudan. I am happy to \nintroduce legislation which would do that. I also believe we need to \nstrengthen sanction laws themselves to provide additional resources to \nensure their enforcement. Even more importantly, we must convince the \nworld to act as well.\n  The largest single economic player in the Sudan today is China. The \nsingle greatest export for Sudan is oil. Petrochina, the Chinese \ncompany, is a major player in that nation. That offers the Chinese \npowerful leverage to convince the Khartoum Government to accept U.N. \npeacekeepers.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, in what is billed as an unusually \nstrong message, the Chinese urged Sudan on Wednesday to show more \nflexibility on a peace plan for the devastated Darfur region, but they \nwent on to say the Chinese said that other countries would not help the \nsituation by dictating the terms of action.\n  This article goes on to talk about China buying oil from Sudan and \nholding veto power in the U.N. Security Council. There have been many \ncritics of China because, frankly, they have threatened a veto if we \ntry to take action through the Security Council to deal with the \ngenocide in Darfur. Perhaps that is what motivated the Assistant \nForeign Minister Ahzi Jun to hold a press conference on his return from \na trip to Sudan. He said at the end of that press conference:\n\n       We suggest the Sudan side show flexibility and accept this \n     plan--\n\n  That is the peace plan--\n\n     offered by the U.N. to deploy a hybrid African Union-U.N. \n     force into Darfur.\n\n  These are moderate words from the Chinese. I really had hoped for \nmore. But at least they are speaking out, I think none too soon, as we \nread this terrible press account of what is occurring in this region.\n  Recently, the Wall Street Journal, on March 28, 2007, published an \narticle written by Ronan Farrow and Mia Farrow entitled ``The Genocide \nOlympics.'' That article reminded the readers of the Wall Street \nJournal of China's slogan for the 2008 Olympics. The slogan is ``One \nWorld, One Dream.'' But what they note here is that what is going on in \nDarfur is a nightmare, and the Chinese have to do something about \nit. They make a point--and one we all appreciate--that we want to \nbelieve that China is moving into the family of civilized nations, that \nthe Olympics will be proof of this change in China over the years, but \nmany of us will judge China not by its slogans or its press releases \nbut by its actions.\n\n  This month, the United Kingdom is chairing the U.N. Security Council. \nNext month, the United States will hold that position. I think it is \nimperative that the United States force a vote on multilateral actions \nagainst the Sudanese. That is the only way to move us toward a \npeacekeeping force.\n  Some argue that China may veto that resolution, but that shouldn't \nstop us. If they want to go on record as standing in the way of \nstopping this genocide, so be it. It will be a bitter commentary on \ntheir aspirations for one world and one dream.\n  There is also an effort underway in the United States for divestment. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports the Council of Priests of the Archdiocese \nof Los Angeles has added their voice in calling for divestment of \ncompanies operating in Sudan. At the urging of one of their members--a \npriest who is a former stockbroker--the council wrote to the firm which \nhandles the retirement accounts for the 350 priests in the Archdiocese \nurging it to sell its shares in Petrochina and Sinopec Corporation. \nThat investment firm is Fidelity, which is the single largest U.S. \nholder of American shares in Petrochina. They have reportedly been \nhearing from thousands of their shareholders on this subject.\n  I am not a shareholder in Fidelity, but I have our family investments \nthrough mutual funds in this company, and I will be notifying them that \nif they do not divest their holdings of this Chinese oil company in \nSudan on a timely basis, that I will be changing my company. I think \nthat is a small thing. I don't have that big of an account, but if \nothers will join me in that effort, perhaps they will think twice about \nthese investments.\n  Petrochina and Sinopec are involved in some of Sudan's largest oil \nprojects. My guess is the retirement accounts of 350 Catholic priests \nin Los Angeles won't make a big impact on Fidelity, but I certainly \nhope a number of others will join me in letting them know it is time to \ndivest of this investment.\n  Along with Senator Cornyn of Texas and a growing number of bipartisan \ncosponsors, I have introduced legislation to support efforts by State \nand local governments to divest of holdings in the Sudan. There are \nsome who say that divestment is not the way to go. They claim it is \njust going to take too long. But is that an excuse for doing nothing to \npressure the Sudanese in the midst of a genocide?\n  The violence in Darfur has been going on for 4 years. The President \ndeclared 2 years ago that this was genocide. To say divestment is too \nslow ignores the fact that every pressure point we apply makes it a \nlittle bit harder for the Sudanese Government to continue on their \npresent course. I see no reason we shouldn't take every step we can to \nend this disaster. Eight States and over fifty colleges and \nuniversities are leading the way.\n  I am proud that my home State of Illinois was the first to pass \ndivestment legislation. Already, investment firms that offer Sudan-free \ninvestment vehicles are tracking billions of investments. Several major \nEuropean and Canadian companies have ended their operations in the \nSudan. The divestment campaign is already having an impact.\n  Some people also criticize divestment efforts because anti-apartheid \nlaws from two decades ago are still on the books in some states and \nlocalities. The bipartisan bill I have introduced with Senator Cornyn \naddresses this issue with a sunset clause: If the Federal Government \nlifts its sanctions against Sudan, the authorization provided in our \nbill would expire.\n  Finally, some argue that State governments should not be making \nFederal policy. Divestment is about States making choices about how \nthey invest their pensions and other funds. The Durbin-Brownback bill \nrecognizes that choice and extends Federal support for it in the face \nof ongoing genocide in Sudan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article I am about to refer to be \nprinted in the Record after my reference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this article is from the Atlantic \nMagazine,\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nApril 2007 issue. I came across it and was attracted to the title of \nthis article by Steven Faris titled ``The Real Roots of Darfur.''\n  When we have this debate about global warming and talk about climate \nchange, we talk about the impact it might have on a great State such as \nFlorida over many years and other places around the world. Mr. Faris \nwrites an article that talks about the climate change in this area, the \nDarfur region, which has taken place over the last several years. What \nthey once billed as an occasional drought or bad agricultural practices \nnow has become a recurring trend.\n  Here is what Mr. Faris wrote in the Atlantic Magazine:\n\n       By the time of the Darfur conflict 4 years ago, scientists \n     had identified another cause. Climate scientists fed \n     historical sea-surface temperatures into a variety of \n     computer models about atmospheric change. Given the \n     particular pattern of ocean temperature changes worldwide, \n     the model strongly predicted a disruption in African \n     monsoons.\n\n  Of course, the rainy seasons.\n  Columbia University's Alessandra Giannini led one of the analyses and \nsaid:\n\n       This was not caused by people cutting trees or overgrazing. \n     The roots of the drying of Darfur, she and her colleagues \n     have found, lay in changes to the global climate.\n\n  There is a competition here for land between farmers and those who \nhave livestock, and that is part of the tension in this area.\n  The article goes on to conclude:\n\n       With countries across the region and around the world \n     suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in \n     the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos.\n\n  Environmental degradation creates very dry tinder, so if someone \nwants to light a match to it, they can light it up.\n  I wish to put this into the Congressional Record for those who follow \nthis debate because I have spoken about a lot of reasons for the \nviolence here, and it is the first time I have seen a suggestion of \nenvironmental causation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        The Real Roots of Darfur\n\n                           (By Stephan Faris)\n\n       To truly understand the crisis in Darfur--and it has been \n     profoundly misunderstood--you need to look back to the mid-\n     1980s, before the violence between African and Arab began to \n     simmer. Alex de Waal, now a program director at the Social \n     Science Research Council, was there at that time, as a \n     doctoral candidate doing anthropological fieldwork. Earlier \n     this year, he told me a story that, he says, keeps coming \n     back to him. De Waal was traveling through the dry scrub of \n     Darfur, studying indigenous reactions to the drought that \n     gripped the region. In a herders' camp near the desert's \n     border, he met with a bedridden and nearly blind Arab sheikh \n     named Hilal Abdalla, who said he was noticing things he had \n     never seen before: Sand blew into fertile land, and the rare \n     rain washed away alluvial soil. Farmers who had once hosted \n     his tribe and his camels were now blocking their migration; \n     the land could no longer support both herder and farmer. Many \n     tribesmen had lost their stock and scratched at millet \n     farming on marginal plots.\n       The God-given order was broken, the sheikh said, and he \n     feared the future. ``The way the world was set up since time \n     immemorial was being disturbed,'' recalled de Waal. And it \n     was bewildering, depressing. And the consequences were \n     terrible.''\n       In 2003, another scourge, now infamous, swept across \n     Darfur. Janjaweed fighters in military uniforms, mounted on \n     camels and horses, laid waste to the region. In a campaign of \n     ethnic cleansing targeting Darfur's blacks, the armed \n     militiamen raped women, burned houses, and tortured and \n     killed men offighting age. Through whole swaths of the \n     region, they left only smoke curling into the sky.\n       At their head was a 6-foot-4 Arab with an athletic build \n     and a commanding presence. In a conflict the United States \n     would later call genocide, he topped the State Department's \n     list of suspected war criminals. De Waal recognized him: His \n     name was Musa Hilal, and he was the sheikh's son.\n       The fighting in Darfur is usually described as racially \n     motivated, pitting mounted Arabs against black rebels and \n     civilians. But the fault lines have their origins in another \n     distinction, between settled farmers and nomadic herders \n     fighting over failing lands. The aggression of the warlord \n     Musa Hilal can be traced to the fears of his father, and to \n     how climate change shattered a way of life.\n       Until the rains began to fail, the sheikh's people lived \n     amicably with the settled farmers. The nomads were welcome \n     passers-through, grazing their camels on the rocky hillsides \n     that separated the fertile plots. The farmers would share \n     their wells, and the herders would feed their stock on the \n     leavings from the harvest. But with the drought, the farmers \n     began to fence off their land-even fallow land--for fear it \n     would be ruined by passing herds. A few tribes drifted \n     elsewhere or took up farming, but the Arab herders stuck to \n     their fraying livelihoods--nomadic herding was central to \n     their cultural identity. (The distinction between ``Arab'' \n     and ``African'' in Darfur is defined more by lifestyle than \n     any physical difference: Arabs are generally herders, \n     Africans typically farmers. The two groups are not racially \n     distinct.)\n       The name Darfur means ``Land of the Fur'' (the largest \n     single tribe of farmers in Darfur), but the vast region holds \n     the tribal lands--the dars--of many tribes. In the late \n     1980s, landless and increasingly desperate Arabs began \n     banding together to wrest their own dar from the black \n     farmers. In 1987, they published a manifesto of racial \n     superiority, and clashes broke out between Arabs and Fur. \n     About 3,000 people, mostly Fur, were killed, and hundreds of \n     villages and nomadic camps were burned before a peace \n     agreement was signed in 1989. More fighting in the 1990s \n     entrenched the divisions between Arabs and non-Arabs, pitting \n     the Arab pastoralists against the Fur, Zaghawa, and Massaleit \n     farmers. In these disputes, Sudan's central government, \n     seated in Khartoum, often supported the Arabs politically and \n     sometimes provided arms.\n       In 2003, a rebellion began in Darfur--a reaction against \n     Khartoum's neglect and political marginalization of the \n     region. And while the rebels initially sought a pan-ethnic \n     front, the schism between those who opposed the government \n     and those who supported it broke largely on ethnic lines. \n     Even so, the conflict was rooted more in land envy than in \n     ethnic hatred. ``Interestingly, most of the Arab tribes who \n     have their own land rights did not join the government's \n     fight,'' says David Mozersky, the International Crisis \n     Group's project director for the Horn of Africa.\n       Why did Darfur's lands fail? For much of the 1980s and \n     '90s, environmental degradation in Darfur and other parts of \n     the Sahel (the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara) was \n     blamed on the inhabitants. Dramatic declines in rainfall were \n     attributed to mistreatment of the region's vegetation. \n     Imprudent land use, it was argued, exposed more rock and \n     sand, which absorb less sunlight than plants, instead \n     reflecting it back toward space. This cooled the air near the \n     surface, drawing clouds downward and reducing the chance of \n     rain. `Africans were said to be doing it to themselves;' says \n     Isaac Held, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration.\n       But by the time of the Darfur conflict four years ago, \n     scientists had identified another cause. Climate scientists \n     fed historical sea-surface temperatures into a variety of \n     computer models of atmospheric change. Given the particular \n     pattern of ocean-temperature changes worldwide, the models \n     strongly predicted a disruption in African monsoons. ``This \n     was not caused by people cutting trees, or overgrazing; says \n     Columbia University's Alessandra Giannini, who led one of the \n     analyses. The roots of the drying of Darfur, she and her \n     colleagues had found, lay in changes to the global climate.\n       The extent to which those changes can be blamed on human \n     activities remains an open question. Most scientists agree \n     that greenhouse gases have warmed the tropical and southern \n     oceans. But just how much artificial warming--as opposed to \n     natural drifts in oceanic temperatures--contributed to the \n     drought that struck Darfur is as debatable as the \n     relationship between global warming and the destruction of \n     New Orleans. ``Nobody can say that Hurricane Katrina was \n     definitely caused by climate change,'' says Peter Schwartz, \n     the co-author of a 2003 Pentagon report on climate change and \n     national security. ``But we can say that climate change means \n     more Katrinas. For any single storm, as with any single \n     drought, it's difficult to say. But we can say we'll get more \n     big storms and more severe droughts.''\n       With countries across the region and around the world \n     suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in \n     the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos. \n     Environmental degradation ``creates very dry tinder,'' says \n     de Waal. ``So if anyone wants to put a match to it, they can \n     light it up.'' Combustion might be particularly likely in \n     areas where the political or social geography is already \n     fragile. ``Climate change is likely to cause tension all over \n     the world,'' says Idean Salehyan, a political scientist at \n     the University of North Texas. Whether or not it sparks \n     conflict, he says, depends on the strength, goodwill, and \n     competence of local and national governments. (For more on \n     the economic, political, and military tensions that global \n     warming might create, see ``Global Warming: What's in It for \n     You?'' by Gregg Easterbrook, on page 52.)\n       In Darfur itself, recognizing climate change as a player in \n     the conflict means seeking a solution beyond a political \n     treaty between the rebels and the government. ``One can see a \n     way of de-escalating the war,'' says de Waal. ``But unless \n     you get at the underlying roots, it'll just spring back.'' \n     One goal of the internationally sponsored peace process is \n     the eventual return of locals to their land. But what if \n     there's no longer enough decent land to go around?\n       To create a new status quo, one with the moral authority of \n     the God-given order mourned by Musa Hilal's father, local \n     leaders would have to put aside old agreements and carve out \n     new ones. Lifestyles and agricultural practices would likely \n     need to\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n     change to accommodate many tribes on more fragile land. \n     Widespread investment and education would be necessary.\n       But with Khartoum uncooperative, creating the conditions \n     conducive to these sorts of solutions would probably require \n     not only forceful foreign intervention but also a long-term \n     stay. Environmental degradation means the local authorities \n     have little or no surplus to use for tribal buy-offs, land \n     deals, or coalition building. And fighting makes it nearly \n     impossible to rethink land ownership or management. ``The \n     first thing you've got to do is stop the carnage and allow \n     moderates to come to the fore,'' says Thomas Homer-Dixon, a \n     political scientist at the University of Toronto. Yet even \n     once that happens, he admits, ``these processes can take \n     decades.''\n       Among the implications arising from the ecological origin \n     of the Darfur crisis, the most significant may be moral. If \n     the region's collapse was in some part caused by the \n     emissions from our factories, power plants, and automobiles, \n     we bear some responsibility for the dying. ``This changes us \n     from the position of Good Samaritans--disinterested, \n     uninvolved people who may feel a moral obligation--to a \n     position where we, unconsciously and without malice, created \n     the conditions that led to this crisis,'' says Michael Byers, \n     a political scientist at the University of British Columbia. \n     ``We cannot stand by and look at it as a situation of \n     discretionary involvement. We are already involved.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to also ask unanimous consent \nthat the article I referred to in the Wall Street Journal be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Divestment is not the only answer, nor are stepped-up \nU.S. sanctions or even multilateral U.S. sanctions, but together these \nsteps might work. Hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur have been \nkilled, and millions have been driven from their homes. It is too late \nto repeat the empty promise of ``never again,'' but we can at least \nlive up to the pledge of no more.\n  I am reminded of my former colleague, boss, and mentor, Paul Simon of \nIllinois, who in 1994 joined Senator Jim Jeffords in asking that troops \nbe sent to Rwanda to try to stop the massacre. We were told that 5,000 \nsoldiers could have stopped that massacre of 800,000 innocent people. \nNo action was taken. These innocent people died. Senator Simon and \nSenator Jeffords did their best to try to call the attention of \nCongress and the Government and the world to what was happening in that \nnation, to no avail.\n  But they can at least take satisfaction--the late Paul Simon and Jim \nJeffords--that they did their best as Members of the Senate. So many of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle joined me in this bipartisan \neffort to call attention to the genocide in Darfur and to urge our \nGovernment to take decisive, meaningful action as quickly as possible \nto spare these suffering people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                         The Genocide Olympics\n\n                    (By Ronan Farrow and Mia Farrow)\n\n       ``One World, One Dream'' is China's slogan for its 2008 \n     Olympics. But there is one nightmare that China shouldn't be \n     allowed to sweep under the rug. That nightmare is Darfur, \n     where more than 400,000 people have been killed and more than \n     two-and-a-half million driven from flaming villages by the \n     Chinese-backed government of Sudan.\n       That so many corporate sponsors want the world to look away \n     from that atrocity during the games is bad enough. But \n     equally disappointing is the decision of artists like \n     director Steven Spielberg--who quietly visited China this \n     month as he prepares to help stage the Olympic ceremonies--to \n     sanitize Beijing's image. Is Mr. Spielberg, who in 1994 \n     founded the Shoah Foundation to record the testimony of \n     survivors of the holocaust, aware that China is bankrolling \n     Darfur's genocide?\n       China is pouring billions of dollars into Sudan. Beijing \n     purchases an overwhelming majority of Sudan's annual oil \n     exports and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp.--an \n     official partner of the upcoming Olympic Games--owns the \n     largest shares in each of Sudan's two major oil consortia. \n     The Sudanese government uses as much as 80% of proceeds from \n     those sales to fund its brutal Janjaweed proxy militia and \n     purchase their instruments of destruction: bombers, assault \n     helicopters, armored vehicles and small arms, most of them of \n     Chinese manufacture. Airstrips constructed and operated by \n     the Chinese have been used to launch bombing campaigns on \n     villages. And China has used its veto power on the U.N. \n     Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the U.S. \n     and the U.K. to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the \n     slaughter.\n       As one of the few players whose support is indispensable to \n     Sudan, China has the power to, at the very least, insist that \n     Khartoum accept a robust international peacekeeping force to \n     protect defenseless civilians in Darfur. Beijing is uniquely \n     positioned to put a stop to the slaughter, yet they have so \n     far been unabashed in their refusal to do so.\n       But there is now one thing that China may hold more dear \n     than their unfettered access to Sudanese oil: their \n     successful staging of the 2008 Summer Olympics. That desire \n     may provide a lone point of leverage with a country that has \n     otherwise been impervious to all criticism.\n       Whether that opportunity goes unexploited lies in the hands \n     of the high-profile supporters of these Olympic Games. \n     Corporate sponsors like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General \n     Electric and McDonalds, and key collaborators like Mr. \n     Spielberg, should be put on notice. For there is another \n     slogan afoot, one that is fast becoming viral amongst \n     advocacy groups; rather than ``One World, One Dream,'' people \n     are beginning to speak of the coming ``Genocide Olympics.''\n       Does Mr. Spielberg really want to go down in history as the \n     Leni Riefenstahl of the Beijing Games? Do the various \n     television sponsors around the world want to share in that \n     shame? Because they will. Unless, of course, all of them add \n     their singularly well-positioned voices to the growing calls \n     for Chinese action to end the slaughter in Darfur.\n       Imagine if such calls were to succeed in pushing the \n     Chinese government to use its leverage over Sudan to protect \n     civilians in Darfur. The 2008 Beijing Olympics really could \n     become an occasion for pride and celebration, a truly \n     international honoring of the authentic spirit of ``one \n     world'' and ``one dream.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, earlier today the Senate invoked cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to the fiscal year 2007 Intelligence \nauthorization bill.\n  However, as a result of objections from the other side, the Senate \nnow finds itself in the unfortunate position of having to run out the \nclock for the next several days rather than promptly considering and \ncompleting action on this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the long road we have been down with \nthis bill already.\n  The previous Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass an \nintelligence authorization bill in fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year \n2007--2 years in a row.\n  That is an unprecedented and unacceptable record for this body: prior \nto that, Congress had passed this bill every single year for 27 years, \noften with the bipartisan support of every Senator.\n  As my colleagues know, the Intelligence authorization bill funds the \noperations of the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community--\nincluding the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Defense Department--and all \nthe critical work they do to keep Americans safe and fight the war on \nterror.\n  It includes essential initiatives that would improve our efforts to \nfight terrorism and control weapons of mass destruction, enhance our \nintelligence collection capabilities, and strengthen intelligence \noversight.\n  Blocking the passage of this bill, as a handful of Senators on the \nother side of the aisle have done over the last couple of years, has \nleft Congress silent on these important matters and made America less \nsecure.\n  Most of us in the Senate recognize how important it is to pass this \nbill. We know it is not a partisan issue, that there are no political \npoints to be scored on either side. But I am increasingly disappointed \nat the continued obstructionism by several Republicans on a matter of \nnational security.\n  Earlier this year, Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond \nattempted to bring this bill up for consideration. We were told the \nobjections of a single Senator on the other side of the aisle blocked \ntheir efforts.\n  I have heard that some Senators on the other side of the aisle are \ninterested in offering amendments, yet at this time none of these \namendments have surfaced or seen the light of day.\n  I would certainly like to be reasonable and accommodate every \nSenator's interest in debating amendments offered in good faith, but I \nam increasingly concerned that we are seeing obstructionism and delay \ntactics, rather than productive debate.\n  Some may wonder what is behind the delay. At a time of war, why would \na handful of Senators be willing to hold up a bill that is crucial to \nour national security?\n  Why would a group of Senators hold up a bill that has always passed \nquickly, with little debate or amendment?\n  Why would they hold up a bill that enjoys overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport?\n  It appears the answer lies not in the legislation before us now but \nthe legislation the Senate will turn to next:\n  A Medicare bill that will lower drug costs for seniors and people \nwith disabilities by giving the Federal Government the power to \nnegotiate drug prices with some of this Nation's most powerful and \nprofitable companies.\n  This is not good faith debate--it is a cynical effort by the drug \ncompanies--their lobbyists in Gucci shoes and chauffeured limousines--\nand their supporters--to hold this national security bill hostage and \ndelay the Senate from acting on legislation to help society's most \nvulnerable.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider this fair notice: unless I see \nsome signs of good faith from the other side of the aisle toward a \nreasonable timeframe for considering a reasonable number of amendments, \nI will file cloture on this bill tomorrow.\n  The Senate has a lot of work ahead of it and it should begin with the \nswift consideration and passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, early next week, Members of the House and \nSenate will meet to work on the final version of the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The Senate's version of this \nlegislation provides $123 billion primarily for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, for improving the health care for returning soldiers and \nveterans, for continued Hurricane Katrina recovery for the gulf coast, \nto fill major gaps in homeland security, and to provide emergency \ndrought relief for farmers. The President has asserted that Congress is \nholding funding for the troops hostage for what he calls ``porkbarrel'' \nspending. What nonsense. Facts matter. Once again, the President does \nnot seem to know the facts. This is legislation that meets some of the \nmost critical needs of our troops and our Nation.\n  In the days since the Senate approved this legislation, the White \nHouse has taken on the regular practice of demonizing the Congress and \nattacking the bipartisan bill. On Tuesday, for instance, President Bush \nrepeated his hollow claims that the Army will run out of money if \nCongress doesn't finish this legislation by the weekend. What nonsense.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has reported that the \nArmy can use the dollars that Congress has already appropriated--some \n$52 billion--to help the Pentagon reach the end of May. Fifty-two \nbillion dollars. Unless the administration has a new military adventure \nup its sleeve that the country doesn't know about, that $52 billion \nwill easily pay for continued operations in Iraq.\n  The White House is spinning an imaginary tale of doom and gloom to \ntry to scare the Congress and the country. But the facts just don't \nsupport the administration claims.\n  To underscore this factfinding effort, the Army provided financial \nupdates to the House of Representatives this week and told House \nofficials that its current Army funding could last until the summer. \nYet, to listen to the White House, one would think that our soldiers \nwill be out of bullets by Sunday.\n  Another example of facts mattering. In remarks this week, before \nannouncing that the troops would see their tours of duty extended for \nat least 3 months and that his escalation would take many months longer \nthan he first planned, President Bush spoke of a reprogramming request \nfor $1.6 billion from personnel accounts. That is Washington-speak for \nshifting funds around to pay the bills. Basically, the Pentagon is \nconsidering a shift of dollars from September's payroll budget to fund \nthe President's surge plan. Yet, to hear the dire claims coming from \nthe White House, this shift would wreak havoc on the Pentagon. The \ntruth is that no havoc will ensue. This shift is one that the Pentagon \nhas adopted on many occasions in years past, during times of war and \npeace. This is a simply accounting move, not a major blow to the \nPentagon's war machine.\n  It is time for the White House to drop this trumped-up crisis talk \nand get down to the truth.\n  Let's take a look at what the House and Senate have actually \napproved. The House and the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, have each \napproved nearly $100 billion for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines. The House and the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, approved \nfunding to improve the health care of our troops and our veterans. The \nHouse and Senate, on a bipartisan basis, approved funding to speed \nlong-delayed Hurricane Katrina reconstruction. The House and Senate, on \na bipartisan basis, approved funding to close the major gaps in our \nhomeland security that could be exploited at any moment.\n  These priorities, the White House claims, are extraneous and \nwasteful. On top of the $38 billion already approved by Congress for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, now the White House has requested $3.7 \nbillion more to rebuild Iraq. I cannot understand how the White House \ncan champion another $3.7 billion to rebuild Baghdad but object to $3.3 \nbillion to rebuild the hurricane-ravaged gulf coast of America. I \ncannot understand how the White House can press Congress to build new \nhospitals in Iraq but object to $1.7 billion to provide first-class \nhealth care for our veterans and another $1.3 billion for our troops \nreturning home from war.\n  When this legislation is finished, we will have a responsible plan \nthat provides key resources for our troops, takes care of our veterans \nreturning home from war, and rebuilds the communities laid to waste by \nHurricane Katrina. And Congress will listen to the American people and \ncraft a responsible framework for the Iraqis to\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\ntake control of their own nation. This is not legislation that should \nbe vetoed by this President; this is legislation that he should sign \ninto law.\n  We will announce a conference schedule soon and move forward quickly. \nOur goal is to have the final legislation to President Bush by the end \nof the month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ASSEMBLED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ALTERNATIVES PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the future of \nthe Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternative, ACWA, program, which is of \nvital importance to the people of Madison County, KY.\n  The people of Madison County are living right next door to over 500 \ntons of the deadliest material ever conceived by man. It is stored at \nthe Blue Grass Army Depot, BGAD. Understandably, those in the nearby \ncommunity would like to see these weapons disposed of as safely and \nquickly as possible. It is the mission of the ACWA program, as well as \nthe Department of Defense, to do just that.\n  Recently, the program manager for ACWA, Mike Parker, decided to \nretire. Mike has left big shoes to fill. The question then is, who will \ntake Mike's place? Whoever is picked to permanently fill his position \nwill need to possess a number of qualifications. These traits include \nan appreciation for the unique culture at ACWA. Central to that culture \nis the willingness to work collaboratively and openly with the local \ncommunity and with Congress. It would be unfortunate if the new program \nmanager, whoever it may be, were to attempt to impose solutions \nunilaterally onto the community and to act without transparency and \nconsultation with Congress. I also trust that the new program manager \nwill understand the need to complete work at BGAD as soon as is safely \npossible; not as soon as the department finds it to be convenient.\n  Finally, the new program manager needs to be fully committed to \nchemical neutralization at BGAD as this approach has already been \nselected by the department, embraced by the community and endorsed by \nthe state of Kentucky. Any variance from this path would only lead to \nadditional delay in eliminating the risks associated with these stored \nweapons.\n  The job of disposing of chemical weapons at BGAD is not just to be \nlaid at the feet of the program manager for ACWA. It is a mission \nentrusted to the Department of Defense. Accordingly, the department \nitself needs to provide oversight over ACWA to ensure that the new \nprogram manager is acting in a manner consistent with the way ACWA has \nconducted its business in the past.

Mr. President, for far too long the criminal justice \nsystem has failed to adequately address recidivism, and that failure \nhas imposed a large financial and social cost on the Nation. Even the \nbest-intentioned prisoners face debilitating challenges when they \nrejoin their communities, yet the current system leaves them ill-\nprepared to face those challenges.\n  Our existing policies of mass incarceration and release are not \nworking. Large prison populations and high recidivism rates place heavy \nburdens on prisons, communities, and taxpayers. Of the 2.2 million \npersons housed in prisons today--an average annual increase of 3 \npercent in the past decade--97 percent will be released into the \ncommunity. Overcrowding continues to plague the system. State prisons \nare operating at full capacity and sometimes as much as 14 percent \nabove capacity, and Federal prisons are 34 percent above capacity. In \n2005, prison populations in 14 States rose at least 5 percent. \nRecidivism and inadequate reentry programs add to the problem. Over \n600,000 prisoners are released each year, but two-thirds of them are \narrested again within 3 years.\n  The social cost of recidivism is devastating to communities, and it \nalso imposes a financial burden. States spend an average of \napproximately $22,000 annually to house a prisoner. Taxpayers spend \nmore than $60 billion annually on corrections, more than six times the \n$9 billion spent 25 years ago. Yet the current system still fails to \nadequately support the essential programs for health, housing, \nsubstance abuse, education, and employment that ex-offenders need to \nreintegrate into their communities. Even community and local law \nenforcement programs that are effective in helping ex-offenders often \nlack adequate resources and guidance.\n  Future generations will bear the burden created by today's high \nrecidivism rates. In 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported that 2 million children nationwide have an incarcerated \nparent. Studies suggest that these children are seven times more likely \nto end up in prison themselves. One study found that as many as 1 in 10 \nwill have been incarcerated before reaching adulthood. Of the \napproximately 100,000 juveniles who are currently incarcerated, many \nwill become recidivists because of a lack of effective reentry \nprograms.\n  This increasingly serious failure demands a comprehensive solution \nthat takes into account both the challenges that ex-offenders face and \nthe role of law enforcement and community and family-based programs in \nsuccessful reentry. That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the Second Chance Act. This legislation provides an \nopportunity for law enforcement, communities, and families to give \nformer offenders a helping hand that the vast majority of them will use \nto become productive members of society.\n  The Second Chance Act provides financial support, research, and \nguidance for proven and cost-effective solutions to the health, \nhousing, substance abuse, education, and employment challenges that \nformer offenders face in reintegrating into their communities. It funds \nmentoring grants, demonstration grants, drug treatment, and family-\nbased treatment. It authorizes the National Institute of Justice to \nconduct research on offender reentry and on the need for a national \nresource center for State, local, and community service providers to \ncollect and disseminate best practices. The bill also creates an \ninteragency taskforce to review and report to Congress on the Federal \nbarriers that so many ex-offenders face.\n  A second chance starts with a place to live. This bill will promote \nprograms that help recently released inmates overcome the first major \nhurdle they face--finding safe, adequate, and affordable housing. 15 to \n27 percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon release. \nFigures published by the Volunteers of America in 2004 indicated that \ntwo-thirds of former prisoners who lacked adequate housing had \ncommitted crimes within 1 year of their release, compared to only one-\nquarter of those who had housing. Another recent study released by the \nNational Criminal Justice Reference Service showed that 30-50 percent \nof parolees in urban areas such as Los Angeles and San Francisco are \nhomeless, which compounds the profound hardship that re-integration \nalready places on urban communities. The Second Chance Act supports our \ncommunities and local law enforcement by supporting housing programs \nfor ex-offenders, so that they can take the first steps towards getting \nback on their feet and rejoining the community.\n  The Second Chance Act also supports mental health care and substance \nabuse treatment programs that are vital to many ex-offenders as they \nstruggle to reintegrate. Nearly a quarter of State prisoners and jail \ninmates with a mental health problem had served three or more prior \nincarcerations, yet two-thirds of State prisoners do not receive mental \nhealth treatment. In substance abuse treatment, more than two-thirds of \nState prisoners have been regular drug users at some point during their \nlives, and one-third had committed the crime for which they were \nimprisoned while under the influence of drugs.\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\n  According to a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report, of the \napproximately 50 percent of prisoners who met the criteria for drug \ndependence or abuse, less than half participated in drug treatment \nprograms since their admission to prison. To address these issues, the \nSecond Chance Act reauthorizes mental health care and substance abuse \ntreatment demonstration projects and provides resources and best \npractices research to comprehensive community-based and family-based \nsubstance abuse programs. The programs supported by this legislation \ngive ex-offenders the care and treatment they need to remain drug free \nand out of prison.\n  We also cannot expect ex-offenders to become productive members of \nthe community if they don't have the education and vocational training \nthey need to find jobs. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that \nonly 46 percent of incarcerated individuals have a high school diploma \nor its equivalent. The limited availability of education and vocational \ntraining programs exacerbates the problem. Only 5 percent of jail \njurisdictions offer vocational training, and 33 percent of \njurisdictions offer no educational or vocational training at all.\n  Research shows what a profound effect such programs have on \ndecreasing recidivism rates. Recidivism for inmates who participate in \nprison education, vocation, and work programs have been found to be 20 \nto 60 percent lower than for nonparticipants. The Federal Bureau of \nPrisons found a 33- percent drop in recidivism among Federal prisoners \nwho participated in vocational training.\n  The Safer Foundation in Chicago found a recidivism rate of 8 percent \nfor participants in its vocational program, compared with 46 percent \nfor a comparison group. The Second Chance Act supports community \neducation and vocational training programs that have proven their \neffectiveness, and offers the tools and resources to study best \npractices on job training and placement. It also supports collaboration \namong community corrections, technical schools, community colleges, and \nthe workforce development and employment service sectors to help ex-\noffenders overcome the many barriers they face in finding employment.\n  In addition to addressing adult ex-offender reentry programs, the \nSecond Chance Act also supports juvenile ex-offender reentry programs \nthat put juvenile ex-offenders on the path to being productive adults \nand good citizens. The nearly 100,000 children who make up the juvenile \nprison population are among the most vulnerable and defenseless group \nin our criminal justice system. Too often, we fail to protect them. \nMany juvenile ex-offenders have learning disabilities and need \nsubstance abuse and mental health treatment. Many are incarcerated in \novercrowded facilities. All need an education and the support of \ncommunity-based programs to reintegrate them after incarceration. To \nhelp give juvenile ex-offenders the second chance they need to become \npositive forces in their communities, this bill reauthorizes the \nJuvenile Offender Reentry Demonstration Projects, creates a resource \ncenter to collect data and provide guidance concerning best practices \nfor juvenile reentry, offers grants to improve educational methods in \njuvenile facilities, and supports community and family-based juvenile \naftercare programs.\n  In Massachusetts, programs like those that the Second Chance Act \nwould authorize have already been nationally recognized for their \nsuccess. In Hampden County, Sheriff Michael Ashe and the Hampden County \nSheriff's Department have shown that law enforcement and community-\nbased reentry programs that focus on education, employment and \ntreatment are the most effective way to reduce recidivism and improve \ncommunity safety. States such as Massachusetts have been creating \ninnovative and effective reentry programs, and it is time for the \nFederal Government to do its part. Supporting such programs is the \nsurest way to ensure that when ex-offenders leave prison, they go with \nthe skills, guidance, and support they need to succeed.\n  I am especially pleased that the Second Chance Act will support the \nElderly Nonviolent Offender Pilot Program, which focuses on \nreintegrating nonviolent elderly offenders over the age of 60. The \ncurrent strategy of incarcerating elderly inmates who are no longer a \nthreat to their community is a waste of government resources and a \nhumanitarian failure, and the problem is only getting bigger as the \nelderly prison population grows. A 2004 report by the National \nInstitute of Corrections found that the number of State and Federal \nprisoners ages 50 or older rose 172 percent between 1992 and 2001, and \nsome estimates suggest that the elderly inmate population has grown by \nas much as 750 percent over the last two decades. Even conservative \nestimates suggest that the population of elderly inmates will represent \n33 percent of the total prison population by 2010. The average cost of \nhousing the increasing number of elderly inmates is reported to be \nabout $67,000, three times the average cost of housing younger inmates. \nAs the age of the inmate population grows over the next decade, the \ntotal spent on corrections will increase dramatically, even though \nnonviolent elderly offenders pose little risk to the community. And \naccording to a Department of Justice report, they have a recidivism \nrate of only 1.4 percent, much lower than the rate for younger inmates.\n  Housing elderly inmates also raises humanitarian concerns. Often they \nrequire treatment for chronic and fatal diseases, protection from \nyounger prisoners, and alterations to accommodate walkers, canes, and \ngeriatric chairs. According to the National Institute of Corrections:\n\n       [T]he lack of personal protection for elderly inmates, \n     which may be frail and therefore vulnerable to the threats of \n     assault by younger predatory inmates, contributes to the \n     emotional stress and physical deterioration they routinely \n     experience, especially among those who may be already \n     vulnerable owing to chronic illness.\n\n  Housing nonviolent elderly offenders is not just a financial issue. \nIt is also a humanitarian problem for which we must find new solutions.\n  Forty-one states already offer some kind of early limited release \nprogram for elderly inmates. The American Bar Association has recently \nendorsed a proposed amendment to the sentencing guidelines to allow \nmore lenient sentencing for nonviolent elderly offenders. By supporting \nthe Elderly Nonviolent Offender Pilot Program, Congress takes an \nimportant step towards addressing the humanitarian and financial \nchallenges of housing an aging prison population. The Federal Bureau of \nPrisons estimates that 378 nonviolent elderly offenders, and an average \nof 53 nonviolent elderly offenders a year over the next decade, will be \neligible for the program. It offers an opportunity to demonstrate the \neffectiveness of alternatives to housing elderly inmates, and I hope \nits success will lead to a more comprehensive solution to one of the \nimportant challenges facing the prison system.\n  When ex-offenders return to prison, all Americans pay a price, both \nsocial and financial. The Second Chance Act supports a comprehensive \nsolution to the recidivism problem in America--a problem that we cannot \nafford to ignore. It is a solution that allows local law enforcement, \ncommunities, and families to offer ex-offenders the programs and \nsupport they need to get back on their feet and become positive, \nproductive members of their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4431-S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DECEPTIVE FOOD PACKAGING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I call attention to a development \nwithin the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA, that has resulted in \nthe sale of carbon-monoxide-treated meat to American consumers. \nAllowing this can deceive American consumers and raises serious public \nhealth concerns since the consumers can no longer rely on the way the \nmeat looks to indicate its freshness.\n  The use of carbon monoxide turns beef a shade of red that mimics very \nfresh red meat. Mixing carbon monoxide into the pre-packaged, air-tight \npackaging of beef allows it to retain its red color long after the \nexpiration date on the package.\n  The meatpacking industry argues that beef is actually safe up to 20 \ndays when refrigerated and much longer if it is frozen. They also argue \nthat because untreated meat can begin to turn brown before its \nexpiration date, it is\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nnot a true indication of the meat's freshness and consumers should not \nbe relying on the color of the meat, but the expiration date on the \npackage.\n  That is a theoretical argument that fails in the real world. \nConsumers do rely on meat color and the industry knows that the only \npurpose of using carbon monoxide is to maintain the red color. \nExperiments with treated and untreated packages of beef compared how \nthey age under refrigeration. After the expiration date, untreated meat \nbegins to turn brown, while meat was still rosy pink if treated with \ncarbon monoxide. Even though the treated beef looked fresh, it was in \nfact contaminated with E. coli bacterium and salmonella.\n  The FDA has had longstanding rules against color alteration of meats \nbut, inexplicably, the FDA has allowed carbon-monoxide-treated \npackaging to move forward. I asked the Food and Drug Administration for \nan explanation of this change. In their response, the FDA claims that \nadding carbon monoxide to the packaging meets their standard of \n``generally recognized as safe,'' and no further FDA approval is \nrequired.\n  Relying on the procedures for substances that are ``generally \nrecognized as safe'' is inappropriate for color additives and surely \nthat should include any substance added to food whose purpose is to \nchange its color. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the \nFDA is required to issue, through notice and comment rulemaking, the \npermissible conditions of use in regulations ``listing'' the color \nadditive. The color additive ``listing'' procedure is a transparent \nprocess in which the public is engaged. Consumers have the opportunity \nto comment on the safety and deception risks that are presented. For \nthe FDA to allow the use of carbon monoxide for color alteration under \nthe ``generally recognized as safe'' notification procedure ignores the \nwell established listing requirements for public engagement in the \npolicy development process.\n  Since there are currently no requirements for the meatpacking \nindustry to label which meats have been packed in carbon monoxide and \nwhich have not, it is especially important for consumers to look for \nthe expiration date printed on all meat package labels and not just at \nthe color of the beef. Even if the meat is purchased before the \nexpiration date, consumers still need to be aware that beef packaged in \ncarbon monoxide can spoil at home yet still look fresh. If consumers \njudge the freshness of beef by its red color without checking the \nexpiration date on the package, they risk their health.\n  Prepackaged beef should not be treated with carbon monoxide, but at a \nminimum, meat that has been treated with carbon monoxide should be \nclearly labeled so that consumers know what they are buying.\n  Six consumer groups recently sent a letter to Senators asking that \nCongress take action on this important health issue. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Consumer Federation of America--Consumers Union Food & \n           Water Watch--Government Accountability Project National \n           Consumers League--Safe Tables Our Priority\n                                                 January 18, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: We write to urge Congress to institute a ban \n     on the use of carbon monoxide in a modified atmosphere \n     packaging (MAP) process for case-ready fresh meat. In January \n     2006, consumer groups sent a letter to the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     requesting the FDA and the USDA to re-visit their acceptance \n     of carbon monoxide usage in case-ready meats as a GRAS \n     (generally recognized as safe) substance. This request was \n     made for several reasons: (1) the science behind the decision \n     is questionable; (2) the decision was made without the \n     benefit of public dialogue and input; (3) this process has \n     already been banned in Europe; and (4) there is concern by \n     the American public that the meat that they purchase could \n     look fresher and safer than it actually is. However, despite \n     repeated calls from members of Congress and consumer groups, \n     the agencies have not acted.\n       The addition of carbon monoxide utilized in the MAP \n     processing of fresh meat produces a new, bright red color in \n     the meat, which then masks the natural browning of the meat \n     that would occur over time. This could induce consumers to \n     buy and use meat products that are not as fresh as they \n     appear. Furthermore, case ready packages of meat processed \n     with carbon monoxide are not at this time required to have \n     labeling informing consumers that such a process was used.\n       Even USDA has acknowledged the risk of misrepresentation to \n     consumers by noting that the use of carbon monoxide ``with \n     case ready fresh cuts of meat and ground beef could \n     potentially mislead consumers into believing that they are \n     purchasing a product that is fresher or of greater value than \n     it actually is and may increase the potential for masking \n     spoilage.'' This is precisely the situation Congress, by law, \n     intended to proscribe in establishing the adulteration and \n     misbranding provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (FDCA) and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) in the \n     early 1900s.\n       As a result of recent foodborne illness outbreaks which \n     sickened hundreds and caused several deaths, consumers are \n     becoming increasingly concerned about the federal \n     government's ability to protect them from contaminated food. \n     Consumers want more disclosure about food-processing \n     practices, not obfuscation, as is occurring with meat \n     utilizing a MAP process.\n       The use of carbon monoxide in the MAP processing of fresh \n     meat means that consumers have no way of judging the \n     freshness of the meat, which Consumer Reports found could be \n     spoiled even before the labeled ``use-by or freeze-by'' date. \n     Proponents of carbon monoxide disingenuously point to smell \n     as a telltale sign of spoilage but consumers can't use smell \n     with sealed packages before the point of purchase. They have \n     to wait until they have purchased the meat and taken it home \n     to open the package and be able to smell it. Those with \n     impaired senses of smell may have difficulty in detecting \n     ``off'' odors. In addition, those at greatest risk of \n     contracting the most serious forms of foodborne illness, such \n     as the elderly, may have difficulty reading the stamped dates \n     on the packages.\n       The Consumer Federation of America sponsored a national \n     survey that demonstrated overwhelming opposition from \n     consumers to the use of carbon monoxide in meat. When asked \n     whether the practice of treating red meat with carbon \n     monoxide is deceptive or not, 78 percent of consumers \n     surveyed said the practice is deceptive. In that same survey \n     68 percent of consumers said they would strongly support a \n     mandatory labeling law for carbon monoxide-treated meat.\n       In addition, industry insistence that consumers rely on \n     ``use-by'' or ``freeze-by'' dates to determine the freshness \n     of the meat is not valid. Conventionally packaged (on-site) \n     meat and ground beef generally has a shelf life of \n     approximately four to five days, at which time the meat turns \n     brown and is either discounted or discarded. Meat that \n     arrives in store in a ``case-ready'' condition in typical \n     packaging (packaging that has not used CO or the MAP process) \n     has a shelf life of 10 to 12 days, before the meat changes \n     color. Contrast these shelf lives with the 28-day shelf life \n     granted by USDA for ground beef that is packaged under a MAP \n     process utilizing carbon monoxide. Even after that period of \n     time, the artificially bright red color persists, lessening \n     the likelihood that consumers will check the ``use-by or \n     freeze-by'' date.\n       The findings of two studies, one by Consumer Reports and \n     one sponsored by Kalsec and conducted by S laboratories, \n     raised serious concerns that some carbon monoxide-treated \n     meat on store shelves and available to consumers may be \n     spoiled prior to the use-by date stamped on the package. \n     Additionally, a study conducted at Texas Tech and submitted \n     to the FDA by supporters of CO-meat seemed to corroborate \n     these findings--that CO-treated meat may be spoiled prior to \n     the use-by date on the label.\n       The question now becomes, ``Are the agencies acting in the \n     best interests of consumers?'' If you believe as we do that \n     they are not, then it is incumbent upon Congress to act.\n       As a result of the agencies' acceptance of this process and \n     unwillingness to revisit their decision based on new \n     information provided to them over the course of this past \n     year, the onus is now on consumers to determine for \n     themselves if the meat they are buying is fresh, not \n     presented to them in a deceptive manner, or potentially \n     unsafe. Unfortunately, consumers have been put in this \n     position without the information or tools to make these \n     determinations--such as clear labeling that indicates the use \n     and purpose of carbon monoxide, and communications programs \n     to inform consumers not to use color to judge the freshness \n     and quality of meat, as they usually do. As a result, \n     consumers have no indication that the color of this meat is \n     the result of the addition of carbon monoxide to the \n     packaging and are denied the opportunity to make informed \n     purchasing decisions. This practice therefore can deceive the \n     consumer into believing that meat is fresh when it may be \n     spoiled or that it is of higher quality than it appears.\n       We respectfully urge the 110th Congress to take this matter \n     up by instituting an immediate ban on the use of carbon \n     monoxide in a MAP process for case-ready fresh meat. This \n     meat is sitting, unlabeled, on grocery store shelves now and \n     no action by FDA or USDA to reconsider its GRAS decision \n     seems to be forthcoming, despite the numerous concerns raised \n     above.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chris Waldrop,\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\n     Jean Halloran,\n       Consumers Union.\n     Wenonah Hauter,\n       Food & Water Watch.\n     Jacqueline Ostfeld,\n       Government Accountability Project.\n     Linda Golodner,\n       National Consumers League.\n     Nancy Donley,\n       S.T.O.P.--Safe Tables Our Priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4433-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UPCOMING ELECTIONS IN NIGERIA\n\n  Mr. OBAMA.

To secure this victory for \nthemselves and for Africa, and to retain the kind of international \nconfidence in Nigeria's future that is essential for the country's \ngrowth, Nigerians need and deserve the strongest possible international \nsupport for free, fair, and peaceful elections on April 14 and 21.\n  Successful elections are not guaranteed. Political violence and \nserious irregularities have tarnished past polling in parts of the \ncountry, denying some Nigerians their democratic rights. No one truly \ninterested in Nigeria's long-term stability and prosperity can accept \nrepeats of these incidents as regular features of the country's \npolitical landscape.\n  There is already cause for concern this time around. Regrettably, \npreparations for this month's elections have been sluggish, and the \nindependence of the electoral commission has been compromised. \nImportant national discussions about corruption and accountability have \nbeen temporarily hijacked by elaborate preelection maneuvering.\n  But the Nigerian people can still succeed in exercising their \ndemocratic rights and taking control of their national destiny. The \nrule of law, not the wishes of the powerful, can resolve outstanding \nquestions about the electoral process. American interests in working \nwith a strong and democratic Nigerian partner will remain powerful \nregardless of who is victorious when the returns come in, which is \nprecisely why we should use our voice now, not to favor any party or \ncandidate, but to support Nigeria's democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4433-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FIFTY CALIBER SNIPER RIFLES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, militaries around the world use .50 caliber \nsniper rifles which are noted for their powerful and destructive \ncapabilities. In the hands of a terrorist, these weapons could inflict \ndevastating results. The fact that terrorists can legally obtain \nweapons in the United States with such destructive capabilities puts us \nall at great risk.\n  In 1985, a previously classified National War College strategic study \nreport, written by a former Deputy Assistant Director of the U.S. \nSecret Service, warned of the growing threat from large caliber sniper \nrifles, specifically .50 caliber rifles. These ``long range weapons \npose a significant threat for U.S. National Command Authority figures \nif used by terrorists or other assailants,'' the Secret Service warned. \n``These weapons are more accurate than shoulder fired antitank rockets \nand, if used against aircraft, [are] immune to electronic counter \nmeasures.''\n  Ten years later the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit global policy think \ntank, issued a report identifying .50 caliber sniper rifles as a \nserious threat to the security of U.S. Air Force bases. After noting \nthe success of Barrett sniper rifles against light armored vehicles in \nthe 1991 gulf war, the report noted, ``Such weapons also give light \nforces a portable and quite deadly option against parked aircraft. \nThese rifles are effective against man-sized targets up to 1,600 meters \naway and could hit aircraft sized targets at even greater ranges.'' It \nfurther states that, ``it seems only a matter of time before these or \nsimilar weapons find their way into the arsenals of potential \nadversaries, if they have not already done so.''\n  The August 2003 U.S. Army Intelligence training handbook, ``A \nMilitary Guide to Terrorism in the Twenty-First Century,'' specifically \nidentified large caliber sniper rifles as an attractive weapon for \nterrorists to use for an assassination. It noted that .50 caliber \nsniper rifles are of particular interest because they can engage \nattacks on ``targets that are difficult to get close enough for other \nweapons,'' yet ``can also effectively engage light armored vehicles.''\n  A 2004 report on security at Los Angeles International Airport, LAX, \nspecifically warned of snipers using .50 caliber rifles to fire at \nparked or taxiing aircraft among a list of potential terrorist attack \ntactics. The RAND Corporation compiled this list by considering \ninformation gathered by intelligence organizations based on the \nhistorical tendencies and capabilities of terrorist organizations. The \nanalysis however was not able to identify ``any truly satisfactory'' \nsecurity improvement options to protect against such sniper attacks.\n  In November 2004, the Homeland Security Center at the University of \nSouthern California, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, identified .50 caliber sniper rifles as an imminent threat to \ncivil aviation.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor former New England \nPatriots Quarterback Drew Bledsoe on his retirement, after 14 years in \nthe National Football League, NFL.\n  Drew Bledsoe helped usher in the modern era of Patriots football. \nThroughout his career, Drew Bledsoe may have also played for the \nBuffalo Bills, an AFC East rival of the Patriots, and for the Dallas \nCowboys, but he got his start in chilly Foxboro, MA.\n  Fourteen years ago, a young Bledsoe was the first overall selection \nin the NFL Draft for New England draft of Washington State. He brought \nthe Patriots to their first Super Bowl in 11 years, and despite \nultimately losing to Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers, a newfound \nfeeling of excitement and pride overtook New England's football fans. \nAnd that feeling hasn't subsided.\n  After Tom Brady went down in the AFC playoff in 2002, Bledsoe led the \nPatriots to victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, ensuring the Pats a \nspot in Super Bowl XXXVI. And as you know, that was just the beginning \nof the New England football dynasty.\n  Bledsoe is a four-time Pro-Bowl quarterback, who throughout his \ncareer threw for more than 44,000 yards and completed more than 250 \ntouchdown passes. He finished his career 7th all-time in yards passing, \n13th in touchdowns, and 5th in completions.\n  His career off the field was just as impressive. Bledsoe has long \nworked to help improve the lives of children by teaching parenting \nskills through both the Drew Bledsoe Foundation and Parenting with \nDignity. The programs' curriculum, which teaches the importance of \nfamily values, is used nationwide, reaching an estimated 1.75 million \nAmerican families. He has also served as international chairman of the \nChildren's Miracle Network, helping to raise millions of dollars to \nbenefit children nationwide.\n  Bledsoe is the recipient of the Thurman Munson Humanitarian Award, \nthe NFL Alumni Spirit Award for exemplifying the spirit of the NFL \ncaring for kids and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, chosen by \nhis teammates for demonstrating balance between civic and professional \nresponsibilities. He also received the Ed Block Courage award, chosen \nby his teammates as the NFL player demonstrating the most courage and \ncharacter.\n  Drew Bledsoe has conducted himself with both dignity and maturity\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nthroughout his 14 years in the NFL, and today I, along with Patriots \nfans across New England, congratulate him on a fantastic career and \nwish him success in the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELEANOR SANTEE\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today, I would like to honor a woman \nof incomparable dedication and grace. After 26 years of loyal service \nto the Scranton School District, Mrs. Eleanor Santee retired from her \nposition as a secretary at Robert Morris Elementary School on March 2, \n2007.\n  Throughout Eleanor's years of service, the combination of her \nexperience and work ethic allowed her to provide capable administrative \nsupport for the three principals of Robert Morris Elementary under whom \nshe served. More importantly, Eleanor took the time and initiative to \nprovide support, encouragement, and friendship to the thousands of \nstudents who passed through the school during tenure. Some people with \nEleanor's years of experience might have become complacent, but Eleanor \nunderstood that in order to be successful a school must go beyond mere \nacademic success; it must also provide a nurturing environment where \npupils can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for \nsuccess throughout life. Eleanor made an indelible mark on Robert \nMorris Elementary and all who passed through there. She can take pride \nin a job well done.\n  In retirement, I have no doubt that Eleanor will continue to be an \nactive citizen of my hometown, Scranton, PA, where she resides with her \nhusband Richard.\n  I congratulate Eleanor on her many years of service to Robert Morris \nElementary School and wish her the best in health and happiness at the \ncompletion of an admirable career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4434-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     APPRECIATION FOR TOM GARY, JR.\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Tom Gary \nof Greenwood, MS, for his distinguished service during the past year as \npresident of the Delta Council.\n  Delta Council is an economic development organization representing \nthe business, professional, and agricultural leadership of the 18 delta \nand part-delta counties of Northwest Mississippi. Delta Council was \norganized in 1935 to help meet the challenges which confronted this \nregion of our State.\n  A major concern of the Mississippi Delta was the impact of \nMississippi River and tributary flooding. Flood protection and drainage \nhave severely challenged the delta region throughout its history. This \nis an area of concern where Tom Gary has distinguished himself as a \nleader. Tom took the leadership of the Delta Council Flood Control \nCommittee following a serious delta flood in 1991 and led the effort to \naccelerate construction and completion of all Yazoo Basin projects. The \n1991 flood inundated more than 1.1 million acres in 15 delta towns; and \nit seriously damaged schools, roads, public facilities and cropland. \nAfter Gary's term as Flood Control Committee chairman, cities such as \nGreenville, the largest town in north Mississippi, received benefits \nthat will provide 100-year flood protection.\n  Tom serves as vice president of Delta Wildlife, chairman of the \nLeflore County Farm Service Agency Committee, commissioner and \ntreasurer of the Leflore County Soil and Water Conservation Commission, \ndirector of the Business and Industry Political Education Committee and \nas the Cotton Board director of Farmers Supply Cooperative. He was also \nappointed by the Secretary of Agriculture as a member of the Cotton \nBoard.\n  Through his work with Delta Council, Tom has become a strong advocate \nand effective leader in advancing Delta Council's mission in adult \nliteracy, the fight against critical teacher shortages in the primary \nand secondary school system, improved access to health care, and in \ntransportation developments which are so vital to the delta region.\n  I congratulate Tom Gary and his wife Moxie for the contribution they \nhave made to the delta through their service in Delta Council during \nthe past year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4434-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4434-S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS HARVEY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a \nrecent change in the top leadership in our Army. Dr. Francis Harvey \ndeparted as Secretary of the Army at a ceremony at Fort Myer, VA. \nFarewell ceremonies are often held at Fort Myer for soldiers of all \nranks as they pass the torch to those men and women who will take over \nthe responsibility of defending our Nation. The ceremony at Fort Myer \nhonors their contributions and symbolizes the continuity between the \npast and the future. Secretary of the Army Harvey's service as \nSecretary of the Army was during a particularly crucial time for the \nArmy. The Nation is at war against a dangerous and determined enemy. \nThat war is of long duration, and the Army has borne the brunt of the \nfighting. The nature of this war, and the demands it has made on the \nArmy, has resulted in great challenges for the senior leadership of the \nArmy. Secretary Harvey accepted those challenges and worked with skill, \ndetermination, and honor to overcome them and keep our Army strong and \nready today and to prepare it for tomorrow. Many of us in Congress know \nof and appreciated Secretary Harvey's commitment to the Army. But the \nperson who is best able to tell of his accomplishments and his \ncontribution to the Army is his close partner, the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army. I am pleased to commend to my colleagues GEN Peter \nSchoomaker's speech thanking Secretary Harvey for his service to the \nArmy. I bid Secretary Harvey farewell, thank him for his service to our \ncountry, and wish him all the best in the next chapter of his life.\n  The material follows.\n\n                      Speech by General Schoomaker\n\n       Secretary and Mrs. Harvey, Deputy Secretary England, \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Pace . . . Sergeant \n     Major of the Army Preston, other distinguished guests and \n     friends. Today Dr. Fran Harvey, our 19th Secretary of the \n     Army, departs our ranks but not our hearts. I am grateful to \n     have had the privilege and honor to serve by his side. When \n     Secretary Harvey was sworn-in back in November 2004 I \n     provided him a photo of a Soldier on bended knee in Iraq \n     carrying an almost unbearable load.\n       I explained to Secretary Harvey that this picture should \n     serve to remind him--that like all leaders across our Army--\n     everything he does will impact our Soldiers on the ground. \n     Our challenge, therefore, was to lighten the load our \n     Soldiers bear (in other words, to ``take things out of their \n     rucksacks,'' as we like to say).\n       While he has kept it on his desk for two years let me tell \n     you in no uncertain terms Secretary Harvey needed no such \n     reminder. He was quick to state, and truly believed, that \n     ``Soldiers are and will always be our centerpiece. Their \n     efforts are the reason the Army is one of the most respected \n     organizations in America.''\n       This conviction was evident in everything I saw him do as \n     our Secretary. Everything was based on his passionate concern \n     for the Army, its Soldiers, their families, and our Army \n     Civilians.\n       This concern is reflected in the other picture on his desk, \n     one of two ladies, the mothers of two fallen Soldiers. That \n     picture serves as a reminder of the sacrifices our Soldiers \n     and their families are making. His dedication was reflected \n     in his personal and professional commitment to ``provide a \n     quality of life for our Soldiers that matched the quality of \n     service they provide to the Nation.''\n       And he has worked tirelessly to do just that. Because of \n     his vision, his dedication, and his unfailing commitment he \n     departs our ranks today knowing with absolute certainty that \n     our Soldiers and their families as well as the Army Civilians \n     who support them have benefited greatly from his service. I \n     have no doubt that our Army is far better today than we were \n     just two years ago\n       Our progress in many cases is the direct result of his \n     determination to stand-up to those who challenged the basis \n     of our requirements to properly support our Soldiers.\n       He also inspired us to think differently and far more \n     strategically about how we ``do business.'' Without doubt \n     these qualities are a testament to the unique brand of \n     values-based, principle-centered leadership he demonstrated \n     with absolute conviction in his service as Secretary of the \n     Army.\n       In short his impact on our Army has been profound. He has \n     moved us significantly forward in our collective and \n     continuing efforts to meet the needs of the Nation that we \n     serve.\n       My remarks will be brief because you came to hear Secretary \n     Harvey, not me. We've convened today to honor him and his \n     family and bear witness to the sacrifice of our Soldiers and \n     the contributions our Army is making worldwide in defense of \n     the Nation.\n       We often overlook the fact that to perform his duties as \n     our Secretary . . . he has endured his own experience in \n     ``family separation'' by being apart from Mary his gracious\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\n     wife of over forty years for more than twenty-eight months. \n     While we could spend the remainder of today highlighting \n     Secretary Harvey's achievements neither he nor you would be \n     very appreciative of ``the mother of all laundry lists.'' So \n     I will briefly highlight three broad but interrelated \n     touchstones: People, Resources, and Teamwork.\n       Dr. Harvey's commitment to people has enabled us to sustain \n     the overall health and viability of our All-Volunteer force--\n     which is now being tested for the first time in a protracted \n     conflict. His actions have enabled us to achieve \n     unprecedented levels of both recruitment and retention. \n     ``People are the Army'' and we recruit more of them each year \n     than all of the other Services combined. In Fiscal Year 2006 \n     the Active component had its best year in nine years \n     recruiting over 80,000 men and women. The National Guard had \n     its best year in thirteen years recruiting over 69,000 \n     people; finally, the Reserves achieved over a 25 percent \n     increase from the previous year bringing in 25,000 new \n     people.\n       His accomplishments on behalf of the great people in our \n     organization have been a logical continuation of his \n     voluntary service to the Army as a key member of the Army \n     Science Board while a private citizen over many years.\n       They include: Improvements which enabled us to meet our \n     goals for recruiting and retaining our All Volunteer force; \n     decisions and support to provide for better access and better \n     management of our vital National Guard and Army Reserve units \n     not as individuals but instead as whole cohesive units fully \n     prepared and ready to perform their duties amidst new \n     challenges; and decisions and support to grow our force--in a \n     extraordinary way--to better meet our needs and to alleviate, \n     over time, current levels of stress on our Soldiers and their \n     families.\n       We now have dramatic enhancements to ``push the envelope'' \n     increasing our ability to protect the force. These include \n     considerable improvements affecting all elements of the \n     Department to improve leadership, training, education, and \n     career opportunities for our civilians and our civilian \n     executives and equally impressive improvements in finding \n     ways--to change our culture--to drive out waste and \n     improve both efficiency and effectiveness. In this regard \n     he thought and acted unequivocally like a Soldier.\n       He was driven by a single unifying purpose: to free human \n     and financial resources for more compelling wartime and \n     operational needs. Properly focusing activity and obtaining \n     resources to enable that activity are core tasks for senior \n     leaders. No one that I have served with in public or private \n     life does it better than Dr. Fran Harvey. Our budgeted \n     dollars for Fiscal 2008, due to his personal efforts, are the \n     highest in our history--which exemplify his leadership in \n     this regard. Working in full collaboration with me and all of \n     ``the right people'' he quickly established a strategic \n     framework that reflected our most urgent challenges and \n     ongoing initiatives. He then set out in a determined yet \n     pragmatic fashion to obtain the resources required to support \n     our Army to ensure it was fully prepared to serve at the \n     forefront of the war on terror and to execute the full range \n     of its other worldwide missions.\n       Creating relevant, ready forces is the surest measure of \n     effective Army leadership. Since 2004 sixty-four (64) Brigade \n     Combat Teams have been converted or are in the process of \n     being converted; 148 multifunctional and functional support \n     Brigades have been converted, or are in the process of being \n     converted, to the modular design force.\n       I won't dwell on numbers. While important they do little to \n     tell this story. I will highlight instead the personal \n     courage and integrity he demonstrated in challenging the \n     bureaucracy, changing perceptions, and setting us on a path \n     to get our resources and our requirements in balance. His \n     leadership proved to be decisive in this regard. Not only did \n     he establish a methodology (demonstrating why he has been so \n     successful in ``Corporate America'') to explain why our costs \n     have increased in recent years, he also promoted \n     understanding and acceptance at the highest levels of our \n     Government for our most compelling needs. We will rely upon \n     Fran Harvey's example ``to do what is right'' for many years \n     to come.\n       He also inspired all of us in the Army to achieve more--in \n     what we do personally . . . and in what we expect to be \n     delivered by others. In this regard . . . two of his deep \n     seated beliefs will remain embedded in the culture which \n     shapes and characterizes our Army: ``In the bottom line it's \n     all about `cost, schedule, and performance' plain and simple \n     and what gets measured gets done.''\n       His efforts have dramatically improved the quality and \n     openness of our working relationships within the Department \n     of Defense and with the many stakeholders upon whom we depend \n     for resources and support. In a word, he is a genuine ``team \n     player'' who has engendered unprecedented levels of teamwork \n     which will benefit our Soldiers. Our personal working \n     relationship is the result of our mutual decision to operate \n     from the same playbook. And that playbook was based on a \n     couple of key fundamentals. We agreed that the door between \n     our offices would always remain open and that our \n     relationship would be based upon one core belief--that \n     Soldiers would remain the center of all that we do.\n       Over the past two years we've crossed that threshold that \n     used to be blocked many times a day. Opening the door between \n     our offices not only opened lines of communication, it also \n     enabled progress in three other very important ways: First, \n     as an outgrowth of the extremely close partnership between \n     Secretary Harvey and me we set the tone for a strong civil-\n     military team at the top of the Department. Second, we were \n     unified in our commitment to a single Vision--the Army \n     Vision--that centers, as it must, on the great Soldiers who \n     fill our ranks and the dedicated Army Civilians who support \n     them to generate and sustain our All-Volunteer force. Third, \n     teamwork and a shared vision for the future enabled our \n     entire team to better articulate and defend the Army's most \n     compelling needs.\n       I'm convinced that these positive developments played a \n     vital role in dramatically changing our current and projected \n     resource posture and ultimately to better provide for our \n     Soldiers and to better accomplish what the Nation demands \n     from its Army. So as we farewell our 19th Secretary I say so \n     long to a visionary, a ``true leader'' and a teammate with \n     whom I have been enormously proud to serve. He has led the \n     Army to unprecedented levels of civil-military cooperation, \n     fostered open communication, and mutual respect (even in \n     times of disagreement) all in the interest of Soldiers, \n     families, and the Army mission--to conduct prompt, sustained \n     combat and stability operations on land. I have mentioned \n     just a few of the seminal achievements that will endure and \n     continue to bear fruit long after Dr. Harvey departs our \n     ranks today. Selfless leadership is that rare and wonderful \n     commodity of which every nation possesses too little. Its \n     presence is unmistakable, its impact enduring.\n       We are fortunate to have the continuity of vision and \n     direction that Acting Secretary Geren now represents. Sir, we \n     welcome your leadership and your experience as a Member of \n     Congress and within the office of the Secretary of Defense. \n     We know that you'll lead and care for our Soldiers and \n     families and that you're going to keep us on course.\n       Secretary Harvey, Sir, thank you for your service for your \n     friendship and for living the Army Values and for honoring \n     our Warrior Ethos. Because of your leadership we're ``Army \n     Strong'' and as our song says we'll ``keep rolling along.'' \n     Together we wish you, Mary, Francis, John and the rest of \n     your family Godspeed.\n       Army Strong!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed today, April 12, 2007, by the President pro tempore \n(Mr. Byrd).\n\n       S. 1002.

A bill to reward the hard work and risk of individuals who \nchoose to live in and help preserve America's small, rural towns, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nHagel, Johnson, Brownback and nine of our colleagues today in re-\nintroducing the New Homestead Act of 2007. This legislation will help \naddress a serious threat to the economic future of rural America--the \nloss of its residents and Main Street businesses.\n  I have previously described to my Senate colleagues the severe \neconomic and social hardships that population out-migration has had on \nAmerica's Heartland when businesses are shuttered up, schools and \nchurches are consolidated or closed altogether. Hundreds of thousands \nof people have left small towns in rural areas throughout the Great \nPlains. If you are a business owner, mayor, school board member, \nminister or resident of one of these rural communities, you know \nfirsthand about this problem. People who are from these areas know that \nyou simply can't grow or run a business in an environment where the \noverall economy is shrinking, current and potential customers are \nleaving, and public and private investment is falling. Too many \ncommunities in North Dakota and other rural States lack the critical \nmass of people and resources it takes to keep a community alive and \ngrowing.\n  Rural counties in North Dakota and heartland States have experienced \nmassive net out-migration in recent decades and this trend is \ncontinuing today. Forty-seven of North Dakota's fifty-three counties \nsuffered net population losses between 2000 and 2005. My home county, \nHettinger, saw its population dwindle from 4,257 in 1980 to just 2,715 \nin 2000. Its population is projected to drop to just 1,877 by 2020.\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n  However, this out-migration problem isn't limited to North Dakota. \nNearly all of America's Heartland is facing significant population \nlosses. Over the past fifty years or so, nearly two-thirds of rural \ncounties in the Great Plains lost at least one third of their \npopulation.\n  One of the major problems caused by chronic out-migration is the \ndwindling workforce of young people. A recent analysis and report \nprepared by Dr. Richard Rathge at the North Dakota State Data Center \nhighlighted this concern. His report revealed that the steady out-\nmigration of young adults over the last half century or so has \nsignificantly reduced the proportion of individuals age 20 to 34 in our \nrural counties. The report predicts that between 2000 and 2020, the \nprime working age population in North Dakota, those aged 35 to 54, will \ndecline from 183,435 to 146,717, a loss of nearly 37,000 people. If \nthis trend continues as predicted, there will be more elderly North \nDakotans age 65 and older in the year 2020 than individuals who are in \ntheir prime working years. As the report concluded, this dwindling \nlabor pool could have a devastating economic impact on rural \ncommunities that are already struggling from a loss of residents, \nbusinesses and investments needed to survive.\n  We believe the bipartisan New Homestead Act will help reverse the \ndepopulation of our rural communities by giving people who are willing \nto commit to live and work in high out-migration areas for 5 years tax \nand other financial rewards to help them to buy a home, pay for \ncollege, build a nest egg, and start a business. These incentives \ninclude repaying up to $10,000 of a college loan, offering a $5,000 tax \ncredit for the purchase of a new home, protecting home values by \nallowing losses in home value to be deducted from Federal income taxes, \nand establishing Individual Homestead Accounts that will help people \nbuild savings and have access to credit.\n  It also provides tax incentives to encourage businesses to move to or \nexpand their operations in high out-migration rural counties, including \ntax credits for investments in rural buildings and to offset the cost \nof equipment purchases and operating expenses of small businesses with \nfive or fewer employees. Very little, if any, private venture capital \nis invested in out-migration rural counties, so the New Homestead Act \nalso establishes a new $3 billion venture capital fund with state and \nlocal governments as partners to ensure that entrepreneurs and \ncompanies in these areas get the capital they need to start and grow \ntheir businesses.\n  The United States Senate has previously passed parts of the New \nHomestead Act, but those and other provisions in the bill have not yet \nbeen signed into law. But there is good reason to think we will make \nsignificant progress on the New Homestead Act in the 110th Congress.\n  In March, the Senate passed S. Con. Res. 21, to establish a budget \nplan for fiscal year 2008. This resolution allows for Senate action on \nthe kinds of policies provided in the New Homestead Act. Specifically, \nSection 306 of the budget authorizes the Budget Committee Chairman to \nrevise the levels in the resolution by $15 billion for revenue-neutral \nlegislation that would, among other things, provide rural development \ninvestment incentives for counties impacted by high rates of out-\nmigration.\n  The Senate's action on the budget signals that Federal policy makers \nin the U.S. Senate do understand that rural out-migration is a serious \nthreat to the economic well-being of the Nation's Heartland. My \ncolleagues and I will work closely with the leaders of the Budget \nCommittee and the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee to secure \npassage of New Homestead Act provisions in the coming year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the New Homestead Act in the 110th \nCongress by cosponsoring it and helping us move this important bill \nforward in the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Akaka, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 1096. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \ncertain housing benefits to disabled members of the Armed Forces, to \nexpand certain benefits for disabled veterans with severe burns, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the past several months, our Nation \nhas focused on the tragic stories of the shameful conditions our \nwounded soldiers have faced as outpatients in Building 18 at Walter \nReed Army Medical Center, and the stories of the difficulty they faced \nas they tried to navigate the military and veterans health care and \nbenefits systems following their return from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  This morning, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe ranking member--the committee on which I serve--as well as the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee had further hearings and detailed the work \nwe have to do to bring down another wall, and that is the wall that \nseparates our wounded warriors from the benefits they have earned by \ntheir noble service.\n  Today I introduce the Veterans Housing Benefits Enhancement Act of \n2007 that will provide immediate and tangible assistance to our wounded \nservicemembers and their families by strengthening our current law.\n  This legislation provides explicit VA housing and automobile grant \neligibility to servicemembers and veterans with burn injuries, enhanced \neligibility for grant assistance during the Department of Defense-to-\nVeterans' Administration transition, and requires the Secretary of the \nVeterans' Administration to report on possible improvements to the \ncurrent law that would cover others with special disabilities, such as \nthose with traumatic brain injuries.\n  I am pleased to say the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Danny Akaka, and the ranking member, Senator Larry \nCraig of Idaho, have joined me as original cosponsors of this \nlegislation, as well as my senior Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  I grew up in a military family. My dad served for 31 years in the Air \nForce. I saw firsthand the importance of treating our veterans in a \nfair and equitable manner. The sacrifices our men and women in uniform \nmake every day must not be forgotten when they take that uniform off or \nwhen they leave their active-duty military service. No veteran should \never be left behind. The fundamental agreement--I would say even sacred \ncovenant--between our men and women in uniform and our Government does \nnot end when a servicemember is wounded or separates from the active-\nduty military service and becomes a veteran.\n  Let there be no question about it, the conditions of these outpatient \nhousing facilities at Walter Reed were absolutely unacceptable. But \nperhaps the story of that unacceptable condition has led us to finding \na way to serve our wounded warriors and their families better. The U.S. \nmilitary and the Department of Veterans Affairs must conduct a top-to-\nbottom investigation of our entire military health system and take \nimmediate steps to address any and all problems that might exist.\n  It is sobering to know--as Senator Craig quoted during this morning's \nhearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee and Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee--that the conclusions reached by GEN Omar Bradley some five \ndecades ago were not fundamentally different from those that are \ntentative conclusions today about how we can improve that transition, \nand still we know problems exist.\n  The President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded \nVeterans, led by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, is an \nimportant component of this ongoing effort, which will not be a task \nfor the short-winded. We have an obligation and a duty to ensure that \nthe men and women who are serving and who have served in our military \nare receiving the very best treatment and benefits for themselves and \ntheir families. We cannot and we should not tolerate anything less. We \nhave to do whatever it takes, including providing both the necessary \nresources and cutting the bureaucratic redtape, to best meet the \nmedical and other needs of those who have so nobly defended our \nNation's freedom.\n  In my State of Texas, my home of San Antonio, Brooke Army Medical \nCenter stands at the forefront of modern army medicine, second to none \nin\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nthe world. Without a doubt--and this is a personal judgment, and I know \nmy colleagues will indulge me--it is Brooke Army Medical Center that is \nthe crown jewel of modern military medicine. I have seen firsthand the \nmagnificent job our men and women are doing at Brooke Army Medical \nCenter to care for our servicemembers, and they deserve all the credit \nand our firm support.\n  When I made my most recent visit to Brooke Army Medical Center, on \nMarch 10, I had the chance to not only visit soldiers and their \nfamilies but I chaired a roundtable of hospital administrators, \nveterans service organizations, and veterans themselves because I \nwanted to learn from them what we needed to do here in Washington, DC \nto craft the laws and policies of this Nation to serve them better. I \nappreciate the strong opinions and advice expressed by these people who \nparticipated in the roundtable, and others who have been a source of \ninformation and feedback to me as I try to do what I can in my capacity \nas their elected representative to accomplish these goals. The care and \nsupport our Nation provides to these wounded warriors is a direct \nreflection of the level of respect we have for both our military, our \nmilitary families, and our veterans, and will, in many ways, shape the \narmed services, the all-volunteer services, for many years to come. \nThey depend not only on recruitment but retention.\n  In conjunction with my most recent visit to Brooke Army Medical \nCenter, I heard from many soldiers, families, and veterans about their \nindividual experiences, as I know the current occupant of the chair has \nwhen he has traveled back to Colorado, and as all of us have when we go \nback to learn more from our constituents about how we can improve our \nresponse. I learned in particular of challenges that burn victims and \ntheir families have faced because they have not received enough special \ncare and assistance for that particular type of injury in the area of \nVA housing grants and automobile enhancements.\n  In particular, I want to recognize two women, heroes in my eyes, and \nI am sure in the eyes of their families, people such as Christy Patton, \nwhose husband, U.S. Army SSG Everett Patton, is undergoing treatment at \nBrooke Army Medical Center. He was wounded and badly burned by an IED, \nan improvised explosive device, in Iraq while with the 172nd Stryker \nBrigade from Alaska. The Pattons have five children.\n  Then there is Rosie Babin, whose son Alan, a corporal, a medic, was \nshot while serving in the 82nd Airborne combat team in 2003, now \nmedically retired and living at home with his parents outside Austin, \nTX. These two women--Christy Patton, who sought me out and explained to \nme the difficult challenges that her husband and her family of five \nchildren are having transitioning and dealing with these wounds and \ntransitioning from the military medical care into retirement and the \nveterans system; as well as Rosie Babin, on behalf of her son Alan--are \nthe most fervent and effective advocates anyone could ever want to have \non your side. They have helped me a great deal as I have tried to craft \nlegislation which I have introduced today to help not only them, \nbecause I know they didn't come to me advocating just for a solution \nfor their husband or their son, they came to me because they thought we \ncould craft a solution for wounded warriors and their families yet to \ncome. These families, though, are facing unique challenges as they deal \nwith the injuries of their loved ones, and we have a responsibility to \nensure they do not go it alone and that they get all the resources and \nassistance our country can offer them so they can recover to the \nmaximum degree possible.\n\n  The intent of the legislation which I have introduced today, along \nwith my cosponsors, is pretty straightforward. Let me describe briefly \nwhat it does.\n  It would strengthen the present code to provide for the specific \nneeds of burn victims for housing and automobile grants. It would \nensure that wounded servicemembers and veterans with other specific \nneeds, such as traumatic brain injuries, are also covered by these \nkinds of grants, if required. It would further strengthen the \nDepartment of Defense-to-Veterans' Administration transition.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows, that has been one of the real \nproblems we have identified early on, is transitioning people from \nactive-duty military service into the Veterans' Administration, with \nthe duplicate bureaucracies and redtape and the different standards for \ndisability determination and the like. But this bill, in particular, \nwould strengthen the Department of Defense-to-Veterans Administration \ntransition by providing partial housing grants for those veterans \nresiding with a family member to cover servicemembers still on active \nduty awaiting their final VA disability rating.\n  I have to say a word here about the family members. When I have been \nto Walter Reed and when I have been to Brooke Army Medical Center in \nSan Antonio, I have seen young spouses, mostly women, who are attending \nto their injured warrior husbands, or in the case of Rosie Babin, a \nmother, a loving mother attending to the needs of her son, who was also \ninjured in 2003. It was brought home to me on a very human level what \nthese wounds mean not just to those who receive them but to the family \nmembers, who basically sacrifice everything in order to attend to and \ncare for their loved ones. So we ought to do everything we can for our \nwarriors, such as Alan Babin, who are living in their parents' home, to \nmake sure these housing grants will cover servicemembers still on \nactive duty who are awaiting their Veterans' Administration disability \nrating.\n  This legislation will also require the Veterans' Administration to \nreport on the need for a permanent housing grant for wounded veterans \nwho reside with family members; and, finally, it will adjust current \nlaw to provide home improvements and structural alteration housing \ngrants to Department of Defense servicemembers who are awaiting final \nVA disability ratings.\n  As a direct result of the care and concern of military family \nmembers, such as Christy Patton and Rosie Babin, we now have a concrete \nresponse to the very real concerns they have raised and ways that we \ncan, working together, strengthen the current law. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this legislation so we can work together on a bipartisan \nbasis, in unison, to support our wounded servicemembers and their \nfamilies better, particularly people such as the Babins and the \nPattons. With continued attention to our veterans, we can fashion a \nrevised system that best supports them and their families. I know we \nall agree that they deserve nothing less. They are the very finest our \nNation has to offer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 1098. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the \namount of minimum allotments under the Projects for Assistance in \nTransition from Homelessness program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Bingaman, Senator Harkin, Senator Leahy and Senator \nSanders to introduce a bill that will raise the minimum grant amounts \ngiven to States and territories under the PATH program. The PATH \nprogram provides services through formula grants of at least $300,000 \nto each State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and $50,000 to \neligible U.S. territories. Subject to available appropriations, this \nbill will raise the minimum allotments to $600,000 to each State and \n$100,000 to eligible U.S. territories.\n  When the PATH program was established in fiscal year 1991 as a \nformula grant program, Congress appropriated $33 million. That amount \nhas steadily increased over the years with Congress appropriating $55 \nmillion this past year. However, despite these increases, States and \nterritories such as New Mexico that have rural and frontier \npopulations, have not received an increase in their PATH funds. Under \nthe formula, as it currently exists, many States and territories will \nnever receive an increase to their PATH program, even with increasing \ndemand and inflation. This problem is occurring in my home State of New \nMexico as well as twenty-five other States and territories throughout \nthe United States.\n  The PATH program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nand it funds community-based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, \ncase management and other support services, as well as a limited set of \nhousing services for people who are homeless and have serious mental \nillnesses. Program services are provided in a variety of different \nsettings, including clinic sites, shelter-based clinics, and mobile \nunits. In addition, the PATH program takes health care services to \nlocations where homeless individuals are found, such as streets, parks, \nand soup kitchens.\n  PATH services are a key element in the plan to end chronic \nhomelessness. Every night, an estimated 600,000 people are homeless in \nAmerica. Of these, about one-third are single adults with serious \nmental illnesses. I have worked closely with organizations in New \nMexico such as Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless and I have seen \nfirst hand the difficulties faced by the more than 15,000 homeless \npeople in New Mexico, 35 percent of whom are chronically mentally ill \nor mentally incapacitated.\n  PATH is a proven program that has been very successful in moving \npeople out of homelessness. PATH has been reviewed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget and has scored significantly high marks in \nmeeting program goals and objectives. Unquestionably, homelessness is \nnot just an urban issue. Rural and frontier communities face unique \nchallenges in serving PATH eligible persons and the PATH program \nfunding mechanisms must account for these differences.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nto make individuals employed by the Roosevelt Campobello International \nPark Commission eligible to obtain Federal health insurance; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce a bill that would \nsolve a serious health-insurance problem for some Americans who work on \nCampobello Island, Canada, near the Maine border, at a park that honors \nthe memory of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n  Ten residents of the State of Maine are employed on that beautiful \nisland by the Roosevelt Campobello International Park. The park centers \non the spacious summer cottage that FDR loved and visited often, from \nhis childhood in the 1880s up to his last trip in 1939. Today, the \nRoosevelt cottage and the park draw thousands of visitors from around \nthe world.\n  The Roosevelt Campobello International Park was dedicated in 1964 as \na memorial to President Roosevelt, and is funded by both the U.S. and \nthe Canadian Governments under terms of a treaty.\n  Unfortunately, the drafters of the treaty did not address the need \nfor health insurance for park employees. As a result, the State \nDepartment concluded in 1965 that those employees ``shall be subject to \nthe relevant Canadian labor laws.'' Based on that State Department \nopinion, the U.S. Civil Service Commission--precursor of the Office of \nPersonnel Management--determined that the employees were not eligible \nfor Federal Employee Health Benefits Program coverage.\n  Meanwhile, even if the employees could join the Canadian health plan, \nthe park's location makes it impractical for them to seek medical \ntreatment in Canada. The closest doctors and hospitals are in Maine, \nand the only access to the park is from the United States.\n  Consequently, the employees have relied on a small-group insurance \nplan negotiated by the Park Commission and have paid for their own \ninsurance. But as with millions of other Americans, drastic increases \nin premiums have made that small-group plan unaffordable for the Park \nemployees. The result is a genuine hardship for them and their \nfamilies.\n  My bill will resolve this problem simply, by making these employees \neligible for FEHBP health insurance. This is a matter of equal \ntreatment as well as compassion. Full-time employees of other joint-\nresponsibility parks on the U.S.A.-Canada border, like Glacier National \nPark, are already eligible for coverage under the FEHBP.\n  Adding this handful of employees to the rolls is a negligible cost to \nthe government, but a huge relief for these deserving citizens.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Harkin. He serves \nably on the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission, and so \nunderstands the problem faced by my Maine constituents employed at the \npark.\n  I hope that our colleagues will join us to support this bill so that \nthe American citizens maintaining a park honoring a great American \nPresident will be treated fairly. I ask unanimous concent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpedite the application and eligibility process for low-income \nsubsidies under the Medicare prescription drug program and to revise \nthe resource standards used to determine eligibility for an income-\nrelated subsidy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1103. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security At to \ninclude costs incurred by the Indian Health Service, a Federally \nqualified health center, an AIDS drug assistance program, certain \nhospitals, or a pharmaceutical manufacturer patient assistance program \nin providing prescription drugs toward the annual out of pocket \nthreshold under part D of the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nSmith to introduce two pieces of vitally important, bipartisan \nlegislation that will ensure that low-income seniors have full access \nto the benefits available to them under the Medicare Drug Benefit. The \nfirst piece of legislation makes critical improvements in the Medicare \nPart D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) available to assist these individuals \nin meeting cost sharing, premium, and deductible requirements under \nPart D. The second will ensure that low-income seniors don't get caught \nin the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ``doughnut hole,'' simply \nbecause of where they purchase their Part D pharmaceuticals.\n  These bills were developed in close collaboration with Senator Smith, \nwho also will be introducing two bills today to achieve other, critical \nimprovements in the Medicare program for low-income seniors. Together, \nwe believe this package of four bills will provide the reforms \nnecessary to ensure that the Medicare program and the LIS function as \nthey were intended, to ensure access to life-saving drug coverage for \nsome of the most vulnerable members of our society.\n  Data indicates that a shockingly low number of seniors eligible for \nthe LIS benefit are actually receiving the benefit. According to the \nJanuary 2007 report by the National Council on Aging (NCOA), The Next \nSteps: Strategies to Improve the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy, \nonly 35 percent to 42 percent of beneficiaries who could have \nsuccessfully applied for the LIS in 2006 were actually receiving it. \nExacerbating this problem, NCOA also reports that overall LIS \nenrollment rates are slowing. In total for 2007, NCOA estimates that \nbetween 3.4 and 4.4 million beneficiaries still must be identified and \nenrolled in the LIS. Furthermore, data indicates that certain LIS \nrequirements result in many low-income seniors that should be eligible \nfor the benefit being denied enrollment in LIS. I believe the modest \npolicy changes created by the legislation I and Senator Smith are \nintroducing will ensure that all low-income beneficiaries have access \nto the LIS.\n  The single most significant barrier to LIS eligibility is the asset \ntest, which accounts for approximately 41 percent of LIS denials. As \nreported by NCOA, the asset test penalizes low income retirees who may \nhave very modest savings. For example, approximately half of the people \nthat failed the asset test have excess assets of $35,000 or less. These \npeople tend to be older, female, widowed, and living alone. In addition \nthe asset test is inherently discriminatory against certain categories \nof people, e.g., people who rent their homes.\n  My legislation, the Part D Equity for Low-Income Seniors Act, will \ndramatically improve this inequity by raising the asset test limits to \n$27,500 for an individual and $55,000 for a couple. This will capture \nabout half of individuals and two-thirds of couples who have been \ndenied LIS because of excess resources.\n  As recommended by OIG in fall 2006, this legislation also allows the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) to transfer tax filing information to \nthe Social Security Administration (SSA) so they can better target \nbeneficiaries who might be eligible for the LIS. In addition, this \nlegislation creates an expedited LIS application process for pre-\nscreened beneficiaries, prohibits the reporting of retirement account \nbalances, life-insurance policies and in-kind contributions when \ndetermining a beneficiary's resource level, and prohibits LIS benefits \nfrom being counted as resources for the purposes of determining \neligibility for other federal programs.\n  I also am introducing the Low-Income True Out-Of Pocket (TrOOP) \nExpense under Part D Assistance bill, which ensures that low-income \nAmericans do not get ``stuck'' in the Part D ``doughnut hole'' simply \nbecause of where they choose to purchase Part D pharmaceuticals.\n  Unbelievably, under current regulation and guidance, individuals who \nare in the doughnut hole and receive Part D drugs from commercial \npharmacies are permitted to count waivers or reductions in Part D cost-\nsharing to count towards their TrOOP. However, low-income individuals \nwho tend to receive Part D drugs from safety-net pharmacies and other \nsafety-net providers are not permitted to count similar waivers or \nreductions in Part D cost-sharing by safety-net providers towards their \nTrOOP. Thus, current law penalizes low-income individuals and makes it \neasier for them to get stuck in the doughnut hole--never accessing the \ncatastrophic coverage to which they are entitled.\n  My legislation would undo this inequity and permit waivers and \nreductions for beneficiaries receiving care from safety-net providers \nto count towards beneficiaries' TrOOP. Specifically, the legislation \nwill count waivers and reductions by certain safety-net hospitals and \npharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), AIDS Drug \nAssistance Programs (ADAPs), Pharmacy Assistance Programs (PAPs), and \nthe Indian Health Service (IRS) toward TrOOP.\n  In closing, I would also like to offer my strong support for the two \nbills on which we worked very closely with Senator Smith and that he is \nintroducing today. The first is the Medicare Part D Outreach and \nEnrollment Enhancement Act, which creates a permanent 90-day special \nenrollment period for any beneficiary who becomes eligible for the LIS. \nIt also requires CMS to provide such beneficiaries facilitated \nenrollment into the plans allowing, within 90 days, the beneficiary to \nbe enrolled into the most appropriate plan for his or her needs. The \nlegislation also waives the late enrollment penalty for LIS \nbeneficiaries, provides a $1 per beneficiary authorization for State \nHealth Insurance Programs, and funds the National Center on Senior \nBenefits and Outreach, which was created last year in the Older \nAmericans Act.\n  The second piece of legislation creates important equity between \ninstitutionalized Part D beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid and those dual eligibles who avoid initialization through a \nHome and Community Based Waiver (HCBW). Currently under Federal law, \nPart D cost-sharing requirements are waived for dual-eligible \nindividuals that are institutionalized but are not waived for \nindividuals in HCBWs. Senator Smith's legislation would make an \nimportant change to Federal law to all allow cost sharing under Part D \nto be waived for dual eligibles regardless of whether they are \ninstitutionalized or receiving care through HCBWs.\n  I also would like to express my gratitude for the assistance of \nseveral key senior citizen advocates in crafting all four important \npieces of legislation, including: Paul Cotton and Kristen Sloan from \nthe American Association of Retired Persons, Howard Bedlin and Sara \nDuda from the National Council on Aging, Lena O'Rourke and Marc \nSteinberg from Families USA, Patricia Nemore and Vicki Gottlich from \nthe Center for Medicare Advocacy and Paul Precht, from the Medicare \nRights Center. I would also like to thank the Staff at the Social \nSecurity Administration (SSA) for their prompt feedback and invaluable \nassistance.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these important pieces \nof legislation, which will ensure that life saving pharmaceuticals are \navailable to low-income Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the National Council on Aging Report, \nand the text of these bills to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Next Steps: Strategies To Improve the Medicare Part D Low-Income \n                                Subsidy\n\n       The passage of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) was the \n     largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception \n     in 1965 and over 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries now \n     have prescription drug coverage due to unprecedented efforts \n     by the public and private sectors. However, millions of those \n     in greatest need have still not signed up for the Low-Income \n     Subsidy (LIS or Extra Help) program, which provides generous \n     financial assistance to beneficiaries with limited income and \n     resources, including coverage through the ``donut hole.'' HHS \n     has estimated that at least 75% of the Medicare beneficiaries \n     still without any prescription drug coverage are eligible for \n     the Low-Income Subsidy.\n       The challenge of finding and enrolling people with limited \n     means in needs-based programs is not new. After forty years, \n     take-up rates remain low for many federal means-tested \n     benefits. As a result of unprecedented efforts by the public, \n     non-profit and private sectors in the first year of the \n     program, NCOA estimates that 35% to 42% of beneficiaries who \n     could have successfully applied for the LIS in 2006 are \n     actually receiving it. While the LIS take-up rate so far is \n     on a par\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\n     with historic enrollment rates in other federal, needs-based \n     programs (especially after the first year of effort), there \n     are signs that overall enrollment rates are slowing. We \n     estimate that there are between 3.4 and 4.4 million \n     beneficiaries that we still need to find and sign up for the \n     program in 2007.\n       These are people who would benefit most from the coverage \n     that Part D and the LIS can offer them. With targeted \n     investments and modest policy changes, significantly higher \n     participation rates can be achieved in 2007.\n       This paper identifies recommended legislative, \n     administrative, and regulatory reforms that should be made to \n     the LIS to improve access to the program for seniors and \n     people with disabilities with limited means. Some of the key \n     legislative reforms recommended include: (1) eliminating the \n     asset test, as it is the single-most significant barrier to \n     Part D LIS eligibility; (2) enacting legislation to make the \n     LIS Special Enrollment Period (SEP) permanent and eliminate \n     the late enrollment premium penalty for this population; and \n     (3) establishing and funding a dedicated, nationwide network \n     of enrollment centers through the new National Center on \n     Senior Benefits Outreach and Enrollment in order to find and \n     enroll remaining LIS eligibles.\n       There are also significant administrative and regulatory \n     reforms recommended in this paper. Some of the reforms \n     include having the Social Security Administration (SSA): (1) \n     designate at least one dedicated worker in each field office \n     who is assigned specifically to process LIS applications \n     where practical; (2) amend the LIS application to allow \n     applicants to designate a third party to assist them through \n     the LIS application process and interact with SSA on their \n     behalf; and (3) maintain a link from the online LIS \n     application to a webpage that provides seniors and people \n     with disabilities--as well as their family members, friends, \n     or advocates--with state-specific information on other public \n     benefits for which they may be eligible.\n       In addition to implementing reforms to the Part D LIS \n     program, Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and Medicare \n     Advantage-Prescription Drug plans (MAPDs) should be required \n     to screen their member lists for individuals who are \n     potentially eligible for the Low- Income Subsidy. We estimate \n     that up to 1.1 million more people in plans could enroll in \n     the LIS if they knew they were eligible for the program and \n     received application assistance. PDPs and MA-PDs could \n     partner with nonprofit organizations to help screen their \n     members for LIS eligibility.\n       We commend CMS for its recent decisions to permit low-\n     income beneficiaries to sign up for LIS and enroll in a plan \n     throughout the remainder of 2007 without penalty. This action \n     is necessary, but not sufficient in itself to achieve higher \n     LIS enrollments in 2007. To reach the remaining LIS \n     eligibles, additional investment in proven strategies that \n     work is needed, along with progress on the other \n     recommendations included in this paper.\n       With the beginning of the second year of this program, the \n     Access to Benefits Coalition and NCOA call on the \n     Administration, foundations, corporations and advocacy groups \n     to renew their commitment to outreach and enrollment efforts \n     and to invest in effective strategies to help seniors and \n     people with disabilities in greatest need to receive the \n     important benefits available to them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Federal assistance to States, local \njurisdictions, and Indian tribes to prosecute hate crimes, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, hate crimes violate everything our \ncountry stands for. They send the poisonous message that certain \nAmericans deserve to be victimized solely because of who they are. \nThese are crimes committed against entire communities, the Nation as a \nwhole and the very ideals upon which our country was founded.\n  The vast majority of Congress agrees. In 2000, 57 Senators voted in \nsupport of this bill. In 2002, 54 Senators voted with us, and, in 2004, \nwe had 65 votes. Today, we are re-introducing this bicameral, \nbipartisan bill with the support of 39 original cosponsors, and we have \nthe\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nvotes to get cloture. We have the votes in the House too. This year, we \nare going to get it done.\n  Our legislation is supported by a broad coalition of over 210 law \nenforcement, civic, religious and civil rights groups, including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Anti-Defamation League, the Interfaith Alliance, the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nthe National District Attorneys Association, and the National Center \nfor Victims of Crime.\n  Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey are especially \ndisturbing because they indicate that a large number of hate crimes go \nunreported. The data indicates that an average of 191,000 hate crimes \ntake place every year, but only a small percentage are reported to the \npolice.\n  We obviously need to strengthen the ability of Federal, State and \nlocal governments to investigate and prosecute these vicious and \nsenseless crimes. The existing Federal hate crime statute was passed in \n1968, soon after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It \nwas such an important step forward at the time, but it is now a \ngeneration out of date.\n  The absence of effective legislation has undoubtedly resulted in the \nfailure to solve many hate-motivated crimes. The recent action of the \nJustice Department in reopening 40 civil-rights-era murders \ndemonstrates the need for adequate laws. Many of the victims in these \ncases have been denied justice for decades, and for some, justice will \nnever come.\n  This bill corrects two major deficiencies in current law--one, the \nexcessive restrictions requiring proof that victims were attacked \nbecause they were engaged in certain ``federally protected \nactivities,'' and, two, the limited scope of the law, which covers only \nhate crimes based on race, religion, or ethnic background, excluding \nviolence committed against persons because of their sexual orientation, \ngender, gender identity, or disability.\n  The federally protected activity requirement is outdated, unwise and \nunnecessary, particularly when we consider the unjust outcomes that \nresult from this requirement. Hate crimes can occur in a variety of \ncircumstances, and citizens are often targeted during routine \nactivities that should be protected.\n  For example, in June 2003, six Latino teenagers went to a family \nrestaurant on Long Island. They knew one another from their involvement \nin community activities and were together to celebrate one of their \nbirthdays. As the group entered the restaurant, three men who were \nleaving the bar assaulted them, pummeling one boy and severing a tendon \nin his hand with a sharp weapon. During the attack, the men yelled \nracial slurs and one identified himself as a skinhead.\n  Two of the men were tried under the current Federal law for \ncommitting a hate crime and were acquitted. The jurors said the \ngovernment failed to prove that the attack took place because the \nvictims were engaged in a federally protected activity--using the \nrestaurant. The result in this case is only one example of the \ninadequate protection under current law. The bill we introduce today \nwill eliminate the federally protected activity requirement. Under this \nbill, the defendants who left the courtroom as free men would almost \ncertainly have left in handcuffs through a different door.\n  The bill also recognizes that hate crimes are also committed against \npeople because of their sexual orientation, their gender, their gender \nidentity, or their disability. It's up to Congress to make sure that \ntough Federal penalties also apply to those who commit such crimes as \nwell. Passing this bill will send a loud and clear message. All hate \ncrimes will face Federal prosecution. Action is long overdue.\n  Examples of the problem abound. Two years ago, a 52-year-old Alabama \nman was beaten on the head with a hammer because he was gay. Still \nwaiting for justice, the man lies in a coma as a result of that attack.\n  In 1993, a 21-year-old transgender man, Brandon Teena was raped and \nbeaten in Humboldt, NE, by two male friends. The local sheriff refused \nto arrest the offenders, and they later shot and stabbed Brandon to \ndeath.\n  In 1999, four women in Yosemite National Park were targeted by a man \nwho admitted to having fantasized about killing women for most of his \nlife. The current hate crime law did not apply to this horrific crime \nbecause enjoyment of a Federal park is not a federally protected right.\n  In 2001, Fred C. Martinez, Jr., a Navajo, openly gay, transgender \nyouth, was murdered while walking home from a party in Cortez, CO. The \nperpetrator, Shaun Murphy, had traveled from New Mexico to Colorado \nwith a friend in order to sell illegal drugs. He met Fred at a carnival \nthat night, and the next morning, while driving, he saw Fred walking \ndown the street. Shaun and his friend offered Fred a ride and dropped \nhim off close to home. Shortly thereafter, Shaun attacked Fred and beat \nhim to death with a large rock. His body was discovered several days \nlater. The attackers bragged about this vicious crime, describing the \nvictim with vulgar epithets.\n  The perpetrator could not be charged with a hate crime because no \nState or Federal law protecting gender identity existed. He received a \n40-year sentence under a plea agreement and he will be eligible for \nparole in 25 years. His victim did not live long enough to see his 20th \nbirthday. If the defendant had been charged with a Federal hate crime, \nhe could have received a life sentence. If the prosecutor had greater \naid for his investigation under the proposed legislation, he could have \nhad a stronger case against the defendant and prosecuted him more \neffectively.\n  In October 2002, two deaf girls in Somerville, MA--one of whom was \nwheelchair bound due to cerebral palsy--were harassed and sexually \nassaulted by four suspected gang members in a local park. Although the \nalleged perpetrators were charged in the incident, the assaults could \nnot be charged as hate crimes because there is no Federal protection \nfor hate crimes against disabled individuals.\n  These examples graphically illustrate the senseless brutality that \nour fellow citizens face simply for being who they are. They also \nhighlight the importance of passing this legislation, which is long \noverdue.The vast majority of us in Congress have recognized the \nimportance of this legislation since it was first introduced--nearly 10 \nyears ago. This year, we have an opportunity to pass it in both the \nSenate and the House, and enact it into law. Let's make the most of \nthis opportunity, and do all we can to end these senseless crimes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this list of \norganizations who support the Matthew Shepard bill.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed as \nfollows:\n\n       1.

Excerpts of Support for the Hate Crime Prevention Act \n     of 2007.\n       29. General List of Supporting Organizations 2007.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, like acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an \nimpact far greater than the impact on the individual victim. They are \ncrimes against entire communities, the whole Nation, and the ideals of \nliberty and justice upon which America was founded.\n  First enacted nearly 40 years ago after the assassination of Martin \nLuther King, Federal hate crime laws have provided an important basis \nfor prosecuting those who commit violent acts against another due to \nthe person's race, color, religion or national origin.\n  Current law, however, makes it unnecessarily difficult to investigate \nand prosecute these and other insidious hate crimes. Consequently, the \ntime has come to remove some of these hurdles and to expand the scope \nof Federal law so Americans who fall victim to hate crimes can receive \nprotection under Federal law.\n  That is why I have cosponsored the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \nAct of 2007, a bipartisan bill with broad political support that has \nbeen endorsed by 210 law enforcement, civil rights, civic, and \nreligious organizations.\n  The bill will strengthen the ability of Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, \nethnic background, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, \nand gender identity.\n  The bill will also provide grants to help State and local governments \nmeet the extraordinary expenses involved in hate crime cases.\n  This bill, while adding to Federal authority, properly leaves with \nthe State or local law enforcement officials the primary responsibility \nof protecting citizens against crimes of violence. The bill authorizes \nactual Federal prosecutions only when a State does not have \njurisdiction, when a State asks the Federal Government to take \njurisdiction, or when a State fails to act. It is a Federal back-up for \nState and local law enforcement.\n  While State and local governments should continue to have the primary \nresponsibility for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, an \nexpanded Federal role is necessary to ensure an adequate and fair \nresponse in all cases. The Federal Government must have jurisdiction to \naddress those limited, but important cases in which local authorities \nare either unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute.\n  Failure to pass Federal hate crimes legislation would signify our \nfailure as a nation to accord each of our citizens the respect and \nvalue they deserve.\n  According to FBI statistics, 27,432 people were victims of hate-\nmotivated violence over the last three years. That's an average of over \n9,100 people per year, with nearly 25 people being victimized every day \nof the year, based on their race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic \nbackground, or disability. But it is estimated that the vast majority \nof hate crimes goes unreported. Survey data from the biannual National \nCrime Victimization Survey suggests that an average of 191,000 hate \ncrime victimizations take place per year.\n  While hatred and bigotry cannot be eradicated by an act of Congress, \nas a nation, we must send a strong, clear, moral response to these \ncowardly acts of violence. I believe that the Federal Government must \nplay a leadership role in confronting criminal acts motivated by \nprejudice.\n  All Americans have a stake in responding decisively to violent \nbigotry. We must pull together to combat ignorance and hatred. The \ndevastation caused by hate crimes impacts the victims, members of his \nor her family, as well as entire communities, and the Nation as a \nwhole.\n  I am reminded of the great wisdom of Martin Luther King, ``Darkness \ncannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive \nout hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence \nmultiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending \nspiral of destruction. The chain reaction of evil--hate begetting hate, \nwars producing wars--must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the \ndark abyss of annihilation.'' Strength to Love, 1963.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up against ignorance and intolerance \nand vote for the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the \nLocal Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, and I commend \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership and \ndetermination on this issue. We have tried for the better half of a \ndecade to get this legislation passed, signed, and enacted into law. \nToday represents our strongest effort to date, and it is long past time \nthat crimes based on hate be recognized and criminalized under Federal \nlaw. The need for Federal hate crimes legislation has been apparent for \nyears as hate crimes know no State borders and--in part because their \nimpacts often affect the very fabric of our society--they are a problem \nthat affects all Americans.\n  This act sends the message that we will not tolerate acts of \naggression and violence towards targeted communities or individuals who \nbecome victims of violence merely for being themselves. Perpetrators of \nthis type of violence will now be subject to Federal prosecution under \nthis act. Before we had to rely on the States to act, and some simply \nhave failed to do enough to stem this type of criminal behavior. This \nact recognizes that hate crimes have national consequences and are not \nmere localized occurrences.\n  Put simply, a hate crime tends to impact an entire community, as \nopposed to being limited to the victim or the victim's family. It is a \ncrime against a particular group, and must be treated as such. In \nessence, there are two crimes--one against he victim, and one against \nthe victim's group or community. Some have asked, ``But aren't all \ncrimes based on hate?'' No, they are not. Hate crimes are unique \nbecause they cut at the very fabric of our national values; they \nundermine shared\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nprinciples like tolerance and equal protection under the law, and in so \ndoing, harm us all. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government \nto address this issue and arm prosecutors with the tools they need to \nseek justice, promote order and provide all American with equal \nprotection under the law.\n  The framework of the Constitution provides a sound basis for our \nactions today--both the Commerce Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment \nare implicated by these crimes. The effects of hate crimes do not end \nat a State's border, but rather transcend those borders. These crimes \nimplicate a citizen's ability to move and travel freely. Additionally, \nviolence based on someone's race, religion, sexual orientation, or the \nother characteristics noted in the act are reminiscent of the ultimate \nhate crime--slavery. As such, the 13th Amendment allows for Federal \naction to remedy this problem. The courts have ruled time and time \nagain that discrimination in housing and discrimination in contractual \nagreements could be remedied through Federal statutes promulgated under \nthe authority of the Thirteenth Amendment. It matters not what the \ndiscrimination is based on, what matters is the, discrimination itself. \nIn an attempt to rid the last vestiges of slavery from our society, the \ncourts have allowed the 13th Amendment to be the basis of such \nlegislation.\n\n  Let us be very clear, we are not criminalizing speech. Violent acts \nagainst an African American, a woman, or a Sikh because of who they are \ndo not constitute free expression. Nor are we are criminalizing evil \nthoughts. We are only criminalizing action--harmful and violent action \nthat cuts against our society and against the very meaning of what it \nis to be an American. Congress and local law enforcement are not \nbecoming the ``thought-police.'' Rather, we are criminalizing the \nviolent actions of closed-minded and hateful individuals.\n  In today's society, we see all too frequently violence based on the \nperson's race, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. \nWe must act to address these injustices. This is not about special \nrights to any particular group. Actually, it is quite the contrary. \nThis is about equal rights. This is about going after those individuals \nwho act on their harmful beliefs. By committing hate crimes, they are \nattempting to relegate certain people to second-class citizenship. They \nthink they can do this through violence. But they are wrong, and this \nlegislation is a forceful statement that this country will not tolerate \nthis behavior.\n  The victims of these crimes have done nothing to bring on this \nviolence. Because of these crimes, the victims' communities frequently \nlive in fear. Unfortunately, these crimes are not few and far between. \nThese crimes are all too common, and when committed, they send a \nshockwave that can be felt across the country. Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd are just two of the many thousands of victims of hate crimes \nwhose deaths horrified this country. Additionally, we mustn't forget \nthe thousands of loyal and patriotic Americans, who after 9/11, were \nattacked by ruthless thugs, all because they ``looked'' like--or were--\nMuslims or Arab Americans. We saw many of these attacks in New York, \nand let me say, those attacks were not just a New York problem, they \nwere an American problem. Every State experienced similar violence in \nthe months after 9/11, and that is one reason why Federal legislation \nis appropriate.\n  The Act not only makes hate crimes a Federal crime, but it also \nserves to benefit local police departments as well, considering they \nare the front line of defense and prevention. This Act delivers much \nneeded financial assistance to local police departments who may be \nstruggling to deal with the crimes. It will also assist them in helping \nthe community which they protect.\n  The point is, that we should be protecting communities who are \ntargets of this shameful violence, and this Act today marks a great \nstep in that direction. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this \nAct and look forward to working with you all to see this Act gets \npassed and signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 1107. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce cost-sharing under part D of such title for certain non-\ninstitutionalized full-benefit dual eligible individuals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1108. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a special enrollment period for individuals who qualify for an \nincome-related subsidy under the Medicare prescription drug program and \nto provide funding for the conduct of outreach and education with \nrespect to the premium and cost-sharing subsidies under such program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, to introduce a package of four bills aimed at helping \nseniors get the assistance they need with their Medicare prescription \ndrug costs. Thirty-nine million individuals now have access to \naffordable prescription drug therapies through Medicare Part D, many \nfor the very first time. But low-income beneficiaries still are \nexperiencing difficulties taking full advantage of the program's \nbenefits. I believe the bipartisan package of legislation we have \ndeveloped will go a long way to removing programmatic barriers that are \nlimiting seniors from getting the help we intended them to have when we \ncreated Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program.\n  The low-income subsidy (LIS) is one of the best features of \nMedicare's new prescription drug benefit. Over the past few years, I \nhave conducted extensive oversight of the program's implementation, \nespecially through my work as Chairman and now Ranking Member of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging. Through hearings and staff-level \ninvestigations, I have identified a number of concerns with both the \nadministration and the overall effectiveness of Medicare Part D's LIS. \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Social \nSecurity Administration (SSA) have made a great deal of progress to \nensure that the benefit is working well for all beneficiaries. But \ntheir efforts can only go so far. Ultimately, it is Congress' \nresponsibility to ensure that all low-income seniors who have \ndifficulty paying their prescription drugs costs get the help they \nneed.\n  Two of the four bills that Senator Bingaman and I are filing today \nare based upon initiatives that I introduced during the 109th Congress. \nThe first is a measure that would create parity in the cost-sharing \ncharged beneficiaries living in nursing homes and assisted living \nfacilities. Under current law, dual-eligible Medicare beneficiaries, \nthose who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare coverage, receive a \nsubsidy from the government to pay the benefit's required $250 \ndeductible. These individuals also qualify for reduced copayments for \nboth generic and brand named drugs in the amount of one and three \ndollars respectively. If a dual-eligible beneficiary receives long-term \ncare services in an institutional setting, such as a nursing home, he \nor she is exempt from paying the required copayment. Congress decided \nto provide this assistance because dual-eligible beneficiaries residing \nin nursing homes live off of very limited incomes. For instance, in \nOregon the personal needs allowance beneficiaries receive each month \nfor incidentals, including medications, is only $30. As many \ninstitutionalized beneficiaries are on multiple medications, they would \nnot be able to meet their share of drug costs.\n  This is the very reason Congress provided institutionalized dual-\neligible beneficiaries with an exemption from all copayments under \nMedicare Part D. However, many dual-eligible beneficiaries choose to \nreceive long-term care services in home or community-based settings, \nsuch as assisted living or resident care program facilities. Almost all \nstates have chosen to establish Home and Community Based Services \n(HCS) Medicaid demonstration projects that have expanded access to \ncommunity based alternatives to an even greater number of low-income \nelderly Americans. The State of Oregon operates one of the Nation's \nmost successful HCS waivers, serving an average of 23,500 dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\neach year. My state has a thriving community based care industry that \nhas provided many dual-eligible Oregonians the freedom to choose the \ncare setting that best meets their own physical and social needs.\n\n  While dual-eligible beneficiaries are exempted from prescription drug \ncopayments under Medicare Part D, those choosing community-based \nalternatives are required to pay them. This is despite the fact that \nbeneficiaries choosing community based care options typically live off \nof the same limited incomes as those residing in nursing homes. While \nsome states provide HCS beneficiaries' a larger personal stipend each \nmonth, many may have greater financial demands. At the end of the day, \nthey are in no better position to pay the costs of prescription drugs \nthan those beneficiaries living in nursing homes.\n  I also should note that their less restrictive living environments \nmay require them to take additional medications to support their daily \nroutines. It is not uncommon for dual-eligible beneficiaries in \ncommunity-based care settings to be on 8 to 10 medications at a given \ntime. At that level, even minimal copayments create a significant \nfinancial burden to these individuals.\n  The current dual-eligible copayment exemption policy not only is \ncreating inequity in Medicare Part D, it is potentially restricting \naccess to life-saving medications. This is not what Congress intended. \nI believe we need to do everything possible to support choice in long-\nterm care, and by applying the current institutional copayment \nexemption more uniformly, Congress will ensure the Medicare drug \nbenefit does not adversely affect beneficiaries' choices.\n  The second measure I am introducing today is based upon a bill I \nfiled last year. That legislation sought to provide beneficiaries \napplying for LIS extra time to enroll into Part D if they had not \nreceived notification of their eligibility status by the time an open \nenrollment period ended. The bill also would have also waived the late \nenrollment penalty assessed to all beneficiaries who enroll outside of \nan enrollment period. Fortunately, CMS enacted an administrative \nsolution to this problem, and allowed all LIS eligible beneficiaries to \nenroll into Medicare Part D at any point during 2006, and later \nextended that policy into 2007.\n  Now that Medicare Part D is fully implemented and policymakers have \nhad an opportunity to assess how well the program is working, I believe \nthat the administrative actions taken by CMS last year to create a \nspecial enrollment period for LIS beneficiaries should be made \npermanent. The Medicare Part D Outreach Enrollment Enhancement Act of \n2007 does just that. It would create a 90-day special enrollment period \nfor any beneficiary who applies and is approved for the LIS at any \npoint during the year. It also would allow them to undergo a \nfacilitated enrollment process overseen by CMS, so they get the help \nthey need to select a prescription drug plan that best meets their \nneeds.\n  Additionally, the bill exempts low-income beneficiaries from Medicare \nPart D's late enrollment penalty. While an enrollment penalty can be an \neffective means of helping drug plans better assess their risk in a \ngiven period, it is not fair to ask our low-income seniors--many who \nstruggle with a number of challenging healthcare problems--to pay a \nhigher cost simply because they need additional time to enroll in the \nprogram. Selecting a prescription drug plan can be a challenging feat, \nand it can be even more complicated if you are trying to make your \nlimited income stretch as far as it can. We need to guarantee that \nbeneficiaries have sufficient time to choose the most affordable plan \nthat also meets all their prescription drug needs.\n  The measure also would create a new authorization to support the \nvaluable work of State Health Insurance Programs (SHIPs). SHIPs provide \na range of services to our nation's seniors, such as help choosing a \nquality prescription drug plan, applying for financial assistance with \ntheir drug costs and resolving general problems experienced with the \ndrug benefit. Unfortunately, funding for SHIPs has not kept pace with \nthe number of beneficiaries that age into Medicare each year. To remedy \nthat, my bill creates a new authorization that increases funding in \nconjunction with growth in enrollment. The bill also provides funding \nfor the new National Center of Senior Benefits and Outreach, created in \nthe Older Americans Act last year. The Center is charged with \ndeveloping ways to assist organizations like SHIPs to better target \ntheir efforts so that all seniors are fully aware of the benefits that \nmight be available to them.\n  The next bill in the package we are filing today addresses a problem \nlow-income seniors encounter if and when they enter into the drug \nbenefit's coverage gap. While beneficiaries still have access to \nmedications through their drug plans during the coverage gap, they may \nhave to pay more for them. For those living on fixed incomes, this \ncould present a serious problem as the out-of-pocket cost of many \ncommon prescription drugs can be quite steep. Fortunately, many safety-\nnet programs, like community health centers and the AIDS Drug \nAssistance Program (ADAP), provide assistance to eligible low-income \nbeneficiaries during the coverage gap. Effectively, they fill the role \nof the drug plan in providing beneficiaries access to their medications \nat a heavily subsidized cost.\n  This scenario presently works well for a number of low-income \nbeneficiaries, but it is simply unsustainable in the long-run for two \nkey reasons. First, from the perspective of beneficiaries, it is not \nright to ask them to continue paying premiums to their drug plans \nduring the coverage gap when they are unable to generate sufficient \nout-of-pocket expenses to qualify for the program's catastrophic \nbenefit. Many low-income beneficiaries who get ``caught'' in the \ncoverage gap struggle with significant health problems, such as cancer \nor HIV/AIDS. These conditions often require costly treatment that a \nlow-income beneficiary would likely have to forge without the \nassistance of a safety-net provider.\n  Second, the current scenario is placing a disadvantageous strain on \nthe safety-net programs that assist low-income beneficiaries with their \ndrug costs during the coverage gap. One of the primary reasons Medicare \nPart D was created was to provide relief to states and other safety-net \nproviders who bore a lion's share of the responsibility of providing \naccess to drug therapies for the Nation's seniors. While Part D has \ngone a long way to fulfill that intention, there is still much that can \nbe done to help our safety-net providers. It is not right that service \nproviders like community health centers and ADAP have been forced to \nprovide discounted medications to low-income beneficiaries during the \ncoverage gap, especially when the beneficiary has no way of accruing \nenough out-of-pocket costs for their Part D coverage to resume.\n\n  The bill Senator Bingaman and I are filing today resolves both these \nproblems. It would allow safety net providers' drug costs to count \ntoward a beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs so they are able to reach \nMedicare Part D's catastrophic benefit at some point. This will ensure \nthat low-income beneficiaries have access to the full range of coverage \nunder the program and will provide much needed fiscal relief to already \nstrained safety net providers. Congress intended for all \nbeneficiaries--especially those with limited incomes--to have full \naccess to the benefits through Medicare Part D. This bill will \nguarantee that happens.\n  Despite the progress we have made in providing low-income seniors \naccess to affordable prescription drugs, I find it troubling that \nrecent estimates still show that there may be at least three million \nseniors eligible for the low-income subsidy who have yet to apply for \nit. While CMS, SSA and their community partners continue their vital \noutreach to capture these seniors, I believe the existing LIS \napplication is too complex and is preventing seniors from getting the \nhelp they need. We need a simpler process that better reflects the true \nlevels of assets and resources held by low-income seniors.\n  The last bill in the package I am filing today does just that. The \nPart D Equity for Low-Income Seniors Act is the product of months of \nbipartisan collaboration with representatives of groups like AARP, the \nNational Council on Aging and Families USA. It aims to help SSA better \ntarget potentially\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\neligible beneficiaries and make the application process much simpler to \ncomplete.\n  First, drawing from a recommendation from the Health and Human \nServices Office of Inspector General, SSA is given the authority to use \nselect tax information to help determine which Medicare beneficiaries \nmight be eligible for extra help with their drug costs. With this data, \nthey would be able to more efficiently contact beneficiaries and \nprescreen them for potential eligibility. I realize that some of my \ncolleagues might have privacy concerns with such an arrangement, but I \nwant to make clear that my bill is not giving SSA access to any data \nthat they already do not have. In order to implement the Part B subsidy \nadjustment, the Medicare Modernization Act requires that the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) send tax data to the SSA--they are legally \nprohibited from using it for any other purpose than Part B. We simply \nare establishing the same process for data exchange that already exists \nbetween the IRS and SSA so that SSA can more efficiently conduct its \noutreach work for Medicare Part D's low-income subsidy.\n  The bill also seeks to make the LIS application easier for seniors to \ncomplete. I have heard a number of complaints that the current form \nuses confusing verbiage and is overly burdensome in its reporting \nrequirements. As a remedy, we eliminate the reporting of retirement \naccount balances, the face value of life savings policies and in-kind \ncontributions. This not only will make the form easier to complete, it \nwill prevent seniors from the pressure of having to determine whether \nthey should sacrifice their retirement income or long-term risk \nprotection in order to pay their healthcare bills. I believe we need to \nbe encouraging seniors to save for their later years in life, not \nrequiring them to liquidate their futures to fill their prescriptions.\n\n  In order to make the LIS benefit more accurately reflect the assets \nand resources low-income seniors possess, our bill also proposes \nraising the current asset test limit to $27,500 for an individual and \n$55,000 for a couple. According to data from the SSA, this increase \nshould help capture almost 40 percent of the individuals who are \nineligible for the LIS benefit due to excess resources, and 50 percent \nof the couples. I realize this can be a sensitive issue for some of my \ncolleagues--especially on my side of the aisle. We want to ensure that \nonly those beneficiaries who truly are in need of help with their drug \nare eligible for government assistance. But, I also believe that we can \nbe too heavyhanded and prevent those with legitimate need from getting \nit. The new asset/resource limits Senator Bingaman and I have proposed \nrepresent a good, bipartisan solution to the problem. I know many would \nlike to see the full asset test repealed, but this year that may be a \ndifficult feat to accomplish politically and financially. This is a \nreasonable step forward, one the advocates support. I hope my \ncolleagues will as well.\n  I believe that the Medicare Prescription Drug Program is working for \nAmerica's seniors and that we should not undertake a significant \noverhaul of the new benefit in this Congress. However, there is room \nfor improvement, especially in regard to making the program work better \nfor America's low-income seniors. I firmly believe that if Congress \ndoes not address some of these lingering problems this year, Medicare's \nlong-term public image could be severely tarnished in the eyes of the \nvery people it was created to serve.\n  One can learn a great deal about the character of a society by \nlooking at how well it cares for its poor and vulnerable citizens. I \nbelieve my four bills that improve upon how Medicare Part D serves low-\nincome beneficiaries will help cement the United States as a country \nthat looks out for its citizens in need. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in supporting the full package and assist me in moving it through \nthe process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 146\n\n       Whereas, the bald eagle was designated as the national \n     emblem of the United States on June 20, 1782, by our \n     country's Founding Fathers at the Second Continental \n     Congress;\n       Whereas, the bald eagle is the central image used in the \n     Great Seal of the United States and the seals of the \n     President and Vice President;\n       Whereas, the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) Congress;\n       (2) the Supreme Court;\n       (3) the Department of Defense;\n       (4) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (5) the Department of Justice;\n       (6) the Department of State;\n       (7) the Department of Commerce;\n       (8) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (9) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (10) the Department of Labor;\n       (11) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (12) the Department of Energy;\n       (13) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (14) the Central Intelligence Agency; and\n       (15) the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas, the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of the \n     American spirit of freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas, the image, meaning, and symbolism of the bald \n     eagle have played a significant role in American art, music, \n     history, literature, architecture, and culture since the \n     founding of our Nation;\n       Whereas, the bald eagle is featured prominently on United \n     States stamps, currency, and coinage;\n       Whereas, the habitat of bald eagles exists only in North \n     America;\n       Whereas, by 1963, the number of nesting pairs of bald \n     eagles in the lower 48 States had dropped to about 417;\n       Whereas, the bald eagle was first listed as an endangered \n     species in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation \n     Act, the Federal law that preceded the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973;\n       Whereas, caring and concerned citizens of the United States \n     in the private and public sectors banded together to save, \n     and help ensure the protection of, bald eagles;\n       Whereas, in 1995, as a result of the efforts of those \n     caring and concerned citizens, bald eagles were removed from \n     the ``endangered'' species list and upgraded to the less \n     imperiled ``threatened'' status under the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973;\n       Whereas, by 2006, the number of bald eagles in the lower 48 \n     States had increased to approximately 7,000 to 8,000 nesting \n     pairs;\n       Whereas, the administration is likely to officially delist \n     the bald eagle from both the ``endangered'' and \n     ``threatened'' species lists under the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973, with a final decision expected no later than June \n     29, 2007;\n       Whereas, if delisted under the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973, bald eagles should be provided strong protection under \n     the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory \n     Bird Treaty Act;\n       Whereas, bald eagles would have been permanently extinct if \n     not for vigilant conservation efforts of concerned citizens \n     and strict protection laws;\n       Whereas, the dramatic recovery of the bald eagle population \n     is an endangered species success story and an inspirational \n     example for other wildlife and natural resource conservation \n     efforts around the world;\n       Whereas, the initial recovery of the bald eagle population \n     was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas, the sustained recovery of the bald eagle \n     population will require the continuation of recovery, \n     management, education, and public awareness programs, to \n     ensure that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2007, as ``American Eagle Day'';

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 229) to redesignate a Federal building in \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the ``Raymond G.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today that we will \nhave renamed the Albuquerque VA facility as the Raymond G. Murphy \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. I thank my colleague \nSenator Bingaman for his support on this issue, as well as Senator \nAkaka and Senator Craig and the staff on the Committee of Veterans' \nAffairs for their help.\n  Raymond ``Jerry'' Murphy died last Friday at the age of 77. His \nobituary described him as ``one of the softest-spoken, most modest men \nto ever wear the Medal of Honor.'' Jerry Murphy was a true American \nhero who in war and peace dedicated himself to others. CPT Jerry Murphy \nwas the 39th U.S. Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism \nin the Korean war. When he returned from war he dedicated his entire \nlife to taking care of other veterans. He spent 23 years working in the \nAlbuquerque VA regional office. Upon his retirement, he continued to \nserve veterans as a volunteer until he became too sick to do so. I \nthink it is only right that the medical center in Albuquerque bear his \nname in recognition of his great service to veterans and to the Nation.\n  I came to the floor earlier in the week and spoke about my good \nfriend after he died. I stand by that statement and again send my \ncondolences to Jerry's wife Maryann, his sons John, Michael, and Tim, \nhis daughter Eleanor, as well as his eight grandchildren. It is never \neasy to lose a loved one, but at these trying moments, we can take \nsolace in the fact that Jerry lived a long and fulfilling life. He \nhelped many people and touched many lives. His service is a shining \nexample to civilians and veterans alike of a life dedicated to service.\n  I am very proud to have known Jerry Murphy and to have been able to \ncall him my friend. It is a privilege to play a part in bestowing this \ndeserving honor on a great man and a great American, Raymond Gerald \nMurphy.\n  Mr. REID.

I \nalso would be remiss if I did not mention the primary individuals who \nwere here during most, if not all, of that debate: Senators Harkin, \nSpecter, Brownback, Coleman, and Isakson. They conducted the debate in \na manner which shows Members can disagree and not be disagreeable. \nAlthough there were different points of view, the debate was clearly \nvery informative and educational.\n  Also, we just entered an order allowing the Senate to consider the \nIntelligence authorization bill on Monday. There will be a cloture vote \non that bill at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  The Senate will not be in session on Friday. Therefore, there will be \nno rollcall votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/12/senate-section/article/S4457-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
