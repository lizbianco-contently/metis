Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately \nproceed to executive session for an hour's debate regarding three \nnoncontroversial--we hope, at least--District Court nominations. The \ntime is equally divided and controlled between Senators Leahy and \nSpecter or their designees, and Members can expect votes on these \nnominations to occur at approximately 11 a.m. this morning.\n  Once the nominations have been confirmed, Senator Barrasso will be \nrecognized to give his maiden speech, and he will be recognized for up \nto 30 minutes.\n  I say to Senator Barrasso and others, sometimes these maiden speeches \nbear fruit. I remember my first speech. I was speaking on the \nTaxpayers' Bill of Rights, and presiding, as is the Senator from \nVirginia today, was Senator David Pryor from Arkansas, who was chairman \nof the IRS Subcommittee of the Finance Committee. Also listening to \nthis speech, fortuitously, was Senator Grassley, who was a member of \nthe Finance Committee--not a senior member but someone who was active. \nWhen I finished my speech, talking about the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights \nmaking it a more level playing field between the taxpayer and the tax \ncollector, Senator Pryor had written a note, given it to a page, and he \nsaid to me he liked what I was trying to do and would help me. I also \ngot a communication from Senator Grassley that he wanted to work on \nthis.\n  Well, to make a long story short, Mr. President, because of their \ninvolvement, I had to do very little. That legislation passed, and it \nwas landmark legislation. It was not because of my ability to \ncommunicate as much as who was listening. So I say to Senator Barrasso: \nYou never know what is going to happen with your maiden speech.\n  Once he has completed his speech, the Senate will proceed to the \nTransportation Appropriations bill. Senators Murray and Bond are \nmanagers, and they are prepared to finish that legislation this week. \nThere should be votes prior to 5:30 or 6 o'clock tonight. After that, \nwe will have no votes.\n  Tomorrow should be a very long, productive day because at 1 o'clock \non Wednesday we can have no more votes. We can do more Senate business, \nbut because of the Jewish holiday there will be no more votes after \nthat time.\n  Mr. President, on September 17, which is a week from today, there \nwill be no votes but there will be work. I indicated to the \ndistinguished Republican leader and others that we are going to do what \nwe can to see if we can get the DC-Utah congressional thing worked out, \nthe Voter Rights Bill. What we are working on now is to get some type \nof consent to have a cloture vote on that sometime next week. That \nhasn't been resolved yet but we are working on it. I have kept Senator \nLieberman involved.\n  Next week, also, we are going to move to the authorization bill for \nDefense, which has to be completed. We\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\nneed to complete this appropriations bill this week, because as soon as \nwe complete the Defense authorization bill, we need to move to Defense \nAppropriations. That is what we have to complete before the end of the \nwork period.\n  There are other things we have to do. We have to have some extension \nor some agreement on what we are going to do with the farm bill. We \nhave SCHIP that we need to work on prior to the end of this month. So \nwe have a tremendous amount of work to do. Last week was a very \nproductive week. We had to work a couple of late nights, but it was \nworth it. So that should set us up for this week and give us an idea of \nwhat we are going to do next week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would ask one question of my good \nfriend, the majority leader. I didn't hear him indicate whether--and \nmaybe he doesn't know yet--the Iraq debate will occur in the context of \nthe DOD authorization bill or separate from that.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to try to work with the minority leader to see \nwhat we can work out as to whether we want to have the Iraq votes \nintertwined with Defense authorization or whether we do not. I have \nMembers telling me on the Defense authorization bill that they are \ngoing to offer an amendment to close Guantanamo and offer habeas \ncorpus, so it is going to be a contested piece of legislation. We have \nto complete that.\n  There are some who believe we would be better off having the Iraq \nmatters separate and apart from Defense authorization. I have to work \nthat out first with Senators Levin and McCain. My initial report from \nthem is that they would rather have them separate, but I will work with \nthe minority leader and we will try to finish deciding what we are \ngoing to do by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to make some remarks in my \nleader time. I would ask the Chair if this is the appropriate time to \ndo that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

When we opened this session in January, the situation \nin Iraq appeared to be unraveling. Sectarian violence had sharply \nincreased, particularly in Baghdad, since the bombing of the Golden \nMosque. Foreign fighters were taking advantage of this fighting to \ninflame it even more. And two options emerged: withdraw our forces and \nabandon this fledgling democracy to al-Qaida and the other terrorists, \nor confront them directly, in the streets and neighborhoods where they \nlived.\n  We needed a new and realistic strategy to succeed, and we got one. \nThe President proposed, and a Democratic-led Senate unanimously \nconfirmed, Gen David Petraeus on January 26 to carry out a new plan \naimed at protecting the population in and around Baghdad, beating back \nal-Qaida, and training Iraqi forces to defend Iraq on their own. The \nnew plan would take time and patience. We had no guarantees it would \nwork. But General Petraeus assured us of one thing. In testimony \ndelivered just before his Senate confirmation, he said this:\n\n       I will provide Multinational Force Iraq the best leadership \n     and direction I can muster; I will work to ensure unity of \n     effort with the ambassador and our Iraqi and coalition \n     partners; and I will provide my bosses and you with \n     forthright, professional military advice with respect to the \n     missions given to Multinational Force Iraq and the situation \n     on the ground.\n\n  That was General Petraeus.\n  And if he should determine that this new strategy cannot succeed, the \ngeneral said he would provide such an assessment.--a promise of candor.\n  Tomorrow, General Petraeus will give the Senate the forthright advice \nhe promised, a first-hand account by the commander of U.S. forces in \nIraq on the progress of their mission. And then we, the men and women \nwho unanimously confirmed him for that mission, will respond \naccordingly. This briefing will take place 6 years to the day after the \nattacks of 9/11--when nearly 3,000 innocent people were killed in \nunprovoked attacks; more than in another sneak attack some 60 years \nearlier at Pearl Harbor.\n  Over those 6 years, General Petraeus has compiled an astounding \nrecord of service. He has spent 4 of them deployed away from home and \naway from his family, with nearly 3 years service in Iraq. Let me say \nthat again: 3 years of service in Iraq.\n  He led the 101st Airborne with distinction in northern Iraq early in \nthe fight. Later he improved the way we trained Iraqi security forces \nafter early mistakes by the Coalition Provisional Authority. And he \nserved as commander of the U.S. Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort \nLeavenworth, where he developed the Army's doctrine on \ncounterinsurgency--he literally wrote the book.\n  He has proven his devotion to this country. His integrity is above \nreproach. And any suggestion to the contrary is totally absurd and \ndemonstrably untrue.\n  And so I resent the comments of those who have sat comfortably in \ntheir air-conditioned offices, thousands of miles away from the \nfirefights and the roadside bombs, and tried their Washington best in \nrecent days to impugn the general's good name.\n  The Democratic majority sent him into battle by a unanimous vote, \nfunded his mission, and asked him to report back on progress. And when \nhe returns, is he greeted with the respect and appreciation his service \ndeserves? No. He is attacked again, at home, by some of the very \nDemocratic Senators who confirmed him.\n  They are following the lead of the left-wing groups that placed a \nfull-page ad in today's New York Times, questioning the character--\nquestioning the character--of a four-star general who has the respect \nand admiration of the more than 150,000 brave men and women serving \nunder his command. These childish tactics are an insult to everyone \nfighting for our freedom in Iraq, and they should be condemned. I am \nwaiting for someone on the other side to condemn this ad in the New \nYork Times today--the condemnation it richly deserves.\n  Republicans have tried to maintain a level of civility in this \ndebate. We have let most of the rhetorical excesses of the other side \nslide, knowing that tempers are bound to flare in this charged \nenvironment. But the effort to discredit General Petraeus personally \nover the past few days is completely and totally out of bounds. It \nneeds to be recognized as such, and it needs to end--right now.\n  The early effort to undermine his mission was troubling enough. \nScarcely had a fraction of the additional soldiers or marines landed in \nIraq before we started hearing the voices of defeat. Amazingly, some \nDemocrats who had called for a surge before January, would then label \nthe policy a failure 2 full months before it fully began. Others said \nthe war was lost even as these soldiers and marines were being sent \ninto battle.\n  General Petraeus was asked to carry out a new plan, and it would be a \nchallenge. But it was guaranteed to fail too if armchair generals in \nWashington were allowed to dictate the battle plan from here. And with \nthe help of a single courageous Independent, Republicans circled around \na simple principle: tactics would be dictated by conditions on the \nground, not the political thermometer. Before rushing to legislative \njudgment, we would listen closely to our commanders.\n  We held our ground. Despite the best efforts of some of our \ncolleagues on the other side, we gave our commanders what they needed \nto carry out their plan. Not least of all we gave them hope that they'd \nhave the time and the funding to do their work.\n  As the summer dragged on here in Washington, leftist groups continued \nto insist on an arbitrary withdrawal date. And when they failed to get \ntheir wish in Congress, they followed Republicans home over the August \nrecess, pouring money into misleading political ads and busing in \nprotesters. This was the other surge, a surge aimed at intimidating \nRepublicans who supported the Petraeus Plan.\n  These efforts were misguided--and of course they failed.\n  They failed because Americans will always choose the hopeful path, \nwhen they see one in view. And while the defeatists were pouring out of \ntheir buses\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nwith their coffee and their doughnuts last month, thousands of tough, \ndetermined American soldiers and marines were spilling out into Iraqi \ncities and villages finding a way to win this fight. And the news that \nstarted to trickle back from those villages and towns was this: after a \nlong season of setbacks, there is reason for hope.\n  The first major combat operation of the surge began less than 3 \nmonths ago on June 15. And the early reports of our commanders in the \nfield confirm some truly remarkable gains. Our second in command, GEN \nRaymond Odierno, has told us that total attacks are at the lowest level \nsince last August, that attacks against civilians are at a 6-month low; \ncivilian murders in Baghdad are down to their lowest point since just \nbefore the bombing of the Golden Mosque; and that he sees a new \naggressiveness in Iraqi soldiers, and discipline and pride.\n  This report mirrored others that we have heard, from journalists and \nindependent analysts, about the strong morale of U.S. troops. One of \nthose reports came in late July. After spending 8 days with American \nand Iraqi military and civilian personnel, two prominent early critics \nof the war at the left-leaning Brookings Institution issued a call to \nall critics: stop, look, listen.\n  They said morale among U.S. troops is high, that troops are confident \nin their commander, that they see results, and that they believe they \nhave the numbers to make a difference. And then they told us what many \nothers have confirmed: that Iraqis themselves are turning on the \nextremists, that Al Anbar, once thought to be lost to al-Qaida, has \ngone in 6 months from being the worst place in Iraq to the best. The \nmarines and soldiers fighting in Anbar have been working with the local \ntribes and sheiks for years to produce this result, but their efforts \nare beginning to show remarkable results.\n  The authors of this report didn't sugarcoat the hard realities in \nIraq. The obstacles are enormous. And they admitted what all of us, \nincluding General Petraeus, have long known and repeatedly said: that \nwe can't stay in Iraq indefinitely at current troop levels. But, they \nconcluded, we are finally getting somewhere militarily. And it would be \nfoolish to turn back now.\n  We have heard of stirring scenes in recent weeks: hundreds of \nthousands of Iraqi pilgrims marching to the Kadhimiya Shrine in Baghdad \nin peace, protected by the Iraqi security forces. Political leaders \nfrom across the ethnic divides who once stood by silently as terrorists \nbombed neighborhoods and mosques now joining together to condemn them. \nArabs, Kurds, Sunnis, Shias, and Christians working together in Ninevah \nto help the victims of the recent bombing there.\n  Americans like what they have heard. Recent polls suggest that an \nincreasing number of Americans now think we have a chance of winning. \nThey have put their trust in our commanders and the troops in the \nfield, and they trust that we will respect their gains and listen to \ntheir general, without prejudice, when he reports back to us this week. \nThe early successes of the Petraeus Plan give America hope that we can \nbring about ample stability to Iraq, and it also gives us real hope \nthat we can start to bring our troops back, not in retreat but with \nfull honor and pride.\n  None of us wants the troops to stay in Iraq any longer than it takes \nto make it a stable democracy capable of defending itself. But \nRepublicans have insisted that we let the uniformed generals advise us \nwhen that time comes, not armchair generals who are more focused on the \npolls than on a successful mission.\n  General Petraeus has already hinted that a reduction in troop levels \nmight be possible at or near the end of the year. This is the most \nwelcome news yet, and if he recommends it tomorrow, I assure you \nRepublicans will be ready to draft the legislation supporting that \nrequest.\n  We hope that Democrats who have signaled a willingness to cooperate \non Iraq, after 8 months of insisting on arbitrary withdrawal dates and \npremature troop reductions, join us in acknowledging that our generals \nknow better than we do what it takes to win this war.\n  Again, none of us wants the troops in harm's way a minute longer than \nnecessary. But while there is a chance for hope, we will not retreat. \nWe know the stakes if we leave Iraq to terrorists: slaughter on an \nunimaginable scale, the abandonment of an entire nation to vicious \nkillers who would use it as a staging ground for future acts of \nviolence against Americans, an open field for Iran, and the entire \nworld murmuring that America doesn't have the patience or the stomach \nor the grit to win.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle sent General Petraeus to Iraq, \nthen tried to control the mission. When that failed, they tried to \ndefine the mission as a failure. And in a last-minute burst of \ndefeatism, they have tried to discredit the man they sent to carry that \nmission out. No wonder a recent poll showed that only 3 percent of \nAmericans think the Democratic Congress is doing a good job handling \nthe war.\n  Let's listen to General Petraeus when he gets here, really listen. I \nknow that is hard for Senators, but let's listen and respond \naccordingly. At some point we will have to draw down our forces, and we \nwon't leave perfection in our wake. We know we will have to maintain a \nlong-term presence in Iraq and the region. We must deter Iran, we must \ncombat al-Qaida, and we cannot countenance terrorist sanctuaries.\n  But crafting a wise policy for the region over the long term will be \nimpossible in the current partisan climate. Let's listen to the ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, the senior Senator from \nIndiana, who said we will only be able to craft a sustainable \nbipartisan strategy in Iraq together.\n  Eight months ago, the situation in Iraq was unraveling. It remains \ndifficult and dangerous. But there is hope and proof, not only of \nsuccess, not only of bottom-up political progress on the ground, but \nfor the reduction in troops that all of us want. And if General \nPetraeus says this is warranted, then we will act, together, and move \nforward with new confidence that we can craft a sensible policy for \nprotecting our interests not only in Iraq but in the broader Persian \nGulf.\n  Let's allow this man to speak tomorrow and listen to him without \nprejudice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11285-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11285-S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF WILLIAM LINDSAY OSTEEN, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n            JUDGE FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MARTIN KARL REIDINGER, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n               FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JANIS LYNN SAMMARTINO, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations en bloc, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of William \nLindsay Osteen, Jr., of North Carolina, to be United States District \nJudge for the Middle District of North Carolina; Martin Karl Reidinger, \nof North Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina; and Janis Lynn Sammartino, of California, \nto be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nCalifornia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 60 minutes of debate equally divided between the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North \nCarolina is on the floor and wishes to speak. Obviously, I will yield \nher more time if she wants, but I ask unanimous consent that she be \nyielded 10 minutes out of the time reserved for the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today the Senate has the opportunity to \nconfirm, for district judgeships, William Osteen, Jr. and Martin K. \nReidinger, two of North Carolina's most talented and capable legal \nminds. Both of these men have impeccable credentials, a keen sense of \njustice and a strong desire to serve. I am fully confident that Bill \nand Martin would serve the people of my home State with great honor and \ndistinction as members of the Federal judiciary.\n  I am delighted to support Bill Osteen, to serve as a judge for the \nMiddle District. With deep roots in North Carolina, Bill received his \neducation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has \npracticed law in the State for the past two decades. In 2004 and 2005, \nBusiness North Carolina included him in its Legal Elite--the cream of \nthe crop, selected not by the editors of the magazine but by State bar \ncolleagues.\n  Bill has broad experience in both criminal and civil litigation. As \nwe all know, criminal cases make up a substantial and increasingly \nlarge portion of a Federal district judge's docket, and Bill is well \nequipped to handle this important aspect of the job. He estimates that \nhe has served as the counsel of record in more than 100 Federal \ncriminal cases. Bill also knows his way around a courtroom. In an age \nwhen most cases are resolved through settlement or plea agreement, Bill \nhas taken over 30 cases to trial. On the strength of this experience, I \nhave no doubt that he will be able to make the transition to district \njudge without missing a beat.\n  In addition to a distinguished professional life, Bill also has a \nvery full personal life. He is a dedicated family man to his wife \nElizabeth and their two children, Anne Bennett and Bill, and he is a \nman of faith, actively involved in the First Presbyterian Church of \nGreensboro. It is also notable that Bill has been nominated to succeed \nhis father to this seat. Bill's father, William Osteen, Sr., has served \nthe Middle District with great distinction and it is a rare and \nremarkable feat that a son has the opportunity to serve in his father's \nonetime place on the bench. And let me add that Bill's mother, Joanne, \nhas been a treasured friend since our Duke days together. I know the \nOsteens are very proud of their son and I am honored to highlight \nBill's many qualifications here today.\n  Another outstanding North Carolinian for the Western District of \nNorth Carolina, Martin Reidinger, has built quite an impressive record \nof accomplishment over the years. A graduate of the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, he has practiced law for the past 23 years in \nAsheville with Adams Hendon Carson Crow & Saenger. There he gained vast \ncivil litigation experience, handling matters running the gamut from \nemployment law to land disputes. He frequently appears in Federal \ncourts and has litigated to a verdict or judgment nearly 200 cases over \nthe past two decades.\n  In addition to his vast professional experience, Martin makes it a \ntop priority to give back to his community. He has served as the \npresident and secretary-treasurer of the Buncombe County Bar \nAssociation, and he currently sits on the board of directors for Pisgah \nLegal Services, which provides free, civil legal services to low-income \npeople who are unable to afford an attorney. In fact, in 2004, Martin \naccepted the North Carolina State bar's Outstanding Pro Bono Services \nAward for his law firm's commitment to giving back to their community. \nIn addition to his extensive public service work, Martin is dedicated \nto his family--his wife Patti and children Heather, Sara, Alex and Max.\n  Bill Osteen and Martin Reidinger are vastly qualified to serve on the \nFederal bench. They have earned the admiration of their colleagues and \npeers and support from Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  It was my privilege to recommend these individuals to the president \nfor these posts, and I am proud to urge my colleagues to support their \nconfirmation today, so they can get to work for the people of North \nCarolina.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I note \nthat when we confirm these three nominations today--and I fully \nanticipate we will; I will support them and I know Senator Specter will \nsupport them--the Senate will have confirmed 29 nominations for \nlifetime appointments by the middle of September this year. That is 7 \nmore than were confirmed in all of 2005 when the Senate had a \nRepublican majority which was considering nominations of this \nRepublican President. I mention that because consistently, for the \nRepublican President, President Bush, when the Democrats have been in \ncharge, we have moved his nominations faster than Republicans have.\n  You would not know this, certainly, with some of the rhetoric that \ncomes out of the White House; but, you know, sometimes facts get in the \nway of rhetoric. It is a pesky thing.\n  Incidentally, there were 12 more confirmations that were achieved \nduring the entire 1996 session, when Republicans stalled consideration \nof President Clinton's nominations by pocket-vetoing them. It is \nactually a little-known fact that during the Bush Presidency, more \ncircuit judges, more district judges, and more total judges have been \nconfirmed in the time we have had Democrats in control and I have been \nchairman, than during the 10 years that either of the two Republican \nchairmen were working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  Taking into account today's confirmations, the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts lists 46 judicial vacancies. The President has sent \nus only 24 nominations for these 46 remaining vacancies. Twenty-two of \nthese remaining vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 19 \nvacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial \nemergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 8 of them, \nmore than a third. Of the 16 circuit court vacancies, 6, more than a \nthird, are without a nominee. If the President had worked with the \nSenators from Michigan, Rhode Island, Maryland, California, New Jersey, \nand Virginia, we could be in position to make even more progress.\n  Of the 22 vacancies without any nominee, the President has violated \nthe timeline he set for himself at least 13 times--13 have been vacant \nwithout so much as a nominee for more than 180 days. The number of \nviolations may in fact be much higher since the President said he would \nnominate within 180 days of receiving notice that there would be a \nvacancy or intended retirement rather than from the vacancy itself. We \nconservatively estimate that he also violated his own rule 11 times in \nconnection with the nominations he has made. That would mean that with \nrespect to the 46 vacancies, the President is out of compliance with \nhis own rule more than half of the time.\n  William L. Osteen, Jr., is a partner at the two-person law firm of \nAdams & Osteen in Greensboro, NC, where he has worked for his entire \nlegal career. His practice focuses primarily on Federal criminal \nlitigation and State civil litigation.\n  Martin K. Reidinger is a partner at the Asheville, NC, law firm of \nAdams, Hendon, Carson, Crow & Saenger, where he has worked his entire \n23 year legal career as a civil litigator. His legal practice \nconcentrates primarily in the areas of general business litigation, \nland disputes, municipal matters, and employment law.\n  Janis L. Sammartino is the presiding judge in the Superior Court of \nSan Diego County in California. For 12 years, she served on the State \ntrial court bench as a municipal court judge in San Diego, and she \nworked for 18 years as a deputy city attorney in the San Diego City \nAttorney's Office.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday.\n  How much time is remaining for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. We \nhave worked harmoniously in a bipartisan way on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nAn expression I like to use when we change chairmen: It is a seamless \ntransfer of the gavel in a bipartisan way. I join Chairman Leahy in \nasking for the confirmation of the three judicial nominees who are \npending this morning.\n  I start with Janis Lynn Sammartino, who is up for the District Court \nfor the Southern District of California, because she was born in \nPhiladelphia, PA: magna cum laude from Occidental College in 1972, Phi \nBeta Kappa at that university; law degree from Notre Dame; law clerk to \na superior court judge in California, Judge Douglas Seely; deputy city \nattorney; judge on the Municipal Court of the City of San Diego; a \njudge on the Superior Court for San Diego for the past 12 years--a very \ndistinguished resume. She has a majority ``qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, and some rated her as ``well qualified.'' She \ncomes to the floor with the unanimous recommendation of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Similarly, I urge the confirmation of Martin Karl Reidinger for the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. He has \nan outstanding academic record: a bachelor's degree from the University \nof North Carolina-Chapel Hill; a law degree with honors from the \nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Law; Order of the \nCoif, which means top 10 percent academically; North Carolina Law \nReview. He has had an extensive practice with the law firm of Adams \nHendon Carson Crow & Saenger--associate for 5 years and partner for the \nlast 18 years--distinguished qualifications. I think he is well suited \nto become a Federal district court judge.\n  Third, I urge the confirmation of William Lindsay Osteen, Jr., for \nthe District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. He has a \nbachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in \n1983 and a law degree from the same university in 1987. He practiced \nlaw for the last 20 years--first as an associate and later as a \npartner--in Adams & Osteen, and has a distinguished curriculum vitae.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resumes of these three distinguished \nnominees be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Janis Lynn Sammartino--United States District Judge for the Southern \n                         District of California\n\n       Birth: April 24, 1950, Philadelphia, PA.\n       Legal Residence: California.\n       Education: A.B., Magna Cum Laude, Occidental College, 1972; \n     Phi Beta Kappa; J.D., University of Notre Dame Law School, \n     1975.\n       Employment: Law Clerk, Judge Douglas Seely, Superior Court, \n     St. Joseph County, Indiana, 1975-1976; Deputy City Attorney, \n     San Diego City Attorney's Office, 1976-1994; Judge, Municipal \n     Court of the City of San Diego, 1994-1995; Judge, Superior \n     Court of San Diego County, 1995-Present.\n       Selected Activities: Master and President-elect, American \n     Inns of Court, Louis M.

Mr. President, I see the Senator from North Carolina. I \nam going to yield the floor to him and perhaps take a minute or two at \nthe conclusion of his comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to stand before \nmy colleagues today to urge them to confirm two great lawyers in North \nCarolina to be U.S. district court judges. I wish to take a moment to \ncommend my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for unanimously \nreporting out Bill Osteen, Jr., and Martin Reidinger before we \nadjourned for the August recess. I thank Judiciary Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Specter for their dedication to ensuring that judicial \nnominees get hearings and votes on the Senate floor. I am grateful for \nthe care and passion with which the Judiciary Committee members \napproach their responsibility of examining nominees for Federal \njudgeships.\n  I have often said that there is no area of our daily lives that is \nnot somehow affected by judicial decisions. The decisions made by \njudges today will have a lasting effect long after we are gone from \nthis institution. It is critical that these Federal judges serve to \nadminister justice according to the strict interpretation of law and \nthe Constitution. We have before us today the opportunity to confirm \ntwo individuals who are committed to doing just that.\n  As I mentioned in my remarks before the Judiciary Committee when he \nhad his hearing, this is not the first time that somebody by the name \nof Bill Osteen has been before the Senate for consideration. Fifteen \nyears ago, Bill Osteen's father was confirmed to be a U.S. district \ncourt judge. Bill Osteen, Jr., was nominated by the President to be a \nFederal judge because he is qualified to serve on the bench, and I am \nconfident he will continue to work towards a strong judicial system in \nNorth Carolina.\n  Born and raised in Greensboro, he attended the University of North \nCarolina in Chapel Hill for both undergraduate and graduate law school. \nHe has a diverse legal background and has litigated many cases spanning \nall areas of the legal profession. Trying both civil and criminal \nmatters, Bill spent much of his time in the Federal courtroom. After \ntoday, I hope he continues to spend his time in the Federal courtroom \nbut now for a different reason in a different seat.\n  While I am impressed by the professional qualifications he will bring \nto the bench if confirmed, perhaps most importantly, Bill is a good \nman. Bill is a family man. He is a good dad to his two children Ann-\nBennet and Bill. He is a good husband to his wife Elizabeth. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Bill's nomination and to confirm him to serve on \nNorth Carolina's Federal bench.\n  Martin Reidinger of Asheville, NC, is also before the Senate today to \nbe confirmed as a U.S. district court judge.\n  Like Bill, Martin graduated from the University of North Carolina for \nboth his undergraduate and law degrees, graduating with honors from the \nlaw school.\n  Martin's well-established Federal practice in western North Carolina \nhas existed for a number of years. Throughout his career, he has \nhandled all types of cases, represented a wide range of clients, and \nhas appeared in all levels of State and Federal court.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Martin's family as well: his wife \nPatti, and his four children: Heather, Sara, Alex, and Max.\n  Martin's family and friends are proud of him for all of his \naccomplishments,\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nand Martin has continuously expressed how honored he is to be \nconsidered for the Federal bench. These two nominees have tremendous \nlegal experience, an unwavering commitment to their families, and are \nmen with good moral character.\n  On too many occasions, we have let judicial nominations escalate into \ncontentious debates where people's good reputations are tarnished as a \nresult of partisan politics. We have seen it throughout history, and no \none party is to blame. Unfortunately, both sides share blame. But it is \ngreat to see how this body can come together to work to make a \ndifference in the lives of Americans.\n  As policymakers, our debates certainly affect every American. We hear \nfrom thousands of our constituents every week, and when we make \ndecisions, we think about how to best balance the competing policy \npositions so we are able to make good laws.\n  But every day, judges see how these laws we are responsible for \nmaking, apply in real life. They do not have the benefit of changing \nthe law based on who appears before them. We owe it to our constituents \nto put fair-minded and qualified judges on the bench whom we are \nconfident will apply the laws this body passes in an impartial manner.\n  By confirming Bill Osteen, Jr., and Martin Reidinger to the Federal \nbench in North Carolina, I believe we are fulfilling that obligation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both of their nominations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2035 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the \nconfirmation of Judge Janis Lynn Sammartino to be a U.S. district judge \nfor the Southern District of California.\n  Judge Sammartino is nominated for a seat that has been designated a \n``judicial emergency'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nThe seat has been vacant for 3 years, ever since Judge Judith Nelson \nKeep passed away in September 2004.\n  Fortunately, the Judiciary Committee has acted quickly on this \nnomination. It was submitted to the Senate on March 19 of this year. \nJudge Sammartino completed the required questionnaire, and a hearing \nwas promptly scheduled for June 20. Now, fewer than 3 months later--\nincluding the August recess--we are voting on the nomination today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination to fill this \nlongstanding vacancy and permit the district court in the Southern \nDistrict of California to operate at full capacity.\n  Judge Sammartino is a graduate of Occidental College and of the law \nschool at the University of Notre Dame. After earning her law degree, \nshe served as a law clerk on the superior court in South Bend, IN.\n  For her entire legal career since then, she has devoted herself to \nthe service of her city, San Diego, and the State of California.\n  Judge Sammartino worked for 18 years as a deputy city attorney in San \nDiego. In her first 2 years, as a deputy in the Criminal Division, she \ntried more than 50 criminal cases in front of juries and an equal \nnumber of bench trials. She then was promoted to the Municipal Law \nSection of the Civil Division, where she developed substantial \nexpertise in land use law. She later served as the principal legal \nadvisor to the city of San Diego on redevelopment issues. In that \ncapacity, she played a major role in the planning and construction of \nthe Horton Plaza Retail Centre in downtown San Diego.\n  Judge Sammartino rose to the rank of senior chief deputy city \nattorney and was responsible for supervising three advisory divisions \nin the City Attorney's Office. She was a regular participant in legal \nand strategy decisions for pending cases. Her public service career \nthen moved from the City Attorney's Office to the courthouse. She was \nappointed to the municipal court in 1994, and to the superior court in \n1995.\n  As a testament to her skills as both a judge and a leader, her fellow \njudges elected her to be assistant presiding judge from 2004 to 2005 \nand then to be presiding judge as of January 2006. She now oversees the \nsecond largest trial court in California, which is also the third \nlargest trial court in the Nation.\n  Judge Sammartino's judicial career has given her experience in a wide \nrange of areas from criminal cases to family law cases, environmental \ncases, and complex civil cases.\n  In California we have developed a bipartisan process for selecting \nFederal district court nominees. Under this system, a committee of \nlawyers known as the Parsky Commission, which includes Democrats and \nRepublicans, recommends qualified applicants to the President. I am \nproud of this system, and proud to report that Judge Sammartino was \nrecommended unanimously by the Parsky Commission to be nominated as a \nFederal district judge. I chaired the hearing on her nomination, and I \nwas impressed with her testimony. By all accounts, she would make an \nexcellent addition to the Federal bench in San Diego.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the time has come for the \nscheduled votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If all time is yielded back--\n  Mr. SPECTER. The time is yielded back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of William Lindsay Osteen, Jr., of \nNorth Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of North Carolina?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of moments to \nhighlight the life of one of our brave fighting men who lost his life \nin Afghanistan. His name is Jan Argonish. He was a sergeant in the Army \nNational Guard.\n  On the last business day before our August recess was over, I was in \na line in Peckville, PA, at his viewing where all of his family and his \nfriends paid him last respects and prayed for him. Just to give a sense \nof the scene, the context of this scene, this was a viewing line that \nlasted hours and hours. I was in the line from about 6 o'clock to 8:30. \nSo for all the reasons we celebrate the service and the sacrifice of \nour brave troops, I wish to highlight the life of SGT Jan Argonish, who \npassed away at the age of 26 when he was killed in action in an ambush \nin Kunar Province in Afghanistan.\n  Jan Argonish was a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, with nearly 10 \nyears of service in the Pennsylvania National Guard. He volunteered to \nhelp train soldiers of the Afghan National Army. For SGT Jan Argonish, \nthis was his third deployment since September 11, 2001.\n  He was born in Peckville, PA, and was a resident most recently in \nScranton, my hometown. He was a 1999 graduate of Valley View High \nSchool, where he played football and was on the swim team. He went on \nfrom high school to enlist in the Army. He was a graduate of the Army's \ninfantry and mortar schools and tanker school at Fort Knox, KY.\n  He received numerous awards for his brave service--the Bronze Star, \nthe Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, and on and on, \naward after award. He was a member of the Sacred Heart Church in \nPeckville, PA, and VFW Post 5544 in Jessup, PA. Since February 2006, he \nwas employed as a corrections officer at the U.S. Penitentiary Canaan \nin Waymart, PA.\n  Sergeant Argonish leaves behind a family. One member of his family I \nwill never forget, his 8-year-old son Jakub, who was in the viewing \nline to greet hundreds and hundreds of people. He was wearing a State \ntrooper's hat which was, obviously, too large for an 8-year-old. But in \nso many ways, that image of that young boy, Jakub, is an image I will \nnever forget, and in so many ways it is symbolic of and a metaphor of \nwhat so many families have lost when they have lost a loved one in \nIraq, Afghanistan, or fighting around the world. Even someone who is \nold enough to understand it better than 8-year-old Jakub did--so many \nfamilies are not ready for the horror and the trauma of that loss.\n  So I am thinking of SGT Jan Argonish today. I am thinking of his \nservice. We are remembering and praying for his family and, of course, \nall those who are doing the brave work our troops are doing in \nAfghanistan and, of course, in Iraq during this very profound week we \nare about to enter into, the week where we think about the victims of \n9/11 and we think about our troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Barrasso, is recognized to speak in morning business for \nup to 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11289-6", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11289-S11292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WYOMING AND MY VISION FOR THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to address this body and \nour Nation in my first official speech as Wyoming's newest Senator. \nToday I share with you how I got here, who I am, what I believe, my \nvision for the future, and what I hope to accomplish.\n  All of us in this body and everyone in the State of Wyoming lost a \ngreat friend when we lost Senator Craig Thomas. I have heard it in this \nChamber on both sides of the aisle and throughout this building, and I \nhave heard it all around Wyoming: We have lost a great friend. Susan \nThomas and the memory of Craig Thomas have been recognized all across \nWyoming this summer at rodeos, county fairs, the State fair, parades, \nand at special events. The new visitors center at the Grand Teton \nNational Park has appropriately been named in his honor.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n  Craig was a forceful and courageous voice for his constituents. He \nalways did what he saw as right for Wyoming and right for America. He \nwas a cowboy and a marine. The Marines say ``Semper fidelis.'' Craig \nThomas was always faithful. God, country, and Wyoming--that was Craig \nThomas. He has left huge boots to fill. No one can truly do it. I am \nvery honored to be the person to succeed Senator Thomas. I am humbled \nto be given the opportunity and the responsibility to represent the \npeople of Wyoming in the U.S. Senate.\n  Wyoming is the Equality State. It is a State of high altitude and low \nmultitude and a State of great natural beauty blessed with remarkable \nmineral resources.\n\n  The law in Wyoming says a Senate vacancy must be filled by the \nGovernor from a list of three names. The three names are supplied by \nthe central committee of the political party where the vacancy \noccurred.\n  Thirty-one Republicans in Wyoming applied for this Senate seat. The \nnumber was then reduced to 10, and then 5, and then 3 by a series of \nspeeches and forums. The Governor then made his selection from the \nthree finalists. I am very grateful to Gov. Dave Freudenthal for the \nconfidence he and the people of Wyoming have placed in me.\n  During the selection process, I made a simple pledge to the people of \nWyoming: I told them they could count on me to show up, to stand up, to \nspeak up, and then to shut up. I would show up early for work and be \nhere for votes. I would show up at home in Wyoming on weekends to \nlisten to people and to host a town meeting in every county by Labor \nDay and to show up when people from Wyoming visit the Capitol. As Craig \nThomas did, I will only work in Washington but continue to live in \nWyoming.\n  I will stand up--stand up for Wyoming people and Wyoming values, \nstand up against big government and Washington's one-size-fits-all \napproach, stand up against those who try to take away the rights of \nWyoming people. And I will speak up--speak up for limited government, \nlower taxes, and fewer regulations, speak up for a strong defense and \nsecure borders, and speak up to make Wyoming values the values for all \nof America. And then I will shut up. That is because words are no \nsubstitute for action, and the most important thing a Senator can do is \nlisten to Wyoming people, their hopes, their dreams, their concerns for \nthemselves, their children, their families, their communities, and for \nall of Wyoming, and because the best things about Wyoming and America \ndon't need long speeches but are expressed in single words: freedom, \njustice, honor, duty, compassion, hope, opportunity, life, and liberty.\n  I have kept my pledge to visit every county in Wyoming before Labor \nDay and listen to people. I have held 30 town meetings and heard from \nthousands of people. Many brought their children. I have heard about \ntheir hopes for their families, their communities, Wyoming, and our \nNation. And I have heard about their dreams for our future.\n  Parents in Wyoming want what all parents want for their children: the \nopportunity for a better life. It is what all of our parents wanted for \nus.\n  My dad had to quit school in ninth grade because of the Depression. \nHe fought in World War II. He was in the Battle of the Bulge. As a \ncement finisher, he did backbreaking work to put food on the table for \nthe family. That is where I really learned about hard work, by pushing \nwheelbarrows of heavy, wet cement every summer in high school and \ncollege.\n  Every day growing up, my dad would say: You should thank God every \nday you live in America. You don't know how fortunate you are. It is \nthe same lesson I try to pass on to my children Peter and Emma, because \nin America, through hard work, even the son of a cement finisher can \nhave the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n  My dad would have been 90 when I was sworn in. We lost him 2 years \nago. I had his dog tags from World War II in my pocket when I took the \noath of office.\n  Now, my mom's lesson was different. Since the day I started \nkindergarten, my mom would always say: This year, this one right now, \nis the most important year of your life. What she was saying is that \nwhatever you are doing, focus on it, do it right because the future \ndepends on what you are doing today. In the Senate, I want to spend \nthis next year, this most important year, working for a better future \nfor our families--the families of Wyoming and the families of America.\n  In Wyoming, many people refer to me as Wyoming's doctor. For over two \ndecades, folks have invited me into their homes with statewide \ntelevision and radio health reports. I give people information on how \nto stay healthy and how to keep down the cost of their medical care. I \nend each report by saying: ``Here in Wyoming, I am Dr. John Barrasso, \nhelping you care for yourself.'' That is also my philosophy for \nGovernment--helping people help themselves.\n\n  I believe there is a role for Government, but that role must be \nlimited. Government should not do for people what they can and should \ndo for themselves. Nor should Government put obstacles in the way of \npeople pursuing their American dream. Limited Government means limited \nin size, limited in scope, and limited in spending--limited but \neffective. That means a government that gives us value for our tax \ndollars.\n  Speaking of values, to me that means families, schools, communities, \nand charities. I believe, as Ronald Reagan believed, we should rely \nmore on ourselves and less on our Government. That is why I will \nchampion legislation to cut wasteful spending and to make sure \ntaxpayers get value for their money.\n  Now, some may wonder why and how an orthopedic surgeon became \ninterested in serving his community in elective office. As a high \nschool senior, I attended a program right here on Capitol Hill. The \nprogram is called A Presidential Classroom for Young Americans. It is \nthe Nation's premier program in civic education. Both of my children \nhave attended. This past year, 50 Wyoming students attended on \nscholarships. I would enthusiastically recommend A Presidential \nClassroom for Young Americans to any high school student.\n  I have been privileged to serve in the Wyoming State legislature. It \nis a true citizen's legislature. Through the years, it has been a great \ntraining ground for the folks Wyoming sends to Washington. During my \ntwo terms in the Wyoming State Senate, I built a reputation for getting \nthe job done by working with members of both parties. That includes \nbeing a strong advocate for our veterans and members of the National \nGuard, working to keep our roads safer for young drivers, and reducing \nthe tax burden on all the people of Wyoming by eliminating the sales \ntax from groceries.\n  I was one of the original sponsors of the Hathaway scholarship \nprogram. The Hathaway scholarship is designed to give opportunity for \nall Wyoming high school students to further their education at the \nUniversity of Wyoming or one of our community colleges. It is a way we \nused our State's mineral wealth to invest in our people and in our \nfuture. The original bill was introduced by four State senators, two \nRepublicans and two Democrats. Members of the senate and members of the \nhouse improved the bill considerably. The bill was signed by Governor \nFreudenthal, a Democrat, and named for former Governor Hathaway, a \nRepublican. It is a great example of members of both parties working \ntogether to improve the quality of life for our citizens.\n  Now, as a Senator, I will continue to work with all people, \nregardless of party, on issues that are important to the people of \nWyoming. As one of only two physicians in the Senate, people are \nalready coming to me to ask about health issues. Well, health issues go \nway beyond a twisted knee or a painful shoulder. The concerns include \nthose of people living longer and needing care; the concerns of access \nto care, of affordable care; the concerns of substance abuse and mental \nhealth; and the concerns of what to do with a sick child or elderly \nparents when the caregivers are not available because they are working \nfull time, and sometimes more. This country deserves a serious \ndiscussion on our health care needs and our health care system. I will \nbe actively engaged in that discussion, along with my Wyoming Senate \npartner, Mike Enzi.\n  Craig Thomas knew that rural States such as Wyoming have special \nneeds\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nwhen it comes to health care. He was cochair of the Rural Health Caucus \nfor over 10 years. There are obstacles that our hospitals and providers \nmust overcome to deliver quality care to families in an environment \nwith limited resources. The week he passed away, Senator Thomas was set \nto reintroduce a followup health care bill, along with Senators \nRoberts, Conrad, and Harkin. This bill has been renamed the Craig \nThomas Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act. I will ask to cosponsor \nthe legislation and to join the Rural Health Caucus.\n  While health care is near and dear to my heart, I am very pleased to \nbe serving on three committees that are critical to Wyoming. So much of \nWyoming's heritage and Wyoming's future is tied to our land, our \npeople, and our natural resources. Wyoming has been represented on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for over a century. I am \ngrateful that my Republican colleagues recognized that long tradition \nand allowed me to keep Wyoming's voice on the committee.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee also has a major influence \non daily activities in the Equality State, and the Select Committee on \nIndian Affairs will allow me to continue to serve the needs of our \nNative American citizens, as I have done before as a trauma surgeon.\n  Energy, Public Lands, and the National Parks are all vital to our \nState's economy and our Nation's. I will work to make sure that public \nlands remain open to multiple use, while at the same time ensuring our \nenvironment is protected.\n  As an outdoorsman and a conservationist, Craig Thomas worked on two \nbills affecting the western part of Wyoming that were very close to his \nheart. While he is not here to carry on the work, the work needs to \ncontinue as part of his legacy. One is called the Snake River \nHeadwaters Legacy Act of 2007. The bill, S. 1281, designates sections \nof the Snake River and several tributaries as ``wild and scenic.'' This \nwill create a lasting legacy for Wyoming people and for future \ngenerations. The designation of wild and scenic announces to the world \nthat this river is the best of the best.\n  The legislation he was working on also ensures that access, multiple \nuse, and private property rights are not restricted. As a tribute to \nSenator Thomas, and in recognition of his years of leadership in the \nSenate, and specifically the Energy Committee, I will ask that my name \nbe attached to S. 1281. I will work hard for passage of the bill that \nachieves Senator Thomas's vision, while balancing the concerns shared \nwith me during August by private landowners and the agriculture \ncommunity in Wyoming.\n  The second bill affecting the western part of Wyoming deals with a \nvery special area named the Wyoming range. The Wyoming range is part of \nthe Bridger-Teton National Forest. As a strong supporter of multiple \nuse, Senator Thomas still believed there are areas of our State that \nare so sensitive that they must be protected from development. In \n2005, Senator Thomas said:\n\n       We ought to seek a balance of energy development and \n     conservation. We can have both. Wyoming's economy is thriving \n     because of the positive role of energy in our State. And most \n     folks live in Wyoming because of our outstanding natural \n     resources and quality of life.\n\n  A bill to protect the Wyoming range was in the final stages of \ndevelopment when Senator Thomas died. I had talked with him about it. I \nhave his draft bills. I have visited the Wyoming range and listened to \nthose whom the legislation affects. I am completing that work and will \nsoon be introducing a bill in the Senate to protect the undeveloped \nareas of the Wyoming range from any future oil and gas leasing. My \nlegislation is intended to achieve that goal while respecting private \nproperty rights that currently exist in the Wyoming range.\n  When I think of the history of our great State, I am reminded of one \nrugged individualist who loved Wyoming--Teddy Roosevelt. We take our \nkids to Mt. Rushmore to see his face chiseled into the mountain, along \nwith Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson. He gave a speech at the \nUniversity of Wyoming about 100 years ago. There were 10,000 people in \nthe crowd. Now, back then, that was a huge number for a sparsely \npopulated State. He said:\n\n       People of Wyoming, I believe in you and in your future. The \n     government can only supplement the work of the individual. \n     The work of the individual depends on the character of the \n     individual.\n\n  Here we are, 100 years later, and the lesson is still the same: The \nGovernment can only supplement the work of the individual. It is the \nsame message Ronald Reagan delivered in Cheyenne, WY, 25 years ago. He \ntalked of why he loved the frontier spirit of the West. He said:\n\n       Wyoming is a place where people are still sure that the \n     future is ours to shape.\n\n  Still sure that the future is ours to shape. In Wyoming, we do \nbelieve the future is ours to shape. To shape the future, you need to \nhave a vision for the future. I can see a specific future for Wyoming \nthat helps all Americans. Imagine a future where America breaks its \ndependence on foreign energy. Imagine a future of affordable domestic \nsources of energy. Imagine a future where we solve the issue of carbon \nemission. And imagine a future where we can accomplish all of this \nwhile we protect the environment. That is the future I see for America, \nand that is the future I see for Wyoming.\n  Wyoming is blessed with incredible resources--coal, natural gas, oil, \nand alternative sources of energy, with wind leading the list. The \nUniversity of Wyoming's School of Energy Resources is prepared to \nbecome the leading energy research institute in the world, converting \ncoal to liquid, converting coal to gas, pumping carbon dioxide back \ninto the earth to enhance our ability to get more oil.\n  The world's most powerful computer is being assembled in Wyoming to \nhelp make this possible. We can and we will do it while preserving the \nnatural beauty and the wildlife of our State. That is the future I see \nfor Wyoming.\n  As a Senator from Wyoming, I am always asking myself: What can I do \ntoday for Wyoming's future? I will tell you what I heard at 30 town \nmeetings since I have been sworn in. What I heard is: Fight for \nWyoming, fight every day, fight for our future, fight for quality \neducation for our children, fight for quality jobs for our families, \nfight for health care, and fight for our core values--the values that \ncome from within us, from our families, our communities, and how we \nwere raised. That is what I plan to do every day because, like my mom's \nlesson, this is our most important year.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by thanking the Members of the Senate who \nhave all been so gracious in making me feel so welcome. I also want to \ntell you I feel very blessed. I am blessed with a wonderful team of \nWyoming folks with whom I serve--Vice President Cheney, Senator Enzi, \nand Representative Cubin. I am blessed with a wonderful staff, who \nserved with Senator Thomas. And I am blessed with a wonderful family--\nmy children Peter and Emma--and the love of my life, Bobbi Brown, and \nher daughter Hadley.\n  Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor. She is a remarkable person. At \nlast month's Race for the Cure in Wyoming, we announced our engagement. \nI joked with the crowd that I believed if I ever made anything out of \nmyself I would ask Bobbi to marry me. The newspaper headline told the \nstory: ``Barrasso proposes--Brown says yes.'' And I am very grateful.\n  There is a passage in the Bible, a letter from Paul to Timothy, which \nsays:\n\n       In the end, he fought the good fight, he finished the race, \n     he kept the faith.\n\n  As I enter the Senate, it is my goal to fight the good fight, to \nfinish the race, and to keep the faith--faith in God, faith in my \nfamily, faith in Wyoming, and faith in America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am hard pressed to remember a time \nwhen I complimented a Democratic Governor for a great appointment, but \nI think I will have to say once again that the Governor of Wyoming made \nan outstanding selection in picking our new friend John Barrasso to \nreplace our late and beloved colleague Craig Thomas.\n  I have heard a few maiden speeches. Actually, some people on the \nfloor right now have made their initial Senate speeches in the last few \nyears, but I believe we just heard one of the best.\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\nSo I want to add, on behalf of all the Republican conference, our \ncongratulations to Senator Barrasso on an outstanding opening address.\n  He pointed out that one of his specialties, which is greatly needed \naround here, is the fact he is a physician. That is extremely \nimportant. So your skill set, in addition to your leadership abilities, \nis certainly welcomed here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate our colleague from Wyoming on a great \nmaiden speech and welcome him once again to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, congratulate my colleague on his \nofficial first speech, so I will officially give my first welcome. He \nand I and the people of Wyoming know this is not his first speech, and \ndefinitely not his first effort. He has been helping people in Wyoming. \nHe gave up a great orthopedic practice that he founded, which is a \ndisappointment to a lot of people in Wyoming who were actually still \nhoping they would have an operation from him. But because of the \nquickness of the appointment, he was back here, ready to work, and at \nwork. He has done a phenomenal job since he has been here.\n  I am glad to have the help explaining Wyoming, as he did so aptly in \nthis speech. There is a lot of work to be done here, teaching the East \nabout the West so they understand better that one size fits all does \nnot work.\n  I have been across Wyoming and talking with my colleagues here \nexplaining what a hard worker and a fast learner the new Senator is. He \nhas certainly proven that on his own. He did mention the 30 town \nmeetings he held prior to September 1. That leaves out a lot. Besides \n30 town meetings, he had meetings with officials, he had meetings with \nspecial groups, he went to a lot of events. He was even in a bocce ball \ntournament in Cheyenne, where he narrowly lost to the reporter who \nwrote a wonderful three-page article after that.\n  When we talk about 30 town meetings in Wyoming, we are talking about \none of the bigger States in the United States. We are a small \npopulation, but we are a big State. To get to those people you have to \ntravel a lot of miles and talk to a lot of small groups. He does that \nwillingly. He shows up at everything. I am pretty sure, by my count, he \nwas in Jackson six times during August. Jackson is on the far side of \nthe State where the Grand Tetons are. We hope everybody in America \nvisits there and visits there frequently. It is just on the south of \nthe Yellowstone, which is even a little better known, but it is on the \nfar side of the State. It is very difficult to get to from anywhere in \nWyoming. It is pretty easy to get to from Houston or Atlanta or \nMinneapolis, but it is very difficult to get to from Wyoming. He was \nthere six times. That means traveling probably 250 miles a trip, each \nway, to get there, and then to get back on schedule, meeting with the \nconstituents with whom he promised to meet. That is the kind of \ndedication he has. He did a marvelous job of answering questions, \ngathering information. He is a good listener, but he is also a good \ndoer.\n  He served in the State senate. That has been a training ground for \npeople who have served here for years. That legislative experience \nmakes a difference in how fast you can adjust to the way things operate \nhere compared to the way things operate in the State legislature--\ncompared to not knowing about either one of them. He had some marvelous \nachievements while he was in the State. He has mentioned some things he \nwants to get done here. Watch out for him. He will get those done. Help \nhim out. They are worth doing.\n  He is a tremendous asset to the Senate, and I am very proud to \nwelcome him as my colleague and part of the delegation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11292-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11292-S11297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3074, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3074) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2008, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill as amended \nbe considered as original text for the purpose of further amendments, \nand that no points of order be waived for purposes of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The substitute amendment (No. 2790) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now \ndebating the Senate amendment to H.R. 3074. This is the Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for this coming \nfiscal year. This bill has been supported by the broadest possible \nbipartisan majorities. The Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Appropriations subcommittee has 21 members, more than one-\nfifth of the Senate. It is one of the largest subcommittees in the \nSenate. Despite the diversity of views on our very large subcommittee, \nback on July 10 we voted unanimously to report the bill to the full \nAppropriations Committee, and 2 days later, each and every one of the \n29 members of that committee voted to report this bill to the Senate.\n  This bill has broad, bipartisan support because it addresses \npragmatically the very real housing and transportation needs of \nAmerican families across all regions of the Nation. Rather than endorse \nthe many arbitrary and destructive cuts called for in the \nadministration's budget, we worked in this bill to target our limited \nresources on getting citizens out of traffic jams and home to their \nfamilies; keeping our low-income tenants in their homes and out of \nshelters; providing housing for the elderly and the disabled; investing \nin crumbling infrastructure, and improving safety on our runways, \nhighways, and railways.\n  Much has been said recently about a looming battle between the White \nHouse and Congress over spending priorities and the funding levels in \nthese appropriations bills. There is no question that the bill before \nus spends more than the level sought by the Bush administration, both \nfor transportation and for housing. Yet this bill still has broad \nbipartisan support, and I believe the Senate would benefit greatly from \na detailed explanation as to why that is the case.\n\n  More than any other reason, this bill spends more than the \nadministration's budget because it rejects many of the most punitive \nand misguided cuts that were proposed by the White House. The \nPresident's budget that he sent us for fiscal year 2008 proposed cuts \nacross the board. Those included cuts that would put low-income tenants \nand their children on the streets. It proposed cuts that would \nundermine transportation safety, especially when it comes to aviation \nand railway safety; cuts that would worsen congestion on our Nation's \nroadways and runways; and cuts that undermine the community development \nefforts of mayors and county executives and Governors across this \ncountry.\n  So this bill spends more than the President's budget, not because it \nincludes vast new spending initiatives but because it simply refuses to \nacquiesce to the President's reckless cuts. These are the very same \ncuts that have been proposed in recent years by the Bush administration \nand rightly rejected by the then-Republican-led Congress. That is why \nevery member of the Appropriations Committee voted to support this \nbill.\n  In addition to restoring funding to the cuts that were proposed in \nthe President's budget, there are a limited number of selected funding \nincreases in\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nthis bill. Those increases are targeted on efforts to maintain the \ncurrent service levels for the HUD section 8 program, so tenants do not \nlose their homes. It continues to make investments in highway \ninfrastructure so we can address our crumbling bridges and highways. It \naddresses the critical housing needs of homeless veterans, including \nveterans who are struggling after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAnd it addresses the current crisis in the mortgage market by boosting \nfunding to counsel subprime borrowers who are today facing default and \nforeclosure.\n  As appropriators, we have an obligation to ensure that with our \nlimited resources we are addressing the most critical and current needs \nwe face in transportation and in housing. I believe we can all agree \nthe needs of our returning veterans, especially those in need of \nhousing while they struggle with physical or mental illness, have to be \nparamount. I believe we can all agree that with billions of dollars of \nmortgages about to reset to higher interest rates in the next few \nquarters, we have to do everything we can to help our borrowers keep \ntheir homes.\n  I have been greatly fortunate to be joined by my ranking member, \nSenator Bond, in crafting this package. Senator Bond's long service on \nthe Appropriations Committee, as well as his work on the Public Works \nand Banking Committees, has made him one of our leading experts in the \nareas of both transportation and housing. Senator Bond's leadership and \nhis commitment to the mission of HUD takes a back seat to no one. I \ncould not have a better or more experienced partner in this effort.\n  The bill that Senator Bond and I put together contains \ncongressionally directed earmark spending. Consistent with the \ninstructions of Senator Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran, those earmarks \nhave been substantially reduced from prior years.\n  For the first time in a great many years, the committee has reported \na bill that will leave dollars available to initiate national \ncompetitions among all eligible applicants for discretionary \ntransportation programs. For the first time in several years, this bill \nrequires every earmarked project to be fully eligible under the basic \nauthorizing statute for the pertinent program in which it is earmarked.\n  Those projects must also conform to other strict criteria newly \nimposed by our subcommittee this year.\n  Now, as I said earlier, this bill spends more money than the \nPresident's request, principally because it rejects a great many of the \ncuts that were proposed in the President's budget cut, that by the way \nhave been rejected year by year by Republican Congresses.\n  I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time today to discuss \nthose cuts in greater detail. The President proposed to cut community \ndevelopment efforts in all our States and communities across the Nation \nby slashing the CDBG Program by $735 million or 20 percent.\n  Now, at a time when our changing economy is imposing unprecedented \nchallenges to our mayors and our governors in preserving their \nstruggling cities and towns, the President wanted to slash this effort \nby almost three-quarters of a billion dollars.\n  I have yet, personally, to meet a mayor or governor of any political \nparty who endorses that approach. So our bill restores every penny of \nthat cut. The President's budget also proposed to cut housing funding \nfor the disabled by $112 million, almost 50 percent. At a time when our \nsocial service networks are trying to give our disabled citizens the \nchance to live independently, the Bush administration wants to slash \nthat program in half.\n  Now, if that is not bad enough, at a time when the number of senior \ncitizens is growing, the President's budget for HUD seeks to cut \nhousing for low-income seniors by $160 million or 22 percent. So the \nbill before you restores every penny of those cuts.\n  The bill also rejects the President's proposal to completely \neliminate funding for the very successful HOPE VI Program. Senators \nBond and Mikulski deserve a great deal of credit for the success of \nthat program. We have again restored funding for it so we can demolish \nsome of the most decrepit and crime-ridden housing projects with new \nmixed-income developments that are cleaner, safer, and promote stable \ncommunity living.\n  The bill before us rejects several punitive cuts proposed for the \nDepartment of Transportation. The President's budget proposed to slash \nfunding for Amtrak by almost $500 million or 40 percent in a single \nyear. This subcommittee heard testimony back in late February that a \ncut of that size would cripple the railroad and push it into certain \nbankruptcy. That was not just the view of Amtrak supporters, that was \nthe view of the DOT inspector general who audits Amtrak's books every \nquarter.\n  The bill before us also rejects the President's proposal to cut \nsubsidies for the Essential Air Service Program, which would eliminate \nall flights to dozens of rural and midsized communities in about every \nState.\n  At a time when our commercial airlines are terminating air service to \nsmall- and medium-sized cities, the President's budgets worsens the \nsituation by slashing subsidies to keep some of those cities on the \nnational aviation map.\n  As anyone who has taken a flight recently can attest, the number of \nair travelers has now well exceeded the levels we experienced prior to \nSeptember 11. Flights are packed and are too often delayed. Planes are \nlanding to find there are no gates to accommodate them. Consumer \ncomplaints are growing. Our air traffic control infrastructure is \nincreasingly showing its age, with equipment outages and near misses \noccurring with frightening frequency.\n  Yet, as in past years, the President's budget for the FAA proposes to \nslash over $800 million from our programs that invest in airport \ncapacity, safety projects, and modernizing the air traffic control \nsystem.\n  Maybe if the President flew commercial instead of on Air Force One we \nwould see a much different budget here. But thankfully, as was the case \nin past years, our bill that is before us today rejects those proposed \ncuts.\n  Finally, as I mentioned before, the bill before us includes some \nselect but critically needed funding increases. The President's budget \nproposed an absolute freeze on the amount of money available for tenant \nhousing vouchers for the coming years, completely ignoring inflationary \ncosts and rising rents. This bill provides a $500 million increase for \ntenant-based rental assistance. That is the amount we estimate will be \nneeded to ensure that all currently federally assisted tenants can stay \nin their homes.\n  Senator Bond and I joined forces to add $78 million for the HUD-VASH \nProgram. That program was designed to target both housing assistance \nand support services to our homeless veterans, including our veterans \nwho are returning today from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have coordinated this increase in voucher funding with a \ncomparable increase in supportive services funding in the \nappropriations bill for the VA and military construction. This is a \nprogram that has not received funding for several years. I am very \nproud to say that our new initiatives will provide critically needed \nfunding to support at least 7,500 homeless veterans.\n  This bill has also included small and selected increases to address \ncritical and worsening problems with transportation safety. Small \nincreases above the President's budget are provided to hire more air \nsafety inspectors. At present, these inspectors cannot inspect all the \nmaintenance facilities they are responsible for, and we are especially \nconcerned about these facilities that are overseas.\n  We have also provided small increases for rail safety, highway \nsafety, and pipeline safety. Our subcommittee, in fact, had a special \nhearing on the rising level of highway fatalities. We have worked to \nrespond to some of the needs that were cited during that hearing.\n  We have also provided increased funding to enable the Department of \nTransportation to investigate the growing backlog of customer service \ncomplaints by airline passengers.\n  In summary, this bill rejects reckless and misguided cuts that \nRepublican-led Congresses have also rejected before, cuts that would \nharm our infrastructure, our communities, and our citizens. It also \ncontains modest targeted increases on programs that are tackling \nemerging and growing problems, programs that will help our veterans,\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\nour safety and our efforts to keep our families in their homes.\n  In doing all this critical work, this bill does spend more than the \nPresident's request. But in that sense, it is no different from the \ntransportation and housing appropriations bills that were passed by the \nHouse and Senate when my Republican colleagues across the aisle chaired \nour committees.\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support because it takes a practical \napproach in addressing real needs we found in the transportation and \nhousing sector. I urge all our Senators to support this bill and move \nus rapidly to final passage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before I turn to my colleague for his \nopening remarks, I would offer an amendment to the bill to clarify the \nauthority of the Secretary of Transportation to collect damages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2791.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike a provision of the bill and insert authority for \n                    the Secretary of Transportation)\n\n       On page 129, strike section 218 and insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 218. The Secretary of Transportation may receive and \n     expend cash, or receive and utilize spare parts and similar \n     items, from non-United States Government sources to repair \n     damages to or replace United States Government owned \n     automated track inspection cars as a result of third party \n     liability for such damages.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2792 to Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment to my \namendment on behalf of Senator Landrieu and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself and \n     Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 2792 to \n     amendment No. 2791.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To expand the extension of authority of the Secretary of \n  Transportation and provide additional obligation authority for the \n                        highway bridge program)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 218(a). The Secretary of Transportation may receive \n     and expend cash, or receive and utilize spare parts and \n     similar items, from non-United States Government sources to \n     repair damages to or replace United States Government owned \n     automated track inspection cars and equipment as a result of \n     third party liability for such damages, and any amounts \n     collected under this subsection shall be credited directly to \n     the Safety and Operations account of the Federal Railroad \n     Administration, and shall remain available until expended for \n     the repair, operation and maintenance of automated track \n     inspection cars and equipment in connection with the \n     automated track inspection program.\n\n\n                    Additional Obligation Limitation\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n       (b) For an additional amount of obligation limitation to be \n     distributed for the purpose of section 144(e) of title 23, \n     United States Code, $1,000,000,000; Provided, That such \n     obligation limitation shall be used only for a purpose \n     eligible for obligation with funds apportioned under such \n     section and shall be distributed in accordance with the \n     formula in such section; Provided further, That in \n     distributing obligation authority under this paragraph, the \n     Secretary shall ensure that such obligation limitation shall \n     supplement and not supplant each State's planned obligations \n     for such purposes.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment that I sent \nto the desk further expands the Secretary's collection authority and \nprovides additional funding for the bridge rehabilitation program. I am \ngoing to be discussing this amendment in detail later this afternoon \nafter Senator Bond has completed his opening statement.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Bond, for his work and \nhis staff's work on this very complex and very important bill. Again, I \nurge all our colleagues to bring their amendments to the floor. As \neveryone knows, we are in a very short timeframe this week because of \nthe Jewish holidays. We are going to be working late in getting our \namendments done. We encourage everyone to get to the floor. I thank my \ncolleague for his work on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my sincere thanks to Senator Murray for \nbeing such a good partner on this bill. It is a very challenging bill, \nparticularly under the constraints in which we are supposed to work. It \nis always a difficult bill and many complex and controversial issues.\n  I begin by echoing her comments; we know there will be amendments. We \nurge our colleagues to come down as soon as possible and offer those \namendments so we can deal with them. We have a hard deadline of \nWednesday noon. I hope we can get the issues resolved before then. But \nthat is a deadline which the Senate schedule imposes on us. We do want \nto get it completed.\n  Senator Murray deserves a great deal of credit for balancing the \ntough issues that are included in this bill; she referred to them. \nThese are important programs that help build our communities and \nwithout which a lot of persons would been placed at the risk of \nhomelessness.\n  This would have been particularly harsh on seniors and persons with \ndisabilities. I also especially am grateful for the programs Senator \nMurray described that we were able to include $75 million in Section 8 \nfunds for the VA Supportive Housing Program.\n  I think it is a critical program that calls attention to some of the \nmany needs that face our returning service people. There are far too \nmany returning service men and women who come back and are without \nhousing. This is a start on dealing with this serious problem that I \nknow the VA and HUD are familiar with.\n  We want to give them the authorization and the direction to move \nforward on it. I think the worth of this program will become even more \nevident as young disabled service men and women try to make the \ndifficult adjustments to civilian life.\n  Now, the next item that is going to be discussed is the Minnesota \nbridge collapse. This was surely a catastrophic event. Our hearts go \nout to all of those families who lost loved ones in that horrific \ntragedy. In response to the bridge collapse, Congress immediately \nauthorized $250 million in emergency relief spending to rebuild this \nvital infrastructure in Minnesota.\n  I think a welcomed awareness has arisen from this event, brought a \nhigher degree of understanding and appreciation that new methods for \ninspecting and rating our bridges are necessary. People are even \ntalking about infrastructure and the need for infrastructure.\n  Well, that is what we have been talking about in this committee and \non this floor for many years. We are delighted to have our long-time \nsupporters and some new friends agreeing with us on it.\n  Now, as far as this bridge collapse, we are anxiously awaiting \nfurther information from the National Transportation Safety Board on \nwhat the root cause of this tragic accident was and how we can further \nimprove our Federal oversight of critical infrastructure. There are a \nnumber of items which have been raised which may point out specific \ncauses for this collapse and which will be a warning to other States \nand other localities as well of steps they must take and things they \nmust do to avoid bridge collapses.\n  But I understand why my colleague, Senator Murray, has offered the \namendment that would add $1 billion in obligation limits for bridges in \nreaction to this tragic event. I share that concern. But I do have a \nfeeling we should not overreact to the Minnesota bridge collapse by \nspending more money out of the highway trust fund than is available \nuntil we have time to work on a comprehensive reauthorization of the \nunderlying legislation, SAFETEA.\n  Part of this process must be a comprehensive review of our Nation's \ninfrastructure problems, including how best to prioritize and fund \nthose needs. Obviously, we are going to be looking at bridge safety as \nwell as the other aspects of transportation safety.\n  I know in my home State of Missouri, and I assume in every State\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\ntransportation department across the country, this event brought \nrenewed attention to bridge inspection. In my State, the department of \ntransportation is embarking on a major program to rehabilitate 800 \nbridges that are of varying levels of deficiency. But while we need to \navoid and prevent a future repeat of the Minnesota tragedy, we also \nmust minimize the risk of death or injury posed by the broad spectrum \nof our aging infrastructure.\n  This measure would cause serious problems with the declining balance \nin the highway trust fund and leave us with an additional $1 billion \ngreater shortfall for highway trust fund funding in the 2009 \nappropriations cycle. Everybody in this building, all my colleagues \nknow or should know that we have significant problems in the highway \ntrust fund because we have seen the impact of higher gas prices on fuel \nconsumption. People are driving less. Economics does work. But when \nthey drive less and use less gasoline, use more efficient conservation \nmeasures, which is all to the good, it results in less money coming \ninto the highway trust fund than had been anticipated and lessens the \namount of revenue we have available to use on bringing our highway and \nbridge infrastructure up to the needs of the 21st century. We are not \nthere yet.\n  Chairman Murray and I held a hearing in April on the question of \nrising highway fatalities. We agree--and everybody would agree--we \ncannot ignore the fact that 43,443 Americans were killed on the \nhighways last year and some 2.7 million more were injured. From my \nState, our highway transportation department estimates that one out of \nthree of these people is killed by reason of inadequate infrastructure. \nIn our State, the major problem is too many two-lane roads carrying \ntraffic which should properly be on four-lane roads. I suspect other \nStates are fighting that problem.\n  The vast majority of highway fatalities are not on the Nation's \nbridges but, rather, on the highways. The best estimate we have from \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation is that approximately 2,200 out \nof the 43,000 deaths occurred on bridges. This leads me to suggest that \nwe cannot overreact to such a horrible and tragic event such as that in \nMinnesota by micromanaging our Federal aid dollars solely to bridges, \nunless that is where a State, through its unique local vantage point \nand knowledge of its situation, wants to focus its efforts in Federal \napportionment.\n  So this is something we will be discussing further. We are both \nconcerned about safety on highways and bridges. We look forward to \nworking with our colleagues to see how this can be resolved.\n  With respect to the Federal Aviation Administration, I again thank \nSenator Murray and her staff for their close cooperation in working \nthrough these issues. The chronic delays experienced by numerous \ntravelers this year and specifically this summer have not gone \nunnoticed by the committee. As ranking member, having spent a wonderful \n2\\1/2\\ hours sitting on an airport runway after we landed, I have a \npersonal interest in dealing with this. The bill continues to support \nthe beginning stage of the NextGen Air Transportation System, which we \nbelieve is a much needed step toward providing additional capacity and \nrelieving many of the delays at our Nation's airports. The bill also \ncontains funds above the administration's request for flight inspection \nand certification personnel. Almost all of us use airplanes frequently, \nand we understand the need the flying public has for greater assurance \nof safety. We think these funds will ensure continued safety for the \nNational Airspace System.\n  I also note additional funds for the Airport Improvement Program. \nThat remains an important bipartisan priority for this subcommittee. I \ncan't tell my colleagues how many small airport operators and community \nleaders in those cities and towns around my State have expressed their \nstrong support for the program.\n  There are some issues we will have to address as the bill moves \nforward. For example, we include revenue aligned budget authority, that \nwhich we call RABA. When Members hear the term ``RABA,'' it is not the \nname of a dog or somebody's pet name; it is ``revenue aligned budget \nauthority.'' This was not included in the President's budget.\n  The bill also contains a $2.89 billion rescission of highway contract \nauthority apportionments to the States used as a budgetary offset to \nmeet the other pressing needs my colleague already described. The bill \nincludes an additional $43.359 million in administrative contract \nauthority and another $172 million in the unused transportation \ninnovative financing infrastructure account--the TIFIA--contract \nauthority, for a total offset of spending of $3.495 billion. In the HUD \nsection, we include a rescission of $1.1 billion.\n  Finally, I raise one issue we have not been able to address; namely, \nHUD and OMB's failure to provide adequate funding for HUD's section 8 \nproject-based housing program for fiscal year 2008. To my colleagues \nand to OMB and to HUD, I say: Let's get serious. This is a critical and \nimportant program which serves many of our most vulnerable citizens--\nlow-income families, extremely low-income families, seniors, and \npersons with disabilities. If we don't fund it, they are out on the \nstreet. None of us wants to see that result. HUD has been unable to \nfund in a full and timely fashion many of these contracts during fiscal \nyear 2007, and this problem is only going to get worse in 2008 to the \nextent that HUD could have a shortfall in its budget of as much as $2 \nbillion or more which is needed to meet its obligations to these \ncontracts in the next fiscal year. If we don't act in this bill, we are \ngoing to see a $2 billion shortfall. Think of the number of people who \nwould be put out on the street if we don't solve that problem. It is \nunacceptable.\n  I know this program enjoys wide support, and I expect and hope that \nOMB will provide the necessary funds for the program through a budget \namendment or as part of a continuing resolution or through emergency \nsupplemental legislation. To my good friends at OMB, I say: You cannot \nwalk away from this problem. This problem is real. It must be addressed \nor we are going to see a tremendous tragedy for the Nation's lowest \nincome and most needy housing residents.\n  While I am pleased with much of the bill, especially spending in \ncritical programs, I have to say that we are on a collision course with \nthe White House on the spending levels contained in this bill. Both \nsides are going to have to make adjustments. Some of the adjustments we \nhave outlined are absolutely essential, and we cannot lose the benefit \nof the positive investments we have made in this bill. This is a very \nimportant bill. It is a very difficult bill because we have some \nextremely serious challenges to face. We understand the need to be \nsensitive to the budget needs, but there are real pressing human \nproblems we must meet in this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks my \ncolleague made regarding the HUD tenant-based housing. I will have more \nto say on that later. I appreciate his comments.\n  We do have now before the Senate a pending amendment about which I \nwould like to make a few remarks. I am hoping we can set a timetable \nfor a vote on that fairly shortly. I do want my colleagues to know \nabout the amendment now pending.\n  Less than 6 weeks ago, our entire Nation--really, the entire world--\nwatched in horror as the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, MN, collapsed \ninto the Mississippi River. Given the scope of that disaster, it is \nmiraculous that the fatalities were not greater. Thirteen people lost \ntheir lives and over 100 were injured on that horrible day. We are all \ngoing to remember the horrendous vision of that yellow schoolbus full \nof children that came within a few feet of tragedy.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board is still, of course, \nconducting its investigation into the exact cause of the bridge \ncollapse, but the horror of that incident has appropriately focused the \nNation on whether we are investing adequately in a national highway \nsystem that is fragile and aging. The troubling conditions of our \nNation's highways and bridges should not have been a surprise to the \nmedia or to policymakers. This has not been a story kept under wraps \nfor years. This is not a case where the true conditions were\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nsuddenly revealed in a groundbreaking study.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has by law been required to \npublish regular reports on the conditions and performance of America's \nhighway infrastructure. That report is submitted to Congress and posted \non the Web. The DOT's report was used extensively in the debate we had \nwith the Bush administration 4 years ago over the appropriate amount of \nfunding that should be authorized in the highway bill. This report from \nthe DOT is amplified by regular annual report cards published by the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, along with regular studies by \nother groups. The difference today is that the nightmare became a \nreality for the people of Minnesota and Americans across the country as \nwe watched it live on television.\n  We have built a national highway system that is the envy of the \nworld. But it is now no secret that our Government has failed to \nadequately fund the maintenance needs of that system. Increasing \ntraffic has put added stress on a system that simply was not designed \nfor it. As a result, our bridges are deteriorating far faster than we \ncan finance their replacement. This is why more than one in every four \nbridges on U.S. highways is rated as deficient. Put another way, fully \n27 percent of our 600,000 bridges have aged so much that their physical \ncondition or their ability to withstand current traffic levels is \nsimply inadequate. Roughly half of these deficient bridges or about \n78,000 across the Nation are structurally deficient. That means the \nDepartment of Transportation considers the physical condition of these \nbridges to be poor or worse.\n  These bridges require immediate attention, and many of them will need \nto have weight limits to keep them in service. For a portion of these \nbridges, their physical condition is so bad that they are unsafe and do \nneed to be replaced. The other half of deficient bridges or another \n80,000 across the Nation are functionally obsolete. They don't meet \ntoday's design standards. They don't conform to today's safety \nrequirements, and they are handling traffic far beyond their original \ndesign.\n  These deficient bridges are not just found off the beaten path, by \nthe way. In fact, over 6,000 bridges considered deficient are located \non the National Highway System, the roadway system that is designated \nas most important to our Nation's economy, defense, and mobility. There \nare deficient bridges found in every State in the Nation. My home State \nof Washington has more than 2,300 deficient bridges. But certain of our \nStates are struggling a lot more than others. Iowa has more than 6,600 \ndeficient bridges. Oklahoma has more than 7,400 deficient bridges. \nPennsylvania has almost 9,600 deficient bridges. Texas has more than \n10,000 deficient bridges. California has more than 7,000 deficient \nbridges, with more than 2,000 on the National Highway System.\n  The Department of Transportation evaluated the complete picture \nacross the Nation last year when it published its Conditions and \nPerformance Report for 2006. That report concluded that there is a \n$65.3 billion backlog of repairs needed on U.S. bridges by all levels \nof government. Unfortunately, the challenge of addressing this issue \ncomprehensively is going to have to wait for the next highway \nreauthorization bill. But today I have offered an amendment to this \nbill that will add $1 billion to the resources available to all 50 \nStates to help address their most critical bridge replacement and \nrepair needs.\n  This amendment will not bust the budget. It can be accommodated \nwithin the budget ceiling that governs our subcommittee bill. It does \nnot bust through that ceiling or through the discretionary spending cap \nthat has been imposed by our budget resolution.\n  Working with Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran, our \nsubcommittee was allocated additional outlays that were not used by \nother subcommittees specifically to accommodate the cost of this \namendment I have offered.\n  My amendment would distribute the $1 billion strictly according to \nthe formula that already exists in the code for the bridge replacement \nand rehabilitation program. That formula by law takes into account the \nphysical conditions of the bridges in each State, the cost to \nrehabilitate or replace the deficient bridges, current safety standards \nand traffic demands, and the role of the bridges in the overall \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \ndistribution of this funding to all 50 States be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     DISTRIBUTION OF OBLIGATION AUTHORITY UNDER THE MURRAY AMENDMENT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Bridge Oblig.

Mr. President, consistent with the rules that are \nalready in law for the bridge program, these additional funds we are \ncovering under this amendment will be available to the States for \nbridge replacement, bridge rehabilitation, preventive maintenance, \nseismic retrofitting, bridge inspections, and the installation of \ncountermeasures designed to protect bridges and extend their lifespans.\n  Importantly, my amendment does include one restriction that is not \nincluded in current law. My amendment will require the Secretary of \nTransportation to ensure these additional funds be used to enhance \nplanned expenditures by the States for bridge construction and repair.\n  Under current highway law, States have the flexibility to use \nobligational authority for many different uses. States may transfer \nfunding between program activities so they can target Federal funds on \ntheir most urgent needs. My amendment would not disturb that \nflexibility for the over $40 billion we are allocating to the States in \nregular Federal aid funding. However, my amendment would require the \nStates to use the additional $1 billion we allocate with this amendment \nsolely for their most critical bridge activities.\n  This amendment is a very measured response to a very big problem. I \nknow our States need even greater resources to address their bridge \nrepair needs, but my amendment will allow for an historic increase in \nFederal bridge funding--a boost of 25 percent. And it will do so while \nworking within the constraints of our budget resolution.\n  I urge our Senators to support this amendment. The American people \ndeserve to feel safe on our roads and our bridges. We should be taking \nevery step necessary to ensure they are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11297-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11297-S11302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PRODUCT SAFETY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week, Mattel, the maker of Barbie and \nElmo and Barney toys, issued its third recall of tainted products from \nChina just in the last month. Toothpaste, tires, toys--when ``made in \nChina'' becomes a warning label, something is very wrong. Our trade \npolicy should prevent these problems, not invite them. Clearly, our \ntrade policy has failed. Yet anyone who disagrees with America's trade \nexperts is labeled a protectionist, as if that is a bad word. It is not \nonly our moral obligation to protect our communities, protect our \nfamilies, protect our children from contaminated, possibly deadly \nproducts, as Members of Congress it is our duty to protect them.\n  Last year, the United States imported from China $288 billion worth \nof goods, much of it food and toys and vitamins and dog food. Not only \nis China weak in unenforced health and safety regulations, as the \nWashington Post revealed again today, it aggressively foists on \nvulnerable nations contaminated food and products.\n  China sends formaldehyde-laced children's candy, mercury-laced \nmakeup, and fungus-infested dried fruits to unsuspecting consumers in \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong--a part of China--nations largely \nreliant upon Communist China for trade and for aid. Our country has \nworked hard to build safe working places, to build a reliable, healthy \nfood supply, and to ensure that our drinking water is pure and safe. \nFor 100 years, workers, community leaders, elected officials, \nadvocates, labor union activists, people of faith in their synagogues \nand in their churches, took on some of the world's most powerful \ncorporations to make sure our food and our products were safe. \nUnrestricted, unregulated free trade with China threatens these gains \nand jeopardizes our public health. Why would we expect otherwise? China \ndoesn't enforce food safety, doesn't enforce consumer product safety, \ndoesn't enforce worker safety in its own country for its own people. \nWhy would we expect--with this wide-open trade arrangement with the \nPeople's Republic of China, why would we expect that Communist \ngovernment, which cares little about its own citizens--why would we \nexpect them to ship us uncontaminated vitamins? Why would we expect \nthem to ship us products that are safe? Why would we be surprised when \ntoys are coated with lead-based paint or vitamins are contaminated?\n  As of now, there is little interest among the Chinese in changing the \nway we and they do business. Our trade deficit with China exceeded $250 \nbillion last year.\n  So what is to be done? Since the Chinese Communist party forbids \nthird party inspectors on Chinese soil, we either buy less--much less--\nfrom China, or we hold importers responsible for the safety of the \nproducts they bring into our country. First of all, we must increase \nthe number of food and consumer product safety inspectors. Less than 1 \npercent of all imported vegetables and fruits and seafoods and grains \nare inspected at the border--less than 1 percent.\n  Mattel is to be commended for taking the proactive step of an \ninternal investigation into the recall of products. But such action \nshould be the rarity, not the norm, which is why we cannot in our \nNation's best interests focus solely on consumer threats from China.\n  The real threat is our failed trade policy that allows--and in fact \nencourages in some ways--recall after recall after recall. The real \nthreat is our failure to change course and craft a new trade policy. \nThe real threat is this administration's insistence not just on \ncontinuing these trade relationships, but on building more of the same: \nMore trade pacts that send U.S. jobs overseas, more trade pacts that \nallow companies and countries to ignore the rules of fair trade, and \nmore trade pacts that will lead to more recalls.\n  The administration and its free trade supporters in Congress are \ngearing up for another trade fight. They want to force on our Nation--a \nnation that in November demanded change in every State in the Union--\nthey want to force on our Nation more trade agreements with Peru and \nPanama, Colombia and South Korea, all based on the same failed trade \nmodel.\n  FDA inspectors have rejected seafood imports from Peru and Panama. \nYet the President is suggesting trade agreements with Peru and Panama. \nYet the current trade agreements--as written--limit food safety \nstandards and continue to ignore real border inspections. Adding insult \nto injury, the agreements would force the United States to rely on \nforeign inspectors who aren't doing their jobs to ensure our safety. We \nhave seen how well that worked in China.\n  More of the same in our trade policy will mean exactly what we have \nseen now with China: more contaminated imports; more unsafe, dangerous \ntoys; more recalls. It is time for a new direction in our Nation's \ntrade policy.\n  As my friend from North Dakota says, we want plenty of trade. We want \ntrade--plenty of it--but we want it under different rules. It is time \nfor a trade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen \ntables and toys in our children's bedrooms.\n\n  Everyone agrees on one thing: We want more trade with countries \naround the world, but our first responsibility in the Senate is to \nprotect the safety and the health of our families first.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Ohio yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would love to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio has spoken often \nabout trade issues, and I have as well. We have talked a lot about the \nissue of workers, the impact of free-trade agreements on workers in \nthis country, and the downward pressure on their income and the \noutsourcing of American jobs. We have talked a lot about its impact on \nthe environment; being able to produce, for example, in China and pump \neffluents into the air and chemicals into the water and encouraging \ncorporations to move to produce where they can hire people for 20 cents \nan hour, 30 cents an hour, and pump their pollutants into the air and \nthe water unimpeded.\n  We have not talked previously much about this issue of protecting \nconsumers. I would just say to my colleague that I spoke last week \nabout a young boy, a 4-year-old boy, who swallowed a little heart-\nshaped charm--a little heart-shaped charm--and died. Why? Because that \nheart-shaped charm was made of 99 percent lead coming from China. Well, \nwe know the impact of lead on human health. Ben Franklin described \nthat. It is not something that is new. Yet we have these products now \ncoming into this country with lead because it is cheap. It is bright. \nSo we have all of this lead coming in.\n  My colleague describes the circumstance now as a ``race to the \nbottom'' with respect to consumer standards. We have always known that \nis what is going on with these free-trade agreements with respect to \nlabor standards and environmental standards. But is it also the case--I \nwould ask the Senator from Ohio is it also the case that this is a race \nto the bottom with respect to consumer standards, by passing these \nfree-trade agreements and doing nothing to insist that the conditions \nabroad are the conditions that we require at home with respect to what \nis used in the production is safe for consumers, and so on?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan is exactly right. The \ntragedy of the young boy who swallowed the little toy made of lead is \nthat it is less expensive to use lead. It is easier to paint. The paint \ndries quicker. All of that when you use lead. So when we have this race \nto the bottom, when our companies go to China and are looking for the \ncheapest way to make products, and then to import those products, \nexport them from China, import them back into the United States, you \nare going to see that race to the bottom.\n  We have seen it with contaminated toothpaste, we have seen it with \nvitamins, we have seen it with inulin in apple juice, and we see it in \ntoy after toy after toy made by Fisher Price, made by Mattel, some of \nthe most respected companies in our country.\n  Until we change the trade policy when we are dealing with a country \nthat doesn't protect its own consumers, doesn't do much for its own \nclean water, its clean air and safe\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\ndrinking water, doesn't do much for its workers, we know this race to \nthe bottom will continue. That is why the Senator's efforts on trade \nissues and our efforts jointly on trade issues are so important. We \nwant more trade, and we want plenty of it, but we want it under \ndifferent rules that protect American families.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further for a \nquestion, it was, I believe, about a century ago when Upton Sinclair \nwrote the famous book that launched an effort in this country that \ndecided to protect consumers. He was describing conditions in the \nslaughterhouses. Once people read what he described, they insisted--\nthey demanded--protection for consumers. He talked about the rats in \nthe slaughterhouses and how they would take pieces of bread, loaves of \nbread, slices of bread, and lace them with poison and lay them around \nso that the rats would eat the poison and die, the bread would poison \nthe rats. It was all shoved down the same hole, and out the other hole \ncame meat to be sold to the American consumer. There was a demand on \nbehalf of the consumer to stand up for the protection of the American \nconsumer.\n  So over a century, we lifted standards in this country to protect \nAmericans, to protect consumers. Oh, I know some consider it regulation \nwhich is, in their minds, something we should never do, but we regulate \nto protect people. It is the case with the global economy.\n  I would ask my colleague from Ohio, it is the case, is it not, with \nthe global economy that if you don't have rules that keep pace with the \ngalloping global economy, you see downward pressure on American wages? \nBecause it is unfair to workers--to ask a worker from Ohio or North \nDakota to compete with someone who will work in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, or China to work for 20 cents an hour; it is unfair to those \nof us who care about the environment--and there is only one fishbowl. \nWe all live in the same fishbowl, and we breathe the China haze in the \nUnited States--and it is also unfair to consumers who believe that for \nover a century we raised standards to protect them and now we discover \nwe have been engaged in a race to the bottom to obliterate those \nstandards by those who are able to produce abroad.\n  Is this not the case?\n  Mr. BROWN. Exactly. As we weaken those standards, as we have this \nwide-open trade arrangement with a country that doesn't respect those \nstandards and has a history of undermining any standards like that, it \nis intensified by the fact that we have seen in our own country a \nweakening of consumer products, safety laws, and we have seen a scaling \nback of the number of food inspectors at the U.S.-Mexican border and in \nother places. So the first job--and I know the Senator thinks in North \nDakota, and I think in Ohio that U.S. Senators protect our families. \nAnd the best way to do that is stronger consumer product laws, stronger \nhealth and safety laws, and not to allow them to be undercut and not to \nallow them to be unenforced.\n  So I thank my friend from North Dakota for his interest, and I also \nwant to lend support for his amendment that he is about to introduce \nthat deals with the same kinds of issues; in this case truck safety, \nand how important that is to all of us.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment to the \nunderlying bill. My understanding is there is an amendment pending. I \ncan withhold the amendment. I have not yet filed it. Let me at least \ndescribe for this moment the amendment, and then I will file it and \noffer it with the consent of the chairman and the ranking member.\n  In this morning's newspaper there is a story of a great tragedy in \nMexico. It says: 37 die in Mexico truck blast accident. Monterrey, \nMexico. Thirty-seven people killed when a truck loaded with explosives \ncrashed into another truck in northern Mexico, Mexican media reported \non Monday. About 150 people were injured by the blast, which left a \ncrater of up to 65 feet in diameter in the road. Most of the dead were \nbystanders, including three newspaper journalists who had rushed to the \nscene of the crash and the truck exploded, the paper said. That area is \na mining State where explosives are used in the coal industry.\n  Why is that something I raise today? Well, we also had something that \nhappened last week that was pretty unbelievable. The inspector general \nissued a report, and the report is titled: ``Issues Pertaining to the \nProposed NAFTA Cross-Border Trucking Demonstration Project.'' What this \nmeans is they have issued a report on whether we ought to allow long-\nhaul Mexican trucks to come into this country and begin trucking in our \ncountry.\n  Well, we then have an accident in Mexico of two trucks. Tragically, \n37 people are killed, 150 are injured, with a crater in the highway of \n65 feet.\n  And then we have the Bush administration that last week rushed--yes, \nI say rushed--to approve the pilot project of some 100 trucking firms \nto do long-haul trucking in our country.\n  The inspector general's report, which I have, is 40-some pages long. \nI had previously cosponsored an amendment with some of my colleagues \nsaying that they had to wait to allow long-haul truckers from Mexico to \ndo long-haul trucking in our country until they could have an inspector \ngeneral's report which analyzed the advisability of this pilot program.\n  So they could not proceed with the pilot program despite the fact \nthat they were itching to do it. But they were impeded from proceeding \nuntil they got the inspector general's report. The inspector general's \nreport came in at 7:30 last Thursday evening.\n  At 8:30 the same evening--presumably having read 40-some pages--the \nattorneys and the administrator at the Department of Transportation \nannounced that the pilot program would begin. So in 1 hour, the \nDepartment of Transportation evaluated this inspector general's \nreport--or maybe not.\n  Let me describe some of what this report is about. First, the \ninspector general's finding--the inspector general's finding, \nDepartment of Transportation only looking at records that the Mexican \ntrucking companies make ``available.'' Here is what it says:\n\n       While the Department of Transportation officials inspecting \n     Mexican trucking companies took steps to certify onsite data, \n     we noted that certain information was not available to them. \n     Specifically, information pertaining to vehicle inspections, \n     accident reports, and driver violations maintained by Mexican \n     authorities was not available to the Department of \n     Transportation.\n\n  I will say that again. This is very stunning, almost unbelievable. \nThe Department of Transportation says it has now evaluated all of \nthis--the pertinent information--and has decided now to trigger the \npilot project by which Mexican long-haul trucks will be moved into this \ncountry, but they weren't able to verify the onsite data. What weren't \nthey able to verify? Well, vehicle inspections, accident reports, and \ndriver violations.\n  Why am I concerned about this whole issue? Because I know--and I \nthink most people know--that you don't have the same circumstance in \nMexico with respect to truck safety, with respect to requirements, \nregulations, and inspections; you don't have the same enforcement with \nrespect to driver standards, hours of service, and all of those related \nissues. The practices are not equivalent. So if we move a trucking \nfleet into this country from Mexico that doesn't have equivalent safety \nrequirements and standards, and drivers who have not been required to \nmeet the same standards and have enforcement to the same standards, \nthen there is no question but that we put at risk drivers on America's \nstreets, roads, and highways. That is a fact.\n  Yet this administration is so anxious to move that they took only 1 \nhour to evaluate the IG report. They tell us: We have all this under \ncontrol. Don't worry, be happy; it doesn't matter what truck you are \ndriving next to ours or what truck you are going to meet at a four-way \nstop sign; it is all under control--except they weren't able to get \ninformation about vehicle inspections. That means they weren't able to \nget that information on Mexican trucks. They weren't able to get \ninformation about accident reports. They weren't able to get \ninformation about driver violations. What were they able to get?\n  Is this one of those ``trust us'' things? I think we have had enough \nof these ``trust us'' claims. How about verifying just a bit some of \nthe basic\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\ninformation we need to know and understand before we decide to allow \nMexican long-haul trucks beyond that 25-mile perimeter they have been \nallowed to drive since NAFTA. Well, as I indicated, it took this \nadministration all of 1 hour to approve this pilot project.\n  Let me provide the next chart that shows the key issue. The inspector \ngeneral's report doesn't resolve these issues. You would think the \nDepartment of Transportation, having some sort of epiphany at 8:30 in \nthe evening, must have felt everything was resolved. If they read the \nIG report, here is what it says:\n\n       Inconsistent data used to monitor Mexican commercial \n     driving convictions in the U.S. Lack of coordination with the \n     Department of Transportation offices to ensure that drug and \n     alcohol testing issues are addressed. Lack of Federal motor \n     vehicle policy to check and record vehicle identification \n     numbers during an inspection. Inadequate Mexican bus \n     inspection coverage during busy periods.\n\n  I went to page 2 of the IG report. Page 2 on the report is a response \nto what the administration said. They said, if we can allow these long-\nhaul Mexican trucks in, we are going to inspect every one of them under \nthe pilot project. If we get one coming North, we are inspecting it. We \nare going to put an inspector on the vehicle. We are going to inspect \nthe vehicle. Here is what the IG report says: They agreed to develop a \nplan to check every truck every time. But as of July 2007--that is a \nlittle less than a month ago--no coordinated site-specific plans to \ncarry out such checks were in place. Federal Motor Vehicle Carrier said \nit would have plans outlined by August 22, but the IG says we have not \nreceived any outlines or completed plans.\n\n       In our opinion, not having site-specific plans developed \n     and in place prior to initiating the demonstration project \n     will increase the risk that project participants will be able \n     to avoid the required checks.\n\n  I will not read that all again. It means this: Despite the promises \nthat they are going to inspect every truck every time, they don't have \nplans in place to do that. Those are pie-in-the-sky promises. We have \nhad a bellyful of them. Time after time, they say here is what we are \ngoing to do and we commit, trust us. On this subject, the fact is we \nshould not trust anybody. We should say show us the plan that is going \nto guarantee the next time you show up at a four-way stop, or you are \ndriving down a highway in this country, and you are confronted by a \ntruck that came across our border from Mexico, that that truck has met \nan equivalent safety standard as an American truck, and that that \ndriver and his or her record of service and the conditions of service \nand the hours of service are equivalent to what you would expect with \nan American driver. If that is not the case, then there ought not to be \na pilot project at this point.\n\n  I only referred to page 2 of the report. As I indicated, they took a \nlittle less than 1 hour last Thursday evening to decide to approve the \npilot project after they were prevented from doing so until this report \ncame out. It is clear to me that they either didn't read the report or \ndidn't understand the report, because this report doesn't suggest at \nall that what has been put into place represents any kind of safety or \nsecurity for American drivers when confronting a Mexican long-haul \ntruck coming across the border.\n  Do I allege that every truck that will come across is unsafe, that \nevery American should shudder at the risk of pulling up to an \nintersection with them? That is not my point. We have two different \nstandards with respect to the enforcement of safety requirements, with \nrespect to trucks and drivers in Mexico versus the trucks and drivers \nin the United States. To decide at this moment that we are going to \nmerge these systems without providing the assurance to the American \npeople they are going to do what they say they are going to do--inspect \nevery truck every time--that is a decision by the Department of \nTransportation to provide extraordinary risks they should not provide \nfor American drivers.\n  Let me again put up a chart that shows three issues on which you \nwould have to know, it seems to me, at least the body of information if \nyou were serious about saying we are going to implement the NAFTA, \nwhich itself--by the way, in my conversation a few moments ago with the \nSenator from Ohio, we could have described our trade failures, and the \nhood ornament of that failure is certainly NAFTA, an agreement we \nreached with Mexico and Canada. At the time, we had a very small trade \nsurplus with Mexico. We have turned that into a very large trade \ndeficit with Mexico now. We had a modest trade deficit with Canada, and \nwe have now turned that into a very large one. By all accounts and \nstandards, NAFTA has been a huge failure for this country. It ought to \nbe, in my judgment, renegotiated, but those who chant ``free trade'' \nand believe that any trade agreement is better than no trade agreement \ncontinue to say NAFTA was a success, despite all of the evidence. It is \nvery hard to describe success as very large and growing trade deficits. \nNAFTA, apparently, indicated that we should integrate our trucking and, \ntherefore, Mexican trucks should be allowed into this country for long-\nhaul capability. But in order to do that, we would harmonize the safety \nstandards in Mexico and the United States with respect to equipment and \ndrivers.\n  So the Department of Transportation, anxious as it is to allow long-\nhaul Mexican trucking into this country right now and, again, with a \npilot program right now, they have tried to assure us there is no risk, \nno problem, be happy. The problem is the very IG report they rely on to \ntrigger the pilot project, in my judgment, tells them they should not \ndo it at all; there is substantial risk. You would need to have a body \nof information about what is happening with respect to Mexican trucking \nin order to make this judgment. What kind of information did they get? \nThey didn't get accident reports because there wasn't any central \nrepository of information for the reports. They didn't get vehicle \ninspections. They didn't have that information. They didn't get driver \nviolations--with one exception; that exception was the Mexican \ncompanies that decided voluntarily to provide the information. They \nhave that--whatever that is. It is not very much, but they have that. \nThat doesn't represent any information that is validated by anybody.\n  It is unbelievable to me that they would rush off and--I know this \nabout transportation, but it seems to me if anybody should be arrested \nfor speeding here, it is those who have decided they are going to rush \nand speed to approve this pilot project less than 1 hour after the IG \nreport comes out, at a time when the IG says clearly they have not been \nable to get the information you would need.\n  Again, on page 2 of the IG report, I will say it again because it is \ncentral to what I am saying on the floor of the Senate, the Department \nof Transportation says they will inspect every truck every time with \nrespect to this pilot project. Let me say, again, here are the facts. \nThey agreed to develop a plan to check every truck every time. But as \nof July 2007, a month ago, no coordinated site-specific plan to carry \nout such checks was in place. They stated they would have plans \noutlined by August 22 at that point. That is about 2 weeks ago.\n  But the IG says that ``we have not received any outlines or completed \nplans.'' ``In our opinion,'' they say, ``not having site-specific plans \ndeveloped and in place prior to initiating the demonstration project \nwill increase the risk that project participants will be able to avoid \nthe required checks.'' What the IG is saying is if you don't have a \nplan in place to inspect every truck every time, you increase the risk \nthat these participants will be able to avoid the required checks.\n  I think this sets us up for failure, but, more importantly, it \nimposes substantial additional risks, I believe, for American drivers.\n  First and foremost, with respect to our trade agreements, they ought \nto be able to protect this country's economic interests and our \ninterests with respect to safety. I don't believe the actions by the \nDepartment of Transportation have done that.\n  I don't believe the inspector general's report suggests that standard \nhas been met. For that reason, I will offer an amendment that is \nidentical to the amendment previously passed by the House that will \nprohibit the use of funds to continue this pilot project.\n  Thursday, at 8:30 in the evening, 1 hour after the inspector \ngeneral's report was published, the administration\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nannounced they were embarking on the pilot project. I don't know \nexactly where they are at this moment on it, but wherever that happens \nto be, the House of Representatives has already said no, and I believe \nthe Senate, in support of my amendment, will do exactly the same thing.\n  There is an amendment pending on the floor of the Senate. I will \nshortly file my amendment, and I will call it up at an appropriate \ntime. But I wish to make a comment on another matter very briefly, if I \nmay.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are now testifying before the \nHouse of Representatives. Most of us know from this morning's news \nreports and from the expectations last week what the report will be \ntoday. The report will be as existed now for a good many years, longer \nthan the Second World War has lasted. That is how long we have been \nengaged in the war in Iraq. The report will be: Things are getting \nbetter; there is marginal improvement; things are uneven; we can't \nleave; we have to stay. That is going to be the report. We understand.\n  I wish to raise the question again, however, that I think is being \nmissed with the Petraeus report and the Crocker report, and missed by \nCongress as well.\n  Last week, we were told that we received a message from Osama bin \nLaden. Osama bin Laden, in a ``safe and secure'' hideaway--and I use \nthe words ``safe and secure'' in quotes because that is what our \nintelligence officials have indicated to us--in a safe and secure \nhideaway, we are receiving messages from the leadership of al-Qaida. \nThe last National Intelligence Estimate, just months ago, indicated \nthat the greatest threat to our country and our homeland is the \nleadership of al-Qaida and that they are ensconced in a safe or secure \nhideaway.\n  My question is this: Despite all of the reports we will now hear on \nthe subject of Iraq, does it meet any kind of test of faith or good \nstrategy that we should be going door to door in Baghdad in the middle \nof a civil war at a time when those planning additional attacks against \nour country are in safe and secure havens in northern Pakistan, at a \ntime when the National Intelligence Estimate says that the greatest \nthreat to our homeland--this is not me making this up--the greatest \nterrorist threat to this country and our homeland is from the \nleadership of al-Qaida, and they are planning new attacks, does it make \nsense there is a spot on Earth that ought to be safe and secure for \nthem? Isn't it the case there ought not be 1 square inch on this planet \n6 years after 9/11 that the leadership of al-Qaida can plan and plot \nattacks against our country?\n  I guess that is the case because we are in the middle, once again, of \ncivil war in Iraq and have been for a long while, and we will, if we \nagree there shall not be a change in course, remain in Iraq for some \nlong while.\n  My own view is we are going to leave Iraq. The question is not \nwhether; the question is how and when. It makes little sense to me not \nto have as a priority, not to have as the priority in our country to \neliminate the greatest terrorist threat to our country, and that, \naccording to the National Intelligence Estimate, is the leadership of \nal-Qaida.\n  Some will make the point that there is al-Qaida in Iraq, and that is \ntrue. That is not the central war on terror, however, and Iraq is not \nthe central war on terror. Iraq is more sectarian violence. The \nNational Intelligence Estimate tells us that as well.\n  All of us hope for the same thing. We want this country to find its \nway; we would wish that the leadership of Iraq will be able to provide \nstrong leadership, resolve the questions, and then at some point find a \nway to provide for its own security. Saddam Hussein has been executed; \nhe is dead. The people of Iraq have a new constitution; they voted for \nit. The people of Iraq have a new government; they voted for that \ngovernment. The next question for the people of Iraq is whether they \nhave the capability and the will to provide for their own security \nbecause this country cannot do that for many more years, and we do that \nat the expense of not eliminating the most significant threat to our \ncountry, according to the National Intelligence Estimate, and that \nthreat is the leadership of al-Qaida that sits now in a safe haven, a \nsafe and secure place.\n  I say again, as I conclude, that even as we have testimony today \nbefore the House and tomorrow before the Senate, our goal ought to be \nto fight the terrorists first, and those terrorists, according to the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, plan additional attacks against our \nhomeland even now from safe and secure places. There ought not be 1 \nsquare inch on this planet that should be safe and secure for the \nleadership of the terrorist organizations plotting attacks against our \ncountry. That ought to be our priority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate all the comments of my \ncolleague. He had some very interesting things to say. I don't believe \nI can let it pass, as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nwithout clarifying some of what has been said about the danger to this \ncountry.\n  First, we have never taken our eyes, our efforts off getting the \nleaders of al-Qaida. There were times in the past, in the nineties, \nwhen we had an opportunity to get him, and apparently, according to \npublished reports, from one of the people who was with Osama bin Laden, \nwe came close, but we have not been able to find him. I can assure you, \nwithout going into the details, that we continue to make a major effort \nto find Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2 man. If any \nSenator wants to come to the Senate Intelligence Committee in Hart 219, \nwe will be happy to brief them on the efforts made there.\n  As far as the threat to the United States, the greatest threat to the \nUnited States from abroad is having al-Qaida establish a safe haven \nwhere they can recruit, have training facilities, issue command-and-\ncontrol orders, and develop weapons of mass destruction. We have no \nbetter authorities than Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri that they \nstill seek to establish that headquarters for their effort in Iraq \nbecause this is where they believe their caliphate should be \nheadquartered. They would be far more capable of operating against the \nUnited States and others if they could go back to establishing their \nsafe havens in Iraq, as they had in Afghanistan prior to our \neliminating the Taliban.\n  I believe anybody will tell you that this country is safer because we \nhave denied them a safe haven. Yes, some of the leaders are hiding out \nin the rugged mountains in that region. Their communications are very \ndifficult. Their training facilities have been interrupted from time to \ntime by our and allied efforts. We continue those efforts. They know \nthey cannot operate safely there with impunity, but they are denied the \noperational freedom of a safe haven in Iraq. That is their goal--that \nand attacking the United States. Establishing a foothold in Iraq would \ngive them not only the training facilities and recruiting and command-\nand-control capacities, but it would give them access to tremendous oil \nreserves, so they would have the funding from the oil resources, \npotentially putting tremendous economic pressure on us if they cut off \nIraq's oil supply to the free world. But they would have the oil \nresources.\n  As far as Iraq is concerned, the intelligence we had before we went \nin was not good. We pointed out in the Intelligence Committees where it \nfell short. But we have also had the report of the Iraqi Survey Group, \nDavid Kay, which said Iraq was a far more dangerous place even than we \nknew. Before we went in and took out Saddam Hussein, we did not know \nthe chaotic system in that country. The fact that there were terror \ngroups operating in that country who sought weapons of mass \ndestruction--and we know Saddam Hussein not only manufactured but used \nweapons of mass destruction--those terrorist groups in Iraq were \nseeking to get weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein's \noperations and his just-in-time inventory system.\n  There is a lot more to the story than we just heard, but I can assure \nmy colleagues, from the intelligence standpoint, we are not giving \nanybody any safe haven where we have any reasonable knowledge of where \nthey stand or in what way they are operating.\n  I wanted to make those comments. I thank the Chair. I note another \ncolleague has asked to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take 2 minutes. My colleague is a \ndistinguished member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, but I want \nto observe this point because it is important. We will certainly have \nan Iraq discussion late this week or next week. It will be, I hope, a \ndiscussion that represents the best of what both sides have to offer \nrather than the worst of each. When we get the best of both, the \ncountry has benefited. I hope and expect that will be the case. But I \ndo wish to make this point: The training camps have already been \nreconstituted. Last week, I was on the floor of the Senate describing \nin three different pieces of evidence that Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-\nZawahiri, and others have already reconstituted training camps, which \nrepresents a problem. Last week in Denmark, they picked up terrorists. \nGuess where they were trained. Partly in Afghanistan but mostly in \nPakistan. And the expectation is they were trained in those training \ncamps which have been reconstituted because the leadership of al-Qaida \ndoes, in fact, have a safe haven.\n  I have great respect for my colleague, and I do not want to pursue a \nlengthy debate, but I want to say that the leadership of al-Qaida has \nlargely been given safe haven. We took our eye off the ball. There was \na period of time when it didn't matter where they were. They have \nreconstituted their training bases, and we are starting to see the \nbitter fruits of that effort, and we will see more. It is why I say I \nbelieve it is very important, as a matter of national strategy, to \nfight the terrorists first.\n  I will speak later about the question of what was in Iraq when we \nwent there. At this point, I think all of us as a country believe that \nif that is the greatest terrorist threat to our country, the leadership \nof al-Qaida, the elimination of that leadership and the elimination of \nany safe and secure haven must be the most important goal for this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today we are embarking on another very \nimportant chapter in our ongoing Iraq debate, and it is very \nappropriate that we do so because we are receiving testimony and \nreports from two great American leaders who have been forging our cause \nthere--GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. In that context, \nI wish to begin to offer some preliminary thoughts of my own as we \nreenter this debate. They are forged in particular by a recent \nexperience, my recent visit to Iraq with three of our Senate colleagues \nduring the August recess. I was able to go there with Senators \nVoinovich, Alexander, and Corker. We had a very good review of many \nissues there, as well as, obviously, a great opportunity to converse \nand study and talk with experts on the way there and on the way back.\n  I guess out of that trip in particular--it was my second trip to \nIraq; the first was just about a year prior to that, and this was my \nfourth trip to the Middle East--three things struck me in particular, \nthat while many of them have been stated before, they are very \nimportant to get out on the table and reaffirm at the beginning of this \ndebate.\n  One is, it is very clear--in fact, I think it is largely beyond \ndispute--that in recent months, because of not just the personnel and \nthe extra manpower given to the effort through the surge but because of \nthe excellent strategy, the strategic thinking largely of General \nPetraeus behind that effort, there have been real and meaningful gains \nmade on the security side. There have been enormous gains made against \nal-Qaida in Iraq in particular and in tapping down the sectarian \nviolence more generally, although perhaps gains there to a lesser \nextent.\n  We have heard a lot about the Anbar awakening and the enormous gains \nmade against al-Qaida in Iraq. But I think those who try to isolate \nthose gains just to that region, just to that situation are missing the \nfull picture.\n\n  We got a fuller picture of the gains while we were there. Not \nperfectly even gains, not all across the country but significant gains \nmade in a number of different places, in a number of different \ncontexts, and not just in that one region. The security gains, again \nbecause of our greater numbers but even more so because of the \nstrategic thinking that was placed behind that surge, I think those \ngains are very real and very meaningful. They were evident to us, to \nmyself and Senators Voinovich and Alexander and Corker, because of a \nnumber of factors and a number of parts of our visit.\n  What got the message through particularly forcefully was the last \npart of our visit in Iraq, when we went to Combat Outpost X-ray near \nTaji, outside of Baghdad about a half-hour, 45 minutes by helicopter. \nThis was a very instructive and, indeed, inspiring visit. Because, \nagain, we saw the very real fruit of our new strategy and the surge \nforce put behind it. And it wasn't just in that situation of Al Anbar, \nthat many folks try to portray as extremely unique and not being able \nto be replicated anywhere else; it was in this combat outpost outside \nof Baghdad. And it wasn't just among a Sunni population or Sunni \ninsurgents; it was in an area that was roughly half and half, Sunni-\nShia.\n  Two things struck me about that visit more than anything else. One \nwas talking to a young African-American soldier from Louisiana, an \nenlisted man, who in casual conversation--he wasn't quoting any talking \npoints, he wasn't giving any formal brief--who said how motivated he \nwas and what a greater sense of progress he thought they were making \nduring his work there at Combat Outpost X-ray as compared to his \nprevious deployment about 2 years before. He said the difference was \nnight and day, and he felt so much more optimistic because of the surge \nand the strategic thinking behind the surge and the results it was \nhaving that he could see, face-to-face, on the ground.\n  Some of those results we saw on that visit. Because we not only \nvisited with U.S. military commanders and their military personnel, \nsuch as this young soldier from Louisiana, we also sat down with four \nsheiks from the region who had become full and active partners with our \nmilitary and the Iraqi military in getting after the bad guys. It so \nhappened, as is representative of that area, that two of the sheiks \nwere Sunni and two of the sheiks were Shia, but they had come together \nas true brothers in arms and as true brothers in arms with the U.S. \nmilitary and the Iraqi military to get after the bad guys, particularly \nal-Qaida in Iraq but also insurgents who were causing violence and \nterrorizing their families.\n  That is the sort of real progress the Louisiana soldier was talking \nabout. That is what was exciting him and had gotten him so motivated, \nparticularly compared to his previous tour of duty about 2 years prior.\n  The second thing I saw firsthand during that visit to Iraq is on the \nother side of the ledger and is also talked about quite freely and \nquite openly, and that is that while we have this meaningful security \nprogress, while we have real results from the surge and the strategic \nthinking behind the surge, unfortunately we don't have a lot of \npolitical progress produced at the Iraqi central government level. \nAgain, this was very evident from our personal experiences on the \nground, particularly two meetings we had, one with the Sunni Vice \nPresident of Iraq and one with the Shia Vice President. Those two \nmeetings, separate meetings, helped to underscore the enormous need we \nhave for further reconciliation and for further political progress on \nthe ground at the central government level.\n  I remarked during our visit to Combat Outpost X-ray that I would like \nto nominate those four sheiks to help form a new central government \nbecause their reconciliation was in stark contrast, their friendship \nand partnership was in stark contrast, quite frankly, to the \ndiscussions we had with the two Iraqi Vice Presidents, one Shia, one \nSunni. So, again, we saw firsthand the unfortunate lack of political \nprogress. Of course, the surge was designed to create breathing room \nand time for the political process at the central government level, but \nthat lack of progress has been very frustrating.\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n  Now, I do have to say there has been a little progress since then. \nSince we came home, the big five Iraqi leaders, if you will--the \nPresident, the two Vice Presidents, the Prime Minister, and also the \nKurdish leader--have signed a joint communique and have laid out a path \nto reconciliation and progress on the key political issues facing them. \nThat is encouraging. But certainly it doesn't completely change the \nsituation on the ground politically, which wasn't particularly \nencouraging when we were there.\n  The third and final thing which I observed very directly, and which \nis perhaps the most important, in my opinion that we focus on this \nweek, is the enormous integrity, focus, dedication, and intelligence of \nour two primary leaders on the ground in Iraq--GEN David Petraeus and \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker. Again, our four-Senator delegation had a great \nopportunity to sit down with them for about an hour and a half, and we \nhad a very meaningful, indepth discussion, hearing recent progress and \nlack of progress from them. They gave us their own personal \nobservations, and they responded to all of our queries and questions. \nThere were a lot of details and facts that came through during that \nmeeting. But what most came through, to me, was their enormous \ncredibility, in terms of what is going on there on the ground, and \ntheir enormous dedication, focus, background, and real intelligence \nabout the challenge they were leading there on the ground.\n  I think that is perhaps the most important of my three observations \nas we begin this new chapter of the Iraq debate, for a very simple \nreason. Those gentlemen are testifying, as we speak, before the House. \nThey will testify tomorrow before the Senate. This is following the \nlead-up of many months, where we have been looking forward and waiting \nto hear their direct observations and their testimony. This is after it \nis universally acknowledged that they are very smart, qualified people; \nthere to lead our military and diplomatic effort. Yet, even having said \nall of that, I think the rush of all of us in Congress, House and \nSenate, is to talk and debate and offer our own opinions without taking \na little time to be quiet, to take a deep breath and listen to the \nobservations and opinions of those two highly qualified leaders.\n  So I end with that observation, of their enormous credibility, \ndedication, focus, and intelligence, in terms of the task before them. \nI end on that observation to encourage all of us not to reserve our \nopinions forever, not to shy away from an important debate, not to \ndisagree, if we truly disagree in our minds and in our hearts, but to \ntake a deep breath for a few days, for a few moments, to listen to the \nobservations and the suggestions of these very capable leaders.\n\n  That is the third thing I brought back from my personal trip to Iraq \nduring August with Senators Voinovich, Alexander, and Corker. Today, \ntomorrow, as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testify before \nCongress, perhaps that is the most important observation. We will have \nplenty of time to debate, argue, disagree, propose resolutions, move \nforward with legislation, and take votes. But surely, given the \nuniversal credibility of these two men, we should take a deep breath \nand listen carefully to their observations, their suggestions, and \ntheir plans. That is certainly what I am going to do as we begin this \nnew chapter of the debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Murray amendment No. \n2792, and that regardless of the outcome, amendment No. 2791 be agreed \nto as amended, if amended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 312\n\n       Whereas, on August 6, 2007, 6 miners, Kerry Allred, Don \n     Erickson, Luis Hernandez, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, and \n     Manuel Sanchez, were trapped 1,800 feet below ground in the \n     Crandall Canyon coal mine in Emory County, Utah;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local rescue crews have worked \n     relentlessly in an effort to find and rescue the trapped \n     miners;\n       Whereas, on August 16, 2007, Dale ``Bird'' Black, Gary \n     Jensen, and Brandon Kimber bravely gave their lives and 6 \n     other workers were injured during the rescue efforts;\n       Whereas Utah is one of the largest coal-producing States in \n     the United States, having produced more than 26,000,000 tons \n     of coal in 2006;\n       Whereas coal generates more than half of our Nation's \n     electricity, providing millions of Americans with energy for \n     their homes and businesses;\n       Whereas coal mining continues to provide economic stability \n     for many communities in Utah and throughout the United \n     States;\n       Whereas during the last century over 100,000 coal miners \n     have been killed in mining accidents in the Nation's coal \n     mines; and\n       Whereas the American people are greatly indebted to coal \n     miners for the difficult and dangerous work they perform: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors Kerry Allred, Don Erickson, Luis Hernandez, \n     Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, and Manuel Sanchez, as well \n     as Dale ``Bird'' Black, Gary Jensen, and Brandon Kimber for \n     their sacrifice in the Crandall Canyon coal mine;\n       (2) extends the deepest condolences of the Nation to the \n     families of these men;\n       (3) recognizes the brave work of the many volunteers who \n     participated in the rescue efforts and provided support for \n     the miners' families during rescue operations; and\n       (4) honors the contribution of coal mines and coal-mining \n     families to America's proud heritage.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the early morning hours of August 6, \n2007, my home State of Utah, our home State of Utah--my distinguished \nfriend and colleague, Senator Bennett, is with me today--suffered a \nseismic event at the Crandall Canyon mine in Emery County. These \n``mountain bumps'' set up a chain of events that culminated in great \ntragedy and tremendous sorrow to all of our fellow Utahans and, I \nthink, to many people across the country.\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\n  As a team of miners was working on its shift at the Crandall Canyon \nmine, the earth shifted and debris and ruin rained down trapping six \nmen, all of whom have remained missing since August 6.\n  As news began to travel regarding the collapse and the lives in \nperil, crews began working to somehow, some way, free the six men. As \none day turned into the next and hopes were lifted, just to sadly be \ndashed, one thing has remained constant: men and women from all walks \nof life have come together to fight for Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, \nLuis Hernandez, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, and Don Erickson.\n  The list is long and varied of the many who have sacrificed and given \ntheir time, knowledge, and resources to help in this tragedy. The list \nincludes officials from the Federal Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration; Murray Energy Corporation; the United States Air Force; \nUtah's Departments of Public Safety, Natural Resources and Human \nServices; the Utah Air National Guard; local, State and national \ngovernment; and last but perhaps most importantly of all the men, women \nand children living in the communities impacted by this tragedy.\n  As our State and Nation watched closely day after day for news of \nhope and rescue, we suffered another devastating blow the evening of \nAugust 16, 2007, when another seismic bump inside the mine buried \nrescue crews in coal and debris. As another new tragedy unfolded, many \nflew into action to now rescue the rescuers. People rushed to the scene \nto offer aid and valiantly try to save additional lives. Stories are \ntold of miners using their bare hands to dig out buried miners.\n  As we heard the news of first one rescuer's death, then another, and \nanother, it is difficult to describe the overwhelming sorrow and \ndisbelief Utahns felt at the deaths of those who had risked everything \nfor their co-workers, friends, and fellow miners.\n  Many were saved that evening, but sadly three lost their lives for \nothers.\n  Dale Black was in the mine desperately trying to reach his cousin, \nKerry Allred. In fact, he wasn't even supposed to have been in the mine \nthat evening. He had been promoted the day before and would now be \nassigned as a rescue manager, working outside the mine. However, as \nDale's brother Guy stated, ``That's Dale. He wouldn't have let his guys \ngo in without him.''\n  Gary Lynn ``Gibb'' Jensen from Redmond, UT, was an employee working \nfor MSHA who was no stranger to mining. He had been in the mining \nindustry in various capacities for 35 years and was described by others \nas someone who steered his career toward mine safety. He never \nhesitated to better the lives of his fellow ``coal'' miners.\n  And finally, Brandon Kimber, a father of a 5-year-old daughter and \ntwin 4-year-old boys. He was relatively new to the mining industry, \nonly working in the mines for 3\\1/2\\ years. He was described as an \nunselfish, wonderful man who never hesitated to help others.\n  Dale Black, Brandon Kimber, and Gary Jensen will long be remembered \nfor their selfless acts that day. These were three humble miners who \nare now three wonderful heroes.\n  As our State and Nation grapples with this tragedy and looks for \nanswers, I do not want us in our haste to solve this tragedy overlook \nthe contributions miners and the mining industry has made to America \nfor many, many years. We want to solve this tragedy, but we haven't \nbeen able to. The original six miners are still buried in the mine. We \nhope we can recover them.\n  Mining is a community, it is a brotherhood, and it helps fuel our \neconomy and growth. Generations of Utahns from many of our communities \nhave toiled in and helped propel the mining industry. Many men and \nwomen return home each evening with faces marred by coal dust, and \ntired bodies. However, to many Utahns mining is a way of life and their \ncontributions to this important industry must always be appreciated.\n  As I have traveled throughout our State and Nation, some of the most \nwonderful people I have met and talked with are miners. They are \nhumble, they work hard, and they display courage each day as they enter \nthe mines to make a living and support their families.\n  Throughout the communities bordering the Crandall Canyon Mine, you \ndon't need to travel far to see a sign, a t-shirt, or some other \ndisplay urging all to ``save our miners,'' ``pray for our miners,'' and \n``love our miners.'' I have witnessed first-hand the courage, \nfortitude, and heroism of many wonderful people to do all three save, \npray, and love our miners.\n  I have been saddened greatly by the events that have transpired in my \nhome state throughout the past several weeks. The Crandall Canyon Mine \ncollapse and tragedy will forever be remembered for the grief we shared \nas a State, and the valiant, and courageous efforts displayed by many. \nIn the depths of this tragedy heroes emerged, and our faith in the \nhuman spirit lives on through the sacrifices made by many to comfort, \nand save the lives of others.\n  Senator Bennett and I have introduced this resolution which has been \nagreed to, honoring the sacrifice of the miners and rescue workers and \nexpressing the condolences of the Senate and our Nation to their \nfamilies.\n  I have been almost blown away by the kindness of our fellow Utahns \nand the courage and strength of those who have tried to save these \nminers. I have appreciated the leadership of the mayors of both \nHuntington and Price who have stood so valiantly as rocks against the \npain and suffering these good people have suffered. I am so grateful to \nknow these people. My heart goes out to the families of these miners \nand, of course, their children. I hope and pray that somehow we can do \na lasting memorial for these folks who have died and who have worked so \nhard to try and support their families. I was happy to urge our \ncolleagues to support this resolution, and I appreciate their support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague for the \nthorough and sensitive way in which he has described this Senate \ntribute to the families and the coworkers of the miners who were killed \nin the Crandall Canyon mine disaster.\n  I was there the day after the mine collapsed. The Governor was there \nas well. Senator Hatch was on his way and joined us later. We welcomed \nthe assistant Secretary of Labor to Utah, and we examined with \nsoberness and concern the facts surrounding the situation. We were not \nsure whether the miners had survived. There were reservations from \nthose who were experienced with these kinds of mine problems. They were \nafraid the miners had, in fact, been killed in the initial blast. But \nwe all held out hopes that they could survive, and efforts were \nundertaken to determine whether they were alive.\n  To show the ruggedness of the territory, there was no way to drill a \nsignificant hole into the mine immediately because there was no road up \nto the top of the mountain where the drill would have to be placed. So \na smaller drill was brought in by helicopter and drilled a 2\\1/2\\ inch \nhole through roughly 1,200 feet in an attempt to find out whether we \ncould make contact with any survivors who might be there. A road was \nbuilt, a larger drill was brought in and followed the 2\\1/2\\ inch hole \nwith an 8\\1/2\\ inch hole. Neither one produced any tangible evidence \nthat the miners had survived.\n  In the briefings we had from the experts onsite, we discussed what \nmight be done further besides drilling the holes. They talked about the \ndangers connected with trying to dig into where the miners were. It was \nunderstood there would be no further attempt in terms of digging in \nuntil the seismic activity in the mountain had stopped. The mountain \nwould continue to shift, and as it was shifting, the experts said: We \nwill not undertake any attempt at further rescue.\n  I subsequently learned they did make an attempt while the mountain \nwas shifting. It was not a reckless attempt, although it was a heroic \nattempt. They believed they had sufficient protection from the rescue \nworkers that they could get somewhere near where the miners had been \ntrapped and find out if they were still alive, even while the mountain \nwas still shifting. They applied fully known and reliable means of \nprotection for the rescuers, and then the second tragedy occurred. Even \nwith\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nthis protection, the rescuers themselves were caught by a seismic shift \nin the mountain, and two more miners and one mine inspector were \nkilled, bringing the tragic total to nine. More holes were drilled. \nMore attempts were made to find out what could be found. But the \nmountain had claimed its nine lives and still has not yielded any of \nthose bodies.\n  This double tragedy has united the mine community in Utah in the ways \nSenator Hatch has described. And throughout the State of Utah, far away \nfrom the minefields, flags were flown at half staff as the people of \nour State joined together in mourning for those who had lost their \nlives in this tragic accident. Hearings have been held. We hope to \nlearn as much as we possibly can, to continue to work as hard as we can \nas a nation to see that the deaths in the mining world continue to \ndecrease, but we recognize that whatever satisfaction we take from the \nfact that mining deaths have decreased over the decades, that still \ndoes not lessen the tragedy for those loved ones and coworkers who have \nseen this kind of death occur.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Hatch in cosponsoring \nthis resolution and I thank the Senate for its unanimous support of the \nresolution and extend, once again, my personal condolences and \nsympathies for all of those who are personally touched by the tragedy.\n  We must, as a Congress, do everything we can to see that this kind of \ntragedy is reduced to the point where, ultimately, it ceases to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11304-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to make note of an event that the \nnewspapers have talked about and then passed over, but one we should \npay a great deal more attention to. This has to do with the number of \nincreasing cyber attacks that have occurred where hackers have gotten \ninto computers and upset their ability to function. I am not talking \nabout the kind of hackers who break into a computer to leave behind an \nobscene message simply to demonstrate that they could do it. These are \namateurs. I am talking about attacks that appear to be state sponsored.\n  The Nation of Estonia had its computers shut down for a period of a \nweek, unable to perform any kind of connection with the outside world, \nalmost as if it were a test on the part of some nation state to \ndetermine whether they could perform this kind of activity. Now we have \nhad further demonstrations of their ability to do it in government \ncomputers. This has been going on for years. I remember, when I was \nconnected with the Y2K issue as chairman of the Senate's committee on \nthat problem, going over to the Pentagon and standing in the room where \nwe watched the cyber attacks come in. The officials in the Pentagon \nwould identify for me the countries from which they were coming. They \nwould say: Those are attacks coming from the Philippines. Those are \nattacks, probing, trying to get into our computers. They come from \nSouth Korea. These are coming from whatever other country. That does \nnot mean the attacks originated in any of those countries. It is \nentirely possible in today's world for someone to have a sophisticated \ncomputer attack in one nation and route the attacks through a second or \neven third or fourth nation as cutouts so the victim of the attack will \nnot be able to know the original source.\n  The recent attacks that have occurred against our Government \ncomputers clearly come from a higher level of sophistication than those \nI saw 3 or 4 years ago.\n  I pursued an interest in this issue and then became consumed with \nother Senate business--that happens to us--and said, a few years later: \nI probably need to check into this to see what has happened. So I went \nback to the National Security Agency, I went back to the Pentagon, I \nmade contact again with people at the CIA and said: What is going on in \nthe world of cyberattacks and cyberterrorism?\n  I was startled that everything had progressed two, three, four, five \ngenerations beyond what it had been just a few years before. It is a \nclassic sword-and-shield confrontation. The attack comes--representing \nthe sword--we create firewalls--representing the shield--and then a new \nsword is invented and a new shield is called for. This game has been \ngoing on now to an escalated level where now we are seeing \nsophisticated nation state-sponsored attacks, and they break through \noccasionally, and they get a little space in the newspaper and maybe a \nmention on the evening news, and then we go about business as usual.\n  I am as guilty as anyone else of going about business as usual. I \nwant to get back into this issue, dig a little deeper, and find out \nwhat is going on because eventually this will be the ultimate \nbattlefield. Eventually, the people who wish this country ill will not \ncome at us with tanks and aircraft carriers or cruise missiles; they \nwill come at our computers. Our military is the most sophisticated in \nthe world, but if you shut down their ability to communicate through \nsatellites and by computers, our military becomes crippled and \nimpotent. I remember when I went through basic training being told that \nan army has to do three things: It has to move, shoot, and communicate. \nThose who are mounting these cyberattacks are developing the capability \nto prevent us from communicating. We need to spend more time and effort \nlooking at this issue.\n  I have one suggestion for the executive branch. During the Clinton \nadministration, the highest official dealing with this issue was in the \nWhite House. After President Bush became the President, that official \nreported to Condoleezza Rice in her role as National Security Adviser. \nI sat down with Condoleezza Rice to talk about this issue, to try to \nbring her up to date on what I thought was important. She was very \npolite, but I became quickly aware she knew more about this issue than \nI did. She was not patronizing about it, but she was up to speed and up \nto date on it, and I felt reassured that the White House had that level \nof understanding.\n  Well, she has now gone on to other duties, and the highest official \nnow is in the Department of Homeland Security. I am not sure that is \nthe place where it needs to be. It may very well be that it needs to go \nback into the White House at the high level it held at one point in the \npast.\n  I will be discussing this and other issues relating to this question \nin the months to come. I appreciate the opportunity of alerting my \nfellow Senators to this very important but often overlooked issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I believe I have filed the amendment. It is an amendment \nthat deals with Mexican trucks. I wish to offer it at this point on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Specter from Pennsylvania and other \ncosponsors. It is amendment No. 2797.\n  I ask that we consider that amendment. I believe there is no \namendment pending at the moment, so I do not need consent to set an \namendment aside. I ask for the immediate consideration of the amendment \nI just described.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Specter, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2797.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the establishment of a program that allows \n Mexican truck drivers to operate beyond the commercial zones near the \n                            Mexican border)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be used to establish a cross-border motor carrier \n     demonstration program to allow Mexico-domiciled motor \n     carriers to operate beyond the commercial zones along the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, I am offering the \namendment on behalf of myself, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, and \nothers. I believe my colleague, the chairman of the subcommittee, is \nworking with the ranking member of the subcommittee for a time \nagreement. I don't believe a time agreement exists at this point.\n  With consent, I ask that Senator Specter from Pennsylvania be \nrecognized. He has a time commitment. He was asking to be recognized \nnow. I previously said a few words about this amendment. I will speak \nabout it in greater detail in a bit. I ask unanimous consent for \nSenator Specter to be recognized for as much time as he may consume. If \nhe is not ready, Mr. President, I will continue for just a moment to \ndescribe the amendment.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague from the State of \nWashington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask if we could set up a time agreement \non this amendment so Members know when the vote is going to occur \ntonight. I ask unanimous consent for 60 minutes of debate prior to the \nvote; that no second-degree amendment be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote; that the time be equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, I regret we have not been \nable to clear this request on this side. As much as we would like to, I \nhave to object at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to recognize my colleague from \nPennsylvania in a moment, but let me describe very briefly what this \namendment is.\n  Over this past weekend, a pilot project was initiated by the \nDepartment of Transportation dealing with long-haul Mexican trucks \ncoming into this country. My contention is, and I think it is \nbuttressed by the inspector general's report that was issued on this \nsubject, that they are nowhere near having the information that would \ngive them the opportunity to initiate long-haul Mexican trucks coming \ninto this country. We have, since the advent of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, allowed Mexican trucks to come in within a 25-mile \nradius of the Mexican border.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for a brief \nstatement to the Senate?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, based on my conversation with the Republican \nleader, there will be no vote on this amendment this afternoon. That \nbeing the case, I think it is a fair statement to say there will be no \nmore votes today. I had indicated already we would not have any votes \nafter 5 or 5:30 today. We have at least an hour's debate on this, and \nthe Republican leader said we would not vote on this amendment today.\n  This means we will have votes in the morning, unless there is \nsomething untoward. So everyone should understand we will have votes in \nthe morning, we will have our caucuses between midday, and there is a \nWhite House meeting, I know for a few people, but that doesn't mean we \ncould not go forward tomorrow. But we have a lot of work to do on this \nbill. It is to the Senate's advantage to finish this bill this week. \nThat would mean we will have finished one-third of our appropriations \nbills, if we finish this bill.\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\n  In my brief conversation in the well with a number of Senators a few \nminutes ago, we have Senators wanting to move the Labor-HHS bill and \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Those are my only two \nconversations today. We, of course, have to deal with the Defense \nAppropriations bill in the near future. So the sooner we finish this \nbill, the better off we will be. There is a lot of work that needs to \nbe done before the end of the fiscal year, which is in a few weeks. I \nhope everyone understands that if we are going to maintain some degree \nof financial integrity, we are going to have to finish these \nappropriations bills. The Republican leader has told me on more than \none occasion that the minority is interested in finishing the \nappropriations bills, and we have had some good cooperation in the last \nseveral weeks. So I do hope we can finish this bill.\n  There will be votes more than likely in the morning, though.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again, this is an amendment that deals \nwith the issue of a pilot project on long-haul trucking into this \ncountry. The House of Representatives has already passed a piece of \nlegislation that would prohibit that pilot project, and this amendment \nwould do the same for the Senate.\n  I will describe in some detail the reasons for the amendment, but I \nam pleased a cosponsor, Senator Specter, wishes to make a statement. I \nknow he has a time constraint, so I will relinquish the floor so \nSenator Specter can make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Louisiana has \nasked for 2 minutes to precede my comments, and I am prepared to yield \nto her for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for yielding \nbecause of time constraints.\n  I came to the floor to thank Senator Murray for her extraordinary \nwork on the bridge replacement amendment and for the colleagues--60--\nwho joined her in supporting this amendment. It is important to all of \nour States, but particularly for Louisiana, that is struggling, like so \nmany of our other States are, to find funding for critical \ninfrastructure. We, of course, 2 years ago, had the collapse of an \ninfrastructure, of our levees. We have great impacts on many of our \nhighways. Of course, the collapse of the bridge in Minnesota has caused \nus all to refocus on the importance of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I will submit my longer statement for the Record, but \nwe have over 4,000 bridges in the State of Louisiana alone, that is \nincluding overpasses over highways. Nearly 30 percent of the total are \ncategorized as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. In \nfact, one of the bridges I have outlined in my statement is the Red \nRiver Bridge that was built in 1936. It alone will cost $100 million. \nThis U.S. 71/165 bridge is in a very small parish in Louisiana. We are \nstraddling the great Mississippi River, and it causes a great deal of \nstrain on some of our poorer parishes that need to find ways to cross \nbut have very little capacity.\n  The backlog of bridge replacement needs for bridges that are either \nstructurally or functionally deficient and have a sufficiency rating of \nless than 50 in Louisiana is $2.1 billion. The I-35 West Bridge in \nMinneapolis was given a sufficiency rating of 50 in 2005.\n  A total of almost 4,000 bridges, or nearly 30 percent, of the total \nbridges in Louisiana are categorized as either ``structurally \ndeficient'' or ``functionally obsolete.''\n  If all bridges categorized as ``structurally deficient'' or \n``functionally obsolete'' in Louisiana were to be replaced, the total \nprojected cost would be more than $10.5 billion today, not fully \nincluding other costs such as rights of way, engineering or utilities.\n  Louisiana is not unlike most other states with a backlog of \ntransportation projects. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and \nDevelopment alone has a total transportation backlog of over $14 \nbillion. The funding in this amendment will help address a critical \npiece of that backlog by providing additional funds for bridges in the \nState.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator Murray and \nthis critical amendment for our Nation's bridge infrastructure.\n  Specific examples in Louisiana are:\n  The I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles, built in 1952, is \nnow functionally obsolete, with additional capacity needed in the \ncorridor and estimated replacement cost several times the current \nannual funding of the entire bridge replacement program. This bridge is \nnationally significant because it is part of Interstate 10, a \n``Corridor of the Future'' as designated by the Department of \nTransportation.\n  The Red River Bridge at Fort Buhlow, US 71/165, built in 1936, is \nstructurally deficient and functionally obsolete, with an estimated \nreplacement cost of greater than $100 million, a significant portion of \nour current annual funding of the entire bridge replacement program.\n  I thank Senator Murray, and my colleagues for yielding before we go \non to the next debate, which is on trucks and trucking, and I am happy \nto cosponsor their amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 10, 2007.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Your inquiry regarding the condition \n     of bridges in Louisiana, comes at a time where the citizenry \n     and leadership in this State have recognized the criticality \n     of our infrastructure and have opened a serious discussion of \n     the needs for better roads and bridges, especially the types \n     of funding levels which are needed to make improvements to \n     our overall transportation systems. We welcome the \n     opportunity to provide you the information you require to \n     assist in your capacity as a member of the United States \n     Senate.\n       This letter and attachment should provide answer to help in \n     preparation of remarks for the floor. It includes information \n     pertinent to our bridge programs, current status of our \n     bridge system and important nomenclature and rationale for \n     the replacement, rehabilitation and repair of our critical \n     infrastructure.\n       The backlog of bridge replacement needs in Louisiana is \n     $2.1 billion. These are bridges that qualify for federal \n     bridge replacement funds. They are either structurally or \n     functionally deficient, and have a sufficiency rating of less \n     than 50 (on a scale of 1-100).\n       If there was $1 billion additional bridge funds nationwide, \n     that would only equate to approx. $20 million +/- for each \n     state on average. That would only address about 1% of our \n     needs.\n       As a starting point for this discussion, we would like to \n     assure a common understanding of the utilization of the terms \n     ``structurally deficient'' and ``functionally obsolete''. \n     These phrases portray a dire description of a structure which \n     is normally unwarranted, as they are specifically used to \n     define structures as qualifying for rehabilitation or \n     replacement based on structural repair and traffic safety \n     related needs, respectively. For federal bridge funding to be \n     distributed in accordance with the regulations, bridges must \n     be so defined to qualify for this funding. Using these terms \n     literally generally causes trepidation amongst motorists \n     regarding specific bridges which are quite able to safely \n     carry traffic.\n       We trust that this reply provides information which will \n     assist you in your upcoming committee hearings. As always, if \n     I may be of further service in this matter, please notify me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Johnny Bradberry,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n                The Federal Bridge Program in Louisiana\n\n       The Highway Bridge Program in the DOTD is separated into \n     three distinct subsets: Bridge Preservation On-System, Bridge \n     Preservation Off-System and Bridge Preventative Maintenance. \n     Bridge Preservation On-System projects are selected based on \n     eligibility for funding, District priorities and additional \n     factors such as truck routes, average daily traffic, route \n     continuity, structure age, material and condition, crash \n     data, construction cost estimate, constructability and \n     available program funds. Rehabilitation and replacement under \n     this program require that the structure meet current \n     standards when construction is complete. Funding of this \n     program has historically been $60 million to $73 million per \n     year until last year, prior to the collapse of the I-35 West \n     Bridge in Minneapolis, when a decision was made to fund the \n     program starting in FY 07-08 at $125 million for at least the \n     next 5 years.\n       The Bridge Preservation Off-System projects are selected \n     based on eligibility for funding and availability of funds, \n     utilizing similar methodology as with the Bridge Preservation \n     On-System Program. Local governments are allowed to \n     prioritize the projects in their parishes in order to meet \n     their specific needs and priorities. Program funding has \n     historically been $13 million to $15 million per year and is \n     limited by the amount of funding allocated in capital outlay \n     to match the federal funds.\n       The Preventative Maintenance Program, which allows us to \n     repair rather than replace\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n     or rehabilitate structures, is currently funded at $3 \n     million. The primary difference between this program and the \n     aforementioned programs is that funds are allowed to go \n     towards maintenance work that prevents the structure from \n     deteriorating, provided an approved systematic approach is \n     used to select projects. This maintenance work does not \n     follow the caveat that the structure be constructed to \n     current standards, allowing us to more economically repair \n     structures in limited specific cases.\n       The term ``Structurally Deficient'' is used to identify \n     structures that could qualify for rehabilitation or \n     replacement because of structural-related problems. Such a \n     problem could include a particularly low rating of a bridge \n     deck, superstructure or substructure element (girder, pier, \n     etc.). This does not amount to a declaration that the bridge \n     is unsafe, just an indication that the bridge could qualify \n     for federal bridge funding for rehabilitation or replacement.\n       The term ``Functionally Obsolete'' is used to identify \n     elements of the structure which are not currently up to \n     current standards. A bridge over an Interstate highway with \n     15 feet of vertical clearance is obsolete by AASHTO \n     standards, but may service quite well. Another example is an \n     Interstate Highway bridge with 4-foot outside shoulders; \n     again, full shoulders are not provided, but the bridge \n     functions quite well.\n       The term ``Sufficiency Rating'' is a way of evaluating a \n     bridge, based on a structural inventory of the bridge's \n     geometry, clearances, load rating, traffic and other \n     criteria. It is a score from 0 (completely deficient) to 100 \n     (totally sufficient). Bridges with a sufficiency rating of \n     50-80 qualify for rehabilitation under Federal funding \n     regulations, while a rating of 50 or less qualifies a bridge \n     for replacement.\n       The table below demonstrates the status of Bridges \n     Categorized ``Structurally Deficient'' or ``Functionally \n     Obsolete''.\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Bridges       Bridges                               Replacement/\n                                                            Total    Categorized   Categorized     Bridges      Bridges   Rehabilitation   Replacement/\n                         Program                           Number   Structurally  Functionally      Under      Currently       Cost       Rehabilitation\n                                                             of       Deficient     Obsolete    Construction  Programmed    (Currently     Value (All SD\n                                                           Bridges      (SD)          (FO)                                  Programmed)   or FO Bridges)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn-System...............................................      7694         664          1562           124          304         $1.003 B        $6.185 B\nOff-System..............................................      5259        1071           645            51          328            189 M         4.370 B\n    Total...............................................     13223        1735          2207           175          632          1.192 B        10.555 B\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       A total of 3942, or nearly 30%, of the total bridges in \n     Louisiana are categorized as either ``structurally \n     deficient'' or ``functionally obsolete''. There are currently \n     175 bridges currently being rehabilitated or replaced and \n     under construction. There are 632 bridges currently \n     programmed for rehabilitation or replacement within our 6-\n     year program with a replacement cost of $1.192 Billion; the \n     figure in the table for on-system bridges ($1.003 Billion) \n     includes estimates of real estate acquisition, engineering \n     and utility relocation. If all bridges categorized as \n     ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally obsolete'' were \n     to be replaced, the total projected cost would be $10.555 \n     Billion today, not fully including other costs such as real \n     estate, engineering or utilities.\n       There are currently 202 bridges closed which are classified \n     either ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally \n     obsolete''. Of these closed bridges, 199 (12 on-system, 187 \n     off-system) are classified as ``structurally deficient'' and \n     3 (all off-system) are classified as ``functionally \n     obsolete''. Of this total, 86 (1 on-system and 85 off-system) \n     are currently not programmed for rehabilitation or \n     replacement. It should be noted that these numbers do not \n     include detour bridges for bridges in these categories \n     currently under construction, which are considered ``open'' \n     to traffic.\n       Based on the funding limitations and other programmatic \n     restrictions as regards the federal bridge program, there are \n     several bridge projects which we need to point out as \n     problematic in their implementation:\n       I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles, built in 1952, \n     functionally obsolete (narrow shoulders) and additional \n     capacity needed in the corridor, estimated replacement cost \n     several times the current annual funding of the entire bridge \n     replacement program.\n       I-310 Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge in Luling, built in 1984, \n     does not qualify based on sufficiency rating, though it has \n     fallen significantly in a short period of time, need to \n     replace cables ($30 million), does not fit into program well.\n       Red River Bridge at Fort Buhlow, US 71/165, built in 1936, \n     structurally deficient and functionally obsolete, estimated \n     replacement cost (greater than $100 million) a significant \n     portion of our current annual funding of the entire bridge \n     replacement program.\n       US 190 Mississippi River Bridge at Baton Rouge, built in \n     1940, preventative maintenance required--cleaning and \n     painting ($68 million) to preserve structure from further \n     deterioration and to protect investment to widen roadway \n     (1989).\n       Consequently, it is very difficult to provide to you a list \n     of specific structures most in need of replacement or \n     rehabilitation. There are numerous considerations we make in \n     the programming of bridges for replacement, rehabilitation or \n     repair, including eligibility for funding, District \n     priorities and additional factors such as truck routes, \n     average daily traffic, route continuity, structure age, \n     material and condition, crash data, construction cost \n     estimate, constructability and available program funds. \n     However, the list above is illustrative of projects which are \n     problematic to fit into the existing bridge program, though \n     it is clear that repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction is \n     needed on these structures immediately.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am cosponsoring the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from North Dakota because I believe there \nare very serious safety issues involved here which have not been \nanswered sufficiently by the Department of Transportation.\n  Here we have a situation where the Secretary of Transportation \nannounced a pilot program on February 23 of this year to allow up to \n100 Mexican trucking companies to ship goods to and from the United \nStates. The Iraq supplemental appropriations bill delayed \nimplementation of this program until there was a report by the \ninspector general and a response by the Department of Transportation. \nThe inspector general released his report and the Department of \nTransportation submitted responses on the same day--on September 6. As \nI read these documents, it is insufficient to have the requisite \nguarantees of safety. And of no little concern to me is that all of \nthis should be done on the same day, without taking into account some \nvery serious underlying problems.\n  There are safety concerns here which include the database \ndeficiencies that prevent the Department of Transportation inspectors \nfrom being able to accurately gather information on truckdriver \nconvictions and driving violations, vehicle accident reports, and \ninsurance records. The inspector general confirms that these databases \nare still under development. The Department of Transportation report \ndoes not respond to these issues.\n  The inspector general report also states that the Department of \nTransportation has not developed and implemented adequate plans for \nchecking trucks and drivers participating in the demonstration project \nas they cross the border. The DOT report responded by stating they \ncreated border-crossing plans with the U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection. Well, that is hardly an assurance of safety.\n  We do want to have good relations with Mexico. We do not want to \nimpede legitimate commerce. But safety is a very vital factor, and \nthere are good reasons to insist on safety and verification before we \npermit this pilot program with 100 trucking companies, which we can \nobviously expect to be supplemented in a very substantial number. When \nyou are dealing with issues on truckdriver convictions and driving \nviolations and vehicle accident reports, you are talking about \nsomething which is very probative on whether it is a safe program. When \nyou are talking about insurance records, those are necessary in order \nto be sure that if there are accidents, and there is liability, there \nis adequate insurance to protect Americans from these trucks which are \ncoming into our country.\n  We have had a fair amount of experience here. I believe there is \nample time to reevaluate this program if and when this database is \nupdated and there is sufficient record documentation to guarantee the \nrequisite safety. But on this date of the record, it seems to me this \nprogram ought not to go forward, and the amendment which Senator Dorgan \nhas advanced is very sound. I\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nintend to support it and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for yielding me \ntime at this stage of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. \nThe statements he made represent the crux of the matter, the issue of: \nAre there equivalent standards and is there equivalent enforcement with \nrespect to trucking in Mexico, and would that then allow us to feel \nassured that long-haul Mexican trucks entering this country all across \nthe United States would give us the same notion of safety we have with \nrespect to the kinds of restrictions, the kinds of regulations we have \nin the United States?\n  Mr. President, I am going to get some charts I will make a \npresentation with in a couple of moments. It will take me a minute to \nget the charts I want to show my colleagues.\n  Let me, for the moment, suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Pennsylvania said it \nwell, I believe. Look, Mexico is a neighbor of ours to the South. We \ndon't come to the floor, none of us would come to the floor of the \nSenate, under any condition, whether it is a trade debate or a debate \nabout Mexican trucking, in a way that is pejorative with respect to our \nneighbor. But it is important to understand that we are two different \ncountries and, in many ways, have very different approaches to some of \nthese issues.\n  With respect to trucking, we have not previously allowed long-haul \nMexican trucking into this country. We have allowed a 25-mile \nperiphery, or 25-mile diameter from the border, but we have not allowed \nlong-haul trucking in this country from Mexico. The reason: There has \nnot been a demonstration that there are equivalent standards and \nequivalent enforcement with respect to Mexican trucks and U.S. trucks.\n  Now, we have built, over a long period of time, very significant and \nstiff requirements for long-haul trucks in this country. We require \ncertain things of drivers. There are hours of service they can't go \nbeyond, there are logbook requirements that are significant, there is \nequipment inspection that is very significant, there is reporting of \naccidents, and a whole series of things we have done in this country to \ntry to understand and make certain the trucking is safe. Are there \naccidents from time to time? Sure. But it is not because we don't have \nin place significant regulatory capability, and it is not because we \ndon't enforce it. We have regulations and we have enforcement.\n  Now, I want to show my colleagues what happened last Thursday night. \nLast Thursday night, at 7:30 in the evening, the Department of \nTransportation received what is called the Office of Inspector \nGeneral's Report. They have always wanted down at DOT to do a pilot \nprogram for long-haul Mexican trucks, but they have been prevented from \ndoing that because I and others put a provision in law that says you \ncan't proceed with this pilot project until you get the inspector \ngeneral's report and see what the situation is.\n  Well, they got it Thursday night. It is 42 pages. I have a copy of \nit, or we are getting a copy of it--42 pages. At 7:30 at night they \nreceived the inspector general's report, and at 8:30 at night they \ntriggered the pilot project.\n  I tell you what, I took Evelyn Woods' speed reading course in \ncollege. I remember taking that, and all of a sudden I was galloping \nalong. I started at about 300 words a minute and pretty soon I was \nreading at about 1,200 words per minute. It was remarkable. But that is \nnothing compared to what they do at the Department of Transportation, \napparently. This is speed reading par excellence. In 1 hour, they \ndigested the inspector general's conclusions in the inspector general's \nreport. Or maybe there is another answer. Maybe they had already \ndecided what they were going to do, and it didn't matter very much.\n  Let me tell you what the inspector general's report says. It says:\n\n       While Department of Transportation officials inspecting \n     Mexican truck companies took steps to verify the on-site \n     data, we noted that certain information was not available to \n     them.\n\n  What kind of information wasn't available? Well, little things, \napparently. They say:\n\n       Specifically, information pertaining to vehicle \n     inspections, accident reports, and driver violations.\n\n  Excuse me, I am sorry, that represents the entire guts of what you \nneed to know if you are going to assure the safety of the American \ndriver as we begin to see long-haul Mexican trucks coming into this \ncountry--vehicle inspections, accident reports, and driver violations.\n  Now, this morning I showed a news report of a tragic accident, an \nalmost unbelievable accident that happened in Mexico. It is \nheartbreaking to understand the consequences of this. Two trucks \ncollided. This is in today's paper. Two trucks collided. Thirty-seven \ndied and 150 were injured. There was a blast, because one of the trucks \nwas carrying explosives. This was in a mining area. One truck loaded \nwith explosives crashed into another. It caused a crater of 65 feet, \nwith 150 people injured and 37 people killed.\n  Now, I don't know the specifics of this. I am only saying that at a \ntime when we are speaking of safety issues, this was in the paper this \nmorning. My guess is when you move explosives around in this country, \nparticularly on our roads, we have very specific standards--vehicles in \nfront with warning signs, vehicles behind. My guess is--and I don't \nknow what those standards are--that we have very specific standards \nabout the conditions under which you would do that.\n  I don't know whether those standards exist in Mexico. I suspect we \nwill learn about that. But I think the questions of the maintenance of \nthe vehicles, these heavy, 18-wheel vehicles that come moving down our \nhighways, are very important questions. They are not resolved.\n  Let me go to page 2 of the inspector general's report. You don't have \nto go further than page 2. It says the following, that the Federal \nMotor Vehicle Group down at DOT ``agreed to develop a plan to check \nevery truck every time.''\n  So they are going to check every truck every time in this pilot \nprogram, and they have certified 100 trucking companies to be able to \ncome in, but the inspector general says, ``as of July, 2007,'' a month \nand a half ago, ``no coordinated site-specific plans to carry out such \nchecks were in place'' and they stated they would have the plans then \noutlined by August 22, but we have not received any outlines or \ncompleted plans. ``In our opinion,'' they say, ``not having site \nspecific plans developed and in place prior to initiating this project \nwill increase the risk that project participants will be able to avoid \nthe required checks.''\n  All of us have heard these things from the Federal agencies: Trust \nus; we are going to do it; we promise; we pledge. Somehow it does not \nget done.\n  We have an inspector general's report that came out on Thursday \nevening at 7:30, and on Thursday evening at 8:30 the Department of \nTransportation wanted to trigger this report.\n  I have found some things in this report that would give the \nDepartment some comfort. They are there. But you cannot avoid page 2. \nThat provides no comfort at all. They say they are going to inspect \nevery truck every time. They are not and cannot. You cannot avoid this: \nthat the only information they have is information that comes from the \ntrucking companies that wish to give it to them. Otherwise no \ninformation was available. No database was made available to them, and \nno information on these three critical issues: vehicle inspections, \naccident reports, and driver violations.\n  That is the ball game. So the U.S. House of Representatives has \nalready passed by voice vote a provision that says ``no money in this \nappropriations bill shall or can be used to continue this pilot \nproject.'' With my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and \nothers, I propose we do exactly the same thing. This amendment is \nidentical to that which the House has\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\npassed. It makes sense to me. Will there be, at some point, because we \nhave a trade agreement called NAFTA with Mexico, homogenization of \nrules and standards and so forth with respect to trucking? Maybe. Will \nat that point there be long-term trucking in this hemisphere from \nCanada to the United States to Mexico? Maybe. But there will not be, in \nmy judgment, until we are satisfied as a country that the standards and \nenforcement of those standards, which is the most important issue--the \nenforcement of those standards with respect to Mexican long-haul \ntrucking are at least equivalent to that which we have in this country.\n  When an American citizen pulls up at a four-way stop sign or drives \ndown a road, a two-lane or a four-lane road, it doesn't matter, and \ncomes next to an 18-wheel truck, I believe most of them want to be \nassured that the inspections on that vehicle, the requirements on that \ndriver, are the equivalent--if they are not from this country--are the \nequivalent to the standards we have already imposed.\n  When that is the case, I think the consumers, the drivers, the \nAmerican people will not have additional risk. Until that is the case \nthey most certainly will have additional risk.\n  Again, one can argue, I suppose--one can debate at great length this \nissue and talk about what has been done--the improvements, the \nprogress. But one cannot ignore the fact that what we know about \nMexican trucking with respect to vehicle inspections, with respect to \ndrivers' records and accident reports, we are getting only from \nvoluntary compliance from those companies that wish to provide it. That \nis the case.\n  My amendment is very simple. I have more to say, but I think there \nare others who wish to speak. I will defer to them and then speak \nfollowing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am under no illusion that I can change the \nmind of my good friend from North Dakota, but maybe I can ease his \nconcerns, at least in several areas, because he did raise some things \nthat I think should be noted.\n  Prior to 1982, Mexican trucks did operate throughout the United \nStates without restriction. Since then, Canadian trucks have continued \nto operate through the United States. Surprisingly, even some of the \nMexican carriers who were authorized to operate beyond the commercial \nzones in 1982 have continued to operate in the United States. As best \nwe can tell, they have as good a safety record as the U.S. drivers. \nBut, obviously, there are lots of arguments in terms of efficiency, in \nterms of commitments made under the North American Free Trade Agreement \nfor carrying this out. But I want to focus just a minute on a couple of \nitems of concern about meeting safety standards.\n  Mexican trucking companies, drivers, and vehicles participating in \nthe demonstration program have to abide by stricter safety standards \nthan U.S. and Canadian trucking companies, drivers, and vehicles \noperating in the United States. These safety standards include they \nhave to have a U.S.-based insurance policy, full compliance with hours \nof service regulations, vehicle maintenance, driver qualifications, \nincluding the ability to communicate in English, and drug and alcohol \ntesting. Every carrier satisfactorily completing the test has to have \nits drivers drug tested by U.S. labs.\n  In addition, as many of us would be concerned about the tremendous \naccident with hazardous materials, these carriers are prohibited from \ntransporting hazardous materials in the United States. They cannot \ntransport passengers, and they cannot pick up domestic freight going \nfrom point to point.\n\n  Every Mexican truck participating in the program has to pass a \nrigorous 39-point, front-to-back inspection and is required to display \na valid Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance--CVSA--inspection decal that \nindicates it has passed this inspection. The decals are valid only for \n3 months and can be renewed only by passing another inspection.\n  As far as who is going to verify that the trucks are following U.S. \nregulations, U.S. Federal inspectors perform, and Mexican trucking \ncompanies must pass, a preauthorization safety audit to get into the \nprogram, conducted in Mexico prior to granting the authority to operate \nbeyond U.S. commercial zones.\n  The audit includes inspections of vehicles the company intends to use \nin long-haul operations in the United States and a thorough inspection \nof the company's records to ensure compliance with Federal safety \nregulations. Vehicles not inspected by the U.S. Federal inspectors \ncannot be used for long-haul operations in the United States.\n  Every inspector reviews Federal safety regulations with the carrier, \nincluding those concerning driver hours of service, to ensure the \ncarrier is knowledgeable of and comprehends the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Regulations.\n  All the motor vehicles and drivers in the cross-border demonstration \nprogram will be subject to roadside inspections, just like U.S. and \nCanadian vehicles and drivers, and will be placed out of service, as \nany carrier would be, if they fail critical portions of the inspection.\n  I thought that might be of some comfort to my colleague who raised \nquestions about safety inspections. I suggest that be taken into \nconsideration as we review the appropriateness of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to wind the clock back to 1994. \nI had the occasion of voting twice against NAFTA, once when I was in \nthe House and once when I was in the Senate, in the same year because I \ncame in in a special election. I remember at that time we had a \ndelegation of six, four House Members and two Senators from Oklahoma, \nand I was the only one out of six who voted against NAFTA.\n  Ironically, the very arguments I made in the House and Senate back in \n1994 are the same things we are hearing now. I said at that time I \ncould see what was going to be happening in the future; that we would \nbe having Mexican truckers coming in; that they would be competing in a \nway where they would not have to qualify with all of our environmental \nstandards, our safety standards, our wage and hour standards. It \nappears to me that is the case.\n  I listened very carefully to my good friend from Missouri, but I have \nnot seen--and having reviewed the IG report--that all of these \nquestions have been answered. I have to say I am inclined to agree with \nthe Senator from North Dakota that the problem that existed in 1994 \nstill exists today, and I would probably oppose this amendment.\n  I would like to also make a comment, a request. When I have a chance, \nafter the disposition of this, I would like to bring up amendment No. \n2796 for its immediate consideration. I will wait and see if I can get \nin the queue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I think \nit is the case that the Department of Transportation--and I think this \nis true under most administrations--that whatever they want to do they \nwill give you words of assurance that whatever they want to do they \nwill do it right and make sure all the t's are crossed and the i's are \ndotted, but it is the case that the inspector general describes for us \nwhat the Department of Transportation says it will do, it is not doing.\n  We do not have to debate that. It is a circumstance--let me go back \nto this chart, if I might, to describe what the inspector general says.\n  It seems to me the key issue, as my colleague from Oklahoma suggests, \nif we have long-haul Mexican trucks on the roads in this country, the \nquestion is, when you are driving beside one or coming to a four-way \nstop and meeting one, does that 18-wheel truck have the same vehicle \ninspection, the same level of safety? Does the driver have the same \nhours of service, the same requirements that our drivers do? Do we have \nthe same accident record and reports on that driver?\n  The answer is no. So that in itself obliterates the question of are \nwe ready to integrate that Mexican long-haul trucking experience into \nthis country.\n  It is true the Canadians are here. We have similar, nearly equivalent \nstandards and enforcement with respect to\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\nCanada. Of course, an added issue with respect to Mexico is the \nlanguage issue, and there is an English requirement. But the Department \nof Transportation folks, who really do this sort of thing, kind of roll \ntheir eyes, saying: That is fairly hard to enforce.\n  But I do want to make this point. What the inspector general's report \nsays, on two pieces--No. 1, on page 2, again, he said ``DOT said they \nwill check every truck every time.'' That is part of the assurance.\n\n       [B]ut in July 2007, no coordinated site-specific plans to \n     carry out such checks were in place.\n       FMCSA stated that it would have plans outlined by August \n     22, 2007, but [the inspector general said] we have not \n     received any outlines or completed plans. In our opinion, not \n     having site-specific plans developed and in place prior to \n     initiating the demonstration project will increase the risk \n     that project participants will be able to avoid the required \n     checks.\n\n  That is the dilemma.\n  Also, in addition to that, the inspector general says:\n\n       The DOT officials inspecting Mexican truck companies took \n     steps to verify the on-site data. We noted that certain \n     information was not available to them. Specifically, \n     information pertaining to vehicle inspections, accident \n     reports, and driver violations--\n\n  That is the ball game. If you do not have those, you don't have a \nbase of information on which to make a judgment that this is going to \nbe safe for the American people.\n  My point is we have developed certain standards in this country. I \nknow in some cases we have developed those standards after great \ndebate. They represent regulations, and no one likes regulations. But \nin many cases these regulations are necessary in order to assure us of \nthe kind of safety we would expect on the roads. We license drivers, we \ninspect trucks, and require certain things of trucks. We have certain \nstandards which you are required to meet when you haul certain kinds of \nproducts. We do all those things.\n  Is it perfect? No, not at all. But are they standards we understand, \nand are they standards we try to enforce in every case in every State? \nThey are. Sometimes we make mistakes, sometimes the enforcement fails a \nbit, but that is a very different set of circumstances than trying to \nintegrate that system with a country that while it has standards, does \nnot have the same kind of enforcement.\n  You do not have to take it from me, there are volumes of testimony in \nthe Congress from previous hearings about the circumstances of the lack \nof enforcement of these standards in Mexico.\n  Now, when these issues are resolved, you will not have amendments \nsuch as this on the floor of the Senate. But I do not see them resolved \nany time soon. I think the inspector general's report itself says they \nare not resolved. When you say, as they have said in the report \nreleased last Thursday night, the only information available was in the \ncompany records when the records were volunteered to them, otherwise \nthere is no base of information.\n  There is no base of data with which to judge these central questions: \nAre the trucks safe? Is the inspection standard rigorous? Does it meet \nanything near our standard? Do we have drivers who are going to enter \nthis country with the same rigorous requirement with respect to hours \nof service, recordkeeping, logbooks, accident reports, all of those \nissues? The answer to that is no. It is clearly no.\n  The answer to that is embedded in the inspector general's report. I, \nfor the life of me, do not understand why, before the ink was dry \nThursday night, 1 hour later the Department of Transportation decided \nwe have to now have assimilated, apparently through some kind of speed \nreading of this IG's report, we now have to implemented this program \nwhich the House of Representatives, by voice vote, said: No funds \nshould be allowed to be used for the program for the reasons I have \ndescribed. I believe the Senate should take similar action.\n  Finally, let me say this, I tried to say it earlier: Mexico is a \nneighbor of ours. Always we should treat neighbors with respect. We \nhave a lot of things we do with Mexico. There are many areas in which \nwe cooperate and agree. We have a trade agreement. I happen to agree \nwith my colleague from Oklahoma. I did not vote for the trade agreement \neither. I think the trade agreement has been a horrible mistake.\n  I am talking about NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. We \nturned a very small surplus with Mexico into a very large trade deficit \nwith Mexico. We turned a moderate trade deficit with Canada into a very \nlarge trade deficit. So by any standard I think this has been a \nfailure.\n  But aside from the fact it is a failure, it does have a requirement \nto homogenize the standards and the ability to allow long-haul trucking \ninto this country; but it does not do so in a way that allows us or \nrequires us to obliterate our determination for what is safe for \nAmerican drivers. That is why I am on the floor of the Senate hoping we \nwill do what the House of Representatives has already done by voice \nvote and pass this amendment.\n  It will come back. There will be another day. There will be a time, \nmy guess is, when there will not be objection to this because the \nstandards are homogeneous, the standards Americans have are the same \nand the enforcement is reasonable. We believe the enforcement to be \nsignificant enough to provide significant safety without additional \nrisks to American drivers. That is not the case today.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BOND. Through the Chair, I would ask my colleague if he wants to \napply these same standards to Canadian truckers. Because it is my \ninformation, I do not have it documented, that the standards required \nof Canadian truckers are less than the standards required of Mexican \ntruckers. The Canadian truckers coming into the United States, into \nNorth Dakota and beyond, do not have to have U.S. insurance.\n  I would ask my colleague if he is concerned about the Canadian trucks \ncoming in as well and what he plans to do about those.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, it is interesting to me in trade discussions. For \nexample, Mexico has pretty decent environmental standards. Someone \nsaid: Well, you have big environmental standards in Mexico. Yes, the \nproblem is they are not enforced at all.\n  So it doesn't matter to me what the standards required are, that is \nwhy I have emphasized enforcement. What are the standards and are the \nstandards enforced? In most cases the answer is, with respect to \nMexico, they are not enforced to the same degree we enforce the \nstandards in this country.\n  I do not believe you can make the case that there is similarity \nbetween the Canadian enforcement of good standards with respect to \ntruck safety and the Mexican lack--I don't think you can make the same \ncase it exists in identical fashion with Canada or Mexico. I think the \nevidence is quite clear the standards, with respect to Mexico, are \nlower, especially with respect to its enforcement.\n  The reason I say that is this: If you had standards in Mexico that \nwere enforced, and therefore you had knowledge of the issue of vehicle \ninspections, you had knowledge of accident reports and driver \nviolations, there would be a database in Mexico by which you could \naccess the data and make an evaluation of the data.\n  Our inspector general has already determined no such database exists.\n  Mr. BOND. May I ask my colleague another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to respond.\n  Mr. BOND. It relates to the fact that the U.S. Federal inspectors \nwill be going to Mexico and making those inspections with Mexican \ntrucks would satisfy his concern about the enforcement. Before the \ntrucks can come in, U.S. Federal inspectors go to Mexico and make the \ninspections.\n  Does he think we ought to be doing the same thing in Canada, for \nexample? What about requiring Canadian trucking companies to have U.S. \ninsurance as well?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, it is interesting. We have some experience in that \nas well. Let me use the experience of meat; meat from Canada and meat \nfrom Mexico. We allow, because they have equivalent standards and \nequivalent inspections, we believe, for meat to leave a Canadian plant \nand to come into this country uninspected at our border.\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n  We allow that because we believe there are standards and enforcement \nthat are equivalent to the standards of this country. I have spoken on \nthe floor, and my colleague, I think, was not here at the time, but I \nheld up a, I think a 2-pound piece of T-bone steak one day and said: \nCan anybody tell me where this came from? Because meat is not labeled, \nit should be, but it is not. I said: Can you tell me if it came from \nthe processing plant, the slaughter plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. \nBecause if it did, I wish to read to you the one time an inspector went \nthere. It was a plant that was allowed to slaughter cattle and produce \nmeat shipped into our country. One inspector showed up one time. I read \nthe report of the inspector on the floor of the Senate. Sufficient to \nsay, no one would want to purchase meat from that plant.\n  It was promptly closed down, the ownership changed, the plant is now \nsending meat back into this country. I do not believe it has been \ninspected again. My point is the requirement to inspect, with respect \nto slaughterhouses in Mexico, is one example. My colleague says: Well, \nif we would send people down to inspect in Mexico, would that give you \ncomfort?\n  Well, we are told by the Department of Transportation what will give \nus comfort is this, that they will check every truck every time. The \nproblem is, we are told this by the inspector general: They are not \ngoing to inspect every truck every time. Yes, they tell you that. That \nis what they claim. But here is the reality. They have no plans, no \noutlines to inspect every truck every time. They have no site-specific \nplans developed and in place prior to initiating this project. The risk \nis, the project participants will be able to avoid the required checks.\n  So you know, once again, there is a great variation between what the \nFederal agency says and what it is willing to do. So my colleague and \nothers might be comforted by the fact that say: We will go there, we \nwill do those rigorously. I am not so comforted because we have had \nplenty of experience with that.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask another question? We are not \ntalking about packing houses where there was obviously a failure of \nsanitation. We are talking about a situation where U.S. Federal \ninspectors go down, conduct a pretest, a preinspection of the Mexican \ntrucking operations, the vehicles coming in have to go through a U.S. \noverseen or implemented safety inspection every 3 months.\n  Now, I do not think we require Canadian trucks, and certainly we do \nnot require U.S. trucks, to be inspected every time they travel on our \nroads. But we do have inspections, random inspections that will apply \nto United States, Canadian, and Mexican trucks.\n  What I am asking, if U.S. Federal inspectors are doing this--nobody \never said they are going to do it every time. Nobody expects to have \ninspectors inspecting every truck. But what is the difference, I would \nask my colleague, between having U.S. inspectors every 3 months in \nMexico and having random safety inspections--in what situation do \neither the Canadian or the U.S. trucks get the same degree of \ninspection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague is not accurate. They, in \nfact, did say they were going to inspect every time. Let me read the \ninspector general's report. After our visit to Federal--it is the \nFMCSA, one of these other acronyms in Government again. The Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration. It is in DOT.\n  So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration agreed to develop \na plan to check every truck every time. So that is exactly what they \nsaid. But the inspector general says: They are not going to do that. He \nsays, as of July, there is no coordinated site-specific plan to carry \nout such checks. Then they said: Well, we will have it done by August \n22. They said: We have not received any outlines or completed plans. In \nour opinion, not having site-specific plans in place prior to \ninitiating the project will increase the risk project participants will \nbe able to avoid the required checks.\n  I would say to my colleague, I do not always dismiss this issue of \ninspections because I think sufficient inspections can be very helpful. \nBut having been on the floor of the Senate now speaking about the issue \nof tainted products coming into this country, understanding whether it \nis trinkets or toys or shrimp or catfish or tires, car tires, or any \nnumber of pet foods, having spoken about them at some length and \nunderstanding that we inspect 1 percent of them.\n  We inspect 1 percent, 99 percent of the vegetables and the trinkets \nand toys come in here without any inspection. Now we are told, if we \nwould allow the Department of Transportation to proceed with this \nproject, which they announced late at night with 1 hour of review of \nthe inspector general's report, if we would only allow them to proceed, \nboy, they guarantee they will inspect.\n\n  I am sorry. I think the evidence, with respect to the Federal \nGovernment, would suggest a different conclusion and a different \nresult. I hope at some point we do not have these issues. You know, I \nmean I can give you lots of examples of what has promised to have been \nhomogenized between the United States, Canada, and Mexico because of \nthe trade agreement. But promises are cheap.\n  I mean, there are lots of promises, and very few are kept with \nrespect to these trade agreements. The trade agreements are similar to \nSwiss cheese, riddled with holes.\n  This, in my judgment, is a circumstance where, if we decide to \nproceed to say: Under these conditions, we will allow immediately the \nDepartment of Transportation to move to this pilot project, I think we \nwill make a mistake. We will make a mistake on behalf of those who are \ntraveling on America's roads, who at some point, coming up to a four-\nway stop or a stoplight or meeting on a four-way highway, some vehicle \nthat was not subject to the same rigor and the same inspections that \nexist in this country because they did not have the same enforcement, I \nthink someone will be injured. That risk ought not be borne by the \nAmerican consumer or the American driver.\n  We ought to decide what is fair. You know, we have spent a century \nlifting this country's standards and demanding in this country. Upton \nSinclair wrote that book and described at the start of the century, \nstart of the last century, in Chicago, IL, at the big packing houses, \nhow when they were slaughtering cattle and trying to control the rat \npopulation in the slaughterhouses, they put poison on bread loaves and \nthings.\n  They would kill the rats, and they would shove the dead rats and the \nbread loaves and the meat down the same chute, and out the other side \nof the chute would come some sausage and some steak and some meat, and \noff to the consumer. Well a tremendous public outcry resulted from \nthat, and we developed regulations.\n  So we have standards and regulations in a number of areas. This is \nbut one area in which we have standards and regulations. They can be \nstandards and regulations that are the difference between life or \ndeath. Because, when you are on America's roads and highways, safety is \nvery important.\n  My own view is, I think the Department of Transportation is making a \nmistake. I think all the promises and all the assurances will fall far \nshort of what the American consumer and the American driver should \nexpect to minimize risk and to maximize safety on America's roads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are working our way through the \nTransportation appropriations bill. We have one amendment pending. I \nsee the Senator from Oklahoma is here, and he shortly is going to ask \nto set aside this amendment in order to call up an amendment. I ask any \nother Members who have amendments they wish to offer during this debate \nto come to the floor, offer their amendments, and we will work our way \nexpeditiously through as many as possible. I remind all colleagues that \nthe majority leader has been very clear that due to the Jewish holidays \nwe will be finishing by midday on Wednesday; therefore, Members should \nexpect a very long night tomorrow night as we work our way through \nthese amendments. It will work a lot better if Members come to the \nfloor and offer their amendments so we know what order we have and how \nwe can work through them. I ask Members who have been calling us and \nletting us know they have an amendment to come to the floor this \nevening\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\nor tomorrow morning at the latest and get those amendments up so we can \ngo through them.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I join with my colleague from Washington, the chairman of \nour committee. I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to bring \nin their amendments. Because of the timeline we are working under, we \nwill be much more willing and able to work out the amendments that come \nin early. We may be able to cut off the time for filing amendments, I \nwould hope, as early as sometime tomorrow afternoon. But I suggest that \nin case that happens, people come forward with their amendments as \nearly as possible because we are facing a time deadline and need to get \nthis bill amended, if desired, and passed. I would appreciate the \ncooperation of colleagues on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2796\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside for consideration of amendment No. 2796.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment No. 2796.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to implement the proposed Air \n   Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution of the Federal Aviation \n                            Administration)\n\n       On page 147, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       Sec. 414.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended by the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     transfer the design and development functions of the FAA \n     Academy or to implement the Air Traffic Control Optimum \n     Training Solution proposed by the Administrator .\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the test \nlanguage, the IG said, apparently has been corrected. I only remind my \nfriend from North Dakota and my friend from Missouri that when I had \nthe English language amendment up, we used the same definition I \nbelieve they are using right now in order to make sure there is \nadequate knowledge of English language by Mexican truckers. I will read \nwhat it said: Applicants have up to three chances to read and write one \nsentence correctly in English. That is the test, which doesn't give me \na very high comfort level.\n  The amendment I am offering, No. 2796, would prohibit the FAA from \nusing any money in fiscal year 2008 to implement their proposed new ATC \ntraining system. It is called the ATCOTS. The FAA has sped up the \nschedule for transition without giving sufficient attention to the \ntransition from the old to the new. By prohibiting the FAA from using \nfiscal year 2008 funds to implement this new training system, there \nwill be additional time to plan for the transition, if we decide the \ntransition at that point is something we want to do.\n  Finally, there has been no explanation on why the existing system \ndoes not work. This additional time can be used to examine the current \nsystem and determine where it needs to be changed, if it needs to be \nchanged.\n  This is how the current system works. This is how the FAA wants to \nchange it. Currently, candidates must enroll in an FAA-approved \neducation program and pass a preemployment test which measures his or \nher ability to perform the duties of a controller. Let's keep in mind, \nwe are talking about controllers who have our lives in their hands. It \nhappens that I am in my 51st year of aviation. Just as recently as 2 \ndays ago, I was flying, and I have a great deal of respect for these \npeople. To me, the training must absolutely be perfect. The candidates \ncurrently must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass a \npreemployment test which measures their ability to perform the duties \nof a controller. Then the FAA has designated 15 institutions around the \ncountry for preemployment testing. The candidates must also have 3 \nyears of full-time work experience and have completed a full 4 years of \ncollege. These have to be people who have a college education, have to \nhave 3 years of on-the-job training. Then they have to, of course, have \ngone through this preemployment test. Then if the candidate \nsuccessfully meets those three tests, they are eligible for employment \nas an air traffic controller.\n  Successful candidates attend the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City for 12 \nweeks to learn fundamentals of the airway system, the FAA regs, \ncontroller equipment, and aircraft performance characteristics. Upon \ngraduating from the academy, the candidates are assigned to an air \ntraffic control facility as ``developmental controllers'' where they \nreceive training on specific controller positions. Generally, it takes \n2 to 4 years, depending on the facility and the availability of \nfacility staff or contractors, to provide the on-the-job training.\n  Currently, there are two separate contractors that provide training \nfor potential controllers: one contractor at the academy and one \ncontractor for on-the-job training at the facility. What the FAA wants \nto do is to combine these two contracts into one, thereby speeding up \nthe training, they believe, and getting more controllers to train \nfaster.\n  Because controllers hired--and most of us have been around long \nenough to remember this--after the PATCO strike are now eligible for \nretirement, the FAA estimates they need to hire and train approximately \n15,000 new air traffic controllers over the next 10 years. They believe \nthe air traffic control optimum training solution, which is called \nATCOTS, will accomplish this because it will, No. 1, leverage current \nindustry best practices to develop innovative training services \ndelivery solutions; No. 2, achieve efficiencies by reducing time and \nthe cost it takes to certify professional controllers; No. 3, institute \ncontinuous improvement within the training program; and No. 4, \nestablish a performance-based contract management system. That is what \nthe FAA hopes to achieve, but I have yet to understand how.\n  Recently, the FAA announced that they plan to issue a request for \nproposals for this new single controller training contract in January \nof 2008, with an expected award in June of 2008. That is less than a \nyear from this month. This is despite assurances to the Oklahoma \ndelegation that there would be a multiyear transition to ATCOTS. In \nother words, it is going to take several years to make the transition, \nif it is desirable. Now it appears ATCOTS could be fully implemented \nwithin 1 year, although there is no clear transition plan. The winning \nbid is supposed to provide the transition plan.\n  Furthermore, there is no clear assurance that the millions in \ntaxpayer dollars already invested in the FAA training academy in \nOklahoma City will continue to be used. Per the documents I have seen, \nif the winning bidder should choose to conduct the initial classroom \ninstruction elsewhere, they have that option. I question why we would \nabandon the academy and our Federal investment there.\n  Finally, I do not believe there has been sufficient examination of \nthe cost benefits of this new training program. Rather, there has been \na rush to fix a system that no one has been able to explain, at least \nto me, how or if it is broken.\n  My amendment merely slows down the process so Congress can have more \ntime to examine what are the shortfalls of the current training system \nand how the proposed ATCOTS system will improve the training. This is \nlike so many things we rush into. We lay out the predicate that we are \ngoing to spend all this time and be deliberate in making sure we are \nnot getting into something that is not, in fact, a lot better than the \nold system, when we have yet to see anything to at least convince me or \nany plausible argument that there is a problem with the existing \nsystem.\n  While I could have introduced an amendment to stop this, I didn't \nwant to do that because I thought if it is more efficient, then it \nmight be something we may want to consider. But I can assure my \ncolleagues that nothing has been done so far that would convince me \nthat it is a better system. I don't think we should be using 2008\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nfunds. My amendment would give us another year to determine whether \nthis is the wise thing to do. I believe it is a reasonable approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for coming to offer \nhis amendment. He has my commitment that we will take the time to \nreview it. We have not had a chance to do so as yet. We want to know \nwhat the impact is on the FAA budget, as well as the training needs we \nhave, but we will evaluate it as quickly as possible and work with him \nin order to dispose of it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I encourage, again, Senators to come to the floor and \noffer their amendments so, like the amendment we are currently looking \nat, we have time to review it and get it done in a timely fashion. I \nremind all Members that if they wait until the last minute to get their \namendments here, they may likely not be considered or adopted simply \nbecause of time. Again, if Members are here, come tonight quickly, get \nyour amendments up. We will have a chance to review them and hopefully \nbe able to dispose of them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is time for us to review our policy \nin Iraq. We have been aware this day was coming for some time.\n  To recap how things have occurred, we had hearings in the early part \nof this year to confirm General Petraeus. This has been General \nPetraeus's third tour in Iraq. I first had the opportunity to meet with \nhim when he commanded the 101st Airborne in Mosul. He was part of the \ninitial invasion--a brilliant combat commander who impressed all of us \non our CODEL.\n  I later visited him in Iraq when he was in charge of training the \nIraqi military and their police. It was a critical moment in their \ndevelopment. He was asked to go back early to do that, and he agreed to \ndo so.\n  He then returned to the United States and wrote the counterinsurgency \nmanual for the Department of Defense. Before the ink was dry on that \nmanual, the President asked him to go back to Iraq, for the third time, \nto lead this critical effort at this critical time.\n  So I wish to first say how disappointed I have been that some have \nseen fit to attack this man, attack what he might say. I am afraid, \nfrankly, the purpose of that was to sort of preemptively smear his \ntestimony. I saw most of his testimony this afternoon. As a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I expect to see more of it tomorrow and \nto be there tomorrow when he testifies before our committee and to hear \nit all in complete form.\n  So let me say this: It is right and just and appropriate this \nCongress, which sent him there in January, I believe, which voted on \nMay 24 to fund the surge--we had a lot of debate about this surge, \nwhether we should do it, whether we should increase our troop levels. \nThe situation in Baghdad was not good. The situation in Al Anbar had \nmade some improvement but was not where we wanted it to be. The country \nwas in a difficult time.\n  The President said: Let's step up the troop level. Let's have a \nsurge. We had much debate about it. I know our leader, Harry Reid, went \nto the White House along with Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. \nThey came out with an agreement, and only 14 Senators opposed--in a \ntruly bipartisan vote--funding of this effort.\n  So I have been disappointed that some announced it a failure even \nbefore it got started good. But we all committed to one thing; and that \nis that General Petraeus would come back and he would report to us and \nwe would hear from him.\n  Some thought we needed more than that. So we as a Congress included \nin our funding legislation a requirement that another commission be set \nup, an independent commission, with retired officers and so forth. GEN \nJimmy Jones, former Commandant of the Marine Corps and former Supreme \nAllied Commander Europe, chaired that commission. He reported last \nweek.\n  Also, we had the Government Accountability Office do an independent \nanalysis of the benchmarks in Iraq.\n  Now we are having General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, who is \nclearly one of the best respected Ambassadors in the State Department \nwith experience in this region of the world. They are giving us their \nreport today and tomorrow.\n  If Congress concludes this effort ought not to go forward, so be it. \nBut we ought to do it after listening to our generals. In fact, I \nnoticed some of the polling data showed more than two-thirds of the \nAmerican people prefer to have their decision process be informed by \nthe military, and only less than 10 percent, I think, or maybe 20 \npercent, said the Congress should set the military standards.\n  Here is an article by Bing West I noticed in the National Review in \nMay. He has been to Iraq multiple times. He has written two books on \nthe Iraq war. He said:\n\n       The new American military team has infused the effort with \n     energy and strategic clarity, and seized the initiative. In \n     this war, the moral/psychological element outweighs the \n     physical by 20 to 1.\n\n  I think there is a good bit of truth in that. I think we have seen a \nmore coherent, focused strategy under General Petraeus's leadership.\n  With regard to his testimony and its truthfulness, I remember \ninterviewing him before he was to testify in January, before being sent \nto Iraq, and he said: I will tell you one thing, Senator. I am going to \ntell you the truth as I see it if you send me there.\n  So the next morning I thought I would ask him that very question \nbefore the committee while he was under oath. I said:\n\n       You've indicated, I think, in your opening statement \n     [General Petraeus] that you would, but I'd like you to say \n     that so the American people would know that a person who \n     knows that country [Iraq], who's written a manual on \n     counterinsurgency--if you believe it can't be successful, you \n     will tell us so we can take a new action. That was my \n     question to him: Will you tell us if you think this will not \n     work? Because he told us and made the public statement our \n     effort in Iraq was difficult, but he did not think it was \n     impossible.\n\n  He replied to me this way:\n\n       Sir, I firmly believe that I have an obligation to the \n     great young men and women of our country who are putting \n     themselves in harm's way, and certainly to all Americans, to \n     tell my boss if I believe that the strategy cannot succeed at \n     some point.\n\n  I believe this man told us the truth today as he saw it and will tell \nus the truth before the Armed Services Committee tomorrow, as God gives \nhim the ability to do so. He finished near the top of his class at West \nPoint. He was No. 1 in his class at the Command and General Staff \nCollege. He has a Ph.D. from Princeton. He has been in combat. He has \nled one of the Army's finest combat divisions in combat. He has trained \nthe Iraqi Army. He knows most of the Iraqi leaders pretty well because \nof his time there. We could not have a better person. We need to listen \nto him and then make our independent judgment after he testifies.\n  So I thank the Chair for this time. I hope all Americans will \nparticipate, as Congress should, in evaluating where we are today. \nThen, once we make a decision about what our next step will be, I would \ncall on my colleagues to not do things that undermine the strategy once \nwe have established it. Don't come up 2 weeks after we have voted on \nwhat to do and then say it is a failure. Let's don't do that this time. \nLet's agree to--no matter what it is, no matter how it comes out--have \nour debate and then our vote, and let's establish a policy and stick \ntogether and work hard to make it a success.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I wish to be heard on this Dorgan amendment, \nthe pending amendment, with regard to the Mexican trucker demonstration \nproject. I wish to speak on it because I was involved in it the last \ntime this issue came up.\n  I have always urged that we deal with this in a fair way and in a \nresponsible way. We don't want unsafe trucks or unsafe drivers coming \ninto our country, whether they are coming from Mexico or Canada. But I \nhave always felt that maybe we had an attitude toward trucks coming in \nfrom Mexico; it was very different from those which might be coming \nfrom Canada. I think we need to have rules in place and we need to have \nproper precautions, but I think we also need to be rational and \nreasonable. If we don't have at least a demonstration project, what is \ngoing to happen when our trucks want to go to Mexico? I will guarantee \nyou one thing: If I were the President of Mexico, I would say there are \nnot going to be any American trucks coming down here. Can't we use some \ncommon sense? This is not some enemy satellite sitting on our border. \nThis is a place where we can begin to make progress.\n  I know it is easy to demagogue this issue and get into all kinds of \nflights of fancy about, oh, yes, this is the beginning of a \nsuperhighway coming from Mexico; that the border is just a bump in the \nroad and this is part of the one nation movement in North America. I \ndon't know where all this comes from. Maybe I am naive. I don't \nadvocate that. But I think we are really turning this into another case \nof trying to make a bogeyman out of our neighbor to the south.\n  I don't have a vested interest in this. I was in the trucking \nbusiness once upon a time in my life. I know a little bit about \ntrucking. This is not a case where my State is on the border and is \ngoing to be abused one way or the other. So I have the ability to try \nto look at this objectively and to ask that we try to make sense in how \nwe deal with all of this.\n  This is not a new issue. We have been working on this, planning for \nthis, preparing for this for 14 years to make sure it is done properly, \nincluding proper inspections, proper requirements. There is a program \nwe are trying to put in place which would be subject to an additional \naudit at 6 months and when the project concludes. Remember, it is a \npilot program. We are not putting it in place in perpetuity. We want to \ncheck it and see how it works and if it is done correctly.\n  Since 1982, trucks from Mexico have only been able to drive in a 25-\nmile commercial zone along U.S. borders. Think about that. They can \ncome across the border, and they must stay in a 25-mile commercial zone \nand then offload to U.S. trucks before they can come into the United \nStates.\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement contains a trucking provision \nthat was put on hold in 1995 by President Clinton, and, without being \ncritical of him, he wanted to make sure we had looked at it enough and \nthat there were safety requirements, and so forth. At that time, I \nthought, frankly, he was probably doing the right thing. Then, in 2001, \na NAFTA dispute resolution panel ruled the United States was violating \nNAFTA obligations by adopting a blanket ban on trucks from Mexico. So \nthen we kind of got into a fight about it, and that is where I got \ndirectly involved, and that was in 2002 on the appropriations bill. It \ndetailed, as a result--again, we didn't say we were going to do it \nregardless; we said, OK, we are going to try to find a way to do this, \nbut we are going to have some specific requirements. We detailed 22 \nsafety requirements that had to be met prior to allowing trucks from \nMexico to drive beyond the U.S. 25-mile commercial zones.\n\n  Here are the 22 safety requirements and mandates we included in that \nbill. I am going to read every one of them because I want to make sure \nmy colleagues understand that this is not something we are doing \nfrivolously or carelessly. We had specific requirements, and they have \nbeen met:\n\n       Establish mandatory pre-authority safety audits.\n       Conduct at least 50 percent of the safety audits on-site in \n     Mexico.\n       Issue permanent operating authority only to Mexican \n     trucking companies who pass safety compliance reviews.\n       Conduct at least 50 percent of the compliance reviews on-\n     site in Mexico--including any who do not receive an on-site \n     pre-authority audit.\n       Check the validity of the driver's license every time a \n     truck comes across the border.\n\n  Yes, we want these drivers to be licensed. I am sure that when we go \nforward with this, that some trucker gets in here with an unsafe truck \nor without a driver's license or with illegal immigrants in the belly \nof that truck, it will get huge coverage. I don't want any of that to \nhappen. So we have these safety checks, and we have a check of the \nvalidity of the driver's license.\n\n       Assign Mexican truck companies a distinct Department of \n     Transportation number.\n       Inspect all trucks from Mexico that do not display the \n     current CVSA decal.\n       Have State inspectors in the border States report any \n     violations of safety regulations by trucks from Mexico to \n     U.S. Federal authorities.\n       Equip all U.S.-Mexico commercial border crossing with \n     weight scales--including weigh-in-motion systems at 5 of the \n     10 busiest crossings.\n       Study the need for weigh-in-motion systems at all other \n     border crossings.\n       Collect proof of insurance.\n       Limit trucks from Mexico operating beyond the border zone \n     to cross the border only where a certified Federal or State \n     inspector is on duty.\n       Limit trucks from Mexico operating beyond the border zone \n     to cross the border only where there is capacity to conduct \n     inspections and park out-of-service vehicles.\n\n  We must ensure compliance of all--all--U.S. safety regulations by \nMexican operators who wish to go beyond the border zones.\n\n       Improve training and certification for border inspectors \n     and auditors.\n       Study needed staffing along the border.\n       Prohibit Mexican trucking companies from leasing vehicles \n     from other companies when they are suspended, restricted, or \n     limited from their right to operate in the U.S.\n       Forbid foreign motor carriers from operating in the United \n     States if they have been found to have operated illegally in \n     the United States.\n       Work with all State inspectors to take enforcement action \n     or notify U.S. DOT authorities when they discover safety \n     violations.\n       Apply the same U.S. hazardous materials driver requirements \n     to drivers from Mexico hauling hazardous materials.\n       Provide $54 million in Border Infrastructure Grants for \n     border improvements and construction.\n       Conduct a comprehensive Inspector General's review--to be \n     certified by the Secretary--that determines if border \n     operations meet requirements--\n\n  That are required.\n  This is lengthy.\n  Now, I believe it has been pointed out on the floor that the \ninspector general may have indicated: Well, it may not be possible to \ndo all this. We may not be able to check every truck--let's see here. \nAny truck with a safety violation we stop until the problem is fixed.\n  There are questions about do we have the infrastructure and \ncapability to do that. But the specificity of the 22 mandates have been \nmet, and these are the critical provisions that are important.\n  The companies in Mexico must pass a safety audit by United States \ninspectors, including review of drivers' records, insurance policies, \ndrug and alcohol testing, and vehicle inspection records. Every truck \nthat crosses the border as part of the program will be checked every \ntime it enters. There is a question about whether we can do that. \nRemember, this is temporary and a pilot program. We need to check every \none of them. If we don't have the infrastructure to do that, we should \nadd it.\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\n  Any truck with a safety violation will be stopped until the problem \nis fixed. Yes, that ought to happen. So we have a very distinct list of \nitems we are trying to do here.\n  In the first 30 days of the program, 17 Mexican truck companies will \nbe given operating authority. Additional companies will be added each \nmonth. So there is some order to this program.\n  I say to my colleagues that this has been dealt with very \nmethodically. The requirements of Congress have been met. It is a pilot \nprogram on a temporary basis with a 6-month audit. We ought to do this \nprogram.\n  I cannot help but think that there is something more going on here \nthan safety concerns. I do think there is an attitude: We don't want \nthose Mexican truckdrivers up here. Sure, there are some who might not \nbe as good as they should be, but that is true with American \ntruckdrivers, too, on occasion. What about Canadian truckdrivers?\n  I feel we are making a mistake if we try to stop this temporary pilot \nprogram, and I think it is going to seriously damage our ability to \nwork with the Mexican Government, with their new President, in not only \nthis area but a lot of other areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to look carefully at what has been done by our \nDepartment of Transportation. Let's not assume the worst of our \nneighbors from Mexico. I have known a lot of truckers, and I know the \nkinds of problems one can have with trucking. But these are well-\nintentioned, hard-working people. They are an important part of our \neconomy, and we need to have free-flowing trade that benefits both \ncountries, all countries in a way of which we can be proud.\n  If we find a problem, fix it. But to just say no, we are going to \nstop it after 14 years of planning and preparation because some \npeople--I don't know--don't want the competition? This is not an \nimmigration issue. This is a transportation issue. We can do this. We \ncan do it sensibly. But we should defeat the Dorgan amendment. We \nshould allow the pilot program to go forward and make sure it is done \nproperly.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11315-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11315-S11317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the bill that is presently on the floor. It is a good bill, and \nit couldn't be done at a more appropriate time. It is a critical issue. \nWe hear many people talking about our decaying transportation \ninfrastructure. The bill is focused primarily on the transportation \nside, but it also applies to other important subjects, including \nhousing. But when we see the reports about how structurally deficient \nand functionally obsolete our transportation system is, and where we \nstand relative to other countries--even some third world countries--we \nshould want to catch up here.\n  When flights are taking off and landing on time, when our railroads \nare carrying more passengers and cargo safely, when our roads and \nbridges are in good condition--our economy thrives, and so does the \nwell-being of our people. We don't have anything that measures the \nstress factor of motorists, but I am sure if every driver were wearing \nsome kind of a meter that recorded stress levels, the needles would go \noff their face. Tempers rise, time is lost, and appointments are not \nkept.\n  But when we fail to adequately fund these priorities, our economy and \nour infrastructure falters. That is why this bill is critical to our \neconomy.\n  My colleague, the Presiding Officer, also from the wonderful State of \nNew Jersey, knows we have to get things done. We have to get people and \ncargo moving. We have a tiny State, with lots of people, the most \ncrowded State in the country, and transportation is essential. However, \nwe don't have a monopoly on congestion, delays, and pollution from \ntravel.\n  I remember days when I went back and forth to work from the Capitol \nand that the ride used to be 15 minutes. Now sometimes it can take half \nan hour. Look at the bridges and the roads around the Capitol, and we \nsee it. Go anyplace that has a thriving population and you will find \nthe same problem.\n  Our State of New Jersey is a global gateway and a national crossroad \nfor transportation--air, railroad, and sea. We have the largest seaport \non the East Coast. Each year, millions of cargo containers are put on \ntrucks and trains at New Jersey's ports, bound for cities and towns \nacross the interior of America. Newark's Liberty International Airport \nis one of the busiest, and is the most delayed in the country. We have \nthat unfortunate distinction right now.\n  Each week, many of New Jersey's almost 9 million residents ride \ntrains or buses or drive their cars across bridges and through tunnels \nconnecting them to jobs outside the State or within the State. Last \nyear, 54 million cars, trucks, and buses crossed the George Washington \nBridge from Fort Lee, NJ, into New York City, by way of example.\n  After the tragedy in Minnesota, I began working with State leaders to \nmake sure our bridges in New Jersey could safely and effectively handle \nthe increasing volume of cars and trucks. I know many of my colleagues \ndid the same thing. Thirty-four percent of the bridges in the State of \nNew Jersey are deficient, which is higher than the national average of \n27 percent. Think about what these percentages mean. It is saying that \none out of three bridges is structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete and in trouble. That is the way it seems to be in many places \nin the country. Enormous parts of the highway system are not able to \nhandle the volume of traffic that passes over these areas.\n  Congress understands that bridges in America should not disappear \ninto dust and rubble, costing lives and untold economic consequence. \nThat is why in this bill we included $5 billion for Federal bridge \nprograms, a 20-percent increase over last year. I was pleased to work \nwith Senator Murray to add another $1 billion to strengthen our \nbridges.\n  As the chairman of two subcommittees overseeing Federal \ntransportation programs, I am going to continue to do my part to keep \nour bridges strong so New Jerseyans can get to their jobs and back to \ntheir families safely.\n  We want to strengthen these bridges and give people the assurance \nthat when they cross over they are safe. I talk to people who say they \nare reluctant to cross over some of the bridges we have in our area. \nReluctant. But we take it for granted you have to do it in order to get \nwhere you must be.\n  I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Murray and Ranking Member Bond \nfor building a smart and strong transportation and housing \nappropriations bill. It funds Federal bridge repair programs, airline \nsafety inspections, bus and rail transportation systems, and even \noperation of the air traffic control system.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the committee agreed to increase \nfunds for Amtrak, our Nation's passenger railroad. Between the lines of \ncars on the highway and the long security lines at airports, American \ntravelers need and deserve a choice. If one wants to see what a \ndifference it could make, travel to some of the countries in Europe or \nJapan where they have world-class passenger rail service, where a trip \nfrom Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, a 200-mile distance, is \naccomplished in 1 hour 25 minutes. If you tried to get an airplane to \ntake you that distance, you couldn't. They do not fly that way anymore. \nIt is superfluous when you can get from the inside of one city to \ninside the other city and not have to go through the torment of the \nlong lines and other inconveniences of getting on airplanes.\n  Today I had the experience of getting on an airplane at LaGuardia \nAirport in New York. My home in New Jersey is mid-way between LaGuardia \nand Newark airports. The weather didn't look that bad. We got on the \nairplane at 9 o'clock for a 38-minute flight to be here for a vote at \n11. But due to congestion, we arrived here at a quarter past 11. It is \nsomewhat amusing, with an odd twist, when the pilot gets on and tells\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nyou how many minutes the flying time is because it is almost \nirrelevant. The flying time doesn't tell you how long it is going to \ntake. It can take 38 minutes in the air, but it can take an hour and a \nhalf on the ground, which is pretty much what happened to us this \nmorning. As a consequence, Mr. President--and you know how important \ncasting your vote is around here--we missed a vote this morning, two \nother Senators and myself who were on that flight.\n\n  With all the problems with our transportation systems, President Bush \neither doesn't get it or just won't do it. He wants to put brakes on \nprogress. The day after the terrible tragedy in Minnesota, when rescue \ncrews were still searching for missing people, I heard the President \nrespond, and he said: I am disappointed the Congress hasn't sent me a \nspending bill. But 2 weeks earlier he said he was going to veto the \ntransportation spending bill because it was too much money. Can't have \nit both ways, Mr. President. And the public suffers.\n  President Bush's funding request would put Amtrak into bankruptcy, \nbut expanding Amtrak is one way to get people off of the highways in \nmany cases and out of the skyways. It is unacceptable for the Nation's \npassenger railroad service. Amtrak is experiencing record ridership \nlevels, and it is unfair to the traveling public not to put the money \nin there that we have to. The bill before us would provide $1.5 billion \nfor Amtrak, providing the funding it needs to survive and to grow. I am \na frequent user of Amtrak, and I know very well that while the service \nis radically improved from where it was, more needs to be done to \naccommodate the volume of passengers who would use the railroad.\n  The funding here includes a new $100 million grant program for States \nto expand passenger rail service. This proposal stems from a plan \nSenator Lott and I have developed to reauthorize Amtrak.\n  I also thank my subcommittee leaders for agreeing to my request to \ninclude additional funding for the Department of Transportation's \nOffice of Aviation Enforcement, to be able to protect airline \npassengers' rights. Now it is a small group of people trying to handle \npassenger complaints, and they cannot get to them. It is ridiculous. \nHow do we in the Government know what is going on if we cannot process \ncomplaints that come in? This office is the only place where airline \ntravelers can turn when they are mistreated by airline companies, and \nthey know very well this mistreatment is frequent.\n  Right now this enforcement office only counts most complaints. \nInstead of acting on them, they collect them. It is like a mail \nrepository. This includes complaints about overbooked and canceled \nflights, deceptive advertising, failing to process fare refunds and \nadjustments, unfair administration of frequent flier programs, and even \nacts of discrimination upon disabled passengers.\n  With this new funding we can make sure that airlines provide better \nservice to all their customers and act on the complaints a customer \nfiles, not just note that they have arrived.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased the committee agreed at markup to include \nan amendment I put in limiting pollution by some waste-handling \nfacilities near railroads. It is an issue of great significance to New \nJersey. We have seen fires and pollution emitted from waste-handling \nfacilities. The problem is we cannot get at them and correct them \nbecause of a loophole in the Federal law which lets some solid waste \nprocessors do business without regulation, allowing unimpeded pollution \nof our water, air, and lands. My amendment will at least temporarily \nclose this loophole.\n  I have a more comprehensive bill which will close this loophole \npermanently, and I am working with railroads and other stakeholders in \nhopes we can get it passed this year.\n  We now have transportation and public housing programs together in \nthis bill. Perhaps it is just the way it ought to be to accommodate \nlife in better form for our citizens. Public housing programs provide \nhomes for some 38,000 people in my State alone. Public housing needs \nhave been underfunded by at least $1 billion in the last 6 years. The \nbill also maintains funding for the Hope VI program, instead of \neliminating it, which President Bush has tried to do. Hope VI has \ngenerated more than $1 billion to revitalize distressed public housing \nin New Jersey alone, to make sure these families have an affordable \nhome.\n  At a time when we see problems with home ownership for lots of \npeople--bankruptcies in abundance--people will have to find different \nplaces to house themselves and their families. We have to make these \ninvestments. The housing stock that we have is often inadequate, \ninadequate not simply in numbers but in quality as well. This funding \nwe are getting will be especially important.\n  President Bush, as I mentioned before, has threatened to veto the \nbill because it contains $4 billion more for transportation and housing \nneeds than he requested. A veto would cause people to lose their homes. \nA veto would cause bridges to go unrepaired--bridges in dangerous \ncondition. We have to fix these things to be publicly responsible.\n  President Bush is willing to have us spend $3 billion every week in \nIraq. We want to make sure we provide funding for those soldiers who \nare serving overseas right now, but we also need to fund our needs here \nat home.\n  There is an unacceptable problem we see in our country. We do not \ninvest our limited funds back into our infrastructure as we so \ndesperately need to do, and at the same time we are continuing a war \nthat, for many of us, is questionable and ought to be terminated very \nquickly.\n  It is about time the President's priorities matched up with the needs \nof Americans at home. This bill will go some way toward helping that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the last time I addressed this body was \nbefore we adjourned for the August recess, and I had just returned from \nsurveying the enormous damage that occurred when the I-35W bridge \ncollapsed in Minneapolis. It had just collapsed the day before.\n  While I spoke, the dust from this tragedy had yet to settle. Well-\ntrained first responders had arrived at the scene, and they were \nheroically rescuing survivors from the wreckage. The entire country was \nmourning for the victims while praying for the ones yet to be found. \nEveryone was expressing relief that a schoolbus filled with little \nchildren had miraculously escaped disaster.\n  Brave divers, despite mental and physical exhaustion, were working \naround the clock to find loved ones, people such as Patrick Holmes, who \nwas driving home to his young wife Jennifer and their two children, who \nwas on the bridge when that happened; people such as Sadiya Sahal, a \npregnant nursing student and her 2-year-old daughter Hannah, who were \nheaded to a relative's house when the bridge crumbled beneath them.\n  The police, the fire department, the emergency personnel, and \nordinary citizens all came together. The tragedy of the day was met \nwith enormous generosity from the community.\n  It was also met with generosity from this body. United in \nbipartisanship, every single Senator agreed that they would help to \nprovide the necessary means to help Minnesota rebuild. It was done in \nrecord time--60 hours.\n  Today, as I stand before this body, the dust has finally settled, and \nthe promise was that when the dust settled we would provide the \nnecessary means to help Minnesota rebuild. On August 20, the nearly 3-\nweek recovery effort finally came to an end when the last known victim \nwas found. The loss of Greg Jolstad, or ``Jolly'' as he was known by \nhis family and friends, brings the official death toll to 13.\n\n  Much of our massive eight-lane interstate highway bridge is now \nawkwardly draped over the bluffs of the Mississippi River while the \nremaining tons upon tons of steel and concrete lay buried below the \nriver.\n  As I said that day, a bridge just should not fall down in America. \nBut it did. And although we do not know yet why the I-35W bridge \nfailed, and while we still mourn those who lost their lives, the \nrebuilding effort has begun.\n  With the initial money that Congress appropriated, Minnesota has \nincreased transit options to serve commuters, set up detours to restore \ntraffic flow, cleared structural debris, and has begun to lay the \ngeneral framework for rebuilding.\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\n  As Minnesota continues to clear the path for a new bridge, I know \nthis body, as they promised that evening, stands ready to ensure that \nthe appropriate funding is made available to rebuild it. It is one of \nthe most heavily traveled bridges in the State and vital to our \neconomy. If anyone would imagine the most major bridge in their \nmetropolitan area, the most major highway overpass, suddenly falling \ninto a river, you would understand. It is a bridge that takes people \ndowntown, that brings students to one of the biggest universities in \nthis country, and it brings hard-working Minnesotans to their jobs \nevery day. But most important, it is the bridge that connects countless \npeople with their families and friends.\n  On August 3, this Congress made a promise to the people of Minnesota \nthat we would help rebuild the bridge. Today I come to the floor to \nensure that we make good on that promise.\n  I am very happy with and I supported this effort to look at repairs \nacross the country. That is what we just voted on today, and it passed. \nBut I think we should make clear that appropriation did not include the \nmoney that Congress promised for the Minnesota bridge. It was used as \nthe key example of why we needed to make repairs across the country, \nbut it did not include the money to repair our bridge.\n  The last time I addressed this body, the day after the bridge \ncollapsed, I said the rebuilding effort is going to be a long process. \nIt is not just going to end tonight. Today I am here to take the next \nstep in that rebuilding process. Our goal is to get this bridge rebuilt \nand to get our metropolitan area moving again.\n  The Minnesota Department of Transportation concluded that the loss of \nthis critical bridge costs our economy $400,000 per day. This is \nprimarily due to lost travel time for commuters, for commercial \ntruckers, for businesses closed down. This means our economy has \nalready lost well over $8 million since the bridge collapsed.\n  As this fiscal year comes to a close, I am dedicated to getting the \nfunding for our State and the entire Midwest. We need to rebuild this \nbridge. We would like to rebuild this bridge as soon as possible, as I \nknow this country wants to do and this body pledged to do. That is why \nwe will work on this bill and whatever other bills we need to work on \nto get this funding for this bridge.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleagues to get bridge repair for every \nState across the country, but we are devoted to ensuring that Congress \nmake good on its promise and rebuild this bridge that is the symbol for \nwhy we need to make infrastructure repairs across this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11317-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, among the important issues I wish to \ndiscuss this morning is an important issue, an international border \nissue with our friends and neighbors in Canada and Mexico, that could \nhave severe implications for the social and economic ways of life for \nborder communities in my own State of Vermont but all across the \ncountry.\n  In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, a number of new \nborder security measures have been put in place, all with the express \ngoal of preventing another terrorist incident. I worked hard to provide \nbalance and needed resources and to ensure that in the intervening \nyears we did not focus solely on our southern border. I also have tried \nto convey to the administration and to this body something of the \nspecial relationship we have with our northern neighbor, Canada.\n  It is convenient to forget that most of the 9/11 hijackers entered \nthe United States with legal visas. They would not have been stopped at \nany border. Some were on secret watch lists by this Government, but \nthey were not being watched. And even later on, the Bush administration \nsent them official letters after they had killed themselves and \nthousands of innocent people in their attacks. The Bush administration \nhad them on a watch list but did not watch them. In reaction, after \nthese mistakes, the administration has demanded billions of dollars for \nconstructing border fences, seeking to develop and to deploy \nsurveillance technologies, and adding troops along our borders. Now in \ndoing this, we have snared some illicit drug shipments, we have snared \na few criminals. We have not picked up many terrorists.\n  Nobody questions that any country has a right to protect its borders, \nas we do to protect ours, but we should do it sensibly and \nintelligently. Instead, the administration's policy threatens to fray \nthe social fabric of countless communities that straddle the border. \nThey have needlessly offended our neighbors, they have sacrificed much \nof the traditional good will we have enjoyed, and they have undermined \nour own economy in border States. Local chambers of commerce along the \nborder estimate that the costs of the administration's plans will \namount to hundreds of billions of dollars and, I might say, the loss of \nthousands upon thousands of American jobs.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters about problems they have \nencountered at U.S. border crossings, from long traffic backups to \ninvasive searches and questions, to inadequate communications from \nFederal authorities about new facilities and procedures. Such a top-\ndown approach does not work well in interwoven communities along the \nborder where people cross daily from one side to the other for jobs, \nshopping, and cultural events.\n  I live an hour's drive from the Canadian border. Traditionally in my \nState, as in most border States, people go back and forth all the time. \nMany of us have family members in Canada. We have enjoyed an over \n5,000-mile-long unguarded frontier. Canada has been an important \ntrading partner. It has been a friendly neighbor not only to Vermont \nbut to the rest of the United States for more than 200 years. It is in \nthe best interest of both of our countries to keep those relationships \nas positive and productive as possible. Post 9/11, everyone on both \nsides of the border recognized the potential threat and security needs. \nWe have hardened security around the U.S. Capitol, hardened it around \nthe White House, and built fences near San Diego. But those procedures \ndo not work on Canusa Avenue in Beebe Plain, a two-lane road where one \nside of the road is Vermont and the other side is Quebec. That is \nactually true. This is a street, an avenue. On one side, you are in \nVermont; on the other side, you are in Quebec. What are we going to do, \nput an enormous barrier down the middle of the street? People are used \nto going back and forth to their neighbors to borrow a cup of flour or \nsomething such as that. Are they going to take two hours to go through \nsome kind of an unnecessary, baseless search?\n  And we have the Haskell Free Library and Opera House in Derby Line, \nVT, and Stanstead, Quebec. The library and opera house is half in Derby \nLine, VT, half in Stanstead, Quebec. It straddles the international \nborder. Mr. President, I invite you to come see that some time. It is a \nbeautiful piece of architecture.\n  That is why I am so troubled by the so-called Western Hemisphere \nTravel Initiatives, which would require individuals from the United \nStates, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean to present passports or other \ndocuments proving citizenship before entering the United States. This \nis a dramatic change in the way border crossings have been processed in \nthe western hemisphere since the Treaty of Paris set up the \ninternational boundary to Canada in 1783. That is already costing us \ngreatly.\n  The Departments of State and Homeland Security have been charged with \nimplementing this law. They should be coordinating their efforts with \nour neighbors in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean to ensure a smooth \ntransition at our borders. Unfortunately, as I detailed to Secretary \nRice and Secretary Chertoff on several occasions, there are serious \nproblems in the ways in which their agencies have pushed forward with \nimplementation of the\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nWestern Hemisphere Travel Initiative, before any of the necessary \ntechnology installation, infrastructure upgrades, or training takes \nplace in our border stations. If these critical features of deployment \nare not in place, we are going to see severe delays at our border, and \nlaw-abiding citizens from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the \nCaribbean will have great difficulties moving between our countries. \nMost importantly, a hasty implementation without assurances that the \ntechnology to be used is truly effective can actually result in a less \nsecure border.\n  Month after month, and despite hearing after hearing, the Department \nof Homeland Security, one of the least functional Departments in our \nGovernment, and the Department of State has highhandedly rushed to \nimpose this new border crossing plan on the America people before they \nare ready with the necessary technology, infrastructure, and training, \nand at every step their rosy assurances to the Congress and the \nAmerican people have been wrong. The administration's record on \nimplementing the new passport program is clear, and it has been \nabysmal. Hundreds of Vermonters have been calling my office for \nassistance in salvaging their travel plans. I know that Americans from \nother States have experienced high levels of concern and problems as \nwell. We have been doing what we can, passport by passport, but a large \nbacklog persists.\n  The huge passport backlogs prompted by the launch of DHS's \nrequirement for air travel passports earlier this year are just a taste \nof the chaos that is likely next summer when they want to start \nenforcing passport checks at our land and sea borders. DHS, which has \ndifficulty implementing most of their programs, said it will be very \neasy; look how well it is working for those who are flying to have the \npassports. They had press conferences, they had announcements, they got \ntheir talking points in the press on how well it is working. And then, \nwithin weeks, they had to pull it back. Why? Because it was not \nworking. They did not have anything in place to make it work. And that \nis only about 5 to 10 percent of the actual traffic that will go across \nthese borders. Well, think what is going to happen next summer when \nthey start enforcing passport checks at our land and sea borders. If \nthey cannot handle the small percentage, what is it going to be like \nwhen they have to do it for 100 percent?\n  I have been urging the State Department and the Department of \nHomeland Security not to rush into establishing rules and procedures \nthat shut our borders to legitimate travel and trade and, instead, work \nwith our neighbors, coordinate with our neighbors on security plans \nthat might actually work. We can be smarter and more effective, rather \nthan arrogantly insulting our traditional friends in Canada and Mexico. \nWe have worked with them on joint intelligence operations to identify \nand target terrorists. I would much rather see, instead of wasting tens \nof billions of dollars on a program that is not going to work, lose \nhundreds of billions of dollars in jobs in America, that we spend a \ntiny fraction of that talking about our northern border now, working \nwith our friends in Canada, and do a better job of intelligence and \nidentifying possible terrorists.\n  Unfortunately, my calls and the pleas from border communities from \nMaine to Alaska--for that matter, from California to Texas--have been \nlargely ignored. This administration is setting the American people up \nyet again for a fiasco of failure and frustration.\n  Since DHS and State keep saying WHTI is a congressionally mandated \nprogram, they should stop opposing the bicameral and bipartisan flow \nmoving through Congress to shift the new requirement to June of 2009. \nThey have been warned repeatedly that they are not ready. Even the \nfresh embarrassment of this passport debacle does not humble these \narrogant purveyors of a failed program. In the memorable words of \nPresident Bush: They are doing a ``heck of a job.'' The incompetence \nthat led to the human and economic tragedy of Katrina and its \naftermath, a tragedy that has not been rectified for more than 2 years, \nis striking again. By maintaining the fiction that they will be ready \nto implement the largest phase of this program next January, they are \nrecklessly risking the travel plans of millions of Americans, but they \nare also risking the economies of scores of States and communities.\n  Today is September 10. Tomorrow is the sixth anniversary of the \nattacks. I remember that day so well, being right here in Washington. \nThe administration's failure to prevent those attacks, to connect the \ndots, to take seriously the warnings of Richard Clarke, to listen to \nFBI field agents in Minnesota and Arizona, all because of the \npreeminence of its ideological agenda, is no longer subject to denial. \nThose failures before 9/11 are no excuse to indulge in authoritarian \nexcesses now and in the future.\n  When we sacrifice our freedoms, Americans lose and the terrorists \nhave taken from us what they cannot by force of arms. As we commemorate \nthe sacrifices of so many that took place 6 years ago tomorrow, we need \nto rededicate ourselves to American principles and values.\n  In the days ahead, the Judiciary Committee will be holding a series \nof hearings into important security matters. Today I am writing to the \nDirector of National Intelligence inviting him to join us on September \n25 for a hearing into warrantless surveillance of Americans.\n  I am not convinced that the sweeping scope and lack of checks and \nbalances in the recently enacted temporary amendment to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act are necessary to address the national \nsecurity concerns the administration had identified. As elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, we need to consider whether \nthere are more effective mechanisms to ensure appropriate oversight of \nsurveillance involving U.S. persons. We need to restore the proper \nbalance in order to maintain our security while preserving the \nconstitutional rights of Americans and providing appropriate oversight \nof executive action involving private communications of Americans.\n  Just this past weekend, we saw reports indicating that the \nPresident's surveillance program of Americans was much more extensive \nthan he had led us to believe. The New York Times reported that the FBI \nwas not just concerned about known or even suspected al-Qaida \noperatives, as the President spokespeople repeated over and over since \nthe programs became known in December 2005, but with casting a much \nwider net for information about what they termed a ``community of \ninterest.'' We need to examine how far this so-called link analysis has \ngone, how far down the daisy chain it has gone, what use was made of \nthe private call information, and whether private information of \ninnocent Americans has been collected and retained in Government \ndatabases without any authorization. How many innocent Americans who \ncalled someone else, who may have had some innocent contact with \nsomeone else, are now in a Government database and suddenly wonder why \nthey didn't get a job promotion or why their child wasn't able to get a \nstudent loan? It is telling that as this story became public--this \nalways happens only when it becomes public--the FBI responded by saying \nthat this data is ``no longer being used'' and, of course, ``was used \ninfrequently.'' Is the administration nonetheless going to prevent \nCongress from obtaining the information it needs to provide appropriate \noversight? Will our patriotism be threatened anew if Congress seeks to \nexamine the administration's overreaching and ineffectiveness? I hope \nnot, but we will have to see. The very first hearing we held before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee this year was on data mining. With the \nleadership shown by Senator Feingold, we have passed a reporting \nrequirement on Government data mining. Now we need to follow up and get \nthe information we need and exercise oversight authority.\n  The first week in October, we are looking forward to hearing from \nProfessor Jack Goldsmith, who served at a critical juncture in 2004 as \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel to the \nDepartment of Justice. In that capacity, he considered the \nconstitutional underpinnings of the President's program of warrantless \nwiretapping and helped lead the way to changes in that clandestine \nsurveillance affecting the rights of every single person in this \nChamber and all other Americans.\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\n  This past week, we were reminded yet again of the need to improve the \noperations of the Terrorist Screening Center, which failed to make \nwatch list records of suspected known terrorists available to front-\nline screening agents but continues to list the names of innocent \nAmericans in its watch list database. I won't go through all of the \nstories that come out of some of these things: a year-old child having \nto get a passport to fly and prove they are not a 45-year-old terror \nsuspect or one of the most senior Members of the Senate being blocked \n10 times from taking a flight he has been taking for 30 or 40 years \nbecause he is on a terrorist watch list. Somehow, they got the names \nmixed up. We saw a recent Government Accountability Office report on \nthe Department of Homeland Security with its failing grades, having \nfailed to achieve half its performance expectations since 2003. If you \nor I in college were to get a 50 or less on all our exams, we would be \nout on our ear in a moment. This is what we have seen from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. We heard from an independent \ncommission and former military leaders who indicated the Iraqi police \nforce is so riddled with corruption and sectarianism that they should \nbe disbanded, and after 4 years and hundreds of millions of American \ntaxpayer dollars, we should start over from scratch. We can't even find \nhalf the weapons we have given them until they turn up in terrorist \nhands. But we send these hundreds of millions of dollars to the Iraqi \npolice force and we tell the police in America: We have to cut out the \nCOPS Program. We don't have money for our American police. We can't \nafford to improve our American police because we have to send hundreds \nof millions of dollars to the Iraqi police. If I have to call a police \nofficer, I am going to call an American police officer. I would like to \nknow that some of that money was spent on them.\n  This past week also provided a reminder of the need to refocus our \nefforts on bin Laden. Six years after 9/11, he has not been brought to \njustice but continues to taunt us. He should never have been allowed to \nescape when our forces had him cornered in Tora Bora. One of the \ngreatest mistakes of this administration--not counting the great \nmistakes made before 9/11--was withdrawing our special forces and not \nproviding the support needed. That was another mistake driven by \nideology. Think how much better it would be today had they actually \nsucceeded in the one thing the whole Congress agreed on--to go and get \nbin Laden. They failed. The bipartisan leaders of the 9/11 Commission \nare right that the occupation of Iraq has provided a recruiting bonanza \nfor al-Qaida and a costly distraction. Iraq, a country that didn't have \nal-Qaida, is now a recruiting bonanza for them. We need to be smarter \nand more focused in countering terrorism.\n  How many costly mistakes are the American people going to be asked to \nbear? I hope all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, will join \ntogether in the days ahead as we did 6 years ago, when so many of us \nstood on this floor and joined hands to do the things that needed to be \ndone. The American people deserve a government that works and that \nworks for them. American freedom and values need to be defended and \nreinforced, not mortgaged to fleeting and ill-considered promises of \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11319-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR DANIEL BREWSTER\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the State of Maryland and the United \nStates lost a brave and committed public servant last month. Former \nSenator Daniel Brewster, who served in this esteemed Chamber during the \n1960s, died of cancer on August 19.\n  Few Americans have the political ancestry of Senator Brewster, who \nwas a direct descendant of Ben Franklin and the former Attorney General \nfor President Chester Arthur. Public service came naturally to this \nman, whose life and work showed his commitment to our country. He first \ngave to this country through his military service as a decorated war \nhero, wounded seven times during his service in Guam and Okinawa. Then \nhe served as an elected official for 18 years. He served in the \nMaryland House of Delegates starting in 1950, was elected to the House \nof Representatives in 1958 and then to the Senate in 1962.\n  Senator Brewster first came to politics as an advocate for civil \nrights. In his own Baltimore neighborhood, neighbors complained when he \ninvited African-American servicemen from World War II to his home. This \nwas an outrage to him. He would never slight a person, particularly \nsoldiers who had courageously served to defend the American flag. \nSenator Brewster went on to cosponsor the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nforever changing the course of history in this country.\n  Senate Brewster represented much of what is great about public \nservice: a desire and commitment to make this country better and \nstronger for every American, black and white, rich and poor, farmer and \nbusinessman.\n  Senator Brewster had some very trying times in his life: First, at \nthe age of 10 when his father died; then when he was beset with \npersonal struggles in the very public forum of public life. The lesson \nhe left for all of us is one can rise above adversity, even in the face \nof trying times, and continue to serve the people of this great Nation. \nHe did that and left this country and this Congress with a lasting \nlegacy of accomplishments.\n  He left another legacy quite apparent today, introducing some of our \ncountry's strongest leaders to the world of politics. House Speaker  \nNancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer both started their \npolitical careers working for Senator Brewster.\n  I am personally indebted to Senator Brewster for the wisdom and \nadvice he shared with me as a newly elected Senator. This past spring, \nhe, along with former Senators Joe Tydings and Charles Mathias, Jr., \nmet with me to share their insights.

BILLINGTON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, an important anniversary will be marked on \nSeptember 14, at the Library of Congress. Twenty years ago, in the \nGreat Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building, then-President Reagan \npresided over the swearing-in of Dr. James H. Billington as the 13th \nLibrarian of Congress.\n  When he was appointed, Dr. Billington brought great expertise to the \nLibrary, both as the world's premier scholar of Russian culture and \nhistory and as director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars. His vision, and the hard work of so many dedicated Library \nstaff members, has led to continued growth of the Library of Congress. \nHe has fulfilled the promise made on September 14, 1987--to make the \nriches of the Library more broadly available to ever widening circles \nof our society.\n  At the time, Senator Wendell Ford remarked that the Library of \nCongress ``represents our nation's commitment to a knowledgeable \ncitizenry.'' Dr. Billington has upheld that commitment by enhancing the \nLibrary and making its riches and inspiration available to all \nAmericans. Under his leadership, the Copyright Office, the Law Library, \nthe Congressional Research Service, and the National Library have \nseamlessly worked together to build the collections and preserve them \nfor future generations.\n  The Library's accomplishments of the last two decades are \nextraordinary. The collections have expanded by 50 million items, and \nstate-of-the art facilities have been built to ensure their long-term \npreservation. The establishment of the Kluge Center for Scholars and \nthe Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences have \nenriched not only the scholarly life of Washington but also have \nenabled Members of Congress to meet thought leaders and benefit from \ntheir perspectives. Also, the Library was a pioneer in online \ncollections and services, launching American Memory, THOMAS, the World \nDigital Library and resources for teachers, students and families \nacross the Nation and world.\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\n  The Library's pioneering work in education has had a great impact in \nmy home State of Illinois. The Library's educational mission, shaped by \nDr. Billington's vision, is that young people benefit from learning \nwith primary sources such as Lincoln's magnificent Gettysburg Address, \nseeing the Founding Father's notes and revisions to the Bill of Rights, \nand exploring maps and sound recordings to understand history and \nculture firsthand. As the Library developed and focused its massive \nresources in ways that teachers could explore and use for their \nclassrooms, Dr. Billington recognized the profound impact of \nincorporating primary sources into teacher education. Many of us in \nCongress recognized the potential around this idea and helped create \nand fund the Adventures of the American Mind, which is now poised to \nbecome a national program--Teaching with Primary Sources. The 10 \nuniversities in Illinois that have benefited from working with the \nLibrary have transformed their teacher education programs. I have seen \nfirst hand the programs and curricula that have been created using the \namazing resources from Congress's Library to improve teaching in our \nNation's schools.\n  Dr. Billington's energy is unflagging. He has led efforts to launch \nthe World Digital Library, the reinstallation of Thomas Jefferson's \nLibrary in the Jefferson Building, and the Library's celebration of the \nLincoln Bicentennial in 2009 and beyond. In short, I have valued and \nlook forward to continuing leadership from Dr. Billington. He and his \ncolleagues at the Library of Congress are a tremendous resource to our \nwork as a legislature.\n  The Library of Congress has benefited immeasurably from the first 20 \nyears of Jim Billington's leadership. We are grateful to him and \ncongratulate him, his wife Marjorie, and his family on this milestone \nof service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11320-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECOGNIZING TOSTAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during my time in the Senate, I have been \na vocal advocate of programs that help the nations of Africa improve \nthe living conditions of their citizens. Much of this work is done \nthrough dedicated nongovernmental organizations that work year after \nyear on issues of health, literacy, women's empowerment, democracy, \nhuman rights, and microfinance lending. Today I wish to recognize one \nsuch group, Tostan, which recently won the 2007 Conrad Hilton \nHumanitarian Prize for its extraordinary contributions to help \nalleviate human suffering in Africa.\n  Tostan means ``breakthrough'' in the Wolof language of Senegal. The \nefforts of Tostan have truly been a breakthrough in the West African \ncountries in which it works. Tostan was founded by a University of \nIllinois alumna, Molly Melching. When Molly arrived in Senegal in the \n1970s, she began teaching literacy through traditional African stories, \nsongs, and theater. Later, in 1991, she founded Tostan, which began \noffering a community empowerment program that helped Africans address \nproblems they found in their daily lives, while teaching reading, math, \nhealth, hygiene, problem solving, and management skills. In 1996, human \nrights and democracy components were added, with particular attention \ntoward ending domestic violence and the exploitation of children, \nempowering women, and expanding health and education for all.\n  The Hilton award recognizes Tostan for its ability to empower African \ncommunities, focusing on change from within and from the ground up. Its \nprogram has helped reduce infant and maternal mortality, improve \ncommunity health care and nutrition, reduce female genital cutting, and \nlower rates of domestic violence in the nine countries where it works. \nThousands of women and children have learned to read and perform basic \nmath and have used these skills to start local cooperatives, build \nstoves, and improve health care. It is not surprising, therefore, that \nTostan has been recognized by others for its outstanding work, \nincluding by UNESCO, which called it ``one of the most innovative \neducational programs.''\n  Tostan's work deserves to be applauded and should receive our \ncontinued support. As one of the world's richest countries, we have a \nresponsibility to help lift up the large numbers of people in our \ncountry and around the world who are still living in poverty. Again, I \ncongratulate Tostan for its important work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11320-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11320-S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, September 6, after less than \n12 hours of debate, the Senate passed by a vote of 81 to 12 the fiscal \nyear 2008 State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I think it was \nthe shortest amount of time we have taken to debate and pass this bill. \nI also think that on the whole we can be satisfied with the outcome. It \nis a bipartisan bill, and while neither I nor Senator Gregg, the \nranking member of the subcommittee who played an indispensable role in \ngetting it done, supports every provision in the bill, that is the \nnature of the process.\n  I also know there are things in this bill the administration supports \nand things they don't like. I would remind them that our allocation was \n$700 million below the President's budget, and the President \nunderfunded a number of programs that have strong bipartisan support--\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and malaria, to give one example. I \nwould hope the White House would recognize that we tried hard to fund \nnot only the President's priorities but also the requests of Senators \nof both parties. This is, as sometimes the White House needs to be \nreminded, a government of equal branches.\n  Senate conferees were named immediately after final passage, and I \nlook forward to sitting down with the House to finish this bill so we \ncan send it to the President for signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, the last vote on the State, Foreign Operations bill \ndid not occur until late at night, and Senators were anxious to go \nhome. I want to take this opportunity to again thank Senator Gregg and \nhis staff, Paul Grove, minority clerk for the subcommittee, whose good \nhumor and penchant for thoroughness and bipartisanship have served the \ncommittee extremely well. I also want to thank Michele Wymer, who \njoined the subcommittee's minority staff this year. Michele has been a \npleasure to work with. She did a superb job last week on the floor \nkeeping track of the flurry of amendments.\n  On the majority side, I want to thank Kate Eltrich, who for the past \n5 years has handled the State Department Operations appropriations. \nKate's budgetary skills, dating from her time at OMB during the Clinton \nadministration, are a great asset to the subcommittee. She has done an \nexcellent job and is someone whose judgment I have great confidence in. \nNikole Manatt joined the subcommittee staff earlier this year, and she \nhas already distinguished herself as energetic, willing and capable of \ntaking on any project, and is a pleasure to work with. J.P. Dowd, my \nlegislative director, spent most of last Thursday on the Senate floor \nhelping out in more ways than I can count. I want to thank Tim Rieser, \nthe majority clerk, who has worked for the Senate for 22 years, either \nas a staff member in my office or, since 1989, for the Appropriations \nCommittee. Tim was my lead staff member on this bill. Tim and Paul \nGrove have worked together to draft these bills year after year, and to \ndeal with the amendments on the floor. Last Thursday, we disposed of 73 \namendments. That is no small feat, and the staff deserves our thanks \nfor the long hours and hard work that made it possible.\n  Among the other Appropriations Committee staff whose contributions to \nthis process were indispensable are Richard Larson and his outstanding \nstaff in Editorial and Printing, and chief clerk Bob Putnam and Jack \nConway, who make sure our numbers add up as they are supposed to.\n  The funds in this bill support lifesaving programs for the poorest \npeople in Africa. They help protect the economic and security interests \nof this country and our allies from South America to South Asia. In a \nworld as complex and dangerous as this, we should be doing far more to \nexert U.S. leadership, particularly in countries and regions plagued by \npoverty, injustice, and conflict or where the United States is regarded \nunfavorably or misunderstood. We have done our best\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nwith what we have to spend, and if used wisely, the funds in this bill \nwill advance U.S. interests and improve the lives of countless people \nless fortunate than we are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11321-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Private First Class Dane Balcon\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to reflect on the \nlife and service of a fallen Coloradan: PFC Dane Balcon of Colorado \nSprings.\n  Private Balcon graduated from Sand Creek High School in 2006, joined \nthe Army, and was deployed to Iraq in July with the 3rd Brigade, 1st \nCavalry Division, out of Fort Hood, TX. Private Balcon was killed last \nWednesday alongside CPL William T. Warford, III, of Temple, TX, when a \nroadside bomb exploded near their vehicle. Dane Balcon was 19 years \nold.\n  Private Balcon was looking forward to a long career in the military. \nSince he was 3 years old he dreamed of being a soldier, of following \nthe path of service that his father, John Balcon, and his mother, Carla \nSizer, chose. Dane was eager for the opportunity to serve in Iraq, and \nwas dismayed when his unit's deployment was delayed. He knew that the \nlonger he was at Fort Hood, the longer another soldier would have to \nstay in theater. ``Every day I stay at Fort Hood,'' he told his mother, \n``someone is away from their family.'' He wanted to get into the fight \nand lift his weight, so that the weight on others might be lifted.\n  Dane's loss has left a hole for his community, his friends, and his \nfamily that no words can ever fill. At Sand Creek High School, Dane's \nfriends remember a young man dedicated to his future in the military. \nHe joined the ROTC program, was in the drum line, and had a voracious \nappetite for learning the soldier's craft.\n  His charm won him widespread admiration and friendship. His habit of \nplaying his drumsticks alongside an imaginary chorus during the school \nday exasperated his teachers, but his jokes would gain their smiles, \nand his heart would earn their respect. When he deployed in July, their \nthoughts and prayers, like those of his classmates, friends, and \nfamily, were with him.\n  The values that led Private Balcon to enlist and to serve on the \nbattlefields of Iraq are the values that have guided American soldiers \nfor more than two centuries. ``Duty, honor, country,'' GEN Douglas \nMacArthur told young soldiers at West Point in 1962, ``these are the \nwords that dictate what a soldier wants to be, can be, and will be. . . \n. They teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but \nhumble and gentle in success; not to substitute words for action; not \nto seek the path of comfort, but to face the stress and spur of \ndifficulty and challenge; to learn to stand up in the storm, but to \nhave compassion on those who fall; to master yourself before you seek \nto master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; \nto learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the \nfuture, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never take \nyourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the \nsimplicity of true greatness; the open mind of true wisdom, the \nmeekness of true strength.''\n  PVT Dane Balcon, who dreamt of serving his country and of devoting \nhis life to its protection, embodied this creed. He donned the \nsoldier's uniform at the first opportunity, he showed his bravery on \nthe battlefield, and he perished in service.\n  Duty, honor, country, GEN MacArthur's ``hallowed words'' characterize \nPrivate Balcon's sacrifice. They are the values of America's great \nsoldiers, the giants to whom we owe our freedom. Theirs is a debt we \ncannot repay.\n  To Carla and John, I cannot imagine the sorrow that you are feeling \nwith the loss of your son. I hope that in time your grief will be \nsalved by your pride in your son's extraordinary dedication to service. \nDane served the Nation with honor and dignity. His sacrifice will never \nbe forgotten.\n\n\n                   Chief Warrant Officer Scott Oswell\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life, service, and \nsacrifice of CWO Scott Oswell, who died on July 4 when his helicopter \nwent down in Mosul, Iraq. Chief Oswell was on his second tour of duty \nin Iraq, piloting OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopters with the 4th \nSquadron, 6th U.S. Air Cavalry out of Fort Lewis. He was 33.\n  Scott grew up the son of an Army officer and was a stoic servant of \nthe greater good. He joined the Marines soon after graduating from Air \nAcademy High School in Colorado Springs, CO. He later transferred to \nthe Army, where he became a helicopter pilot and, in 2006, earned his \ninstructor rating.\n  At his funeral at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver, friends and \nfamily spoke of Scott's devotion to his family and to his service. He \nwas ``family man'' to his wife, Cheri, and to his three children, \nCaitlyn, Amanda, and Ian. He was a patient ``big brother'' to the \npilots he taught. And he was a brave soldier to those with whom he \nserved in Iraq, willing to risk his life to defeat an enemy or to lift \nothers to safety.\n  For his service to his country and his unit, and for his death on \nIndependence Day on a mission to save another, Chief Oswell will always \nbe remembered as a patriot. But he is also a patriot in a larger sense. \nFrances Wright, one of America's most famous lecturers, reminds us that \npatriotism is a virtue that characterizes an individual's dedication to \nthe public good, to the preference of the interests of the many to the \ninterests of the few, and to the love of liberty. ``A patriot,'' she \ntold an Indiana crowd on July 4, 1828, ``is a useful member of society, \ncapable of enlarging all minds and bettering all hearts with which he \ncomes in contact; a useful member of the human family, capable of \nestablishing fundamental principles and of merging his own interests, \nthose of his associates, and those of his Nation in the interests of \nthe human race.''\n  Chief Oswell wore his patriotism with humility. He did the job, and \nhe did it well amid the perils of war. At Scott's memorial service, a \nfellow soldier recalled how they flew out to examine a suspicious \nflicker of light along a supply route to Baghdad. Finding an insurgent \nwith a rocket-propelled grenade in hand, Chief Oswell hovered within \nthe enemy's range, committed to preventing an escape. ``This guy is not \ngoing to get away,'' he said.\n  Even with the best training and preparation, keeping calm and \ncomposed in difficult circumstances demands something more from an \nindividual. Chief Oswell had what it takes. His friends recall that on \nmissions he would often sing popular children's songs. He was steady \nand stoic.\n  CWO Scott Oswell sacrificed his life for this Nation as a patriot, in \nservice to something larger than himself. He accepted the great risks \nof being a pilot with a smile and used his talents and temperament to \nteach others what he had learned. His extraordinary courage is a lesson \nto us all, a debt we cannot repay, a loss we cannot replace. He was a \nfather, a teacher, a pilot, and a patriot. We are humbled by his \nservice and his sacrifice.\n  To Chief Oswell's wife Cheri, to his children, Caitlyn, Amanda, and \nIan, and to his parents, Barry and Nancy, I know that even now, no \nwords can fill the hole left by Scott's death. I pray that you can find \ncomfort in knowing that he was always, and will remain always, a true \npatriot. He will endure in our hearts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11321-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11321-S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CELEBRATING EL GRITO DE DOLORES\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, next week, Idahoans of Hispanic and \nLatino heritage will be joining others in the United States and Mexico \nto celebrate the beginning of the decade-long battle to liberate Mexico \nfrom Spain almost 200 years ago. They gather to celebrate ``El Grito de \nDolores,'' or ``The Cry from Dolores,'' issued by Father Miguel \nGregorio Antonio Ignacio Hidalgo y Costilla Gallaga Mondarte \nVillasenor, better known as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Mexican priest \nand revolutionary leader. Cura Hidalgo, although ethnically a criollo, \nor Mexican of Spanish or European descent, became sympathetic at a \nyoung age to the terrible plight of the Indians and mestizos--those of \nmixed ancestry--who had been subjugated by the Spanish for 300 years in \nMexico. Hidalgo was an intellectual, well-versed in a number of \nlanguages and well-read. Some historians tell that his classmates \ncalled him ``el zorro,'' or ``the Fox.'' He was\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nalso known to be an entrepreneur and humanitarian. With the intention \nto better the plight of the indigenous people of his community, he \ntaught them carpentry, harness-making, wool-weaving and blacksmithing \nand encouraged local artisans. He also cultivated vineyards and olive \ngroves. In the early 1800s, he became involved in a movement to \noverthrow the Spanish-led Government of Mexico, then called ``New \nSpain.'' Although led by a group of criollo intellectuals, the movement \naimed to unify and energize the indigenous people and mestizos against \ntheir Spanish overlords. Due to a breach of intelligence, the \nconspirators were discovered, and Hidalgo gambled--and won.\n  Hidalgo's call to independence was obviously not recorded, and \nhistorical accounts cannot agree on the words of his exact speech, but \nit is understood that early on the morning of September 16, 1810, Cura \nHidalgo, instead of delivering mass, rang the church bell and delivered \na call to arms that has come to be known as ``El Grito de Dolores,'' \nor, simply, ``El Grito.'' The armed Indians and mestizos, under the \ncommand of Hidalgo, fellow revolutionary Ignacio Allende and others, \nmarched to the provincial capitol, Guanajunto, and, just 2 weeks after \n``El Grito,'' won a stunning battle with their now 20,000-strong army. \nAlthough Hidalgo was captured 9 months later and executed on July 30, \n1811, the storm that had been unleashed could not be stopped. Mexico \nsuccessfully fought and won its independence from Spain in 1821.\n  Idahoans and other Americans of Mexican descent have a proud heritage \nin this early freedom fighter. Much like the tradition of our American \nFounding Fathers, the seeds of revolution sprouted in the fertile soil \nof intellectual debate and a recognition of the inherent equality of \nall human beings regardless of race, gender or ethnicity. As people in \nIdaho and across the United States celebrate Mexico's independence and \nthose young freedom fighters 200 years ago, parallels are strong with \nMexican Americans today who are fighting to keep the United States free \nfrom terror here at home. How fitting, then, for the week of September \n11 that we also remember Hidalgo's ``El Grito!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11322-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. PHILIP R. LEE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Presdient, today I recognize Dr. Philip R. \nLee, a pioneering Californian and fellow San Franciscan, who has been a \ndynamic leader in health policy for more than 40 years. This September, \nthe health policy program that Dr. Lee founded 35 years ago at the \nUniversity of California, San Francisco, UCSF, will be renamed the \nPhilip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies in his honor.\n  Dr. Lee is a giant among health professionals. His work in health \ncare policy continues to affect how millions of Americans receive \nhealth care today. He served as Assistant Secretary for Health on two \noccasions; under President Johnson in the sixties and under President \nClinton in the nineties. During the first 8 months of his tenure as \nAssistant Secretary in 1965, more than 80 landmark healthcare bills \nwere passed including Medicare and Medicaid; health professions \neducation assistance amendments; heart disease, cancer, and stroke \namendments; the war on poverty; Job Corps; food stamps; and Head Start, \nto name a few.\n  Especially significant was Dr. Lee's work in developing policies for \nthe newly created Medicare Program, his work to fund graduate medical \neducation, and the work he is most proud of, the desegregation of 1,000 \nof the Nation's 7,000 hospitals at a time when discrimination was a \nreal problem in the Nation.\n  I am proud to say that as mayor of San Francisco in 1985, I appointed \nDr. Lee as the first president of the newly established health \ncommission of the city and county of San Francisco. He was in charge of \nSan Francisco's public health, mental health and substance abuse \nservices, as well as San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Lee served the \nhealth care needs of the residents of San Francisco during challenging \ntimes when the city was in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. He has \nserved our city well.\n  Dr. Lee's influence also extends to health care education. As UCSF's \nthird chancellor, he was charged with the instruction of future health \ncare professionals and the running of a premier research university. As \nchancellor, he was known for his commitment to academic excellence and \nhis efforts to stimulate minority recruitment and enrollment. When Dr. \nLee founded the Institute of Health Policy Studies at UCSF, it was the \nfirst health policy unit in an academic health sciences center to bring \ntogether a multidisciplinary group of faculty to address complex health \nissues.\n  Dr. Lee's career has been devoted to improving health care and public \nhealth for all people. He has an unwavering commitment to the needs of \nthe disadvantaged, including the elderly, the disabled, and those \nwithout access to care. Yet he is able to encourage evenhanded policy \ndebate among parties with highly divergent views in a manner that \nencourages creative innovation.\n  He continues to be a valued teacher and mentor for many who are now \nin key positions as researchers, teachers, and as leaders in the health \nprofessions. It is fitting that the institute he founded three decades \nago, the UCSF School of Medicine Institute for Health Policy Studies, \nwill now be re-named the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy \nStudies.\n  I wish to congratulate Dr. Lee on this tremendous honor and thank him \nfor his service to the city of San Francisco and the State of \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11322-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHAWN JOHNSON\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Not only is \nthis agency profitable and strong, but part of its business practice is \nto contribute to our great city and region in the aftermath of the \nstorms that completely destroyed 18,000 businesses in Louisiana alone.\n  When Katrina hit, the Agency evacuated to Baton Rouge and Monroe and \nprovided housing and accommodations for employees and their families. \nSoon the firm was up and running again in New Orleans and promoting the \ncity's recovery. For instance, it was the Peter A. Mayer agency that \ndeveloped the ``Come fall in love all over again'' television and print \ntourism campaign. Tourism is our State's second largest industry, and \nthe agency's help getting the word out that we are ready for tourists \nwas invaluable.\n  Not only did the agency help the city and region, but it looked \ninward to create a support network for its own employees whose common \nthread was recovering from Katrina. The agency created a Web site, \nLivesConnected.com, where employees, though oral history, told their \nKatrina stories.\n  Peter Mayer founded the firm in 1967 with just three employees and \n$200,000 in billing. It has become one of the largest advertising, \npublic relations and marketing agencies in the South\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\nand an economic anchor in New Orleans, with a staff of 125 and annual \nbillings of more than $75 million. The news media has recognized the \nagency's famed corporate culture, with New Orleans City Business and \nGambit Weekly each naming it one of the top places to work in New \nOrleans.\n  In celebration of its 40th anniversary and in an effort to help \nbeautify our city, the agency last week began planting 40 trees in City \nPark to replace those lost in Katrina. On Friday evening, the agency \ncelebrated its history with all past and present employees at the \nAudubon Tea Room. I thank the Senate for recognizing this outstanding \nagency for its commitment to excellence and public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11323-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagreed to the report of the committee on conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2669) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 601 of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The message also announced that the House passed the following bill, \nin which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2786.

A bill to amend the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984 to \ndesignate the Copper Salmon Wilderness and to amend the Wild and Scenic \nRivers Act to designate segments of the North and South Forks of the \nElk River in the\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\nState of Oregon as wild or scenic rivers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Oregon's coastal forests contain many \nhidden gems. Within the lush rainforests of the Siskiyou-Rogue River \nNational Forest, we find one of these gems--the headwaters of the North \nFork of the Elk River, known as the Copper Salmon area. Today I \nintroduce a bill to protect this natural treasure, which lies adjacent \nto the existing Grassy Knob Wilderness.\n  During the last decade, a dedicated group of local conservationists \nhas been working hard to protect Copper Salmon. It is one of the last \nintact watersheds on the southwest Oregon coast. Copper Salmon is \nrenowned among fishermen. For anglers seeking to catch a trophy chinook \nsalmon or winter steelhead for the barbeque or smoker in Oregon, this \nis the place. Few watersheds in Oregon can match the Elk River \ndrainage. Even after torrential rainstorms, anglers are still able to \nfish the Elk. When 25 inches of rain fell over 18 straight days last \nDecember, the Elk was still fishable while the other rivers in \nsouthwest Oregon, Rogue, Umpqua, Coquille, were clouded with debris and \nmud. Copper Salmon also supports healthy populations of blacktail deer, \nelk, black bear and mountain lion. This beautiful gem on the \nsouthwestern Oregon coast provides great and challenging opportunities \nhere to hunt in freedom and solitude.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of the watershed in this region is still \nintact. The Elk has healthy wild runs of winter steelhead and chinook. \nIt also has some coho salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout, as well as \nresident cutthroats and rainbow trout. Oregon State University \nresearchers believe it is one of the healthiest anadromous fish streams \nin the lower 48. There is a reason why: intact habitat.\n  My bill would provide permanent protections to 13,700 acres of new \nwilderness. It would also designate 9.3 miles of wild and scenic \nrivers. Wilderness and wild and scenic designations will protect this \nwatershed and ensure that hunting and fishing opportunities are \nprotected in the Copper Salmon area. Wilderness designation is popular \nin the local area, as evidenced by resolutions in favor of it from the \nPort Orford Chamber of Commerce, the mayor of Port Orford, and the \nCurry County Commissioners. Additionally, a majority of the guides, \nlodges and local citizens have supported this proposal. It is time now \nthat we all come together and permanently protect this special place.\n  As Oregon's population grows, I believe that we must match this \ngrowth and the corresponding development with protection of our natural \nheritage. Protection of these areas will ensure that Oregonians and \nvisitors will continue to enjoy opportunities to hike in the \nwilderness, hunt healthy populations of elk, blacktail deer, black \nbear, mountain lion and to catch trophy-sized chinook and steelhead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to maintain the free flow of information to the \npublic by providing conditions for the federally compelled disclosure \nof information by certain persons connected with the news media; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to establish a reporter's privilege. The situation in the \nUnited States today is that newspaper reporters, journalists, are \nsubject to a compulsory process to disclose confidential informants. \nThe matter came to a head with the incarceration of a New York Times \nreporter, Judith Miller, for an extended period of time.\n  Last year, Senator Lugar and I introduced legislation to establish a \nreporter's privilege. Since that time, the legislation has been revised \nto provide limitations where national security is involved or where the \nreporter may be the eyewitness to a specific event.\n  This legislation differs from S. 1267, the bill which has been \nintroduced by Senator Lugar and Senator Dodd, in that it tightens up \nexceptions where, for reasons of substantial public importance, the \nprivilege will be limited. But today, there is a patchwork quality in \nthe law, with the circuits going in different directions. Privileges \nare accorded under many State laws.\n  This bill has very widespread support. So on behalf of Senator \nSchumer, Senator Lugar, and myself, I introduce this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce, with \n     Senators Schumer and Lugar, the Free Flow of Information Act \n     of 2007. This bill would establish a Federal reporter's \n     privilege to protect the free flow of information between \n     journalists and confidential sources. It seeks to reconcile \n     reporters' need to maintain confidentiality, in order to \n     ensure that sources will speak openly and freely with the \n     media, with the\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\n     public's right to effective law enforcement and fair trials. \n     Senator Lugar and I introduced a similar bill last year, \n     which garnered the support of 10 cosponsors from both sides \n     of the aisle, as well as 39 media organizations, including \n     the Washington Post, The Hearst Corporation, Time Warner, ABC \n     Inc., CBS, CNN, The New York Times Company, and National \n     Public Radio.\n       There has been a growing consensus that we need to \n     establish a Federal journalists' privilege to protect the \n     integrity of the news gathering process, a process that \n     depends on the free flow of information between journalists \n     and whistleblowers, as well as other confidential sources.\n       Under my chairmanship, the Judiciary Committee held three \n     separate hearings on this issue at which we heard from 20 \n     witnesses, including prominent journalists like William \n     Safire and Judith Miller, current and former Federal \n     prosecutors, including Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, \n     and First Amendment scholars.\n       These witnesses demonstrated that there are two vital, \n     competing concerns at stake. On one hand, reporters cite the \n     need to maintain confidentiality in order to ensure that \n     sources will speak openly and freely with the news media. The \n     renowned William Safire, former columnist for the New York \n     Times, testified that ``the essence of news gathering is \n     this: if you don't have sources you trust and who trust you, \n     then you don't have a solid story--and the public suffers for \n     it.'' Reporter Matthew Cooper of Time Magazine said this to \n     the Judiciary Committee: ``As someone who relies on \n     confidential sources all the time, I simply could not do my \n     job reporting stories big and small without being able to \n     speak with officials under varying degrees of anonymity.''\n       On the other hand, the public has a right to effective law \n     enforcement and fair trials. Our judicial system needs access \n     to information in order to prosecute crime and to guarantee \n     fair administration of the law for plaintiffs and defendants \n     alike. As a Justice Department representative told the \n     Committee, prosecutors need to ``maintain the ability, in \n     certain vitally important circumstances, to obtain \n     information identifying a source when a paramount interest is \n     at stake. For example, obtaining source information may be \n     the only available means of preventing a murder, locating a \n     kidnapped child, or identifying a serial arsonist.''\n       As Federal courts have considered these competing \n     interests, they adopted rules that went in several different \n     directions. Rather than a clear, uniform standard for \n     deciding claims of journalist privilege, the Federal courts \n     currently observe a ``crazy quilt'' of different judicial \n     standards.\n       The current confusion began 33 years ago, when the Supreme \n     Court decided Branzburg v. Hayes. The Court held that the \n     press's First Amendment right to publish information does not \n     include a right to keep information secret from a grand jury \n     investigating a criminal matter. The Supreme Court also held \n     that the common law did not exempt reporters from the duty of \n     every citizen to provide information to a grand jury.\n       The Court reasoned that just as newspapers and journalists \n     are subject to the same laws and restrictions as other \n     citizens, they are also subject to the same duty to provide \n     information to a court as other citizens. However, Justice \n     Powell, who joined the 5-4 majority, wrote a separate \n     concurrence in which he explained that the Court's holding \n     was not an invitation for the Government to harass \n     journalists. If a journalist could show that the grand jury \n     investigation was being conducted in bad faith, the \n     journalist could ask the court to quash the subpoena. Justice \n     Powell indicated that courts might assess such claims on a \n     case-by-case basis by balancing the freedom of the press \n     against the obligation to give testimony relevant to criminal \n     conduct.\n       In attempting to apply Justice Powell's concurring opinion, \n     Federal courts have split on the question of when a \n     journalist is required to testify. In the 33 years since \n     Branzburg, the Federal courts are split in at least three \n     ways in their approaches to Federal criminal and civil cases.\n       With respect to Federal criminal cases, five circuits--the \n     First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits--have \n     applied Branzburg so as to not allow journalists to withhold \n     information absent governmental bad faith. Four other \n     circuits--the Second, Third, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits--\n     recognize a qualified privilege, which requires courts to \n     balance the freedom of the press against the obligation to \n     provide testimony on a case-by-case basis. The law in the \n     District of Columbia Circuit is unsettled.\n       With respect to Federal civil cases, nine of the 12 \n     circuits apply a balancing test when deciding whether \n     journalists must disclose confidential sources. One circuit \n     affords journalists no privilege in any context. Two other \n     circuits have yet to decide whether journalists have any \n     privilege in civil cases. Meanwhile, 49 States plus the \n     District of Columbia have recognized a privilege within their \n     own jurisdictions. Thirty-one States plus the District of \n     Columbia have passed some form of reporter's shield statute, \n     and 18 States have recognized a privilege at common law.\n       There is little wonder that there is a growing consensus \n     concerning the need for a uniform journalists' privilege in \n     Federal courts. This system must be simplified.\n       Today, we move toward resolving this problem by introducing \n     the Free Flow of Information Act. The purpose of this bill is \n     to guarantee the flow of information to the public through a \n     free and active press, while protecting the public's right to \n     effective law enforcement and individuals' rights to the fair \n     administration of justice.\n       This bill also provides ample protection to the public's \n     interest in law enforcement and fair trials. The bill \n     provides a qualified privilege for reporters to withhold from \n     Federal courts, prosecutors, and other Federal entities, \n     confidential source information and documents and materials \n     obtained or created under a promise of confidentiality. \n     However, the bill recognizes that, in certain instances, the \n     public's interest in law enforcement and fair trials \n     outweighs a reporter's interest in keeping a source \n     confidential. Therefore, it allows courts to require \n     disclosure where certain criteria are met.\n       In most criminal investigations and prosecutions, the \n     Federal entity seeking the reporter's source information must \n     show that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a \n     crime has occurred, and that the reporter's information is \n     essential to the prosecution or defense. In criminal \n     investigations and prosecutions of leaks of classified \n     information, the Federal entity seeking disclosure must \n     additionally show that the leak caused significant, clear, \n     and articulable harm to the national security. In noncriminal \n     actions, the Federal entity seeking source information must \n     show that the reporter's information is essential to the \n     resolution of the matter.\n       In all cases and investigations, the Federal entity must \n     demonstrate that nondisclosure would be contrary to the \n     public interest. In other words, the court must balance the \n     need for the information against the public interest in \n     newsgathering and the free flow of information.\n       Further, the bill ensures that Federal Government entities \n     do not engage in ``fishing expeditions'' for a reporter's \n     information. The information a reporter reveals must, to the \n     extent possible, be limited to verifying published \n     information and describing the surrounding circumstances. The \n     information must also be narrowly tailored to avoid \n     compelling a reporter to reveal peripheral or speculative \n     information.\n       Finally, the Free Flow of Information Act adds layers of \n     safeguards for the public. Reporters are not allowed to \n     withhold information if a Federal court concludes that the \n     information is needed for the defense of our Nation's \n     security, as long as it outweighs the public interest in \n     newsgathering and maintains the free flow of information to \n     citizens, or to prevent an act of terrorism. Similarly, \n     journalists may not withhold information reasonably necessary \n     to stop a kidnapping or a crime that could lead to death or \n     physical injury. Also, the bill ensures that both crime \n     victims and criminal defendants will have a fair hearing in \n     court. Under this bill, a journalist who is an eyewitness to \n     a crime or tort or takes part in a crime or tort may not \n     withhold that information. Journalists should not be \n     permitted to hide from the law by writing a story and then \n     claiming a reporter's privilege.\n       It is time to simplify the patchwork of court decisions and \n     legislation that has grown over the last 3 decades. It is \n     time for Congress to clear up the ambiguities journalists and \n     the Federal judicial system face in balancing the protections \n     journalists need in providing confidential information to the \n     public with the ability of the courts to conduct fair and \n     accurate trials. I urge my colleagues to support this \n     legislation and help create a fair and efficient means to \n     serve journalists and the news media, prosecutors and the \n     courts, and most importantly the public interest on both ends \n     of the spectrum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11330-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11330-S11331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 312--HONORING THE SACRIFICE AND COURAGE OF THE 6 \nMINERS WHO WERE TRAPPED, THE 3 RESCUE WORKERS WHO WERE KILLED, AND THE \n MANY OTHERS WHO WERE INJURED IN THE CRANDALL CANYON MINE DISASTER IN \n  UTAH, AND RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY AND THE RESCUE CREWS FOR THEIR \n         OUTSTANDING EFFORTS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TRAGEDIES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 314\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas, when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas these problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas, as recently as 2000, the average person with \n     celiac disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas \\1/2\\ of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can only be treated by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of skin and other \n     organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2007, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, the Celiac Disease \n     Foundation, the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, \n     and the Oklahoma Celiac Support Group No. 5 of the Celiac \n     Sprue Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11331-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11331-S11332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2790.

Mr. President, we haven't made as much progress on the \nTransportation bill as I had wished, but we\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\nare making progress. This is what happens with these complicated bills \non occasion. Tomorrow night people should expect votes into the night. \nIt will not be an early evening tomorrow. We have a lot to do on this \nbill. I have spoken to the distinguished Republican leader. Senator \nMcConnell said they will have an alternative to the Mexican truck \nmeasure offered by Senator Dorgan. Hopefully, sometime in the morning \nwe can get those teed up for a vote. We also have been told by Senator \nCoburn that he has a number of amendments he wishes to offer. He said \nhe would be here at 10:30 in the morning to begin offering those \namendments. I have found Senator Coburn in the past doesn't need to \ntalk very long, doesn't want to talk very long. I am sure that will be \nthe case with this bill. I am glad he is coming over in the morning at \n10:30. If others have amendments to offer, they should do so. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Coburn has a number of amendments. If that is the \ncase and we can't stack these votes, what we will do is, the first vote \ncould come as early as 11 o'clock or thereabouts tomorrow.\n  We have a lot to do. The fiscal year is coming to a close, and we \nhave a number of must-do issues. We will work on those. I have spoken \ntoday, as I indicated, to the distinguished Republican leader about how \nwe would proceed next week on Iraq matters. I think we are making \nprogress on how we should proceed. These are very hotly contested \nissues, very important. We want to make sure people have the \nopportunity to speak on this without delaying things for an extended \nperiod of time.\n\n  Tomorrow morning I am going to ask consent to go to conference on \nH.R. 1538, which is the Wounded Warrior/military pay raise bill. There \nwas a Republican objection to that request the last time. I hope this \ntime the result will be different so we can send this important bill, \nwhich means so much to our men in uniform, to conference. We need to \nsend that to conference. So we will proceed to that unanimous consent \nrequest tomorrow morning. I will not do that tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11352-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PANCREATIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.

We hope to get \nthose cleared for the President tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/10/senate-section/article/S11353-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
