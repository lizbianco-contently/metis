Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of David H. Petraeus to be \nGeneral, United States Army.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 45 minutes of debate, with the time to be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Michigan and the Republican leader or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to express \nmy support for the nomination of LTG David H. Petraeus, U.S. Army, for \nappointment to the grade of General and assignment as Commander, \nMultinational Force--Iraq.\n  General Petraeus is presently serving as Commanding General, U.S. \nArmy Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's leader \ndevelopment, professional military education, doctrine development, and \nlessons learned center. This is the place where the Army focuses its \nattention and its greatest professional capabilities on developing \nleaders, on military education, on developing doctrine, and on learning \nthe lessons from previous conflicts and challenges. As a matter of \nfact, the Army and Marine Corps' newly issued counterinsurgency manual \nwas written under the command and guidance of General Petraeus at \nLeavenworth.\n  General Petraeus had two previous tours of duty in Iraq. The first \nwas in 2003 when he was Commanding General of the 101st Airborne \nDivision, which was headquartered in Mosul, Iraq. General Petraeus' \nsecond tour in Iraq was from May 2004 to September 2005, when he was \nCommander, Multinational Security Transition Command--Iraq/Commander, \nNATO Training Mission--Iraq. In that capacity, he was responsible for \nthe organizing, training, and equipping of Iraqi security forces.\n  General Petraeus' nomination to become the Commander of Multinational \nForces--Iraq may be the single most important command in the Nation's \ndefense establishment. The Nation will entrust him with the operational \ncommand and the welfare of over 130,000 American service members who \nare presently in Iraq, and of those who may be deployed to Baghdad as \npart of the President's planned increase in the middle of a protracted \nand bloody sectarian battle over the future of Iraq.\n  General Petraeus is professionally qualified for this command. He is \nwidely recognized for the depth and breadth of his education, training, \nand operational experience. Noteworthy is his recent leadership of the \nnew Army/Marine Corps manual. He testified that he believes the new \nmilitary strategy for Iraq will work, and that the U.S. military forces \nunder his command will be able to successfully accomplish their \nmission. We would not want a commander who did not believe in his \nmission and in the troops under his command. I pray he is correct.\n  I am obviously very concerned over a strategy that relies on the \nIraqis meeting their commitments when they have repeatedly failed to do \nso in the past. I am obviously concerned about a strategy which is \nbased on an increased military presence, when expert after expert, \nincluding military commander after military commander, has told us \nthere is no military solution in Iraq; that the only way to end the \nviolence in Iraq is for the Iraqis to reach a political settlement.\n  I am deeply concerned that this new strategy, I believe, is based on \nthe wrong assumption--that there is a military solution to a sectarian \nwar--when in fact the only solution to a sectarian conflict is for \nthose groups to finally share power, share resources, including \nresolving the differences over autonomy that can end the violence. That \nis not just me saying that; that is also what the Iraqi President has \nsaid repeatedly--that it is the Iraqi political leaders' failure to \nreach a political settlement that is the cause of the continuing \nviolence.\n\n  That being the case, I don't believe--and I don't think a majority of \nthis body believes--that an increase in troops going into the middle of \nthe neighborhoods of Baghdad and staying there--``holding,'' as we \nsay--is going to contribute to a successful conclusion of our presence \nin Iraq. It is not going to help the Iraqis succeed, to put our troops \nin their neighborhoods in the middle of the sectarian strife. We are \ngoing to add targets without adding to the essential need of the Iraqis \nto face a reality--to stare at their options, to look into an abyss--\ncivil war or one nation? That has to be their choice. We cannot make it \nfor them. We can make it easier or harder for them to do it.\n  The question is whether adding troops into that sectarian cauldron is \ngoing to contribute to their reaching a political solution or indeed \nwill delay the day, as some of our commanders have said, when they will \nreach a political settlement. As a matter of fact, General Casey, the \ncurrent commander, emphasized this point on January 2:\n  The longer we in the U.S. continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's \nsecurity, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to make \nthe hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.\n  General Abizaid said the following:\n\n       It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do the work.\n\n  Then he said this:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevents the Iraqis \n     from doing more, from taking responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  That is what General Abizaid said in November.\n  So those are the expressions of our top military commanders who are \nthere now. I believe they are right. But we need a commander in Iraq. \nGeneral Casey is retiring. The question is not whether we agree with a \nparticular strategy--and we will have an opportunity, hopefully next \nweek, to vote on whether we agree with the increase of the American \nmilitary presence as a way of pressuring the Iraqis or taking the heat \noff of their political leaders to reach a political solution. We will \ndebate that issue.\n  But we need a commander. We have a qualified commander who has been \nnominated. There are other issues General Petraeus is going to have to \nface. General Keane, yesterday, pointed this out. We had a hearing in \nfront of the Armed Services Committee yesterday. General Keane was \nthere, along with former Secretary of Defense Perry and Ambassador \nRoss. General Keane pointed out yesterday that we have a significant \nproblem which is going to face General Petraeus in Baghdad other than \nthe violence, other than inserting American forces into neighborhoods \nand trying to hold them with American forces, with an American face, \nwith an American uniform. That is a big enough problem. But the command \narrangements are such that U.S. and Iraqi forces are going to be \noperating side by side in those neighborhoods under two separate chains \nof\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\ncommand, violating the unity of command principle that is so ingrained \nin U.S. military doctrine and, indeed, is one of the key principles in \nthat counterinsurgency manual which General Petraeus helped to create. \nHe must have unity at the command. They must agree down there on those \nstreets: Yes or no, are we going into that house or not?\n\n  Now, who goes into that house is a critically important issue. Many \nof us don't believe it ought to be an American tip of the spear; that \nthe Iraqi forces have been trained, 150,000 or more, to protect their \ncountry, and they should be the tip of the spear. That is one issue. \nThere is a great dispute over that issue.\n  That goes to the heart of the matter as to whether more American \ntroops are going to help solve this problem. But it complicates the \nproblem, it exacerbates the problem when you have two commanders on the \nground side by side who have two different chains of command who may \nhave two different opinions as to who ought to go into that house or \nwhether that house ought to be entered. That has not been resolved. \nThat is what General Petraeus is also going to have to face.\n  General Keane, who is former Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, just \nyesterday expressed his strong concern about the command arrangements \nbut said he was confident that General Petraeus had the ability to \nrevise the arrangements so that there could be a unity of command. I \nhope he is right.\n  It may be a superhuman task. It may be an impossible task. It is not \na task which ought to face a commander. These issues ought to be worked \nout in advance of forces entering into combat situations. But they are \nnot worked out. So General Petraeus has to figure that out as well as \nthe major issues that he is going to face.\n  Mr. President, did I yield myself a particular amount of time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan did not. \nThe Senator from Michigan has 8 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, during his testimony at his confirmation hearing, \nGeneral Petraeus volunteered to provide honest, straightforward reports \nto the Congress on a regular basis in recognition of Congress's \noversight responsibilities. We are counting on him doing so. He may \neven report to us over a TV network, but he made a commitment. He \nvolunteered a commitment. This was not something we had to press him to \ndo.\n  He said: I am going to regularly report to Congress on whether this \nnew strategy is working and whether these so-called benchmarks which \nthe Iraqis have allegedly agreed to, representing their commitments--\nwhen will they produce troops; will those troops, in fact, be subject \nto political pressure; will the Iraqis come through with the \ncommitments relative to the financing of reconstruction? He is going to \nreport to us on all the commitments which the Iraqis have made, all the \nbenchmarks which are supposed to be met. I take him at his word. He is \nan honorable man, and that is an important representation, again, made \nat his initiative.\n  I believe General Petraeus is highly qualified for his promotion to \nthe grade of general and his assignment as our senior officer in Iraq \nat a very critical and dangerous time. That position needs to be \nfilled. General Casey is retiring. I will vote for his nomination, and \nI urge our colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alabama will \nyield for one moment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to correct the record when I said \nGeneral Casey was retiring. General Casey is being transferred to a \ndifferent position and not retiring. I correct the record on that \npoint. We still need General Petraeus to fill that position because of \nthe shift in and the transfer of General Casey, but it is not a \nretirement.\n  I thank my friend from Alabama for yielding so I could correct the \nrecord.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin, our chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee and our extraordinarily capable leader.\n  Mr. President, I would like to be notified in 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. When 4 minutes remain?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, after I have spoken for 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of points about \nGeneral Petraeus. My colleague, Senator Bunning, who knows him \npersonally from when he served in Kentucky--and has been with him in \nIraq, as I have, will speak longer about him.\n  I will just say this: General Petraeus was in Iraq in 2003 during the \ninitial invasion. I met him there when I went on a codel. He impressed \nme, and all of us, as an extraordinary leader. He was commander of the \n101st Airborne. He is a Ranger and a combat officer. He finished at \nWest Point at the top of his class. He has a Ph.D. from Princeton. He \nwas No. 1 in his class at the Command and Staff General Officer School. \nBy all accounts, he is a man of the most extraordinary ability.\n  He came back to Iraq when we realized the training of the Iraqi \nmilitary was not progressing effectively. So after he had hardly been \nhome a year, the President asked him to go back to train the Iraqi \nmilitary and police; for 15 months, he went back to Iraq, leaving his \nfamily again. Fortunately, his wife is a daughter of a military officer \nand understands our national interest and the lives of American \nsoldiers are at stake.\n\n  He went back to train those officers, and he did that, by all \naccounts, to an extraordinarily fine degree, given the difficulties \nthat entailed. He got to know virtually all the leaders in Iraq. He \ndoesn't know Prime Minister Maliki, but he knows all the leaders in \nIraq. Then he came back, and his duties for the last year have been to \nprepare this manual, the military manual on counterinsurgency. That is \nexactly what we are in today, a counterinsurgency operation in Iraq.\n  I believe we have the finest person this country has to offer to take \na fresh look at the situation. I am an admirer of General Casey and \nGeneral Abizaid. I think they worked their hearts out and did a lot of \ngreat things. I never believed they have done anything but a superb \njob, but sometimes, we need change and new people. I believe this is \nthe best person we can send.\n  General Petraeus promised, as Senator Levin said, which is critically \nimportant, in response to a question I asked, but he had volunteered it \nto me in a private conversation: Senator, if you want the truth, I will \ntell you. If you send me over there, I am going to tell you what I \nthink.\n  I said to him at the hearing: Will you tell the American people how \nthis thing is going? And if it is not going effectively and we \nshouldn't continue, will you tell us?\n  He said: Yes, sir, I will.\n  I believed him when he said that. We cannot have a situation in which \nwe end up 20 years from now with someone writing an autobiography and \nsaying: I thought the war was lost. Yet I didn't say it at the time. We \nneed somebody to tell us the truth. I believe he will do that.\n  We need to support him. The whole infrastructure and bureaucracy of \nthis Government needs to be responsible to the commander on the ground. \nWe have a good Ambassador, but in Iraq where we have this much disorder \nand military threats, the commander is a leading factor. The people \nthere respect him. We in the United States look to him to do much of \nthe work, when much of it is actually being done by the Ambassador and \nother agencies of Government. But they need to respond to him because \nhe understands the situation. We need to have adequate prisons and an \nadequate court system. If the soldiers go out and apprehend these \npeople, where are they going to put them?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 4 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we need infrastructure, and we need \ntrainers. General Keane was very positive about General Petraeus and \nsaid some important things about these needs. This manual deals in \ngreat depth with\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nalmost every issue raised by Senator Levin. So I believe in General \nPetraeus; we have the person best able to work through all the joint \ncommand and political issues, as well as the military.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not in any way want to interrupt the \nproceeding, but I wonder if I might be recognized, following the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, to address the nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to rise today and \nspeak in support of the nomination of David Petraeus to become the \ncommander of the multinational forces in Iraq. I am confident that with \nGeneral Petraeus's experience, leadership skills, and judgment, he will \nprove to be an outstanding commander.\n  I can speak from experience because General Petraeus is a personal \nfriend of mine. Not only is he a friend of mine but also of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  I met General Petraeus initially at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, but \neven more importantly, when I made a codel to Iraq in 2004 with former \nSenator Zell Miller, we spent some time with General Petraeus and the \n101st in Mosul. At that time, he was the commander of the 101st \nAirborne Division in Mosul. As many of my colleagues might know, the \n101st Air Force is based out of Fort Campbell, KY.\n  While in Mosul, I had an opportunity to spend some time with General \nPetraeus and see his troops in action. What I saw was one of the most \nimpressive military leaders I have ever met, and I have met a lot of \nthem.\n  In his 27 months in Iraq--27 months in Iraq--General Petraeus was \nasked to lead a division into battle, to oversee the reconstruction and \ngovernance of Iraq's third largest city, and to build up from virtually \nnothing Iraq's army and police force.\n  General Petraeus not only met all of these challenges, but he \nsucceeded in showing them a unique type of flexibility and adaptability \nin his leadership. I believe this to be a very important skill that \nwill serve him well in his new mission in Iraq.\n  While in Iraq, I was able to see firsthand how this skill of \nadaptability transcends General Petraeus and was passed on to his \ntroops serving under his command. It was soon after the fall of Saddam \nHussein when the 101st Airborne Division got the orders to go to Mosul. \nThey were charged with restarting the city's economy, getting civil \ninstitutions on their feet, and creating a working democracy.\n  Under the command of General Petraeus, some officers supervised \ncement factories, others electricity generation. Soldiers who had \nstudied military aviation tactics found themselves figuring out how to \nrun a university, and an artillery officer was responsible for figuring \nout how to get the region's oil flowing again.\n  General Petraeus himself even supervised the city's first elections, \nelections of Iraqis of very diverse backgrounds.\n  How did he do all this? He did it through a partnership between the \nU.S. forces and the Iraqis, the exact type of partnership the President \nis calling for in his new way forward in Iraq. It is this type of \nforward thinking which will help our mission in Iraq to succeed.\n  General Petraeus has also managed to earn the respect of the Iraqis, \nthe Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias. This type of working relationship of \nmutual respect is desperately needed at this time in Iraq. I recognize \nit, General Petraeus recognizes it, and so does the President of the \nUnited States.\n  One of the key components in the President's new strategy in Iraq is \ncreating a real partnership between U.S. forces and Iraqi forces where \nwe would effectively train the Iraqis to secure their own neighborhoods \nand then act, the U.S. troops, as reserve reinforcements. Through this \ntraining and security, Iraq neighborhoods could once again begin to \nrebuild themselves, restoring vital services such as water and \nelectricity to the Iraqi people. Eventually we can begin to restore \npeace to embattled neighborhoods in Baghdad.\n  This is no easy task, and no one knows that better than General \nPetraeus. He has even admitted to it being a daunting task. But I am \nconfident in his ability to lead. His service in Iraq has equipped him \nwith expertise in irregular warfare and operations and a true \nunderstanding of the enemy we face.\n  Like many of my colleagues here on the floor of the Senate, I, too, \nwas initially skeptical of sending additional reinforcement troops to \nIraq. But I am convinced that we have to allow General Petraeus the \nopportunity to succeed in this mission. In this effort, he has offered \nto provide Congress with regular reports on the status of his mission, \non the performance and commitment particularly of the Iraqis to their \npromises. I, for one, would like to take General Petraeus up on his \noffer, and I am sure everyone in the Senate feels the same way.\n  I believe it is vital that we keep up to date daily on the situation \nin Iraq as it changes so we can best help our new commander address the \nsituation he faces. Judging how the Senate's Armed Services Committee \nunanimously voted him out of committee on Wednesday, I know I am not \nalone in my confidence in him.\n  I urge my colleagues today to support General Petraeus's nomination. \nI wish him Godspeed in his mission and look forward to seeing the \nprogress we can make in Iraq under his leadership as we continue to \ndefeat the terrorists and to win this war against them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished colleague \nfor his remarks. I am proud to follow and likewise indicate my \nunqualified support for General Petraeus, to wish him well, and I hope \nhe succeeds. We had a thorough hearing in the Armed Services Committee. \nI wish to compliment our new chairman, Senator Levin, and the ranking \nmember, Senator McCain, for the speed and efficiency with which they \nmanaged to get this nomination before the Senate for confirmation.\n  We have also pending resolutions to address the situation in Iraq, \nmost specifically our new strategy. I simply say to our leadership, I \nhope we can address those resolutions at the earliest possible date \nbecause our forces are engaged in combat as we speak here this morning, \nand we certainly do not wish to have debate any way construed as less \nthan full support for what they are endeavoring to achieve. We wish \nthem well, and their beloved families here at home, in these perilous \ndays.\n  I have concurred steadily, steadfastly in the President's decision--\nand it is an absolutely correct position. We cannot let Iraq fail, fail \nin the sense to lose the sovereignty they have gained through hard-\nearned elections and the opportunity for this Nation to emerge as a \nconstructive partner toward world peace. Therefore, we must press on. \nBut I think it is incumbent upon the Congress to provide its views. The \nPresident specifically asked, if there were suggestions, forward them, \nspeak them, and I and others, in a matter of clear conscience, have \ndone just that. We shall see what evolves from the resolutions now \npending and possibly other suggestions that could be brought forth by \ncolleagues in the days to come in the Senate. I do once again urge that \nwe address it as expeditiously as the joint leadership can determine.\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee had a hearing. We had the \ndistinguished former Secretary of Defense, Mr. Perry; Ambassador Ross, \nwho is a renowned expert on that region of the world, the Middle East; \nand the former Vice Chief of the U.S. Army, now retired, General Keane. \nIt was excellent testimony. I wish to pick up on one thing General \nKeane addressed.\n  I go back to the President's remarks when he spoke to the Nation on \nJanuary 10. He said:\n\n       Now let me explain the main elements of this effort: The \n     Iraq government will appoint a military commander and two \n     deputy commanders for their capital. The Iraqi government \n     will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across \n     Baghdad's nine districts. When these forces are fully \n     deployed,\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\n     there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades \n     committed to the effort, along with local police. These Iraqi \n     forces will operate from local police stations--conducting \n     patrols and setting up checkpoints and going door-to-door to \n     gain the trust of the Baghdad residents.\n       This is a strong commitment. But for it to succeed, our \n     commanders say the Iraqis will need our help. So America will \n     change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their \n     campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to \n     the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American \n     force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional \n     American troops to Iraq. The vast majority--five \n     brigades--will be deployed to Baghdad. These troops will \n     work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their \n     formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: \n     to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help \n     them protect the local population, and to help ensure that \n     the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the \n     security that Baghdad needs.\n\n  I say most respectfully, this poses a command structure, a dual one, \nof Iraqi commanders and U.S. commanders, which is unique. \nTraditionally, American forces operating in military campaigns have a \nunified command. There is the commander, and it goes right on down to \nthe lieutenant, the head of the patrols, and the platoons. I think this \nwill require further definition, further study.\n  I bring to the attention of our distinguished nominee, General \nPetraeus, the testimony of General Keane yesterday where, in the course \nof a colloquy with me and I think Senator Levin and Senator McCain--\nand, indeed, I remember the Senator from Rhode Island--we were quite \nconcerned about how this unique command and control would work. General \nKeane concluded his testimony, in response to a question I posed, by \nurging General Petraeus early on to devote some attention to this \nquestion of how this sort of joint command and control is going to \noperate.\n  On the battlefield, decisions must be made in a matter of seconds, \nfrom the platoon level often right up the chain of command. We cannot \nhave finger-pointing. We cannot have a mission where the Iraqi \nlieutenant says we should go left, the American embedded officer or \nwhatever command America has in that situation says go right, and the \nmission not achieve its goal and then the finger-pointing as to which \nofficer was correct and who was right and who was wrong. We cannot have \nthat in this situation. It is going to be an extremely complex mission.\n  Yes, I have put forward, along with other colleagues, recommendations \nof how possibly this operation could be conducted with few American \nforces, and specifically our resolution says the rules of engagement of \nthe forces--that is standard military technology--should have some \nspecificity, hopefully saying: Wherever possible, the Iraqis will bear \nthe brunt of the sectarian violence. I am very concerned about the \nAmerican GI being thrust in the middle of the violence that really has \nroot causes that go back 1,000 years to the divisions of thought \nbetween Iraqis as to whether they are Sunnis or Shias. It seems to me \nthat Iraqi forces who have the language capability, who understand the \ncultural differences, are far better qualified than the American GI to \ndo this.\n  Also, we have another document which was put out which explains the \noperations. It lists the President's priorities. It clearly says Iraqis \nwill be in the lead and on the point. This is a White House document \nissued here in the last few days:\n\n       The President's New Strategy is Rooted in Six Fundamental \n     Elements: Let the Iraqis take the lead.\n\n  That has to be well defined and well understood. I commend the \nPresident for putting the emphasis on having the Iraqis do that.\n  So I hope we can go about our debate in an orderly way at the \nearliest possible time. I urge Members to be cautious as we proceed. \nThe feelings on this are quite intense, as they should be, because this \nis one of the most pivotal, one of the most important decisions I have \nseen come before this body in my now 29th year in the Senate. I hope we \nconduct it with sincerity and dignity and huge respect among colleagues \nwith regard to our differences. I speak for myself and I think those \nother nine individuals who worked with me--Senator Bill Nelson, Senator \nSusan Collins--this is a truly bipartisan effort.\n  Whatever we conclude here in the Senate, it is my fervent hope that \nit reflects a feeling of bipartisanship because therein is how best we \ncan help the American public understand this complex situation, to give \ntheir public support. They are strongly behind the troops now. We want \nto get them to have a better understanding and a greater confidence in \nthis new revised strategy going forward. This can best be achieved at \nthe highest level of bipartisanship we can obtain here on these serious \nissues.\n  I see the distinguished chairman here. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGEN David Petraeus to be commander of American and allied forces in \nIraq.\n  General Petraeus has had a long and distinguished career in the U.S. \nArmy. From the moment he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in \n1974, General Petraeus has shown himself to be a dedicated officer and \nleader. He has held numerous leadership positions in the Army and has \nserved throughout the world. Most recently, General Petraeus was the \ncommander of the NATO training mission to Iraq and before that \ncommanded the 101st Airborne Division during the first year of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Additionally, General Petraeus has earned MPA \nand Ph.D. degrees in international relations from Princeton \nUniversity's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs \nand has received many awards and decorations including the \nDistinguished Service Medal and the Bronze Star for valor. Furthermore, \nhe is widely regarded for having written the book on how to conduct \ncounterinsurgency operations.\n  I recently met with General Petraeus to discuss the current situation \nin Iraq and our need to achieve a stable and secure, self-governing \nIraq. He is clearly aware of the difficult challenges that he will \nface. In our meeting and in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, General Petraeus clearly outlined what is at stake in Iraq \nand has convinced me that he is the best man to command Multi-national \nForce-Iraq at a most challenging time for the United States and the \nIraqi Government.\n  I have confidence in his pledge to me that he will openly and \nhonestly tell Congress the situation on the ground as it unfolds and \nprovide forthright advice regarding the new strategy in Iraq, and I am \nheartened by his commitment to the Armed Services Committee to provide \nperiodic updates on the situation in Iraq.\n  I have made clear to General Petraeus that I will support him, his \nefforts, and our troops in every way, but my support for the \nPresident's new strategy for Iraq is conditioned on seeing measurable \nprogress by Iraqis in securing and reconstructing their country.\n  Clearly, based upon his intellect and experience in Iraq and \nelsewhere, General Petraeus is an excellent choice to command American \nand allied forces in Iraq, and I support his nomination.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nnomination of LTG David H. Petraeus for promotion to General and \nCommander, Multi-National Forces-Iraq. I was pleased to join with my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee to favorably report his \nnomination to the full Senate.\n  General Petraeus has been commended by his superiors and policymakers \nalike for his ability to listen, to spend money wisely and use force \nintelligently in Iraq. He will bring to this new assignment his \nexperience from back-to-back tours in Iraq. Most recently, General \nPetraeus authored the Army's new counterinsurgency manual. He is truly \none of our most impressive Army leaders today.\n  On January 10, the President articulated the strategy which General \nPetraeus will implement if confirmed to this important post. His \nmission will be to clear, hold and build. It will require the use of \nforce, and negotiations alone won't complete this mission. I have \nserious doubts about this plan, especially the President's desire to \nsend even more troops to Iraq.\n  Because I feel so strongly that the situation in Iraq is \ndeteriorating, I have joined with colleagues to draft a non-binding \nsense-of-Congress resolution, S. Con. Res. 4, to oppose the surge\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nof troops into Baghdad. Senator Warner, Senator Collins and I believe \nthis resolution avoids partisan rhetoric and provides the Senate a \nvoice to express their disagreement with the President on his Iraq \npolicy.\n  Importantly, this resolution holds the Iraqis accountable and lets \nthem know that the U.S. commitment is not open-ended. Our resolution \nemphasizes the Iraq Study Group's valuable recommendations and \nspecifically says that our strategy in Iraq ``should be conditioned \nupon the Iraqi government's meeting benchmarks that must be specified \nby the Administration.''\n  Along those lines, I hope General Petraeus will be vigorous in \nkeeping Congress informed of progress he is making in Iraq. We need to \nknow what the benchmarks are on the military side of the ledger. We \nalso need to know what is expected of the Iraqis. I hope it's much more \nthan just showing up; the bar can't be that low. I don't want to \nbombard General Petraeus with paperwork--we want and need him in \nBaghdad neighborhoods restoring order--but it is vital that we know if \nthe Iraqis are capable of sharing security responsibilities.\n  During his office call last week, I told General Petraeus the \nexpectations from Congress for his success are high, but the hopes of \nthe American people are even higher. I feel that General Petraeus wants \nnothing less than success in Iraq and I look forward to working with \nhim in the coming months to meet the needs of the troops so they have \nthe tools they need to complete this mission.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, unless there is someone else who wants to \nspeak, I have already spoken. I would ask, is the vote scheduled?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes. At the expiration of time, 6 \nminutes 30 seconds, the vote will occur.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time on this \nside, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof LTG. David H. Petraeus to be General, United States Army? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Leahy) are absent on official business.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell), \nthe Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the \nPresident will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for LTG David H. Petraeus of the \nU.S. Army to be general and commander, Multi-National Forces--Iraq. He \nis a highly experienced individual with a long history of excellent and \nselfless service to this country. I believe he represents the high \ncaliber and professionalism of our Nation's military, and I wish him \nwell with an extremely difficult assignment.\n  But while I am supporting his nomination, I in no way support the \nPresident's policies in Iraq. The President has made the wrong judgment \nabout Iraq time and again, first by taking us into war on a fraudulent \nbasis, then by keeping our brave troops in Iraq, and now by pushing to \nput 21,500 more American troops into harm's way.\n  The indefinite presence of U.S. military personnel in Iraq will not \nfix that country's political problems. And as we have seen over the \nlast few years, sending more troops will not provide the stability in \nIraq that can only come from a political agreement. Congress must \ndevelop the courage to confront this President on what has become one \nof the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1212-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nknow the Senator from Connecticut will seek time, and I will seek time \nafter him. Unless there is another speaker on the Republican side we \ncan share with--the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. ENZI. I was hoping to be able to speak on the bill at some point \nsometime, too.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is all morning business we are talking about. Since \nthe bill is on the floor, I think we should defer. You go first.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would allow the others to go first. I was trying to keep \na longer queue from happening.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am asking to be part of the queue, and if you show me \ncompassion and mercy, I promise to be brief.\n  The Senator from Georgia has asked for 3 minutes; the Senator from \nConnecticut, 12 minutes; and I ask for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                   Honoring Ruben Alexander Crumbley\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as one ages, there are many things they \nappreciate in life. There is nothing greater or more appreciated than \nfriendship. It is an old saying that when you get toward the end of \nlife and you go back to count friends, you can sometimes count them and \nonly need one hand. When I look at my one hand in counting my friends, \nI look and see the face of Ruben Alexander Crumbley, who, on today, \nwill celebrate his 65th birthday in McDonough, GA.\n  So I wish to, for a moment on the floor of the Senate, memorialize \nthat occasion but also to remind myself and all of us, as we deal with \nthe daily workings of the Senate and the importance of our job, to \nnever forget the importance of our friends.\n  Sixty-five years ago, when Rubin Alexander Crumbley was born, he had \na serious heart ailment, at a time when medical science was not nearly \nas advanced as it is today. Through the surgeries and the care of his \ndoctor, the ailment was cured, and he has lived a long and successful \nlife, making significant contributions to the great State of Georgia.\n  He served in the State senate in the State of Georgia. He served as a \nsuperior court judge in Henry County in that judicial circuit. And he \nsought election, although falling short, to the Georgia supreme court.\n  He is a tireless worker and advocate on behalf of individuals, and he \nand his wife Claire have worked tirelessly to improve the county of \nHenry and the city of McDonough. But most important of all, as his \nfriends gather tonight at the Eagles Landing Country Club in McDonough, \nGA, to celebrate his life and his birthday, I today wish to \nacknowledge, as a friend, my great appreciation for all the \ncontributions he has made to me, to my life, and to my family.\n  In closing, I wish to also remember the third person of our group. We \nwere such close friends at the University of Georgia. Rarely a night \nwent by that after studying or partying, we did not gather together for \na cup of coffee to talk over the day and ahead to the next day. It was \nRuben Alexander Crumbley, Johnny Isakson, and Jack Cox.\n  So in remembering my friendship with Alex and celebrating his \nbirthday, I also wish to acknowledge Jack Cox because he sacrificed his \nlife in Vietnam and died fighting on behalf of the United States of \nAmerica. That was many years ago, but he and Alex and I have shared \ntogether a great friendship and many great memories, which Alex tonight \nwill review.\n  I regret I will not be with him in person, but I wanted to take this \nmoment to acknowledge a great occasion and a great friendship.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, about a month ago, Senator John Kerry of \nMassachusetts and I were in the Middle East, and at sundown on an \nevening in Baghdad, as we landed in our helicopter in the Green Zone, a \nyoung man walked up to Senator Kerry and me. I could hardly see him. He \nwas about 6 feet 2 inches, 6 feet 3 inches, a captain, and a West Point \ngraduate. He talked to us about his concerns and what was going on in \nIraq. This was back in the mid part of December before the Christmas \nholidays. His name was Brian Freeman.\n  The conversation did not last very long. It was not one of those long \nconversations. It may have lasted 15, 20 minutes, at best. I do not \neven have a clear picture in my mind of what he looked like because it \nwas dark, as the conversation went on for 15 or 20 minutes. But it is \none of those meetings all of us have had in our lives, where you do not \nforget a person, an individual. For whatever reason, he was compelling, \nhe was sincere. He sought us out. He wanted us to know how he felt \nabout what was happening in Iraq.\n  I mentioned him on ``Meet the Press'' a few weeks later in talking \nabout Iraq. I did not mention his name. I did not wish to put him in \nthat position. But I talked about this young Army captain, a West Point \ngraduate, whom I met. He apparently saw the program in Baghdad and e-\nmailed me, and we began this conversation between my office and himself \nover the last month or so, in which we talked about the surge, and he \ntalked about the problems associated with it, the jobs he was being \nasked to do.\n  He said to me--I am quoting him now--\n\n       Senator, it's nuts over here. Soldiers are being asked to \n     do work we're not trained to do. I'm doing work that the \n     State Department people are far more prepared to do in \n     fostering democracy, but they're not allowed to come off the \n     bases because it's too dangerous here. It doesn't make any \n     sense.\n\n  CPT Brian Freeman, a West Point graduate, was killed in Iraq last \nSaturday.\n  I have spoken to his family over the last number of days, his wife \nCharlotte, his two young children, his parents and his in-laws, trying \nto express on behalf,\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nI am sure, of all us the sense of grief we feel about this young man's \nloss of life and his contribution to our country.\n  I cannot tell you how exciting it was for me to meet him. This young \nman had nothing but potential and a great interest in seeing his \ncountry do better and grow stronger. And he wanted to be a part of it \nand make a contribution to our land.\n  Today, I am here to say enough is enough. I think all of us feel this \nway. We are coming to a point next week when we will have a debate \nabout this. We are going to discuss various resolutions before us. I \nfirmly believe we have to do everything we possibly can to ensure that \nthe tragedy of Brian Freeman does not continue to be replicated over \nand over again. That is why we must say no, in my view, to the decision \nby the President of the United States to send thousands more of our \nbrave young men and women in uniform to the streets of Baghdad to risk \ntheir lives for a plan which just ``doesn't make any sense,'' to quote \nBrian Freeman.\n\n  I, as one Senator, intend to speak loudly, as I have already, against \nthis ill-conceived policy. But more than just speak out, I intend, at \nevery available opportunity, to ask this body and the other body to go \non record in a meaningful way against the President's specific decision \nto send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq and against the \ncontinuation of our failed military strategy in Iraq.\n  This administration's Iraq policy has been a total failure. And this \n``escalation'' or ``surge''--call it whatever you will--of 21,500 more \nAmericans is not going to work. I think all of us in this Chamber know \nit. General Powell, General Abizaid, and General Casey know it. The \nBritish and the rest of our allies know it. Nearly every expert who has \ncome before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, regardless of their \npolitical persuasion or ideology, over the last several weeks of \nhearings Senator Biden has held, knows it as well.\n  That was their testimony. But most importantly, two-thirds of the \nAmerican people flatout oppose it, according to a recent survey done in \nour country--not that surveys ought to determine policy. But you cannot \nsustain a policy when the American people no longer feel you are on the \nright track. And they are right about it.\n  As my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, so eloquently and \npassionately said:\n\n       [W]e owe the military and their families a policy worthy of \n     their sacrifices . . . and I don't believe we have that \n     policy today.\n\n  I could not agree with him more.\n  As we all know, we have lost more than 3,000 young men and women. \nMore than 20,000 American troops have been grievously injured. \nAccording to many estimates, several hundred thousand Iraqi civilians \nhave been killed or maimed over the last 4 years. And now estimates \nsuggest this war will end up costing the American people over $1.2 \ntrillion.\n  We have stretched our military to the breaking point. As Congressman \nMurtha testified before the Foreign Relations Committee last week:\n\n       At the beginning of the Iraq war, 80 percent of all Army \n     units and almost 100 percent of active combat units were \n     rated at the highest state of readiness. Today, virtually all \n     of our active-duty combat units at home and all of our guard \n     units are at the lowest state of readiness--\n\n  ``the lowest state of readiness''--\n\n     primarily due to equipment shortages resulting from repeated \n     and extended deployments to Iraq.\n\n  I strongly believe we must demonstrate to the American public that we \nshare their deep concerns and doubts about the President's proposed \nplans to escalate our involvement in Iraq. I think we need to \ndemonstrate we are prepared to lead on this issue--not simply sit back, \nfearful of taking positions most of us believe are in the interests of \nour country.\n  Earlier this week in committee, I offered an amendment to the Foreign \nRelations Committee proposal that was offered by my friend, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Biden, and Senator Hagel and the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin. My amendment \ncalled for capping the number of troops in Iraq and required the \nPresident to seek a new authorization--after 5 years, a new \nauthorization; it has been 5 years since we voted on the justification \nto go into Iraq--but to get that new authorization from Congress \nimmediately prior to any future troop increases in Iraq--an \nauthorization, I would quickly add, I would vigorously oppose, but it \nwould be an opportunity to debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  My amendment was not about setting a floor, as some have suggested. \nIt was about exactly the opposite. It was about the first step in \nfundamentally altering the status quo in Iraq and forcing the President \nto listen to the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton Study Group to \nfundamentally change our mission in Iraq and begin the phased \nredeployment of U.S. combat troops.\n  It was also about preventing more troops from being put in harm's way \nfor a flawed tactic to a failed strategy.\n  Although my amendment failed, I voted in support of the Biden \nresolution. But I believe it is absolutely essential that the final \nresolution the Senate adopts next week be one with more clarity than is \ncurrently to be found in the words of this resolution or the competing \nWarner-Collins resolution, which was introduced by our good friend, the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. John Warner.\n  Regardless of how effective I and others are in bringing more clarity \nto the resolution through the amendment process, we need to also take, \nat some point in the very near future, concrete legislative action such \nas was attempted last week in the committee on Wednesday but which is \nnot possible in the context of the concurrent resolution we will \nconsider next week.\n  We need to face the hard facts. The President of the United States \nhas already said he will ignore Congress when it comes to his recent \nproposals on Iraq. He has said loudly he will ignore what we do. So it \nis all the more important we do something that is meaningful.\n\n  Sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are the easiest things to ignore. \nThey require absolutely no Presidential recognition whatsoever. They \nare merely opportunities for us to express our views on various \nimportant matters. I recognize it has a value, to some degree. But \nthere are people out there wondering whether we are actually going to \ntake advantage of this time to do something more than send a message, \nwhich all of us have sent, either privately or publicly, that this \npolicy must change. We are beyond the message-sending time. We all know \nwhat the message is.\n  Now the question is whether this body, this historic body, that has \nan obligation beyond the roles and the opportunities or the obligations \nof the other body, will take a clear and strong position when it comes \nto this most recent decision.\n  The Vice President has recently said that the nonbinding resolution \npassed by this coequal branch of Government ``won't stop us,'' to quote \nhim. Mr. Cheney went on to say: ``I think it would be detrimental from \nthe standpoint of the troops'' to pass this.\n  ``Detrimental from the standpoint of the troops''?\n  Refereeing a civil war is detrimental from the standpoint of the \ntroops. Surging into the streets of Baghdad with no clear mission is \nnot detrimental to our troops? Sending Americans into combat with \ninsufficient body armor is not detrimental to our troops? But stopping \nthe President from sending more young men and women into Baghdad is \nmost certainly not detrimental to our troops.\n  Two-thirds of the American public and two-thirds of our troops oppose \na surge, according to a recent survey done by the Military Times--two-\nthirds of the American public and two-thirds of our troops.\n  But it is not public opinion polls that shape my conclusions that our \npolicies in Iraq are terribly flawed. It is the facts on the ground, \nwhich I have learned, as I know others have as well in our recent \nvisits to Iraq, as well as the judgments of former and current military \nand foreign policy experts.\n  What is it going to take to make this administration change course?\n  It is going to take a Congress, in my view, that does not allow the \nblank checks over the last 5 years to continue. It is going to take a \nCongress--and I am confident this one will be one--that has the courage \nto stand up and clearly say we will not support\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\nmore troops nor the current failed policy. And if the President refuses \nto listen, it is going to take a Congress that is prepared to \nlegislatively force the President to change this disastrous course.\n  So next week we will begin the process of attempting to make it \ncrystal clear in the language of whatever concurrent resolution we \nadopt that this Congress is opposed to more troops, opposed to a policy \nthat makes our troops remain referees in a civil war, and in favor of a \nchanged policy which begins the process of the phased redeployment of \nour troops, which last year the Congress had anticipated would begin in \n2006.\n  There are those who say we should not try to tinker with the wording \nof carefully crafted Iraq resolutions because they are delicate \ncompromises and to propose anything more forceful would be politically \ndivisive and that Congress ought to speak with one voice.\n  Well, I wish we could speak with one voice. But to them I would say, \nI believe in consensus. I believe in bipartisanship. My 25-year record \nin this body has amply demonstrated the value of that. But when the \nquest for consensus paralyzes our ability and prevents us from taking \nreal action to stop the senseless death of young Americans, then I do \nnot think consensus ought to be the goal.\n  Stopping this insanity ought to be the goal. If you can do it 51 to \n49, then do it. If you can do it 100 to nothing, obviously, that is \npreferable. But waiting around for consensus on this issue worries me \ndeeply, that we are going to miss an opportunity to fulfill our \nobligations to stand up and say: Enough of this stuff. Stop it now.\n  There are those who say that opposing the surge betrays our troops. \nQuite the contrary is true. I say to them, what truly betrays our \ntroops is sending them into a civil war they cannot and should not have \nto stop. More than 60 percent of the Iraqi people do not want us in \ntheir country. How do you send people into harm's way when the people \nyou are trying to help do not want you to stay?\n  Of course, stopping the escalation of U.S. forces is only the first \nstep as part of a broader policy to stabilize Iraq and bring our troops \nhome.\n  There must also be meaningful deescalation of U.S. combat activities \nin Iraq. We must begin the redeployment of U.S. forces away from the \nurban areas where the sectarian conflict is greatest, to enclaves \nwithin Iraq and to elsewhere within the region--Afghanistan, of course, \nbeing the principal place where our troops could be used.\n  This will enable U.S. forces to concentrate on training Iraqi forces, \nsecuring Iraq's borders, and conducting counterterrorism operations to \nprotect U.S. vital security interests in the region.\n  In the coming days, every American should be able to know whether his \nor her Senator is prepared to go further and attempt to legally bind \nthe President from continuing this policy of folly. That is why I will \nnot be satisfied if the resolution we adopt next week is the last step \nthis Congress takes to right the wrong that the President is \nperpetrating on our brave young men and women in uniform and on the \nAmerican people as a whole. That is why I will find opportunities, if I \ncan, to bring binding legislation to a vote in this body so that every \nAmerican can know where we stand on this issue.\n  The American people want this Congress to live up to its \nresponsibilities. I am confident we can and will under our leadership. \nThe time has come for us to weigh in and change the course of U.S. \ninvolvement in Iraq, something we all know in our hearts needs to be \ndone. If we were able to authorize the President to go to war in 2002--\na vote that I deeply regret having cast in favor of--5 years ago on \ngrounds of weapons of mass destruction and the behavior of Saddam \nHussein--one of which was not true, and the other doesn't exist \nanymore--it is time for us to debate this new argument for our \ninvolvement in Iraq and decide, up or down, whether we believe it is \nthe right course of action.\n  This Nation of ours is at a critical crossroads. The President wants \nto deepen our involvement in the war. I think most of us here want to \nresponsibly end our involvement after 4 painful years that have taken a \ntragic toll on our country.\n  I have met with countless families, in my own State and in others, \nwho have been through the tragedy of losing loved ones in Iraq. Talking \nto Brian Freeman's family in Utah the other night was painful. His 14-\nmonth-old and his 3-year-old don't have a father any longer. Our \ncountry lost a wonderful young man whom Senator Kerry and I had the \nprivilege of meeting for such a brief time. But both of us were \nprofoundly affected by his courage and commitment. I say to them and \nothers that in this body we will stand up in the coming days and bring \nan end to this insanity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the crisis in Darfur. I \nwish I could do more than speak out, but at the very least, I will \ncontinue to speak out. Today I want to specifically speak to an urgent \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  On January 17, 14 United Nations organizations, including UNICEF, the \nWorld Food Programme, and the High Commissioner for Refugees, issued a \njoint statement on Darfur. These statements are usually just ignored. \nThey are somewhat repetitious by nature, usually dry as dust, and they \nlanguish unnoticed on a bookshelf. This statement is different. This \nstatement is a plea. It is a plea for help, a desperate plea for help. \nThis statement outlines the efforts of humanitarian agencies in Darfur \nover the last 2 years. It outlines the heroic efforts that have been \nmade to save hundreds of thousands of lives from a brooding genocide.\n  The statement reads:\n\n       In the face of growing insecurity and danger to communities \n     and workers, the [United Nations] and its humanitarian \n     partners have effectively been holding the line for survival \n     and protection of millions. That line cannot be held much \n     longer.\n\n  Humanitarian access to those in need has become highly limited. \nAttacks on both civilians and those trying to help increase by the day. \nThere are an estimated 14,000 aid workers in Darfur, most of them \nSudanese, who risk their lives every moment of every day to save \ninnocent people. In recent months, these relief workers have been \nmurdered, raped, and attacked repeatedly. Humanitarian and U.N. \ncompounds have been attacked, their vehicles hijacked, their supplies \nlooted. Sudanese police who should be protecting them have arrested and \nbeaten the aid workers. Sudanese nationals who work for these \norganizations have been the most viciously attacked targets of violence \nand harassment.\n  These atrocities represent a concentrated, deliberate assault on \nefforts to provide basic services to the poor, innocent people in \nDarfur--food, water, shelter, and medicine. Actions by the Sudanese \nGovernment are compounded by the actions of rebel groups, some of which \nhave also preyed upon civilians and are responsible for these attacks \nand hijackings. In every case, it is the people of Darfur who are the \nvictims of this violence. A third of the population of Darfur has been \ndriven from their homes. They urgently need humanitarian assistance. \nBut humanitarian organizations are under attack, just as they are. The \nSudanese Government has indicated its willingness to accept the first \nstages of a peacekeeping plan, ever so slowly. But so far there are \nonly a little over 100 U.N. military officers and 33 U.N. policy \nadvisers on the ground in Darfur, an area as large as the State of \nTexas. Thousands more are needed, and they are needed immediately.\n  I recently joined Senators Feingold, Brownback, and others in a \nbipartisan letter to the President raising the issue of these attacks \non humanitarian workers. We have asked the President what the U.S. \nresponse will be, what our strategy should be in the face of Sudanese \nassurances, promises that have not been kept. We recognize the State \nDepartment and the President want to build on preliminary progress that \nhas been made in at least getting some U.N. peacekeepers on the ground. \nBut that progress has been tragically, deliberately slowed. As we wait \nand as we debate, people die every day. We must do more.\n\n  I believe the United States should be prepared to support additional \nfunding for peacekeeping operations in Darfur.\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\nCongress has the opportunity to do that with a funding resolution for \nthe rest of the year that it will vote on in just a few days. The \nPresident should also increase funding for peacekeeping operations in \nthe budget request that he will soon send to Congress. Darfur clearly \nremains an emergency and must remain a priority.\n  A little over a year ago, I went to Kigali, Rwanda, with Senator \nBrownback. We stayed in the Hotel Rwanda, made famous by the film as a \nrefuge for people trying to escape death in the throes of another \ngenocide. I walked down the hill from that hotel to a Catholic Church \nthat I was later told was a sanctuary for only a brief time before the \nrebels overtook it and killed 1,000 people on the stone floor of the \nchurch. That was a genocide about which we should have spoken out more \nand we should have done something about.\n  My predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, pleaded with the \nClinton administration to do more, and President Clinton acknowledges \ntoday he should have done more. I salute the Bush administration for \ncalling the situation in Darfur the genocide that it is. But now that \nwe have acknowledged this horror is happening in our time on our watch, \nwe have a responsibility to do something.\n  We said ``never again'' after Rwanda, but the genocide continues. The \nUnited States and the world must take meaningful action to show the \nSudanese Government that a few hundred peacekeepers from the U.N. are \nnot enough, and we must act now before the thin line of relief workers \nis severed and the suffering in Darfur grows even worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on \nthe minimum wage bill that is before the Senate. I have spoken a little \nbit during the last week, but I have held in reserve a lot of time \nbecause we had amendments offered that other Senators wanted to \nexplain. Normally when a bill is on the floor we have to stand down \nhere and say: Please, if you have amendments, bring them to the floor \nso we can debate them. However, in about the first hour that this bill \nwas on the floor, we had a dozen amendments that were suggested, and \npeople were clamoring for time to debate them. We had amendments from \nboth sides of the aisle. I think there were over 115 amendments that \nwere suggested to this bill. Everybody realizes that 115 amendments are \nnever going to be voted on with any bill. I don't think we have even \ncome close to that on any of the bills that I have seen in the 10 years \nI have been here.\n  Later today, the majority leader is going to file cloture. He has \ngiven notice that he will do that. That is asking the Senate to garner \n60 votes in favor of bringing the debate to a close on the Baucus \nsubstitute which contains the minimum wage increase and the small \nbusiness tax incentive package. I congratulate Senators Grassley and \nBaucus for the tremendous effort they put into coming up with a package \nfor small business that would help offset the impact of the minimum \nwage increase. It is something that was considered the last time there \nwas a minimum wage increase, and I suspect that in the future it will \nalways be a part of a package in some way to make sure that we don't \nharm these small businesspeople who provide a training ground for those \nwith minimum skills so that they can get better skills and get better \njobs.\n  The small businesses of this country are hiring people with no \nskills, teaching them how to operate a cash register, how to interact \nwith customers, and often how to dress, how to cook--all kinds of \nservices. I am reminded that in Cheyenne, WY, we have a McDonald's. \nThey are always used as the example in minimum wage debates. They take \na lot of grief, and they really don't deserve all that grief. They do a \ntremendous job of training young people in some very basic customer \nservice skills.\n  The reason I am reminded of the Cheyenne McDonald's is that we like \nto point out that three former employees there who started at minimum \nwage now own 21 McDonald's. So it is an entry way to greater things. It \nis not for everybody, but for those with a desire to learn and succeed, \nthere are possibilities. Any time we can hold out hope, we are helping \npeople.\n  Yesterday there was a speech on the floor of the Senate and it was \nsaid that we had already spent 5 days on this bill and it was time to \nmove on. Yesterday was actually the fourth day on the bill. Today is \nthe fifth day. We will not be able to have any votes today. I don't \nknow whether you count that or not because we were talking about how \nthe Senate is supposed to work 40 hours a week just like other people \ndo. I know a lot of my colleagues and I have our 40 hours in by about \nWednesday, but at any rate, we have been talking about working a 5-day \nweek. We are here, and we are talking, but we will not vote today. I \ndon't know whether you can really count that as a day on the bill.\n  We talked on the bill on Monday, but we didn't have any votes Monday. \nSo I don't know if you can count that as a day on the bill either. Next \nMonday we have the right to talk on it again, and then Tuesday morning \nthere will be the cloture vote. That would be the next vote allowed on \nthe bill. We really had 3 days on the bill.\n  How productive were we during those 3 days? We voted on 11 \namendments. We have over 100 amendments. Many of the amendments deal \nwith labor issues. There are some that don't deal directly with the \nminimum wage. But the minority side, as I have watched over the last \nseveral years, always has some unrelated amendments that they want to \nshowcase and get passed.\n  Another thing I have noticed as I have been here is the unfortunate \nthing that we do to amendments that are suggested on a key bill. Once \nthat amendment has been suggested, if the majority is the Democrats and \nthe Republicans suggest the amendment, that is considered a poison \npill, something just designed to take the bill down. I can say that \nbecause in the past on some Republican bills, when the Democrats would \nsubmit an amendment, it would be labeled a poison pill.\n  Unfortunately, the people of America don't get to see the debate that \noccurs off the Senate floor. They are not often invited into the \ncommittee meetings. They are not invited into the bipartisan task force \ngroups that work across the aisle on solving problems before they even \nget to committee. There is a good reason for that. If the media were \ninvited, they would take some of the dumb ideas that are thrown out--\nand I have to admit when I am throwing out ideas, I throw out a lot of \nideas; some of them stick and some you really recognize as being dumb--\nand concentrate on those few dumb ideas because people get enjoyment \nout of that.\n  Some of these meetings where there is brainstorming and trying to \nfind common ground have to be held separately. These are often very \nproductive talks. There are a number of them going on right now on key \nissues. I think that this is the best way to handle a bill. But what \nAmerica gets to watch is us debating on this floor, the attitudes we \nproject, and the arguments that we project. I know most of the people \nout there watching are always rooting for one side or the other. I \ndon't think it is the vast majority of independents who are spending \ntheir time addicted to the television. So our constituents kind of \nexpect us to ram home the arguments from our side, and we do.\n  I contend that what we get to talk about on the floor of the Senate \nis the 20 percent of the issues we are never going to agree on.\n  We have to get past that point and get to the point where we look at \nall proposals in a very serious way and figure out a way that we can \naccept it or modify it in some way that makes it acceptable. What I \nusually do is try to find a third way. We have to do a bit more of that \naround here, and if we do I think we will find that the Senate will be \na lot more successful.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have been practicing that for the last couple \nof years. We have been working prior to committee meetings, in \ncommittee meetings, and after committee meetings. We have been very \nsuccessful at not having much floor debate on things that came through \ncommittee. We got 35 bills through committee, and the longest debate we \nhad on the floor was over the pension bill. That bill was very \nimportant, one of the most important bills in the last 2 years. It was \n980 pages long in the Senate, which is not a small bill. We already had \nagreement\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nbefore we came to the floor that there would be one hour of debate \nequally divided, with two amendments and a final vote. Check back \nthrough the years and see how often that has happened. That was an \nextremely difficult bill, and we had 1 hour of debate, two amendments, \nand a final vote. It can be done around here. In fact, we wound up with \n27 bills signed by the President. We are checking to see how many \ncommittees have had that kind of production. Most of those didn't get \ndebated here at all because there wasn't that 20 percent of \ndisagreement. We had the 80-percent agreement and we went with it. That \nis not possible on all bills, and I understand that.\n  I am certainly encouraging my colleagues to get together, work on \nbills prior to them becoming what might be considered a poison pill, \nand see if something cannot be worked out. Hopefully, we can go back \nthrough some of these amendments that have been offered before and look \nat them with clear eyes and see if there isn't a way that what is being \ntalked about in principle cannot be achieved somehow.\n  I want to let the people watching this debate that they are not \nseeing the real story on bills. There is a different and better way we \ncould do it. I hope that is how we will do it more often.\n  Now, I will speak a little more on the bill before us. I am going to \nbe disappointed if we don't have a few more votes on the bill prior to \nhaving the cloture vote. Again, it is a request from the minority to \nhave an opportunity to vote on some of their amendments. So I urge my \nDemocratic colleagues to allow a vote on a few very important \namendments that my Republican colleagues have offered to the bill. I \nknow the Democrats don't want to vote on the amendments because each of \nthem is reasonable enough that it could pass. I know that may sound \nsilly, but that is how things often work here. I have offered \namendments--and the Democrats have sounded the trumpet that they will \nallow an open process on amendments offered, but they have chosen to \nfilibuster by delay. When we only get 11 votes and only 3 days on which \nwe are allowed to offer amendments, it is hard to claim it was a full \nweek. Often bills that are very important here take 3 weeks. In fact, I \nthink that is probably the normal range for a bill around here.\n  So they have the opportunity right now to let the clock run out. But \nwe could have already voted on the minimum wage and small business \nincentive package if we could have received some votes on the important \namendments that have been offered. We said we were going to cull down \nthe number of amendments, and we obviously did.\n  I call for a vote on four amendments we still have outstanding--\nalthough there are many others outstanding. I want to reiterate my \nconviction that as we move to raise the minimum wage, we must also \nprovide a measure of relief to small businesses which will bear the \ncost of the increased wages.\n  Let me first turn to the four amendments I have noted. Over the \ncourse of this debate, we have heard many times that the minimum wage \nis an issue of fairness, an issue that affects working parents and \nworking families. The minimum wage is not the only relevant matter \nbefore us that implicates issues of both fairness and family life. One \nof the most significant dilemmas that face working men and women is the \nstruggle to maintain a balance between their work and family life.\n  Senator Gregg offered an amendment that reaches to the core of this \nissue by providing the opportunity for private sector employees to \nenter voluntary--I stress the word ``voluntary''--flexible work \narrangements with their employers. Senator Gregg requested and deserves \na vote on his employee option time amendment. However, more \nimportantly, working families in this country deserve a vote on this \namendment.\n  Twenty-eight years ago, this body gave Federal employees this highly \nvalued benefit. Now the other side of the aisle wants to deny private \nemployees the same right. Where this can be a big problem is where you \nhave a private employee who is married to a public employee. The public \nemployee can rework his or her schedule to be able to do what the \nfamily needs to have done, and the spouse cannot do that because it is \nillegal. They say, why can my husband or wife do it? Well, because it \nis legal in the public sector. Even unions recognize this benefit is \ncoveted by employees. In a union-sponsored health care worker survey, \nscheduling options was the second most important factor in accepting a \njob.\n  Working families are striving to find the right balance of work and \ntime with their children, spouses, and other loved ones. The Gregg \namendment will remove a major obstacle to finding this balance. Nobody \nshould properly invoke the importance of providing relief or help for \nworking families, while simultaneously denying a vote on this \namendment. This is not only fair, but this is giving the employee the \nright to choose, in cooperation with their employer, the best work \nschedule for their family in the workplace.\n  Senator Kennedy has talked about the children of low-wage workers in \nthis country. Allowing employees more flexible work schedules will cut \ndown on unscheduled leave, sick days, child care costs, and the loss of \nproductivity that occurs when an employee is on the job but their heart \nis somewhere else tending to the needs of family.\n  Public sector employees have enjoyed flextime benefits for nearly \nthree decades. We have not heard a lot of problems about it. At the \nsame time, it has been denied workers in the private sector. Where is \nthe fairness in that result? The amendment offered by Senator DeMint \ngoes to the heart of this discriminatory result. It says if we are \ngoing to allow flextime benefits to some and not others, we ought to \ncorrect the system the other way; if it is not good in the public \nsector, maybe we ought to eliminate it under the Federal sector. \nSenator DeMint deserves a vote, provided the other one fails. \nFundamental fairness demands it. By eliminating flexible work schedules \nfor Government employees until private employees have the same rights, \nwe hope to force our friends on the other side of the aisle to \nacknowledge and address this disparity. If flextime is such a terrible \nproposal and so dangerous to private employers and employees, one would \nthink they would support this amendment to protect Government \nemployees. But there is a reason they will not support this amendment. \nEmployees who have flextime like it: 79 percent of the women who have \nit use it; 68 percent of the men who have it use it.\n  There are many Senators in this Chamber who offer their employees \nflexible schedules. Why is it good enough policy for Senators and \nGovernment employees and not for the private sector? It is long past \ntime for the Senate to give this popular benefit full and open \nconsideration. Once again, if we are truly concerned about our working \nfamilies and about being fair, we should not deny a vote on this \namendment.\n  Another amendment I hope we will vote on is Senator Burr's health \nflex proposal. All of us know health insurance costs are a major issue \nfor both working families and small employers. This amendment would \ngive employers the option to provide a $2.10 increase in wages or spend \nthe increase on health care benefits. We have to recognize the tough \nchoices employees face every day and how the underlying bill will make \nthose choices even tougher.\n  Most Americans get their health care through employment, but it is \nbecoming more and more difficult for small employers to keep up with \nescalating health care costs. Everybody in the country recognizes the \ndifficulty of keeping up with health care costs. The small businessman, \nlike everybody else, wants to have insurance for his family and his \nemployees. As most of us know, 46.6 million people in the United \nStates, or one in seven Americans, lacked insurance during 2005. There \nis no pretending that a minimum wage increase is going to make that \nnumber any smaller. Senator Burr's amendment addresses this negative \nside effect.\n  The availability of affordable health insurance is clearly an issue \nfor all families, and any time this body has an opportunity to address \nor examine ideas designed to achieve that end, I don't think we should \nrefuse to do so. Senator Burr has asked for a vote and he, too, \ndeserves a vote on this important issue.\n  Finally, Senator Vitter also offered an amendment that directly \nrelates to the group of people I feel will be most harmed by this \nmandated increase in the minimum wage. His amendment is\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\none of fundamental fairness, also, to the small employers who create \nthe jobs and try their best to play by the rules. Senator Vitter's \namendment recognizes that small businesses often do not have the in-\nhouse resources or the outside experts they need to assist them in \ncomplying with the ever-growing amounts of paperwork they are required \nto provide to the federal government. They cannot afford to hire \nexpensive consultants to do this for them. Paperwork in the Federal \nGovernment is voluminous, and learning how to do it correctly often \ntakes very thick manuals. The information they are required to give to \nthe Federal Government is very extensive. I used to file some of those \nforms and reports, and I was amazed at the textbooks you had to go \nthrough to be able to fill out the forms properly. Part of that is a \nproblem we have with the Paperwork Reduction Act. We ought to take a \nlook at the Paperwork Reduction Act again.\n  Our income tax forms could be much easier to fill out. I went to the \nIRS when I first got here, as the only accountant in the Senate, and \ntold them that I have done a few of those forms. I could not understand \nthem; I could not understand the logic behind them. There are a couple \nof places where a line could be added and you would not have to go to \nanother form. I found out there is a huge penalty to Government \nagencies who add a line to a form. But there is no penalty for adding \nanother chapter to the book that explains the form. Therefore, it is \neasier to add another whole chapter than to add a simple line. The \nPaperwork Reduction Act is creating some problems for small business \nthat keep the paperwork from being plain and simple.\n  As a result, small businesses sometimes make inadvertent errors in \ncomplying with these obligations. His amendment would relieve small \nbusinesses from monetary fines for certain first-time violations that \npose no threat to health or safety. This is a very important criteria. \nThe Federal Government should not be playing a game of ``gotcha'' in \nthese circumstances, particularly with small businesses. What they \nshould be doing is playing fair. If we, too, are being fair, we would \nallow a vote on this important amendment.\n  Apart from these amendments, I believe we need to focus on the \ncentral question before this body. Everybody in this Chamber knows we \nwill approve an increase in the minimum wage and that we will do it \nvery soon. The debate, as I keep reminding people, has not been over \nwhether to do the increase, it has been whether we can keep people in \nbusiness at the same time we do the increase and the ways to do that. \nWe have made some progress on that issue, I believe.\n  There is a long road ahead to do the tax package Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley so capably worked out in a very bipartisan way because \nthose bills are supposed to start in the House and that will be part of \nthe argument, too. There will be some argument. Some of the offsets are \nopposed by some people--and I think, if you look at the list of those \nwho oppose them, it is big businesses, not small businesses. I believe \nthey think they are being left out of this process. However, this is a \nsmall business issue, and I am trying to solve some of those small \nbusiness problems. The approval of an increase to $7.25 is simply not \nan issue; and, further rhetoric on this point adds nothing to the \nimportant public debate that remains.\n  The debate is simple: How do we go about mandating this increase \nwithout harming the small businesses that have to pay for it? These \nsmall businesses have been the engine of our economy and employ the \nbulk of the minimum wage workers. We do great harm not only to these \nsmall businesses but to all those workers who rely on them for their \nlivelihood if we don't provide the practical means for businesses to \nafford such mandated increases. We have failed in our responsibilities \nif we do not balance an increase in the minimum wage with the \nappropriate relief for small businesses. For a worker without a job, a \nhigher minimum wage is meaningless.\n  As a former small business owner--my wife and I had three shoe \nstores--I know how difficult it can be to meet payroll every week and \nmeet all the other obligations a small businessman has to face. Here \nare the realities: Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 imposes a 41-\npercent increase in labor costs for a small employer with minimum wage \nworkers. Many of them will see this as a tax. That is why some on our \nside have problems voting for an increase in taxes. It goes to a very \nimportant segment of our population, but it is a 41-percent increase in \nlabor costs. Every employer has to face the very real issue of how he \nor she will deal with this increased cost and still make the payroll \nweek after week.\n  This cartoon appeared in one of the papers. It says:\n\n       The good news is the U.S. House voted to increase the \n     minimum wage. The bad news is I can't afford to pay any more.\n\n  Although this cartoon may, at first, appear humorous, these are very \nreal and very difficult questions that impact our small business \nemployers dramatically. It is not a laughing matter. These payroll \nincreases have to be paid for by employers, and money doesn't grow on \ntrees. A lot of the things we look at as options often are not \navailable to them. The fact is that competition regulates prices--\nunless we have price controls--and employers must make hard decisions \nas how to meet these increased payroll obligations.\n  When costs go up, businesses must first look to cut expenses. The \nchoices they have can be very difficult. To meet higher mandated \npayroll costs, the smaller employer may be forced to consider cutting \nback on benefits, such as health insurance, retirement, and leave \nplans. It is simply too easy to forget that fringe benefits have a \nsignificant cost, and if a small employer must reduce expenses to meet \npayroll, these costs are often the first to go.\n  Beyond cutting fringe benefits, small businesses may need to consider \ncutting back work hours or eliminating overtime or eliminating some \nduplication on a shift. I mentioned a video store that has always had \ntwo people to close up because they think two is the minimum for \nsafety. They are now talking about having to go to one person to close \nup. Cutting hours, eliminating overtime, laying off workers or not \nhiring more are traditional and often necessary responses to meeting \nincreased costs. Unfortunately, these actions ultimately hurt the very \nworkers the minimum wage increase is designed to help.\n  Another thing we need to do--and I have avoided putting it into the \nbill as an amendment--is to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act. \nThe HELP Committee has passed it unanimously twice. The Senate has \npassed it unanimously twice. But we have not been able to get a \nconference committee. Part of the reason for not getting a conference \ncommittee is worrying about where the conference committee will go. \nThere ought to be a lot more confidence in the conference committee on \nthe side of the Democrats right now because they will control the \nconference committee.\n  I am hoping that the Workforce Investment Act can be a way that we \ncan help get more job training. Small businesses also provide some job \ntraining for which they do not get paid. That does not come under that \nbill. As I mentioned, small businesses often hire people with minimum \nskills and teach them the skills they need to move up the wage ladder.\n  Incidentally, of the businesses I checked on, the average time that a \nperson stayed at minimum wage was 3 weeks. If they had the capability \nto learn, they moved up quickly.\n  We must also remember that when confronted by higher labor costs, \nemployers will naturally gravitate toward filling positions with the \nmost highly skilled, experienced, and productive workers available.\n  Once again, this phenomenon of replacing low-skilled workers with \nhigh-skilled workers in the face of rising labor costs winds up harming \nthe very workers the minimum wage seeks to help. Minimum wage positions \nare often the entryway into the world of work for those who lack skills \nand experience. Mandated increases in the minimum wage run the risk of \nclosing that entryway to many.\n  Beyond these cost-cutting measures of eliminating benefits, reducing \nhours, downsizing, laying off employees, and reducing low-skill and \nentry-level employment, employers might have to face the prospect of \nincreasing the price for goods and services. Such increases drive \ninflation and cause all\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nconsumers to ultimately pay the price of these mandates. The irony is \nthat as the cost of these labor increases is passed through to \nconsumers, it affects everyone, including the minimum wage workers \nwhose recently increased wages are suddenly devalued by the increased \nprice of goods and services that impact them as well.\n  My colleagues and I feel strongly about the working families of this \ncountry and the businesses they work in and the businesses they run. I \nwish to emphasize that point. I consider the working families of this \ncountry to also include small businesses. A lot of us don't realize the \n``wake up in the middle of the night wondering what is going to happen \nwith the business'' concern and the real risks these people take. A lot \nof them are just mom-and-pop businesses that hire 3, 5, 15 people.\n  There is support for raising the minimum wage, but we recognize that \nby doing so, we put people out of business or make them cut their \nworkforce. If we end up putting someone out of work, we are not doing \nthem any favors. That is the reason we have offered a number of \namendments to H.R. 2. This bill never went through the committee \nprocess, either in this body or in the other body. I think the \ncommittee process helps the chances of moving a bill along and takes \ncare of a lot of the amendments we maybe ought not debate on the floor.\n  We have not had a chance to offer any amendments at all to this \nlegislation until this week. When a bill goes directly to the floor and \ncircumvents the committee process, Members have no choice but to go \nthrough the committee amendments process on the floor of the Senate. We \nonly got to vote on 11 amendments, and have only gotten 3 days to vote \non amendments.\n  Once again, I urge the Democratic leaders to allow us to vote on the \namendments we have offered, and I strongly urge them not to forget the \nworking families of this country who employ low-skilled workers. They \nwill need real relief in order to keep their businesses growing and \ntheir employees working under this mandate. This body must commit in a \nbipartisan way now to the real issue at hand; that is, providing a \nresponsible increase in the minimum wage that allows small businesses \nto continue employing and providing job opportunities to the very \npeople the minimum wage is designed to help. The simple answer is \nbefore us.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 135 and 138, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we have reached Friday in the \nconsideration of the increase in the minimum wage, let me restate both \nby affection and respect for my friend and colleague from Wyoming. We \nhave a strong personal relationship and a very good professional \nrelationship. There are a few occasions when we differ, and this \nhappens to be one of them, but it doesn't take away from the fact that \nI have enormous respect for his legislative abilities. We have worked \nin a number of areas, and we have every commitment to working together \nin so many of those areas of our HELP Committee. I know we don't have \nto repeat it, but it is true. Since we have a moment on a Friday, I \nwanted to express it because of my deep concerns about the direction of \nthis underlying legislation.\n  Let me state, with regard to these family issues, our committee is \nenormously interested in these family issues. The fact is, we have not \naddressed them in these recent Congresses. That happens to be the fact. \nWe have not marked up those measures when Republicans were in charge of \nour committee. We didn't get them out on the floor of the Senate, so we \nhave not considered them. But we are strongly committed to them. We are \nstrongly committed.\n  My friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd--who is the \nauthor of the Family and Medical Leave Act--struggled 10 years before \nwe ever could get that legislation passed because of the opposition \nwithin the Republican Party. He wants to extend that. It only applies \nto companies of 50 or more and leaves out half of all the workers. He \nwants to address that issue.\n  The Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, has had longstanding \nlegislation providing up to 24 hours for individuals to go and work \nwith teachers, engage in teacher conferences.\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n  I have engaged in legislation for sick leave for workers, which is \nenormously important to people here.\n  Family-related issues are something in which we are enormously \ninterested and concerned with. But I want to indicate we are also \ninterested in flextime. But we also recognize that in this past \nCongress, this President eliminated overtime for 6 million Americans--\novertime--this administration.\n  I am not going to take the time now, but I will certainly put the \nmaterial in the Record about the proposal the Senator has just \nreferenced--my friend, and he is my friend, the Senator from New \nHampshire--talking about his flextime legislation. Here on page 2 in \nthe legislation it says, ``notwithstanding section 7, an employer may \nestablish biweekly work programs that--section (A) title I--that \nconsist of a basic work requirement of not more than 80 hours over a 2-\nweek period and in which more than 40 hours of the work period may \noccur in a week of that period.''\n  I believe this is the end of the 40-hour workweek, when your employer \ncan make you work 50 hours in a week with no overtime. You say: No \novertime? Where is that?\n  If we go to page 7 of the legislation, under the definition of \n``overtime,'' the term ``overtime'': ``when used with respect to \nbiweekly programs means all work worked in excess of the biweekly work \nschedule involved in excess of the allocated 50 hours a week.''\n  So here we are basically saying if the employer makes the judgment \nand decision that you are going to work 50 hours, you are going to work \nmore than 40 hours. Under the existing law you get overtime pay for \nover 40 hours. Under this, you work 50 hours and you don't get the \novertime. Here it is in the legislation.\n  Why do we have that on the minimum wage bill, I ask? It seems so \naccommodating. Can't we just accommodate family-related issues on it? \nHere we are trying to undermine it.\n  The issue, of course, that is key in all these matters--you say: What \nabout public employees? Public employees do. They have unions to \nprotect them, and they have longstanding agreements about how and who \nmakes the judgment and decisions in working out those flextime issues. \nIt is an entirely different situation. I am glad to try to work that \nout, as we have with Members on family-related issues. But why should \nwe have to do it on a simple item like the terms of increasing the \nminimum wage? Why is it? As I said yesterday, we are considering zero \namendments on our side. We are prepared to vote. I bet I could even get \nthe leader to say--well, probably not--to say we would go with a voice \nvote and approve it today. But, no, at the current time we have, to my \nknowledge, 109 amendments. They increase every day from the other \nside--109 amendments. Zero over here, 109 amendments.\n  Another issue comes up, the issue of agencies violating different \nregulations, and if it is a first offense and exclusion of health and \nsafety--look carefully how they define health and safety. This is an \nissue without a problem. Agencies have that flexibility today and use \nit today. What are we really trying to get at?\n  Under the original proposal that was offered with regard to first \noffenses, it would have exempted 97 percent of all mine safety \ncompanies. You say let's redraft that now in terms of health and safety \nand see if you won't take it. Why are we doing that out here on this \nquestion? We have just done mine safety.\n  If we want to deal with regulatory reform we are glad to do that. \nWith regard to small business I thought that would be in the Small \nBusiness Committee's jurisdiction. Why should we be dealing with that \nwhen all we are trying to do is get an increase in the minimum wage?\n  Then I hear: What is going to happen in terms of employment when we \npass this increase in the minimum wage? One chart I didn't use the \nother day but I remember from the past is this one. The last minimum \nwage increase did not increase unemployment. These are the figures, \ngoing from 1997, September, all the way through the year 2000. It shows \nthe last time when we went to $5.15 the gradual decrease in \nunemployment.\n  If you look at it this way, we have the increase and the wage was \n$4.75 in the summer of 1996. Look at the increased job growth. Then we \nincreased it in 1997 to $5.15, and it continued job growth.\n  There are 3.7 million Americans who work in these small mom-and-pop \nstores who will never be affected because of the small business \nexemptions. It is $500,000. They are excluded. It is only those. These \nare the figures on it.\n  We have gone through those in some measure. I still am distressed \nthat we are spending this amount of time on this issue, and I wonder \nwhy it is the Republicans have all of these issues. If we had accepted \nall the amendments that have been offered by the Republicans, we would \nhave added $241 billion in spending; $241 billion would have been added \nthat would not have been offset.\n  We are on the fifth day today. We will be on the sixth day on Monday, \nthe seventh on Tuesday. When we had the increase in 1977, we spent 2 \ndays on it. When we had the increase in the minimum wage in 1989, we \nhad 2 days. In 1996, we had 2 days--4 hours in the House of \nRepresentatives. Since we have been debating this issue, the good State \nof Iowa, Monday night, had a debate in the legislature for the increase \nin the minimum wage. They passed it. They considered it in the Senate, \ndebated it, and passed it, and the new Governor of Iowa is signing the \nincrease in the minimum wage today. This is what is happening out \nthere.\n  This is part of what the American people are wondering about \nregarding this institution: Why in a State it takes 3 days to get it \nand other times it has taken a couple of days to consider this. It is a \nvery simple matter: just raise the minimum wage to $7.25 from $5.15. We \nare in day 5, Monday it will be day 6, vote on cloture on day 7. With \nthe 30 hours it will continue on into the better part of next week. Why \ndoes it take so long for this institution when all the amendments are \nover on this side, from the Republicans?\n\n  That happens to be the fact. We debated education. It is interesting. \nOur committee deals with education as the appropriations committee for \neducation. Finance has some provisions in there with regard to the tax \nprovisions. We have important education legislation coming up. We have \nworked out higher education legislation in our committee. There are \nstill a few areas in terms of the loan programs we still have to work \nout. We are working with the administration on the K-12 program. But \nnow we have dropped in here $35 billion in terms of education credits. \nThere is nothing on the IDEA Program--nothing. No help and assistance \non IDEA. No help and assistance in increasing Pell programs. They \nselected $35 billion for whatever they wanted on education to challenge \nus to vote against that particular proposal.\n  Is that it? The underlying bill is to try to get an increase in the \nminimum wage. I am glad to debate education. I was so interested in \nthis because last year we increased the scholarship programs by $12 \nbillion for students, and it went to conference and the Republican \nleadership took all $12 billion and put it for taxes. I can't scarcely \nremember any of those people who were arguing yesterday for increasing \nhelp and assistance for the students raising their voice let alone \ntheir vote in opposition. Or, when we added the funding, or tried to \nadd the funding to the budget last year, I don't remember any of those \nspeaking out. Twelve billion dollars it would have added. I don't \nremember any of those voices out there. But they suddenly want to have \na long debate on that program.\n  Now we want to have a long debate on health savings accounts. The \naverage user of health savings accounts earns $133,000 a year, and \nthree-quarters of those who had the health savings accounts had \ninsurance before they had them. I thought the question today was to get \nto the uninsured, not the wealthy who already had insurance. That is \ncoming from the other side. Why on the minimum wage bill? I am glad to \ndebate that issue, but why on the minimum wage? Why hold up another day \nfor workers? That is what is happening.\n  Every day we are denying these workers, every single day, every hour \nwe are denying these workers an increase in the minimum wage. Make no \nmistake who is doing that--109 amendments from that side and zero from\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nthis side. You can say: We want to just have a little fair opportunity \nto discuss these. Come on. We weren't born yesterday. We know what is \nhappening. This is a whole process to delay, and I believe they hope to \ndefeat us on this issue.\n  It has been 10 years since we have had the increase. We have had 15 \nvotes. We had a couple of other amendments which were accepted. We are \nprepared. The issue, on these family-related issues--we are the \ncommittee, we will work closely with our brothers and sisters on other \ncommittees to get these jobs done. But don't, on Friday afternoon, say: \nOh, we just need to have a few more amendments on this. Then what will \nhappen?\n  We are basically holding the increase in the minimum wage hostage now \nfor additional tax expenditures for businesses. No clean bill. The \nHouse of Representatives, with 80 Republicans, went ahead and passed a \nclean bill but not here in the Senate. No, roadblocks were put in our \nway by Republicans. Make no mistake about it. Let's just call it what \nit is. Roadblocks, parliamentary tactics are used to block a bare \nincrease in the minimum wage, to basically prohibit that increase.\n  We have the additional billions of dollars in tax expenditures added \nto it and now we still have opposition by filibuster by amendment. All \nof us have been around here. It is filibuster by amendment. Thankfully, \nwe have a leader who is going to file cloture so at least we will have \nthe vote on Tuesday next. But there should be no doubt in the minds of \npeople, as we come into this weekend, who bears the burden in terms of \nthe basic reluctance and opposition to the increase in the minimum \nwage. As I said yesterday--I won't repeat it--but it amazes me to try \nand understand why this blind opposition, and why the vehemence of this \nopposition of increasing the minimum wage to $7.25. What is it that \nbothers our Republican friends? What is it about it? It isn't the \nquestion about we want an opportunity to talk about education or health \ncare or Social Security or immigration. No, no. There is opposition to \ngoing to $7.25 for those who are on the lowest part of the economic \nladder. We have seen the most extraordinary explosion of wealth in this \ncountry in the history of this Nation, and we have held those workers \nfor 10 years--they have lost 20 percent of their purchasing power. We \nare just restoring the purchasing power for those individuals. It has \nthe strong continuing opposition of the Republicans.\n\n  It is difficult for me to understand the reasons for that. Certainly \nit can't be economic. We haven't had a debate--we have been ready to \nhave that debate on what it does in terms of communities, what it does \nin terms of the economy. We have demonstrated that with figures, the \nbest we have had. States that have increased the minimum wage do better \neconomically. Countries that increase the minimum wage reduce poverty, \nhave the strongest economies in Europe. We are glad to debate the \nvarious case studies that have been done with Krueger and Card over at \nPrinceton analyzing different kinds of communities. We are glad to \ndebate if you want to debate economics. No, no. It is all filibuster by \namendment on these other topics.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Reid, for being \nwilling to file the cloture petition. We will vote on it next week, and \nhopefully we will be able to get a positive vote on that and we will be \nable to move ahead.\n  We want to leave on this Friday and let those who are out there who \nhave been working hard and who are appreciative of the Congress--4 \nhours the House took to debate an increase in the minimum wage, 80 \nRepublicans who supported that, and here we are at the end of the week, \nlooking forward to another week on this issue with over 109 different \namendments waiting, waiting, waiting, all offered by Republicans, on \nthe widest variety of different subject matters one can imagine. We all \nknow what is going on, and so do those minimum wage workers, their \nfamilies, workers across this country, middle-income people and others \nin the faith community, in the trade union movement, who believe in a \nfair America and believe that those on the lowest rung of the economic \nladder are entitled to participate in the promise of America, like \neveryone else.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following Senator \nAlexander's statement, Senator Lautenberg be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would make a brief comment, if the Senator \nwill allow that, prior to his speech.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis comments. He makes some very persuasive arguments in a very short \nperiod of time on the four amendments I talked about, and I am sure we \ncould reach an agreement and have a very short debate, probably 10 \nminutes equally divided, on those four and then a vote, and that would \nsimplify things a lot. I understand his comments about how we have \nover--I don't remember how many amendments--but I need to mention, \nthere are amendments on the Democratic side. It is a little easier for \nthem to forgo their amendments, because they are in control. The other \nside doesn't have a way to bring up issues. What I am saying right now \nis what the Democrats said for the last 2 years and what Senator \nKennedy said a minute ago is what our leadership had to say on issues \nas we filed cloture. This is a very common procedure, and we all know \nhow it works. So we will be dusting off arguments from the other side, \nthey will be dusting off arguments from us, but hopefully we can \nprogress through these issues in a very substantial way and get them \ndone.\n  I appreciate those comments, and I will learn from them. I did notice \nthe dates we talked about for quick resolution on the minimum wage \nhappened before this Chamber had television. I suspect a lot of the \ndebates we have here have more to do with television than they do with \nthe substance of the amendment we are working on. I hope Senators can \nforgo that possibility, although I am not sure in this culture we can. \nI would hope the pundits out there, radio talk shows and television \ntalk shows, could forgo on some of the issues trying to foment each of \ntheir sides so they argue and fight.\n  It would be a lot easier if we had some civility that went with it. I \nappreciate the other side's civility through these debates and I would \nask that they allow these four more amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, sometimes we like to say something so \noften and so vigorously that we believe it actually does what we say it \nwill do, and I am afraid that is the case of the minimum wage arguments \nthat have gone on since 1939. Perhaps it did in 1939, but I would \nsuggest today that it doesn't do what we say it will do. I expect to \nvote for the minimum wage proposal the Senate produces if it includes \nthe tax incentives and other measures that will help small business men \nand women pay the bill so they don't have to cut jobs as they compete \nwith companies around the world, in China and in India and other \nplaces.\n  I will talk for a few minutes this morning about whether the raising \nminimum wage does what we say it does. We are doing a fairly \nextraordinary thing here. The Government is intervening in the \nmarketplace. We don't ordinarily do that. We are fixing prices. We are \nfixing the cost of labor. Let's say we were in a class at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts, University of Wyoming, or University of \nTennessee in economics 101, and the professor walked in and said, Good \nmorning, students. We have an interesting problem here. Let's pose \nthis: The Government wants to intervene in the marketplace to fix the \nprice of labor--something it doesn't ordinarily do. So the problem for \nthe students to solve would be this: The reason for the intervention is \nto help, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, those who are on the \nlowest rungs of poverty. Working people on the lowest rungs of poverty \nwill be our target. We want to help them have more money in their \npockets.\n  Second, obviously we would like to do this in a way that most \nefficiently gets whatever money we have for this to them and doesn't \nmiss the mark. Next, we want to do it at the lowest possible cost. We \nhave lots of needs in the Government and in this country. Finally, we \nwant to find the fairest way to pay the bill. If we are going to come \nup with this grand social objective that is presumably an objective for\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\nthe whole country, then who pays the bill? All of us? Some of us? A few \nof us? The richest of us? Who pays the bill?\n\n  So the challenge to the students is this: The Government is going to \nintervene. We are going to help, according to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the lowest on the rungs of the economic ladder--people \nwho are poor--people who are working. We want to do it in an efficient \nway. We want to make sure the money gets to the people we want to help, \nand we want to send the bill for all of this--hopefully as low as \npossible--to the fairest group of people who ought to pay for it.\n  I think if the answer came back to that question that what we ought \nto do was raise the minimum wage, the professor would give it a D or an \nF, or he might even send it back to the students who sent him that \nanswer and say, Maybe you didn't hear my question. My question was: How \ndo we intervene in the marketplace to help the people who are on the \nlowest rungs of the economic ladder? How do we do that in the least \nexpensive, most efficient way, and with the fairest way to pay the \nbill?\n  Let's begin to critique the answer I posed that a student might have \ngiven to the professor in economics class 101. First, I think the \nprofessor might say, If you come back with a minimum wage idea, it is a \nvery expensive way to go about it. A new study released by the \nCongressional Budget Office, which I ask unanimous consent to be \nincluded in the Record following my remarks--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. A new study by CBO estimated that raising the minimum \nwage to $7.25, which is the proposal here, would cost $11 billion. A \nstudy done by the Employment Policies Institute put the cost at $18 \nbillion. I ask unanimous consent that this study by Professors \nBurkhauser of Cornell and Sabia of the University of Georgia be \nincluded in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So the student who suggested the minimum wage came up \nwith a pretty expensive idea, an $11 billion price tag, or $18 billion, \naccording to another study. But those estimates are about raising the \ncost of everyone's wages to $7.25 an hour. That is not how it works, \nbecause many workers are already paid a certain amount above the \nminimum wage and they will continue to earn more than the new minimum \nwage. So in effect, we are also legislating that a number of workers \nwill receive a wage higher than $7.25, which means the cost is much \nhigher than $11 billion or $18 billion. That is a lot of money. That is \nthe first critique of the student's answer.\n  The second one: How well does this money hit the mark? We heard \nSenator Kennedy say repeatedly: Those on the lowest rung of the \neconomic ladder. We have visions of women and children who are poor, \nparticularly single mothers. Senator Kennedy has great passion for this \nissue. I have heard him many times over the last 4 years talking about \nhow this is a women's issue; this is a children's issue; this is an \nissue for Americans on the lowest rung of the ladder who are in \npoverty. Well, let's see if that is true.\n  The studies show it is not true. Raising the minimum wage doesn't \nefficiently target the poor. Only one in five minimum wage workers live \nin households at or below the poverty line. So most of that $11 billion \nor $18 billion won't be going to the people who need it the most. It is \nmore likely to be going, for example, to raise the salary of a teenager \nfrom a well-off family who has a part-time job at the mall. The \nEmployment Policies Institute, the study I mentioned a little earlier \nby the professors from Cornell and the University of Georgia, said in \ntheir calculations that even less of the money would go to the workers \nin poor families--13 percent. Even if you look at households earning \ntwice the rate of poverty, which was just under $40,000 in 2005, the \nEmployment Policy Institute study found that less than half--43 percent \nof the minimum wage increase--would go to those families.\n  Let me go directly to the professors' study of the minimum wage. They \nsay:\n\n       While the minimum wage is often promoted as a policy \n     designed to help the poor, minorities, and single mothers, \n     this analysis reveals that only 3.7 percent of the benefits \n     from a $7.25 hour Federal minimum wage would go to poor \n     African-American families.\n\n  So 3.7 percent of the benefit of this $18 billion-plus cost will go \nto poor African-American families. Only 3.8 percent would go to poor \nsingle mother families. What we are about to do, if we do it, is spend \n$11 billion, $18 billion--more than that, probably--with the stated \nobjective of helping the poor, especially single women, especially \nmothers with children, especially minorities, and what the professors' \nstudy shows is that only 3.8 percent goes to poor single mother \nhouseholds.\n  Even more troubling, they go on:\n\n       The majority of working poor families, families who are \n     working but remain in poverty, receive no benefit from an \n     increase to $7.25 an hour.\n\n  The majority of families who are working but in poverty get no \nbenefit from what we are about to do. These families don't benefit \nbecause they already earn more than the new Federal minimum wage and \nremain in poverty either because of a low number of hours worked or a \nlarge family size. Many of these individuals would benefit far more \nfrom an increase from the generous Federal and State earned-income tax \nprograms.\n\n  A couple more statements from the professor from Cornell and the \nprofessor from Georgia:\n\n       Only 3.8 percent of the benefits from an increase to $7.25 \n     an hour accrue to poor single mothers. One of the factors \n     causing this low percentage of benefits is the fact that the \n     majority of poor single mothers have hourly wages above this \n     level. In addition, only 18.5 percent of the benefits going \n     to single mothers will go to those in poverty, the majority \n     of benefits going to single mothers will go to those earning \n     more than twice the poverty line.\n\n  So the authors conclude that only 12.7 percent, or 2.3 billion of \ntheir estimated $18 billion cost of this increase will go to poor \nfamilies, and only 3.7 percent goes to poor African-American families.\n  The authors say that the ability of the minimum wage to target poor \nfamilies is weaker and decreasing over time. Contrary to the statements \nof its advocates, fewer and fewer low-wage employees are supporting a \nfamily on minimum wage, with only 9 percent of low-wage employees \nactually supporting a poor family.\n  I think the professor so far, in grading the paper of the student who \nsuggested an increase in the minimum wage, would say, well, you came up \nwith something that is hugely expensive, $18 billion-plus. And second, \nyou came up with something that almost entirely that misses its target, \nonly 3 or 4 percent to poor African-American families out of this huge \namount of money? So far that paper is not doing very well at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts, Wyoming, or Tennessee.\n  Then there would be another question that ought to be answered. Who \npays the bill? The people who are to pay the bill under the proposal of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts are the small businesspeople of America. \nThey were described by the Senator from Wyoming because he used to own \na shoe store. We stand in the Senate almost every day and talk about \nsmall business men and women and how they have health care costs, how \nthey have taxes to pay, they have OSHA requirements to meet, they have \nFederal regulations added every year, and we say if we do not do \nsomething about this, more of these jobs are going to India and China, \nand we have a big outsourcing of jobs around the world.\n  Even if we, as a Senate, were to decide that we wanted to take the \nmost expensive and perhaps the most inefficient way to help the people \nlowest on the economic ladder, why would we send the bill to the small \nbusinesspeople of America? Why wouldn't we send it to Wall Street? Why \nwouldn't we send it to the big corporations? Why wouldn't we send it to \nthe taxpayers at large? Why couldn't all of us pay the bill?\n  We are very good in Washington, DC--I used to notice this as Governor \nof a State--some Senator or Congressman would come up with a good-\nsounding idea, pass it, hold a press conference, take credit for it, \nand come back down and make a statement at the Lincoln Day or Jefferson \nDay dinner about local control. What we do here all the time is come up \nwith good ideas, take credit for them, and send\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\nthe bill to someone else. That is what we are doing here: we are not \npaying for this. We are not saying: That is going to cost $18 billion \nso let's raise taxes on Americans to pay for it. We are saying it will \ncost $18 billion-plus, but, no worries, we will just send that on to \nthe small businesspeople of America, not the big businesspeople.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, small \nbusinesses employ 61 percent of all minimum wage workers. That is a lot \nof mom-and-pop shops, family-owned businesses. Why should they pay the \nbill for this idea? One reason it might have been better to take this \nlegislation through the committee that the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Wyoming so ably lead is, we could have discussed \nthis and there might have been a better way to reach this goal of \ntaking whatever money we have--maybe a generous amount, maybe $18 \nbillion--and sending it directly to people on the lowest rung of the \neconomic ladder.\n  We might have talked about the earned-income tax credit. The earned-\nincome tax credit isn't always popular on this side of the aisle \nbecause it has had some fraud in it, but the idea is a good idea. I \nfirst heard about it when Pat Moynihan was in the Nixon White House in \nthe early 1970s. He suggested instead of welfare programs we ought to \nhave a negative income tax. He said rather than set up a lot of \nGovernment programs that tend to break down the family and spend money \nin bureaucracies, if people are working in America, and they are not \nmaking much money, let's give them some money. We are a rich country. \nWe have 25 percent of all the money in the world every year for just 5 \npercent of the people in the world. And some people are really well \noff. They have more than one house. They have big incomes. We all know \nthat. And so it tugs at us to think we are so wealthy and we still have \npeople who are not just sitting on a bench, but we have people who are \nworking every day, sometimes two jobs, and they are not making enough \nto help their families. That is what this debate is about. Pat Moynihan \nsaid in the early 1970s, and this Congress has said before: Let's try \nthe earned-income tax credit. In other words, if you are working, and \nyou are poor and you qualify, we will send you a check. The check comes \nfrom all of us. It doesn't come from this segment of society or that \nsegment or just the small businesspeople. We all step up to the plate. \nThe taxpayer pays the bill for earned-income tax credit.\n  Why didn't we have a hearing to talk about that? The tax credit is \ntargeted to help low-income workers. It is only available for families \nmaking up to between 175 to 200 percent of poverty. For example, in \n2006, a single parent with two or more children could not receive the \nearned-income tax credit if he or she earned more than $36,000. That is \nnot a lot of money when you are trying to raise two children.\n  In comparison, according to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly \n60 percent of a minimum wage increase would go to individuals living in \nfamilies earning more than $36,000. So 60 percent of what we propose to \ndo here goes to families earning more than $36,000, but an earned-\nincome tax credit recipient could not receive money if they made more \nthan $36,000.\n  The CBO study released this month also looked at the potential impact \nof increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 as well as possible increases \nto the earned-income tax credit. I put that in the Record a few minutes \nago.\n\n  If we increase the minimum wage as has been proposed, CBO says it \nwould cost $11 billion, the smaller number, but only $1.6 billion of \nthat $11 billion would go to working families living below the poverty \nline. CBO is bipartisan, and works for all of us. They went on to say \nthat to send nearly the same amount of money to working poor families, \n$1.4 billion in assistance, we would only need to increase the earned-\nincome tax credit by $2.4 billion. So instead of a $11 billion or $18 \nbillion pricetag for the minimum wage, we could have done the same \nthing through the earned-income tax credit by spending $2.4 billion.\n  Increasing the earned-income tax credit would target the same amount \nof money to poor families as raising the minimum wage at one-fifth the \ncost.\n  I have used my example of asking a professor at the University of \nMassachusetts or Wyoming or Tennessee, saying to his class: We have a \nlarge goal. We want to help people who are working and who are at the \nlowest rung of the economic ladder, as Senator Kennedy describes. What \nwould be the best way to do it? Tell me, the professor would say, tell \nme how to get the largest amount of money to that group of people, how \nto do it at a reasonable cost, and tell me who should pay the bill.\n  I think if the answer came back that we should spend $18 billion or \nmore, and it costs five times as much to do it through the minimum wage \nas it would through the earned-income tax credit, and in addition to \nthat, doing it through the minimum wage sends the bill to a struggling \ngroup of people disproportionately, the small businesspeople of \nAmerica, and lets off all the rest of us, I think that person would get \nan F. And I think we ought to, as well.\n  I am sure what is going to happen in this Congress is we are going to \npass a minimum wage bill because we are a wealthy country and we want \npeople who are working and who do not have as much to have more. That \nis our impulse. And I don't believe that bill will get out of this \nSenate without substantial assistance for the small businesspeople who \nare paying the bill, or disproportionately the bill.\n  My hope is that Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, some time before we \nbring up this minimum wage idea again, will say: Let's give ourselves \nthe same kind of examination that I just suggested for those college \nstudents. Let's ask ourselves how to do this in an efficient, fair way \nthat gets the money to the right people, instead of going around the \ncountry saying ``minimum wage, minimum wage, minimum wage,'' only to \nfind out some time later that we have a lot of disappointed, poor, \nworking families around America who aren't helped by what we convinced \nourselves was the right thing to do.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                 U.S.Congress,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your request, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed some of the \n     potential consequences of a hypothetical increase in the \n     federal minimum wage rate from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per \n     hour and of several hypothetical expansions in the earned \n     income tax credit (EITC). To provide the information, as \n     requested, about the potential impacts on workers whose \n     family income was below the federal poverty threshold, the \n     analysis used data from the March 2005 Current Population \n     Survey (CPS).\n       The analysis is subject to a number of limitations and \n     should not be interpreted as a cost estimate of the effects \n     of implementing changes in the federal minimum wage or the \n     EITC in future years. CBO simulated the impacts of those \n     policy options as if they were in effect in 2004 and did not \n     incorporate any effect on employment levels or the number of \n     hours worked. Since that time, the number of workers with \n     wage rates in the $5.15 to $7.25 range has fallen by almost \n     30 percent and is expected to continue to decline as \n     increases in state minimum wage rates and other changes in \n     the labor market occur. For simplicity, CBO assumed that an \n     increase in the minimum wage rate would have affected only \n     the wage rates of workers earning between the old and the new \n     minimum rates. Some workers with wage rates outside that \n     range might also be affected by an increase in the minimum \n     wage. For example, employers are permitted to pay certain \n     tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour if their tips \n     bring their total hourly earnings up to the federal minimum \n     wage; thus, an increase in the federal minimum wage could \n     cause some of those employers to raise their wage rates. \n     Also, some employers of workers already paid at or just above \n     the new minimum wage rate might increase those workers' wage \n     rates as well.\n       In addition, the CPS does not contain all of the \n     information needed to compute the EITC, limiting the accuracy \n     of those estimates. Based on the CPS, the estimated amount of \n     EITC payments in 2004 was about 25 percent below the actual \n     amount that year. CBO does not have a basis to infer whether \n     that discrepancy would lead to an underestimate or an \n     overestimate of the share of additional payments resulting \n     from the hypothetical expansions of the EITC that would go to \n     poor families. Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     produces the official estimates for any change in the EITC; \n     its estimates may be different.\n       As discussed more fully in the attachment to this letter, \n     the major findings of the analysis are these:\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\n       On the basis of data from the March 2005 CPS, about 18 \n     percent of the 12 million workers who were paid an hourly \n     wage rate between the federal minimum wage of $5.l5 and $7.24 \n     were in families that had a total cash income below the \n     federal poverty threshold in 2004. Had all of the workers in \n     that wage range, instead, received $7.25 per hour, they would \n     have gotten about $11 billion in additional wages in that \n     year. About 15 percent of those additional wages ($1.6 \n     billion) would have been received by workers in poor \n     families.\n       As requested, CBO examined the potential effects of \n     hypothetical expansions in the EITC that would have provided \n     additional payments to workers in poor families similar to \n     the amount of additional earnings poor workers would have \n     received by increasing the minimum wage rate to $7.25 per \n     hour. One option was to increase the subsidy rate for \n     childless workers by 50 percent. Another option was to \n     increase the subsidy rate for workers with three or more \n     children by 25 percent. On the basis of data from the CPS, \n     combining those options would have increased total EITC \n     payments by roughly $2.4 billion in 2004, with workers in \n     poor families receiving $1.4 billion of that total.\n       The analysis was prepared by Molly Dahl, Tom DeLeire, and \n     Ralph Smith of CBO's Health and Human Resources Division and \n     Ed Harris of CBO's Tax Analysis Division.

Marron,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n       Attachment.\n\n    Response to a Request by Senator Grassley About the Effects of \nIncreasing the Federal Minimum Wage Versus Expanding the Earned Income \n                               Tax Credit\n\n       In response to a request from Senator Grassley, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) used data from the Current \n     Population Survey (CPS) to analyze the distributional effects \n     of a hypothetical increase in the federal minimum wage rate \n     and of several hypothetical expansions in the earned income \n     tax credit (EITC). Although use of the CPS allows the \n     production of results consistent with official poverty \n     measures, the CPS is known to be inaccurate for measuring the \n     EITC. CBO's estimates for a particular policy change could \n     either understate or overstate the true cost of an expansion \n     of the EITC, depending on how information available in the \n     CPS differs from what taxpayers reported on their tax forms. \n     CBO simulated the impacts of the hypothetical policy options \n     as if they were in effect in 2004 and did not incorporate any \n     effect on employment levels or the number of hours worked. \n     The results are not estimates of the effects of implementing \n     those options in future years.\n       Furthermore, this analysis is not a cost estimate. For \n     proposals that would amend the Internal Revenue Code, \n     including changes in the EITC, official cost estimates are \n     provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation; its estimates \n     may differ from those presented here.\n\n\n                              Methodology\n\n       CBO identified workers who would have been affected by a \n     hypothetical increase in the federal minimum wage rate from \n     $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour in 2004 as those who \n     reported in the March 2005 CPS that they were paid on an \n     hourly basis and whose wage rate was between $5.15 and $7.24 \n     at the time of the survey. Also included were workers who \n     reported that they were paid $5.00 per hour, under the \n     assumption that most of them were actually paid $5.15 but had \n     rounded their survey response.\n       To estimate the impact of the hypothetical wage rate \n     increase on the family income of workers, CBO assumed that \n     all hourly workers whose wage rate was between $5.15 and \n     $7.24 per hour would have been paid exactly $7.25 per hour \n     had the hypothetical minimum wage rate been in effect. CBO \n     further assumed that workers whose wage rate was $7.25 or \n     higher would have been unaffected by the hypothetical \n     increase in the minimum wage. For this tabulation, CBO \n     assumed that no changes in employment or hours would have \n     resulted from the higher minimum wage rate. The earnings gain \n     attributed to the hypothetical increase in the minimum wage \n     was calculated simply by multiplying the increase in the wage \n     rate by the total number of hours that CBO estimated the \n     affected people worked in 2004.\n       A limitation of this analysis is that the estimates are \n     based on wage rates reported for March 2005 and income \n     reported for 2004 and, therefore, do not reflect changes that \n     have occurred since then or that will occur before future \n     changes in the federal minimum wage, if enacted, would be \n     implemented. For example, increases in state minimum wage \n     rates and other changes in the labor market have already \n     lessened the potential impact of raising the federal minimum \n     wage rate.\n       CBO used information on family size and both before-tax \n     cash family income and after-tax income, including certain \n     noncash sources of income, in 2004 to place the affected \n     workers into income categories relative to the poverty \n     thresholds.\n       As requested, CBO also examined different ways of expanding \n     the EITC to achieve similar income gains for workers in \n     otherwise-poor families. Note that the CPS does not contain \n     all of the information necessary to compute the EITC, \n     limiting the accuracy of CBO's estimates. For example, using \n     the CPS, CBO estimates that taxpayers received about $29 \n     billion in EITC in 2004, when they actually received about \n     $40 billion.\n\n\nEstimates of the Effects of a Hypothetical Increase in the Minimum Wage \n                                in 2004\n\n       Table 1 provides CBO's estimates of the number of workers \n     paid on an hourly basis in March 2005 who received a wage \n     rate below $5.00, between that rate and $7.24, and at or \n     above $7.25. It shows that 11.6 million workers reported that \n     they received a wage rate in the affected range. Table 1 also \n     provides a cross-tabulation by income-to-poverty ratio, based \n     on the family cash income of those workers in 2004, as \n     reported by the Census Bureau. It shows that 18.5 percent \n     (2.1 million) of the workers who received a wage rate in \n     the relevant range in March 2005 were living in families \n     that were poor in 2004.\n       Table 2 repeats the information from Table 1 but uses an \n     after-tax measure of income that also includes the value of \n     certain noncash sources of income. In the placement of people \n     into income-to-poverty categories, the poverty thresholds \n     themselves remain unchanged. On the basis of this alternative \n     measure of income, a smaller portion of the workers in the \n     relevant wage range were counted as poor (14.4 percent, \n     rather than 18.5 percent).\n       Tables 3 provides CBO's estimates of the income gains that \n     would have resulted from raising the wage rates of everyone \n     who reported that they were paid between $5.00 and $7.24 per \n     hour up to an hourly rate of $7.25. For those figures, CBO \n     simply added its estimates of the gains in earnings from the \n     wage rate increase to estimates of families' cash income. CBO \n     estimates that $1.6 billion (15 percent) of the $11 billion \n     in increased earnings that resulted from the higher wage rate \n     would have been received by workers who were in families with \n     money income below the official poverty threshold in 2004.\n\n\n Estimates of the Effects of Hypothetical Increases in the EITC in 2004\n\n       Table 4 provides CBO's estimates of the distributional \n     income effects of the changes in the EITC specified in the \n     request. Again, the estimates are based on the CPS, not tax \n     statistics, and do not take into account the many intricacies \n     of actual tax provisions or the ways that people might alter \n     their behavior in response to changes in the EITC. The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation provides the official estimates of the \n     potential effects of changes in the EITC.\n       In 2004, eligible taxpayers with one qualifying child could \n     claim a credit of 34 percent of their earnings up to $7,660, \n     resulting in a maximum credit of $2,604; the credit phased \n     down at a rate of 15.98 percent of earnings above $14,040 for \n     nonjoint filers and $15,040 for joint filers. For eligible \n     taxpayers with two or more qualifying children, the credit \n     was 40 percent of their earnings up to $10,750, with a \n     maximum credit of $4,300; the phase-out rate was 21.06 \n     percent, beginning at earnings above $14,040 for nonjoint \n     filers and $15,040 for joint filers. Taxpayers between the \n     ages of 25 and 64 with no qualifying children could claim a \n     credit of 7.65 percent of their earnings up to $5,100, \n     resulting in a maximum credit of $390; beginning at earnings \n     above $6,390 for nonjoint filers and $7,390 for joint filers, \n     the credit phased out at a rate of 7.65 percent. All \n     thresholds are higher now. Not only are they indexed for \n     inflation, but the plateau for joint filers was increased by \n     $1,000 in 2005 and is scheduled to increase again in 2008.\n       The first column of Table 4 shows that, of the estimated \n     $29 billion in EITC received in 2004, about 40 percent ($11 \n     billion) was received by workers in poor families. (As \n     explained, that CPS-based estimate of the total amount of \n     EITC received is much lower than the actual amount that year, \n     $40 billion.)\n       The second column reports CBO's estimates of the effects of \n     a hypothetical expansion in the EITC in which workers in \n     families with three or more children would be eligible for an \n     additional credit. The subsidy rate for that group was \n     increased from 40 percent to 50 percent, the maximum credit \n     available was increased from $4,300 to $5,375, and the phase-\n     out rate was increased from 21.06 to 26.325 percent, \n     representing a 25 percent increase over the credit available \n     in 2004 to those in families with two or more children. (The \n     difference between the maximum credit available to those in \n     families with three children and those in families with two \n     children is $1,075, as compared with the $1,696 difference in \n     the maximum credit available to those in families with two \n     children and those in families with one child.) Using CPS \n     data, CBO estimates that this expansion would have increased \n     EITC payments to poor families by $1.1 billion.\n       The third column examines what the results of a \n     hypothetical expansion of the EITC to childless individuals \n     might have been. As requested, the subsidy rate, the maximum \n     credit, and the phase-out rate to workers without children \n     were increased by 50 percent. Under the hypothetical \n     expansion, the maximum credit available to those workers \n     would have been $585, and the subsidy and phase-out rates \n     would have been 11.475 percent. This expansion would have \n     increased EITC payments to poor families by an estimated $0.3 \n     billion.\n       The fourth column examines the effects of a hypothetical \n     expansion of the EITC in which both the expansion for those \n     in families with three or more children and the ex-\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\n     pansion for childless individuals discussed above were \n     implemented. Using CPS data, CBO estimates that the \n     combination of the two would have resulted in increasing EITC \n     payments to the poor by $1.4 billion, about 60 percent of the \n     overall increase of $2.4 billion that CBO estimates would \n     have occurred in 2004 if those expansions had been in place \n     at the time.\n\n                         TABLE 1.--DISTRIBUTION OF HOURLY WORKERS IN MARCH 2005, BY WAGE IN 2005 AND FAMILY CASH INCOME IN 2004\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                          Hourly Workers, by Wage Rate\n                                                       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Less Than $5         $5 to Less Than $7.25        $7.25 and Higher            Total\n                Income-to-Poverty Ratio                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Number                   Number                     Number                 Number\n                                                         (Millions)   Percent     (Millions)      Percent    (Millions)   Percent   (Millions)   Percent\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess Than 1.0.........................................          0.2      20.2              2.1        18.5          3.3       5.2          5.7       7.5\n1.0 to Less Than 1.5..................................          0.1      11.6              1.5        12.7          4.3       6.7          5.9       7.7\n1.5 to Less Than 2.0..................................          0.1      11.2              1.3        11.1          5.7       8.9          7.1       9.3\n2.0 to Less Than 3.0..................................          0.3      21.4              2.1        18.3         12.9      20.3         15.2      20.0\n3.0 or More...........................................          0.4      35.6              4.6        39.4         37.5      58.9         42.4      55.6\n                                                       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total.............................................          1.1     100.0             11.6       100.0         63.6     100.0         76.3    100.0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office based on data from the Current Population Survey (March 2005).\nNotes: Wage is the reported hourly wage in March 2005.\nIncome is before-tax family cash income in 2004, corresponding to the Census Bureau's definition of money income.

Since its \n     inception in 1938, increases in the federal minimum wage have \n     become an increasingly weak mechanism for addressing the \n     problem of poverty in America. This continuing deterioration \n     stems from the fact that fewer low-wage employees are \n     supporting a family on a minimum wage income. As poverty \n     becomes more a problem of hours worked and not an \n     individual's wage level, anti-poverty policies that focus on \n     wages will be less efficient than polices that focus on \n     income, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n\n\n                            Wages vs. Income\n\n       While wages and income are certainly related, the \n     connection between the two has always been tenuous. In 1946, \n     Nobel prize-winning economist George Stigler commented, ``the \n     connection between hourly wages and the standard of living of \n     a family is remote and fuzzy.'' As this study shows, the \n     fuzzy connection in 1946 has become blurrier over time.\n       Examining Census Bureau data since 1939, the authors found \n     that fewer low-wage employees live in poor households today \n     than in years past. Specifically, in 1939, 85 percent of low-\n     wage employees were living in poor households. By 2003, only \n     17 percent of low-wage employees were living in poor \n     households. Consequently, attempting to target\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\n     poor families by manipulating wages is an inefficient means \n     of addressing the problem.\n       Even more important than the number of low-wage employees \n     living in poor households is the number of low-wage employees \n     who are the heads of poor households. This stereotypical \n     beneficiary of an increase in the wage floor is the one \n     supporters of minimum wage increases claim represents the \n     typical minimum wage employee. In reality, a small fraction \n     of low-wage employees are the head of a poor household, and \n     this number has decreased significantly over time. In 1939, \n     nearly one-third (31%) of all low-wage employees were the \n     heads of a poor household. By 2003, only 9 percent of low-\n     wage employees were heading a poor household.\n       These statistics all reveal an underlying point--modern \n     families have multiple workers whose collective earnings make \n     up the family income. Federal anti-poverty policy should \n     adjust accordingly. As more women and teenagers have entered \n     the workforce as second and third earners, the ranks of low-\n     wage employees contain fewer individuals singlehandedly \n     supporting a family.\n\n\n               Federal Minimum Wage Increases and Poverty\n\n       A byproduct of the aforementioned changes in the \n     composition of family incomes is that the poor make up a \n     small percentage of beneficiaries from a wage hike. Contrary \n     to popular perception, the average minimum wage employee is \n     not in poverty or raising a family on a minimum wage income. \n     Analyzing Census data, the authors found that a \n     beneficiary from a proposed federal minimum wage hike to \n     $7.25 an hour is far more likely to be in a family earning \n     more than three times the poverty line than in a poor \n     family. In total, only 12.7 percent of the benefits from a \n     federal minimum wage increase to $7.25 an hour would go to \n     poor families. In contrast, 63 percent of benefits would \n     go to families earning more than twice the poverty line \n     and 42 percent would go to families earning more than \n     three times the poverty line. The average benefit per \n     household is approximately the same, with poor families \n     receiving a benefit of $1,110 and families earning three \n     times the poverty line earning $1,090--nearly the same \n     benefit, despite a vast difference in family incomes.\n       While there is strong empirical evidence to suggest that \n     increasing the minimum wage will have adverse employment \n     effects--particularly among young African Americans, young \n     non-high school graduates, and teenagers--the authors assume \n     no disemployment effects associated with the minimum wage \n     hike so as to allow the policy its best chance to achieve the \n     poverty-reducing goals promised by its proponents. While the \n     minimum wage is often promoted as a policy designed to help \n     the poor, minorities, and single mothers, this analysis \n     reveals that only 3.7 percent of the benefits from a $7.25 an \n     hour federal minimum wage would go to poor African-American \n     families. Only 3.8 percent would go to poor single mother \n     households. Even more troubling, the majority of ``working \n     poor'' families--families who are working but remain in \n     poverty--receive no benefit from an increase to $7.25 an \n     hour. These families don't benefit because they already earn \n     more than the new federal minimum wage and remain in poverty \n     either because of a low number of hours worked or a large \n     family size. Many of these individuals would benefit far more \n     from an increase in the generosity of federal and state EITC \n     programs.\n\n\n                        Work Effort and Poverty\n\n       Examining the hours worked by poor employees reveals that \n     increases in work effort could have a significant effect on \n     income. The authors found that the median wage of the highest \n     earner in a poor household was much higher than the proposed \n     federal minimum wage--$9.25 for poor households and $9.60 for \n     poor and near-poor households (up to 150 percent of the \n     poverty line). While this wage should be sufficient to put a \n     family of four out of poverty (even without a second or even \n     third earner), the data reveal that the majority of these \n     individuals are not working full-time.\n       The median hours worked for the highest earner in a poor \n     family in 2003 was 1,720--significantly less than full time \n     (2,080 hours a year). While including near-poor families in \n     the calculation brings this number up to 1,872 hours, the \n     majority of these individuals are still working less than \n     full time at their current wage. These individuals would \n     receive significantly more benefit from programs that promote \n     increased work effort than they ever would from a minimum \n     wage increase.\n\n\n                  Single Mothers and the Minimum Wage\n\n       Advocates of increasing the federal minimum wage often \n     insinuate that primary beneficiaries will be single mothers \n     raising a family on a minimum wage income. As was mentioned \n     above, only 3.8 percent of the benefits from an increase to \n     $7.25 an hour accrue to poor single mothers. One of the \n     factors causing this low percentage of benefits is the fact \n     that the majority of poor single mothers (58%) have hourly \n     wages above this level. In addition, only 18.5 percent of the \n     benefits going to single mothers will go to those in poverty. \n     The majority of benefits going to single mothers will go to \n     those earning more than twice the poverty line.\n       Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), the primary sponsor of a \n     federal minimum wage increase to $7.25 an hour, recently \n     stated in support of an increase that ``the jobs available to \n     women leaving welfare are often minimum wage jobs.'' Census \n     data, however, shows this is not the case. From 1995-2000, \n     the time period following welfare reform, the employment rate \n     of single mothers increased by 10.8 percentage points. Many \n     of these single mothers were undoubtedly leaving the welfare \n     rolls and joining the workforce. If Sen. Kennedy's claim is \n     correct, one would expect a significant increase in the \n     number of single mothers holding low-wage or federal minimum \n     wage jobs. In reality, 77 percent of the increase in \n     employment was accounted for by single mothers holding jobs \n     paying more than low wages (50 percent of the average private \n     sector hourly wage rate).\n       Examining the period over the 1990's business cycle \n     produces similar results. The employment rate of single \n     mothers increased by 14 percentage points, with 64 percent of \n     this increase accounted for by single mothers earning more \n     than low wages. Only 24 percent of the increase can be \n     accounted for by those who held jobs at the prevailing \n     federal minimum wage rate.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The authors calculate that, absent any employment loss, the \n     cost to employers of the proposed increase in the federal \n     minimum wage to $7.25 an hour will be $18.26 billion. Only \n     12.7 percent ($2.3 billion) of this cost will actually go to \n     poor families, with only 3.7 percent going to poor African-\n     American families. The ability of the minimum wage to target \n     poor families is weaker and decreasing over time. Contrary to \n     the statements of its advocates, fewer and fewer low-wage \n     employees are supporting a family on the minimum wage, with \n     only 9 percent of low-wage employees actually supporting a \n     poor family.\n       Therefore, effective anti-poverty programs must concentrate \n     on family income and not wages. While most working poor \n     families will not receive any benefit from an increase in the \n     federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, the vast majority \n     would receive a benefit from increases in the generosity of \n     federal and state EITC programs. These programs provide \n     targeted assistance to the low-income working families so \n     often cited in support of minimum wage increases--the same \n     families that receive a minority of the benefits from a wage \n     increase.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Lautenberg will be \nrecognized next. I don't see him in the Senate. I will yield to him \nwhen he comes.\n  I say to my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, how much I \nappreciate his fabulous remarks and analysis.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 209 and 210 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside and I call up amendments Nos. 209 \nand 210 en bloc on behalf of Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for Mr. Kyl, \n     proposes amendments numbered 209 and 210 en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Alexander, I was going to talk about the \nearned-income tax credit in some detail, about how we work it in \nAmerica today. An amendment I filed has been accepted, and I do think \nthe earned-income tax credit, as the Senator most cogently stated, has \ngreater potential to help the working poor in America than the minimum \nwage increase. I knew that was so. But after the Senator's speech I \nknow it is much more so than I thought. It is important we hear about \nthis. I thank the Senator.\n  The amendment that I offered that was accepted will ask the Treasury \nDepartment within 6 months to report to us what can be done to allow \nworking Americans to get their earned-income tax credit as part of \ntheir paycheck. I have been talking about this for several years. It is \ntime to get serious about it. I found most people get their earned-\nincome tax credit when they file their tax return the next year.\n  They work all year. As a result of that income history and the number \nof children they have, they qualify for the earned-income tax credit, \nand they get a big refund. On average it is $1,700 to $2,400, depending \non the size of the family. That is a lot of money. It is almost $1 per \nhour worked.\n  Now, one of the key purposes of the earned-income tax credit was to \nhelp the working poor. The working poor are trying to make decisions \nabout jobs, how to take care of their families, and we wanted to \nincentivize them to work and to not take welfare or other benefits, but \nover the years, the way it has worked out, the tax credit comes in one \nlump sum--not when a person is\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nmaking a decision about whether to go to work. And they don't get it \nthen, so they still are paid whatever the minimum wage is.\n  I feel strongly about this. It is contrary to the policy that Milton \nFriedman and others thought about when they were talking about earning \ntax credits by working because, in the mind of the employee, the \nworker, there is no connection between that big tax return and their \nwork. The tax credit needs to be tied to the work. It can be done now. \nA small number of businesses provide that tax credit today on the \npaycheck. It would, in fact, amount to almost $1 an hour for lower \nincome workers as an increase in their pay if we can make this happen.\n  Remember, we do not have withholdings from this tax credit. There are \nno deductions from it. It is $1 they can take home, keep, and use for \ntheir family--to fix the tires on the car, the brakes, buy something \ntheir children need at school.\n  It is bad public policy to have the earned income tax credit to be \ndistributed as it is. It is contrary to, I think, the impetus behind \nit. I believe we can fix it.\n  I know a lot of people, as the Senator said, think the earned income \ntax credit is rife with fraud. There is some evidence to suggest there \nis a substantial amount of fraud in this program. I do not think it \nwould increase if it were paid on the paycheck.\n  I think more people, perhaps, would find themselves eligible if it \nwere brought up at the workplace with them when they started to work \nand they made claim to it, who otherwise would not know they are \neligible for it and might not even file a tax return, or if they do, \nthey may not even claim the earned income tax credit. So I think we \nmight have some more people claim the benefit, but it would have the \npublic policy benefit of encouraging work and helping people while they \nwork.\n  I think it is the right thing to do. I have talked with the Treasury \nDepartment about it several times. They fiddle around, and they talk to \nyou, and they give an excuse, and they say: There is this problem and \nthat problem. But from the beginning, this has been talked about. When \nthey got right down to it, they could not obtain a consensus on how to \ndo it, and they did not require it to be made part of the paycheck. \nThey allowed it to be done differently. And most people are taking it \notherwise than in their paycheck.\n  So, Mr. President, I am excited that this has been accepted. I hope \nthe Treasury Department will respond in good faith to help us analyze \nthis problem. And if they do, I think we can do a lot for working \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Alabama \nand ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to his \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. We would be pleased to have \nthat happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, yesterday, I had the pleasure of traveling \nto Lee's Summit, MO, to talk about the problem of health care. Right \nnow, we know about 47 million Americans do not have health insurance. \nThat is a huge burden for those families. It is a big problem for all \nof us as policymakers who need to be addressing this issue.\n  I went with the President and HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt. We toured \nthe Saint Luke's Health System Hospital in Lee's Summit, which \nrepresents a very important next step in information technology for \nhealth care.\n  The information on patients coming in--from the diagnosis to the x \nrays--is all included on a basic computer format, which makes it \navailable to any physician or nurse or other health care provider \nworking with that patient. Even the radiologist does a description of \nwhat the x ray means, which is included by voice transcription directly \ninto the program that is on the computer. It is linked through each \nroom, so at a distance, for smaller rural hospitals, experts can do as \nthorough a diagnosis as they could in the room, with the exception they \ncannot physically put their hands on the patient.\n  But this has brought this hospital into a state where more and more \nhospitals want to go. We have the best technology. We have the best \nhealth care providers. We have the finest new medications, prescription \ndrugs, that have dealt with many of the illnesses. But we have a much \nmore expensive system because we have such quality care. The President \nhas outlined a proposal on how we can incentivize Americans to buy \ninsurance, keep health care costs under control, and maintain private \ncontrol of health care decisions, leaving it in the hands of the \npatients and the providers.\n  Well, I believe the President has said the best way to do that is \nthrough private health insurance. He says that is a debate we ought to \nhave in Washington. We believe the private sector is the best delivery \nvehicle of health care. We know there is a role for the Federal \nGovernment, but it is not to dictate, it is not to be the \ndecisionmaker.\n  As he suggested, I think it makes sense to look at the Tax Code as \npart of the solution to the problem. Right now, if you pay your own \nhealth insurance, you pay taxes on the entire cost. If you are an \nindividual, you get no benefit from paying your health insurance. But \nif you have an employer who pays for your health insurance, either all \nor part of it, you get that tax free.\n  I think that creates a very unlevel playing field. The President's \nproposal would establish a more equitable system, one I hope this body \nwill carefully consider through the HELP Committee--to look at it, look \nat the details, criticize it, change it, but at least give it a full \nhearing.\n  I was rather disappointed, yesterday, before we even went out, to see \nsome leaders of the majority party saying, oh, it is dead on arrival. \nWell, we are in such need of having real solutions to health care, I \nsuggest this is a serious proposal that warrants serious discussion. I \ndo not know all the details of it. But I had an opportunity to ask \nquestions of staffers. I listened intently as the program was presented \nto a number of small business owners and small business employees who \nwere very excited about the prospect of getting a tax break at a \nminimum of maybe some $2,200 a year if they bought health care--\nwhatever minimum program their States would provide--if they were a \nsingle person, they would get $7,500 off of their tax bill; if they are \na married couple, filing jointly, they would get $15,000.\n  Now, you may ask the question: Well, if they are low income and do \nnot have to pay any income tax, where would the benefit come from? \nWell, by lowering their AGI, or the adjusted gross income, they would \nnot be subject to Social Security and Medicare costs. So at the $15,000 \nlevel, that would exempt $15,000 from payroll taxes for FICA and \nMedicare.\n  So they were very encouraged that they would, for the first time, be \nable to afford health care. The small business owners were anxious to \nprovide it for their employees or see their employees have access to \nit.\n  There are lots of questions about how it works. But from what I \nunderstood, you have to determine what is it you have to buy to \nqualify. I think at this point the thinking is that the States would \ndetermine what that base program is. It would obviously have to have \nsome kind of catastrophic care.\n  It is my hope that it would also include preventive care to make sure \npeople stay healthy. It is particularly important for children. We are \ngoing to be renewing the SCHIP program to make sure children in poor \nfamilies have that kind of coverage. The best investment we can make in \nthe future is assuring that our youngest citizens get off to a good \nstart with good health care, identifying potential problems and \ntreating them early and getting them off to a start in their education, \ngiving them the opportunity to begin life with good health. And a good \neducation is No. 1. SCHIP would be available for the children of \nfamilies who\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nare at the bottom of the income ladder. But for all children, I hope \nthey will be buying a health plan that focuses on preventive care, \nmaking sure people know what they have to do to stay healthy, and \nidentifying problems before they become serious.\n  The States would be given flexibility to use additional funds which \nthe Federal Government makes available to the States to implement their \nprograms. Some States already have ways of assisting their lower income \npeople, not the poorest but the lower income workers, providing the \nassistance for payments of premiums, if that is what the State wishes \nto do. So there is a lot of room for innovative programs at the State \nlevel.\n  The night before, the Governor of Missouri, Matt Blunt, offered \nanother program, for example, and that is to say to all businesses: If \nyou offer a health care plan to your employees that meets basic minimum \nState standards, you will be exempted from the franchise tax--a great \nboon to encourage Missouri businesses to offer all of their employees \nat least a basic health care plan. Proposals like that would be \nencouraged, and the great laboratories of the States could move forward \nto determine what kinds of things work best.\n  There was some question--I don't know where it came from--that this \nmight cut back on our support of FQACs, federally qualified health \ncenters, what we call community health centers. There is no truth to \nthat. The President is a big supporter--as is, of course, his Secretary \nof Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt--of making sure there are \nhealth care clinics available in every area of the country. They have \nbeen on a vigorous expansion program and intend to continue that. I \nhave visited health care clinics, over 50 of them, in different parts \nof our State, from the center cities to the suburban areas to the \nlarger communities in rural areas to the most economically challenged, \nlowest population areas of the State. Those are absolutely the most \ncritical safety net we have. I believe strongly in them. I have worked \nwith my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to support them. They must \ncontinue to be there.\n  We are talking in this plan about using the Tax Code to make health \ninsurance more available, but community health centers have the \nimportant challenge of making sure it is accessible. In many places, \nthe only place you can find a doctor who will deliver babies is in a \ncommunity health center or through a community health center, or find a \ndentist who will take care of dental problems. A shocking statistic we \nheard: 80 percent of 17-year-olds have serious dental problems in the \nUnited States. We have made dental care part of it. But these people \nwho work in the community health centers are a vital part of our health \ncare network.\n  The President's plan envisions strengthening that safety net. In \naddition, he remains committed to allowing small businesses to go \ntogether in pools to purchase health insurance and avoid the high \npremiums often charged to individual small businesses and the cost of \nadministering those plans, which becomes extremely burdensome for many \nsmall businesses. I hope this year we can also pass association health \nplans.\n  Finally, the President spoke very forcefully about the need to \ncontinue the effort for medical malpractice reform. We saw the need for \nit in Missouri. Missouri passed a bill, and we started getting much \nbetter health care. In the western part of the State, until Missouri \npassed its medical malpractice reform, there were no doctors, outside \nof government hospitals, who could afford to be in the business of \ndelivering babies. This is a problem which translates into higher costs \nof medicine because with unrestrained medical malpractice lawsuits \nbeing filed, there is a real danger that a great deal of time and \neffort will be wasted on unnecessary procedures for fear of the impact \nof a malpractice lawsuit. Many times, even the best doctors have \nmaloutcomes. People don't live forever. We are all going to die from \nsomething. If there is a lawsuit filed against a doctor every time \nthere is a bad outcome, they are going to be faced with insurance costs \nthat go through the roof or health care that is not available.\n  I go back to the point that this is a concept, the outlines of which \nI think I know but which I think deserve a fair hearing. I hope that as \nwe take a look at the many challenges facing us, our HELP Committee and \nour Finance Committee will look at the President's program to determine \nwhether it may be one way of assuring we get health care insurance to \nmany of the 47 million Americans who don't have it. I urge that they do \nso. I am sure there will be changes all of us would like to make, but I \nbelieve the concept merits a hearing. I urge my colleagues to give it \nthat chance.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, to follow up briefly on the last item my \ncolleague from Missouri was discussing, health care, the President in \nhis State of the Union addressed it and laid out one approach which was \ncertainly different from anything I had heard before, a tax approach \nthat would call for some people to have to pay some taxes on Cadillac \nplans that they enjoy today and to use the money generated to help \nfolks who don't enjoy that kind of health coverage. Some people \nimmediately rejected it out of hand. I have not done that. I think we \nneed to study it more closely and understand the ramifications. In the \nend, whether we agree that is a good idea or not, most of us will agree \nthat it is a good idea to figure out how to harness information \ntechnology in the delivery of health care in our own States and in the \ncountry, much as the VA has done for veterans who go there for service \nat their facilities.\n  Delaware is endeavoring to become the first State to put in place a \nstatewide Delaware Health Information Network which links our hospitals \nto our doctors' offices to our labs in a free-flowing electronic \nexchange of information. It will allow the exchange of electronic \nhealth records and lead the way, as a little State, to show what we can \ndo for our country to save money and to save lives and improve outcomes \nand, frankly, to improve the quality of life for the providers as well \nand the satisfaction they derive from their work.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  The second thing I wish to mention is this document which was \nreleased earlier this week. It is called ``A Call For Action.'' It was \nreleased on Monday by an interesting coalition of business leaders, \nmanufacturers, utility companies, and environmental leaders. The folks \nwho released it are called the United States Climate Action \nPartnership. I wish to briefly mention the charter members of the group \nwho were here in the Capitol, just down the hall in the LBJ Room, on \nMonday morning. They include DuPont, a 200-year-old company \nheadquartered in Delaware; Alcoa; BP--used to be called British \nPetroleum, now they are ``beyond petroleum''; Caterpillar; Duke Energy; \nthe Environmental Defense folks; Florida Power & Light: GE; the NRDC, \nNational Resources Defense Council; Pew Institute; PG Corporation, a \nbig utility on the west coast; PNM, which is New Mexico power: and the \nWorld Resources Institute. What they have done is said: Climate change \nis real. Our Earth is becoming warmer. We have something to do with it. \nThey call on us to do something about it--not just us in the Senate but \nas a nation to do something about it. They have laid out here a series \nof findings, of principles, and of recommendations.\n  One of the things I am doing is sharing with each of my colleagues a \ncopy of this document. If we can get the utilities, manufacturers, and \na number of our leading environmental groups to agree on a path forward \non the principles and the recommendations, that is an important step \nfor our country.\n  I shared this with the President on Wednesday. He was in Delaware to \nlook at the work going on at the DuPont Company with respect to \nbiofuels, biobutanol, making ethanol out of cellulosic ethanol, out of \ncornstalks, looking at work being done on fuel cells. I shared with him \na copy of this document.\n  The President had in his speech the other night about one sentence \nwhere he talked about global warming and acknowledged that it was real. \nThen he moved on. But I said to the President during a chance I had to \nchat with him that there is a parade that is beginning to form, a \nrealization that something\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\nis happening to our planet, that we have something to do with creating \nthis warming, and that we have an obligation to do something about it. \nI applaud the leaders from the environmental and business communities \nwho have joined forces to say: This is an approach which makes sense. \nThey take what we call a market approach and use in their approach the \nidea that while we are putting in place a cap-and-trade system to \nreduce CO2 emissions, why don't we do so in a way that \nincentivizes clean coal technology with carbon recapture, that \nincentivizes things such as wind power, maybe incentivizes the next \ngeneration of nuclear energy as well.\n  I commend them. I understand from folks who are involved in this \noriginal partnership, they are getting a lot of calls from around the \ncountry, from other business leaders, and some from the environmental \ncommunity who want to know more about it and, frankly, want to join. My \nmessage to the President on Wednesday was, a parade is forming. We can \nwatch the parade. We can be a part of that parade or we can lead that \nparade. We need to lead the parade. President Bush is our President, \nand he needs to be leading that parade as well.\n  I wanted to share that.\n  The third thing I wish to do is comment on the legislation before us \nand to applaud the efforts of several of our colleagues, including \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, as we have brought this minimum \nwage bill to the floor and coupled it with small business tax cuts. The \nPresident signalled early on that he would be willing to sign the \nminimum wage bill, after having not supported it for a number of years. \nIt has been a long time. We have heard plenty of speeches in the last \nweek about this issue. It has been a long time since we raised the \nminimum wage.\n  As Governor of my State, we raised the minimum wage a time or two. I \nalways contended that if we wanted people to get off welfare, to go to \nwork and to be successful, work has to pay more than welfare. If you \ntake a minimum wage job and you enhance that with an income tax credit \nand add to that Medicaid benefits, add to that food stamps and food \nsupplement benefits, people aren't going to get rich--help them with \nassisted housing--but if we do it right, people can actually be better \noff working than they would be receiving the welfare. An increase in \nthe minimum wage is part and parcel of that.\n  I am pleased to support this increase, even if it is coupled with \nincreases or changes and modifications to small business tax credits.\n  We all know--in fact, everybody in the Senate has given speeches, I \nam sure, saying this--that small businesses are the engine of job \ncreation in this country. I have, and I suspect the Presiding Officer \nhas, as have the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from North \nCarolina, we have all given speeches saying how important the small \nbusiness community is. Small business generates new jobs. One of our \nimportant jobs in government--Federal, State, and local--is to create a \nnurturing environment for job creation and preservation. Some of the \nways to do that are a well-trained workforce, reasonable tax burdens, \nreasonable regulations, safer communities, transportation, good \ninfrastructure, and affordable health care. But taxes are important.\n  What I commend Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley in doing is \ncrafting a series of tax credits for small business that incentivizes \nthem to hire people, some of whom are coming off of welfare and \ndisability, and veterans coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq. They \nhave done good work, and I look forward to supporting adoption of the \nlegislation and working out a compromise with the House that includes \nboth the increase in the minimum wage and the tax cuts and, in some \ncases, credits for small businesses, and then get the President to sign \nthat compromise.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                   Senior Airman Elizabeth A. Loncki\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I want to mention today the death of a \nDelawarean--our 15th Delawarean--whose life has been lost in Iraq. She \nwas the first female whose life has been lost in Iraq and whose funeral \nI attended a week or two ago. I want to reflect on the life and service \nof Air Force SrA Elizabeth Loncki.\n  She was the first female Delawarean to be killed in the line of duty \nin Iraq. As a bomb disposal technician, Elizabeth performed one of the \nmost dangerous tasks assigned to Armed Forces personnel. She routinely \nput herself in harm's way with the hope and knowledge that her actions \nwould save the lives of others. I daresay they have saved the lives of \nhundreds of other people. The steel nerve and extreme bravery required \nto locate and disarm explosive devices are not traits too many people \npossess, including us. Only the bravest of our soldiers and military \npersonnel carry out this responsibility, and her ability to perform and \ncarry out this difficult work speaks volumes about her character and \nsense of duty to her colleagues, comrades, our country, and to the \nIraqi people.\n  Elizabeth epitomized the best of our country's brave men and women \nwho fought to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle \nEast. She exhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to her country, \nand above all else, honor. In the way she lived her life--and how we \nremember her--Elizabeth reminds each of us just how good we can be.\n  Elizabeth was only 23 years old but her competitive spirit and kind-\nhearted ways touched the lives of all that knew her. She was blessed \nwith a wonderful family--younger sister, Olivia, loving parents, \nstepparents, grandparents, great-grandparents and many aunts, uncles, \nand cousins--and countless numbers of friends and comrades.\n  She was also loved by SGT Jayson Johnson, who was stationed with \nElizabeth at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. They had recently purchased a \nhouse together and Jayson had made plans to visit Elizabeth's father to \nseek his permission to ask for Elizabeth's hand in marriage. The \nsadness of his loss cannot be overstated.\n  Elizabeth was a 2001 graduate of Padua Academy in Wilmington. She was \na natural athlete with a competitive spirit and she excelled at \nvolleyball, basketball and softball. She briefly attended the \nUniversity of Arizona before enlisting in the Air Force in March of \n2003. On February 24, 2004, she graduated from Eglin AFB-Naval Tech \nExplosive Ordinance Disposal School. She was proud of her training and \ngladly told inquiring strangers that the ``Bomb Squad'' sweatshirt she \noften wore was indeed the real thing.\n  Elizabeth volunteered to go to Iraq before she was officially called \nand was deployed on September 27, 2006. Her grandfather recalled her \nsaying, ``If I saved one life, it was worth it.'' An Air Force official \ntold the Loncki family that each day her team went out, they probably \nsaved scores of lives. She will always be remembered as a hero who put \nthe safety of others before herself.\n  On January 7, 2007, Elizabeth made the ultimate sacrifice near Al \nMahmudiyah, Iraq, when a car bomb her team was working on exploded \nwhile they were trying to disarm it. TSgt Timothy Weiner of Tamarac, \nFL, and SrA Daniel B. Miller, Jr., of Galesburg, IL also gave their \nlives while trying to save others on that fateful day. All three were \nmembers of the 775th Civil Engineer Squadron at Hill Air Force Base.\n  Elizabeth was one of the few women who dared to serve as a bomb \ndisposal technician. Her family recently shared a story from a sergeant \nmajor who had helped train Elizabeth. I think this goes to the heart of \nthe person she was and what she believed in. I'd like to share a bit of \nthat. He said, ``Elizabeth was an ultimate troop. I am an old Special \nForces guy and have been through a lot of action. I have served in \nthree wars. I had the privilege of being in Elizabeth's company. She \nwas involved in extreme combat training and the highest danger. She \nsaved a lot--I repeat--a lot of lives. . . Bar none, she was one of the \nfinest people I have ever trained. I have two boys in the military and \nhave lost troops under my command in the Special Forces and I have \nnever worked with a finer person.''\n  On January 13, 2007, I attended Senior Airman Loncki's funeral at St. \nPeter the Apostle Church in New Castle where Elizabeth had been an \nactive member.\n  Following the service, Elizabeth was laid to rest with full military \nhonors in\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nthe Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery. The outpouring of love and \nsupport from the many people who gathered for her burial serve as a \ntestament to the positive impact that Elizabeth had on all of those who \nwere blessed to know her.\n  For her service, Airman Loncki received numerous recognitions during \nher Air Force career: Air Force Training Ribbon, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Air Force Good Conduct Medal, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAward. The Purple Heart and the Bronze Star with Valor Device were \nawarded posthumously on January 9, 2007.\n  As I listened to Elizabeth's friends and family speak about the type \nof person she was, I couldn't help but think about the heavy toll that \nthis conflict has taken on our country. Elizabeth had originally \nplanned for a career in the Air Force but she had begun to express \ndoubts about our role in Iraq. She told her grandmother that the people \nof Iraq ``don't want us over there'' and had asked her father, ``if \npeople don't want us to help, what do we do?''\n  If I could talk to Elizabeth, I would tell her that she epitomized \nwhat is best in this world. I would tell her that if the day ever comes \nwhen the Iraqi people decide to put aside their hatred and come \ntogether as a nation--and that day cannot come soon enough--it will be \nthe heroic actions of people like her that made this possible.\n  Next week in this Chamber I believe we are going to debate a \nresolution, and the resolution is about what course we should take in \nIraq. I think the President and those who don't share his proposal for \na surge of our troops share the same goal. The goal is this: How do we \nconvince the Iraqi people to take charge of their lives? How do we \nconvince them to assume responsibility for their country? How do we and \nothers help to convince them to find a way to share power, share the \nwealth of their country, and to stop killing each other?\n  The President believes the best way to do it is to send more troops \nto Baghdad and to other parts of the country. Those of us who disagree, \nincluding some of the President's own military leaders with whom I met \nin Iraq last year, think that maybe the best way to convince them to \nmake the tough choices in Iraq is to make it clear that we are not \nthere forever, that this is not an engagement without an end in sight, \nand that we have expectations for them to stand and deliver for their \nown country.\n  I close simply by saying that sometimes we think these debates are \njust debates that we have in our Nation's Capitol, and there is a \ncountry on the other side of the world, with people we don't know, who \nare doing things we, frankly, don't understand. But it is also \nimportant for us to remember people such as Elizabeth Loncki who are \nwilling to risk it all to try to help them, and our obligation is to do \nour dead level best to make sure they and we get to the right place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, these have been some terrible days \nfor our country. Last Saturday, we lost 27 American men and women in \nIraq, making it the third deadliest day for our country and our forces \nsince this war began. A Blackhawk went down northeast of Baghdad; all \n12 of the troops aboard were killed. Men with grenades, mortars, and \nassault rifles attacked a building guarded by American and Iraqi forces \nin Karbala. Five American troops were killed that day. Coalition forces \nmade a push against insurgents. Five more troops were killed and 59 \nIraqis along with them. In Anbar Province, four soldiers and a marine \nwere killed.\n  Despite the President's handpicked Iraqi Study Group's bipartisan \ncall for a new course, he has not listened. Despite the advice of GEN \nJohn Abizaid, a distinguished military leader and former Chief of Staff \nto Colin Powell, who called for a new course, despite the bipartisan \ncalls of my colleagues who have called for a new course, despite the \nAmerican people who last November called for a new course, and despite \nthe rising death toll, the President has decided to escalate this \nconflict. He wants to send 21,500 more troops into the crossfire of a \ncivil war.\n  Even more disturbing is the behavior and the rhetoric of the Vice \nPresident. I don't know how many of my colleagues had a chance to watch \nthe Vice President's interview with Wolf Blitzer this week on CNN's \n``The Situation Room.'' But I encourage my colleagues who have not seen \nit to watch it. It is up on Youtube. You have to see it to believe it. \nIn that interview, Vice President Cheney boasted of ``enormous \nsuccesses in Iraq.'' He also rejected the idea that Iraq is in a \n``terrible situation.'' Imagine him dismissing that.\n  The interview was so incredible that the Washington Post discussed it \non its front page on Thursday. The Vice President blamed everybody but \nhimself for any troubles in Iraq.\n  As far as the Vice President was concerned, it was all the media's \nfault. What did he say of us, the Congress? He said we were helping the \nterrorists. Vice President Cheney's boasting of the Iraq successes was \non the front page of the Washington Post that day. The story is \nincredible. It says on the front page of Thursday's paper: ``Defending \nIraq war, defiant Cheney cites enormous successes.'' He says that the \nmedia is so eager to write off this effort or to declare it a failure. \nIt goes on to say that there are problems in Iraq, but he said it's not \na terrible situation.\n  Not a terrible situation. Describe that to the families who lost \nsomeone in the last few weeks in Iraq.\n  He said--this is the Vice President of the United States--he has a \nresponsibility to help the President and to help communicate with the \nCongress. He doesn't. He sits here often, but he doesn't. He said that \ndespite that, the congressional opposition won't stop us from sending \n20,500 more troops; it will only validate the course we are on.\n  Imagine. The story inside the paper was a very different one. The \nstory told in these two pages in Thursday's Washington Post is 99 \nfaces, 99 more families who are going to mourn, 99 more children who \nwill not see their father or their mother again, 99 parents who lost a \nchild. And he says it is not a terrible situation? It is a disgrace.\n  This doesn't look like the face of enormous success. No, it doesn't. \nOn those two pages alone is a total of 99 men and women who will never \nsee their friends and family on American soil again. Madam President, \n3,063 American troops have died in Iraq; 74 of them had ties to my \nState of New Jersey. And we have seen over 23,000 with injuries, many \nsevere, over 700 have lost limbs and many suffering from traumatic \nbrain injury.\n  Of the almost 600,000 people--584,000 to be precise--who have served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, over 30,000 of them have PTSD, post-traumatic \nstress syndrome; 30,000 countless brain injuries besides that.\n  The administration's troop increase is not simply a surge. What they \ndid is they searched the word files, probably went to the computer and \nto the dictionaries to try to find a word that would evade the truth of \nwhat this is about. Surge is a euphemism for escalation of our \ninvolvement in this war.\n  When we hear the Vice President talking about enormous successes, it \nmakes one wonder if the President and Vice President have been shielded \nfrom reality by their handlers. We see it in the continuation of the \npolicy that says don't take any pictures of the flag-draped coffins \nwhen the remains of our soldiers are returned to the United States of \nAmerica; don't do that. It is against the rules. Can you imagine that? \nThat sign of honor to the deceased shielded from the view of the public \nbecause underneath that flag lies the remains of some young person.\n  That is the way they see things, and now we are told to expect \nanother $100 billion request from the administration to fund this war. \nWhen does it end?\n  I am a proud cosponsor of legislation that is authored by my \ncolleague Senator Biden. Senator Hagel served valiantly in Vietnam. He \nknows what war is like. Senator Levin and Senator Snowe--all denounce \nthis dangerous increase. This resolution, which easily passed the \nForeign Relations Committee, is clear in stating that the Bush surge is \nnot in the national interests. It is certainly not in the interests of \nthe families who have sons or daughters serving there. It puts the \nSenate on record as being against a growing military conflict that will \nhurt our\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nlong-term goals abroad and our security at home.\n  Similar to the young men and women serving today, I was proud to wear \nthe uniform of my country in World War II in Europe. Those who are \nserving are obeying the orders of their Commander in Chief, and they do \nit fully and bravely.\n  In that war, World War II, the mission was clear: Defeat the enemies \nwho attacked us. While the battles and the casualties were in far-off \nplaces, the brunt of the war's burden was borne by the families at \nhome.\n  We started this fight because we were told things that proved not to \nbe true. We believed in our leaders, and we thought they were telling \nus the truth. What else would we think? The President, the Vice \nPresident, then the chief of the military, Colin Powell, and others--we \nhad faith in their belief. We had faith in the mission. Many of us \ndoubted. I was out of the Senate for a 2-year period, and that is when \nthat decision was made, but I would have believed it, coming from those \nillustrious positions with people who were known for substance because \nof the fact that they had achieved those positions. We had faith, but \nthe mission in Iraq was surrounded in a fog.\n  It is time to redefine this mission in Iraq, a mission that includes \nbringing our troops home. The Iraqis say they want us to leave. Members \nof Congress and military leaders want us to leave, and the American \npeople, in a broad consensus, want us to leave. Bring home those \ntroops, they say.\n\n  Outside my office, I continue to pay my respects to these soldiers. I \nhave a display called The Faces of the Fallen, all who have perished in \nthis war up to a date that we can get the latest pictures, such as \nthose we see displayed in the Washington Post. The display gives us a \nface to the names of the soldiers who have lost their lives in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Visitors come by. Some of them are families and friends. \nVisitors search the photos daily for people they know, love and miss \nand they write notes in a book we have provided. Everyone who signs \nthat book ``God bless these people,'' honors them for their service, \neven though there is a question about whether they ought to be serving \nthere now.\n  Until President Bush listens, until Vice President Cheney realizes \nthis is more than a bunch of victories, that successes are there, until \nthat language is wiped out of their daily statements, we are going to \nhave to keep adding faces to that display of fallen heroes memorial. \nAnd I am going to have to say to people who come into my office in New \nJersey, particularly, who have sons and daughters serving there--one \nwoman tells me about her son who was wounded, got the Purple Heart, and \nthey are sending him back to combat or the woman who comes in crying so \nbitterly that you can barely hear her talk. She screamed at me at first \nwhen I called her when the notice of her son's death was given. She \nasked the question: My son was a second lieutenant. He loved being in \nthe military. He was a trained artillery officer. What in the world \nwere they asking him to do when they asked him to defuse roadside \nbombs? He lost his life defusing a bomb.\n  No, Madam President, if the message can't get through to the White \nHouse and the leadership, what faith can we have in the decisions made \nin this country today? It is discouraging. The world doesn't believe \nus. The people in our country don't believe us, in huge numbers. Yes, \nthere are those who serve bravely and constantly. They do what they are \ntold. That is what one does in the military. But while we think of \nsending people there who have already had, some of them, two tours of \nduty and they are being sent for a third tour of duty, it is impossible \nto imagine that their consciences don't keep them awake at night, but \napparently they don't.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today is the fifth day of the debate on \nthe minimum wage. Some of the days have been days that people have not \ntalked a lot or offered a lot of amendments, but that is not the fault \nof the majority. It is not the fault of the minority. For whatever \nreason, they didn't offer them.\n  The question always arises as to when enough is enough. Have there \nbeen opportunities in this legislation before the Senate dealing with \nminimum wage, raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years? \nI know the Senate is not accustomed to the open process we have had on \nthis legislation and on the legislation dealing with ethics in \nlobbying, but this is something we are going to get used to. My Members \nwould rather not have had the votes we had this past week. They were \ntough votes. None of them related to minimum wage. That is the Senate, \nan open process. But someone has to make a decision at some time that \nenough is enough, and I think I have made that decision. I am going to \nfile a motion to stop debate on this issue and move forward on this \nmuch needed legislation.\n  Ten years was a long time ago. During that period of time, the cost \nof food has gone up about 25 percent, the cost of health care about 45 \npercent, housing about 30 percent, gasoline about 135 percent, \ncongressional pay during that same period of time has increased by \n$30,000. Ten years ago, Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the House, not \nNancy Pelosi; Bill Clinton was starting his second term as President of \nthe United States; the old movie ``Titanic'' was being released; a \nstamp to mail a letter was 32 cents.\n  Today, different than 10 years ago, the pay of the average chief \nexecutive is 821 times that of a minimum wage worker. The chief \nexecutive officer for one of these companies could go to work on Monday \nand by noon have made as much money as minimum wage workers, working \ntheir hearts out for a year, would get.\n  Yesterday and the day before, we voted on all kinds of amendments, \namendments that totaled--I roughed them out--calling for tax cuts of \nabout $350 billion. Madam President, how much more is it going to take \nin the way of tax cuts to get the minority to vote for a minimum wage \nbill? None of the tax cuts are paid for--$350 billion. That is a lot of \nmoney. If you took one-dollar bills and laid them end to end from my \nhome in Searchlight, NV, to Washington, DC, it would take 14,000 lines \nof dollar bills to amount to $350 billion--14,000.\n  We have voted on health savings accounts, tax breaks for teachers, \nand Social Security tax breaks. My favorite was a $2.10 suggestion in \nlegislation offered by one of the Republican Senators. You don't use \nthe $2.10 to increase the wages of a minimum wage worker, but they \ncould do other things with it--buy health care, for example. But it is \nso interesting; every one of these amendments that were offered were \noffered by someone who has no desire of voting for a minimum wage. It \nis an effort to divert attention from the real issue before this body, \nwhich is raising the minimum wage.\n  Every one of these amendments we voted on is important. I am not, in \nany way, indicating that people do not have the right to offer \namendments. They can offer them on any subject they wish. That is what \nthis Senate is all about. But I think it is about time a decision is \nmade whether we are going to give the poorest of the poor who are \nworking, not on welfare, the opportunity to keep working and not have \nto go to welfare.\n  Sixty percent of the people who draw minimum wage are women, and for \nover half of those women, that is the only money they get for \nthemselves and their families. People think that minimum wage is for a \nbunch of kids flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, but that is not the \nway it is. About 3 weeks ago, Business Week had a very good piece on \nthe minimum wage. What this piece said is that raising the minimum wage \nraises the boat for everybody.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will allow this \nlegislation to go forward, to stop talking about it and vote on it. It \nis important that we do that. Ten years is too long.\n  We have had a lot of amendments. Is this enough? When is enough? \nCould we have worked longer hours? Perhaps so. All I know is Wednesday \nwe worked very hard to try to get some of the people in the minority to \nagree to votes--and we couldn't get that done--on their amendments, not \nour amendments their amendments.\n  We have a lot of important things to do and I understand that. I sure \nhope we can move beyond minimum wage to other issues.\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I have other business to conduct on \nanother matter. It is my understanding the distinguished Republican \nleader wishes to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 210\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I call for the regular order with respect to the Kyl \namendment No. 210.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the amendment be divided as indicated by the \ncopy at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be divided.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Republican majority in the \nprevious Congress was prepared to raise the minimum wage. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives passed an increase in the minimum wage and the \nSenate tried to pass an increase in the minimum wage. The difficulty \nwas that Democrats ended up blocking passage because they did not like \nthe fact that the minimum wage was attached to other provisions last \nyear. The minimum wage was attached to some very significant \nprovisions--tax extenders, modification of the death tax--and our good \nfriends on the other side didn't like the way it was packaged and \ntherefore prevented its passage.\n  The last time the minimum wage passed, back in 1996, and President \nClinton signed it, he praised the minimum wage, particularly because it \nwas packaged with tax relief and regulatory relief for small \nbusinesses. So it has been the practice of the Congress, under both \nRepublicans and Democrats, for a minimum wage to be passed in \nconjunction with other matters. In fact, my good friend, the majority \nleader, has advocated that and supported the package that came out of \nthe Finance Committee, even though every Member on the other side of \nthe aisle voted, in effect--by voting to invoke cloture--voted in \neffect for a clean minimum wage yesterday.\n  With regard to how much time we have taken on this bill, we didn't \nhave any votes last Monday, and we are not having any votes today on \nminimum wage, even though we did vote to confirm General Petraeus, \nwhich we certainly should have done. We have not had that much time on \nthe bill.\n  I think my good friends on the other side of the aisle are having a \nhard time adjusting to being in the majority in the Senate. The price \nyou pay for being in the majority in the Senate is, in order to \ncomplete bills, the minority gets votes. I remember my good friend and \ncolleague, the Democratic whip, saying the Senate is not the House. Our \nnew occupant of the chair, in his first couple of weeks in the Senate, \nis learning already that the Senate is not the House.\n  In the Senate, virtually every bill has numerous amendments. The \nmajorities are always frustrated because minorities get their votes \nbefore moving to final passage. I have said to my friend the majority \nleader on several occasions over the last few hours that I was hoping \nthat we could have some more amendments on this minimum wage bill \nbefore moving to its inevitable conclusion. It will end up similar to \nthe ethics bill last year, passing with an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority. But there are still some other important amendments that our \nside would like to offer, and we will be discussing those amendments \nand how our Members feel about that in the next few days.\n  At some point in the not too distant future, an increase in the \nminimum wage, in conjunction with tax relief for small business, will \npass the Senate on a very large bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Cardin). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all have memories. My memory is that \nduring the time that Senator Lott was the majority leader we had very \nfew opportunities to amend bills because he, in the vernacular in the \nSenate, filled the tree and there weren't opportunities to do that. \nSenator Frist did not do that nearly as much as Senator Lott when he \nwas the leader, but certainly it was done a lot of times. We have \nchosen not to do that. We have chosen the amendment process. That is \nwhy I said earlier today: When is enough enough?\n  I have sent the cloture motions to the desk, and we will make that \ndecision at noon on Tuesday.\n  While the distinguished Republican leader is on the floor, I will say \na few more words on another subject.\n  The Republican leader and I have talked on several occasions about \nthis Iraq situation. Anyone who reads the newspaper, listens to the \nradio or watches TV--we all know there are a number of resolutions \naround the Senate dealing with the escalation of the war in Iraq. The \nleader and I have talked about them.\n  We have pending in the Senate now, S. Con. Res. 2, which is a \nbipartisan resolution. Upon disposition of the minimum wage bill--and I \nhave spoken to the leader, Senator McConnell--he is unable to clear \nconsent to move S. Con. Res. 2 now. Members may not be available to \nclear it at the moment, and I understand that, so I am not going to put \nany unanimous consent request before the Senate because the \ndistinguished Republican Senate leader has told me he is not able to do \nthat. But in an effort to save time, I intend to move to proceed to the \nconcurrent resolution today and file cloture on that motion. If on \nMonday the Republican leader is still not able to grant consent to \nproceed to it, we will be in a position, then, to look forward to the \nTuesday vote. If he is able to give me consent to move forward to that, \nthen we can vitiate the cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, I will be filing that motion on cloture today to \nproceed to a bipartisan resolution reported out by the Foreign \nRelations Committee earlier this week. We are moving forward to demand \na new direction in Iraq, as we have spoken about a number times. \nSenator Lautenberg finished a speech on that today. We hope Republican \nleadership will join with us to fully debate this issue, permit votes \non amendments, and ensure an up-or-down vote on the President's plan. \nOur troops and the American people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1232-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1232-S1233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      BIPARTISAN CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON IRAQ--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

FRITZ\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army 1LT \nJacob N. Fritz of Verdon, NE.\n  Lieutenant Fritz graduated from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000. \nHis peers and teachers recognized him as a natural leader. He was \nactive in every extracurricular activity his school offered: speech, \ndrama, basketball, football, track, and band. He organized drug-free \nparties and dances.\n  After high school, Lieutenant Fritz followed his dream of serving in \nthe Armed Forces by enrolling in the Military Academy at West Point, \ngraduating in 2005. His younger brother, Daniel, followed in his \nfootsteps and is currently a third-year cadet at West Point.\n  Lieutenant Fritz had been serving in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, assigned to A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 377th Parachute Field \nArtillery Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort Richardson, \nAK. On Saturday, January 20, 2007, Lieutenant Fritz passed away when \nhis dismounted patrol received indirect fire followed by small arms \nfire in Karbala, Iraq. He was 25 years old.\n  1LT Jacob Fritz is survived by his parents, Lyle and Noala Fritz of \nVerdon, NE, and his two younger brothers, Daniel and Ethan. I offer my \nsincere condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Fritz. He \nmade the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation. I join \nall Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable young man and \nknow that Lieutenant Fritz's passion for serving, his leadership, and \nhis selflessness will remain a source of inspiration for us all.\n\n\n                     Sergeant Major Marilyn Gabbard\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SMA Marilyn \nGabbard of the Iowa Army National Guard. The first woman ever promoted \nto the rank of Command Sargent Major in the Iowa Army National Guard, \nSergeant Major Gabbard was deployed to Iraq on December 16, 2006, and \ndied in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crash on January 20, 2007, at 2:45 \npm local Iraq time. Her colleagues said of her that she was a role \nmodel for other women in the Iowa National Guard, and her rise through \nthe enlisted ranks was inspirational. She is remembered as a respected \nsoldier and caring leader who always put her soldiers first. Her \nmilitary decorations include three awards of the Meritorious Service \nMedal. My prayers go out to Marilyn's husband Edward and her seven \nchildren and stepchildren, her mother Mary Van Cannon, as well as her \ngrandchildren and all her family and friends. SMA Marilyn Gabbard will \nbe greatly missed. She leaves behind her a legacy of military \nachievement, immense compassion, and patriotic service. I hope that \nthose who have been touched by her loss will find some comfort in the \nknowledge that her memory will live on like those countless other \nheroes throughout American history who have given their lives for our \ncountry.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Tommy Rieman\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Army SGT \nTommy Rieman, a native of Independence, KY, who received the military \nSilver Star for exceptional courage. He exhibited this courage when \ninsurgents attacked his reconnaissance squad near the Abu Ghraib prison \nin Iraq on December 3, 2003. His selfless act of bravery and \nunwillingness to fail exemplify the true definition of a soldier.\n  Sergeant Rieman grew up in Independence, a small town in northern \nKentucky. While at Simon Kenton High School, he was captain of the \nfootball team and was a member of the wrestling team, before he \ngraduated in 1999. Sergeant Rieman was a teenager, pumping gas at a \nlocal gas station when he decided to enlist in the Army. This \nmonumental decision he made to begin his exceptional military career \nwould go on to shape his destiny.\n  While serving in Iraq, Sergeant Rieman showcased immense calm under \npressure, when his squad came under attack by insurgents. With the \nconvoy under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades and explosive \ndevices, he used his own body as a shield to protect his squad gunman \nand returned fire to the enemy. The humvees that the squad was \ntraveling in did not have any doors, so as a result Sergeant Rieman \nsuffered two bullet wounds and multiple shrapnel injuries. Despite \nthese injuries, he was still able to direct the convoy off the road and \naway from the live fire combat, only to be attacked by another smaller \ngroup of insurgents. Sergeant Rieman commanded and led his squad to \nreturn fire, and the enemy's weapons were silenced. At this point, the \nsituation was calm and he was able to call a medical helicopter to \ntreat the injuries of these brave soldiers.\n  After returning from Iraq, in August 2004 Sergeant Rieman was awarded \na Silver Star for his brave actions that day in Fort Bragg, NC. He is \nnow employed as an administrative assistant for the Army personnel \noffice in the Pentagon. In May 2006, he was selected to be a \nparticipant in the ``America's Army: Real Heroes'' video game program, \nwhich recounts the lives of military soldiers who have shown heroism \nand bravery in the war on terror. Sergeant Rieman will have his \nmilitary history and motivational story told through this game, with \nthe hope of inspiring others to greatness.\n  On January 23, 2007, Sergeant Rieman was a guest of the First Lady \nand was formally recognized by President Bush, who discussed his \nbravery in the annual State of the Union Address to Congress. He stated \nthat Sergeant Rieman, like so many other Americans who have volunteered \nto defend us, had earned the respect of the Nation. I cannot agree with \nthis statement more. It brings me great pride to see a soldier of the \ncaliber of Sergeant Rieman represent Kentucky in such a courageous and \nselfless way. He is an inspirational example to me and to the entire \nCommonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1233-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1233-S1234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

As president, Dr. Bowen has devoted his professional \nand leadership skills to serving Utah's 1,530 member dental \norganization.\n  The UDA is committed to the public's oral health, ethics, science, \nand professional development. I am proud of our dental health \nprofessionals who skillfully provide quality health care to thousands \nof Utahns. I am also proud of Dr. Ron Bowen, who as the president of \nthe UDA has provided outstanding leadership among his colleagues as he \nrepresented the association on a national, state, and local level. He \nhas extensively traveled the\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nState meeting with members to address their concerns and listen to \ntheir suggestions. In addition, he has a keen sense of the legislative \nprocess and has been able to use this knowledge to accomplish great \nthings for the association.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Bowen has garnered deep respect among his \ncolleagues. He has an ability to listen to others, determine a course \nof action, and implement his ideas in an effective way.\n  Dr. Bowen is a practicing dentist and has had an established practice \nin the Salt Lake Valley for the past 22 years. He graduated with honors \nfrom the University of the Pacific, UOP, Dental School in San \nFrancisco, CA. While at UOP, Ron served as student body and junior \nclass presidents--demonstrating strong leadership skills at a young \nage.\n  During his longtime service to the dental community, Dr. Bowen has \nserved on the UDA board of directors, where he has chaired the \nGovernment and Political Action Committees. Dr. Bowen has also served \nas the president of the Salt Lake District Dental Society and the Great \nBasin Academy. He was inducted into the International College of \nDentists in 2003 and is a member of the Pierre Fuchard Society.\n  In addition, he is married to Melanie Hamilton Bowen and is the \ncaring father of two daughters, Elysa and Lindsey.\n  Mr. President, the UDA has been greatly served this past year with \nDr. Ron Bowen at the helm. His enthusiasm for the practice of dentistry \nand good dental health has been felt by many, and his colleagues have \nappreciated his efforts. I wish him many more happy, successful years \nof dentistry in Utah and join with many satisfied patients in thanking \nhim for his tremendous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1234-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1234-S1235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JO ANNE BARNHART\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to commend someone who represents \nthe very best of citizens in public service. I am speaking of Jo Anne \nBarnhart, the Commissioner of Social Security. Unfortunately, her term \nended last Friday. I say ``unfortunately'' because she has done a \nsuperb job.\n  Jo Anne Barnhart did not need to take this job. She was doing very \nwell running her own consulting firm. But she took the job for one \nreason: She wanted to improve the way that the Social Security \nAdministration performs its duties. And SSA is a significantly better \nagency when Jo Anne left than when she first came on board.\n  That is not all. Many long-term career employees at SSA have said \nthat she is the best Social Security Commissioner for whom they have \nworked. And a number of veteran Social Security observers and advocates \nhave said the same thing. She has made a remarkable contribution to \nthat agency.\n  What has Jo Anne accomplished? Everyone knows that the Social \nSecurity Program provides benefits to workers who have retired. And the \nSocial Security Program also provides benefits to the families of \nworkers who have died. What is less well known is that Social Security \nprovides benefits to workers who become disabled and to the families of \nthose workers. This is one of Social Security's major functions.\n  Determining the benefits that retirees and survivors get is a \nrelatively straightforward process, even where the eligibility rules \nare very detailed. But the same is not true for benefits for disabled \nworkers.\n  There, SSA has to determine whether the applicant is permanently and \ntotally disabled. This determination requires a lot of difficult work. \nFor many applicants, the answer is not readily apparent. And the \napplicant can use several layers of appeals, if denied benefits. These \nadditional layers add to the time that an applicant may have to wait \nbefore receiving benefits.\n  When Jo Anne took over the agency, it could take as much as 4 years \nfor an applicant to be approved for benefits, if the applicant \nsucceeded at the last layer of appeal. A disabled worker waiting for a \ndecision is not earning any money. This can put enormous pressures on \nthe worker and the worker's family.\n  My case workers in Montana have heard from some of the applicants who \nhave been waiting incredibly long times for a decision. And their \nstories are harrowing. And the same was true for one Montana applicant \nwho had to wait 4 years to get his disability benefits and who was kind \nenough to testify before the Finance Committee last year.\n  Jo Anne was fully aware of this problem when she took over the \nagency. And she was determined to do something about it.\n  The first step was to determine why it took so long for applicants to \nbe approved. At her confirmation hearing, Jo Anne indicated that she \nwould study this issue immediately. And she and I agreed that she would \nreport back to me in 6 months.\n  Jo Anne completed that study and briefed me 6 months later, just as \nshe had promised. Amazingly, this was the first comprehensive study SSA \nhad ever done to determine why it took so long for disability \napplicants to be approved for benefits.\n  Jo Anne and her staff put every step involved in the disability \napplication process on one chart. When she completed it, that chart was \n25 feet long. Jo Anne deserves great credit for initiating and \nexecuting this pioneering study.\n  The study found that there were two causes of the long waiting times \nfor approval of disability benefits, and Jo Anne set out to tackle each \nof them. About half of the delays occurred because of huge backlogs of \ncases. The principal cause of these backlogs is inadequate staffing, \nand the principal cause of inadequate staffing is lack of budgetary \nresources. The other half of the waiting times was due to huge \ninefficiencies in the processing of disability claims.\n  Jo Anne responded to these challenges. First, she set out to reduce \nas much of the inefficiency in the disability adjudication process as \npossible.\n  She initiated the conversion of the application process from a paper-\ndriven process to a completely electronic process. And she aggressively \naccelerated this conversion, completing the transformation in record \ntime.\n  As a result, SSA now has the largest repository of medical evidence \nin the world. And the new system works. Previously, all evidence and \nrecords used during the adjudication process had to be mailed from one \nSSA office to another and from doctors' offices to SSA offices. This \nwas inefficient, time-consuming, and expensive. Now all of this is \naccomplished electronically. Jo Anne deserves great credit for these \nchanges.\n  And Jo Anne initiated a Disability Service initiative. This was a \nmajor overhaul of the multiple steps in the disability adjudication \nprocess. This initiative brought many improvements.\n  First, quick decisions are made in cases where the disability is \nobvious. Second, redundant appeal processes were eliminated. Third, \nhuge amounts of time were saved for some appeals that would normally go \nto a hearing before an administrative law judge. That is a process that \ncan take well over a year to occur. A new type of legal official was \ncreated in the system. This lawyer is given authority to award benefits \nbefore the case ever proceeds to a hearing. This dramatically reduces \nthe time for the applicant to get benefits. Many other changes were \nmade as well.\n  All of these changes are being piloted. It is hoped that these new \nprocesses will greatly increase the efficiency by which disability \nclaims are adjudicated. If they do, Jo Anne will have accomplished \nsomething truly great.\n  Jo Anne also initiated action to deal with scarce budgetary \nresources, the second cause of long delays. She provided detailed and \ncogent briefings to the Directors of the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  As a result, the President's budgets have requested a significant \nincrease for SSA's administrative costs each year. This occurred at a \ntime when the President's budgets contained little or no increases or \neven decreases in funding for most appropriated programs.\n  Unfortunately, through no lack of effort on Jo Anne's part, the \namount of money ultimately appropriated for SSA's administrative costs \nhas been substantially below the amount requested by the President each \nyear. This is a problem that needs to be rectified in the future.\n  One of Jo Anne's finest moments came after the terrible hurricanes,\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\nKatrina, Rita, and Wilma, decimated whole areas of the gulf coast and \nFlorida. GAO reported: ``The Social Security Administration had \nenhanced planning and pre-established procedures in place to provide \nimmediate emergency payments to the significant number of beneficiaries \nwho evacuated and did not receive their monthly checks. With these \nprocedures in place, the Social Security Administration had the \ncapability to deploy staff and equipment from its 1,300 offices across \nthe Nation to address the increased workload.''\n  Under Jo Anne's guidance, SSA also successfully implemented some \nbrand new permanent responsibilities without a hitch. For example, SSA \nwas asked to take applications for the low-income subsidy portion of \nthe Medicare prescription drug program. This subsidy allows low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries to participate in the prescription drug program \nat no or reduced cost. SSA was also asked to do massive amounts of \noutreach to find the people who qualified for the subsidies, and it did \nso.\n  Jo Anne also guided the implementation of some brand new systems \nprojects. For example, she oversaw the digital recording of hearings. \nSSA used to record all hearings before its administrative law judges \nwith regular cassette tapes. These tapes were difficult to ship and \nwere often lost during transit. Jo Anne and her team spearheaded the \neffort to have hearings recorded digitally.\n  It is clear that Commissioner Barnhart accomplished an extraordinary \nnumber of achievements for SSA. She has reason to be proud, and the \ncountry owes her a huge debt of gratitude.\n  I wish her the very best in whatever endeavors she takes on after she \nleaves SSA. But we will sorely miss her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1235-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1235-S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CRACKING DOWN ON SWEATSHOP ABUSES\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this week I am introducing a \nbipartisan piece of legislation that every Member of the Senate should \nsupport. The legislation aims to crack down on sweatshop abuses taking \nplace in overseas factories that produce merchandise for sale in the \nAmerican marketplace.\n  The United States currently prohibits the importation of products \nmade with prison labor but does not similarly prohibit the importation \nof products made in sweatshops under slave-like conditions. What is \nmore, if a U.S. retailer finds that one of its competitors is importing \nproducts made in a foreign sweatshop, it has no recourse in U.S. courts \nand is placed at a competitive disadvantage.\n  I am certain that if Members of the Senate were asked to raise their \nhand if they support abusive sweatshop conditions at foreign factories \nproducing for the United States, not one hand would go up. Yet, as the \nmedia and watchdog groups have documented all too well, these \nconditions are prevalent in a number of our major trading partners.\n  We have to put a stop to this. Sweatshop factories undermine the \nforeign workers who work in them, and they undermine U.S. workers who \nare asked to compete with them.\n  The bill I am introducing is called the Decent Working Conditions and \nFair Competition Act, and it is really very simple.\n  First, the bill says that it is illegal to bring the product of \nsweatshop factories to this country. In this bill, a ``sweatshop \nfactory'' is one where workers are abused in violation of that \ncountry's labor laws.\n  Second, the bill allows U.S. retailers the right to sue their \ncompetitors for damages in U.S. court if their competitors are sourcing \ntheir merchandise from sweatshop factories.\n  Let me give you an example of why such legislation is essential, \ninvolving the country of Jordan.\n  Our trade negotiators signed the Jordan Free Trade Agreement in \nOctober of 2000. The agreement was negotiated under the Clinton \nadministration, and it was supposed to be a model trade agreement. I \ngive the Clinton administration credit for at least giving some thought \nto putting labor provisions in the trade deal with Jordan.\n  But those labor provisions were not enforced, and the result has been \nthe proliferation of sweatshops in Jordan. In May of last year, the New \nYork Times described this trend.\n  It turned out that when the agreement was signed in 1999, Jordan \nbegan to fly in so-called guest workers from countries like Bangladesh \nand China to make products in Jordan for sale at stores like Wal-Mart \nand Target. The conditions for these so-called guest workers in Jordan \nwere slave-like.\n  This is how the New York Times described it: ``Propelled by a free \ntrade agreement with the United States, apparel manufacturing is \nbooming in Jordan, its exports to America soaring twenty fold in the \nlast five years. But some foreign workers in Jordanian factories that \nproduce garments for Target, Wal-Mart and other retailers are \ncomplaining of dismal conditions--of 20-hour days, of not being paid \nfor months and of being hit by supervisors and jailed when they \ncomplain.''\n  These were some of the other conditions documented at these \nfactories. Workers were promised $120 a month but in some cases were \nhardly paid at all. One worker was paid only $50 for 5 months of work. \nAnd 40-hour shifts were common. Incredibly, the 40-hour shift \napparently had replaced the 40-hour workweek.\n  To its credit, Wal-Mart admitted to the New York Times that it had \nfound ``serious problems with the conditions at several major Jordanian \nfactories.'' But it should not have taken a New York Times \ninvestigation to uncover these abuses.\n  Here is another instance of sweatshop conditions. In November 2006, \nBusinessWeek had a cover story on sweatshop abuses entitled ``Secrets, \nLies, and Sweatshops.'' The article begins with the description of a \nChinese company called the Ningbo Beifa Group. This company has made a \nlot of money as a top supplier of pens, mechanical pencils, and \nhighlighters to Wal-Mart Stores and other major retailers.\n  In 2005, Wal-Mart inspected this company's factories. It found that \nthe company was paying its 3,000 workers less than China's minimum wage \nand violating overtime rules. So Wal-Mart asked the company to fix \nthese serious problems.\n  The Chinese company failed to do so. Wal-Mart then returned to the \ncompany, found the same problems, and told the company to shape up. \nAgain, the Chinese company failed to do so and happily continued making \npens and highlighters for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart returned a third time and \ngave the Chinese company its third warning. Once again, the Chinese \ncompany failed to treat its workers according to Chinese law.\n  So finally, even Wal-Mart had had enough, and they issued a fourth \nwarning--comply with the law or we will stop doing business with you. \nWhat did the Chinese company do? It turned to another Chinese company \ncalled the Shanghai Corporate Responsibility Management & Consulting \nCo. For a $5,000 fee, the company promised to send a consultant to take \ncare of the Wal-Mart problem.\n  The consultant provided advice on how to create fake but authentic-\nlooking payroll records. The consultant also told the company that, on \nthe day of the fourth Wal-Mart audit, they should give the day off to \nany workers with grievances, so that they would not tell any \ninconvenient stories. After following the consultant's advice, the \nChinese factory passed the Wal-Mart audit--even though the Chinese \ncompany later admitted that it didn't change any of its practices.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that Wal-Mart deliberately turned a blind \neye in this case. And there are certainly documented cases of other \ncompanies selling sweatshop products in the United States.\n  But I do think that companies that decide to import products for sale \nin this country should not be allowed to gain an unfair competitive \nadvantage by deliberately sourcing from sweatshop factories. And the \nbill that I am introducing would address such abuses by banning the \nimportation or sale of products made in factories under sweatshop \nconditions.\n  For purposes of the bill, ``sweatshop conditions'' are gross \nviolations of the labor, health, and safety laws of the country where \nthe labor is performed. Enforcement would be divided between the \nCustoms Service and the Federal Trade Commission. If the Federal\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nTrade Commission determined that a factory was operating under \nsweatshop conditions, it would issue an order prohibiting the sale of \nproducts from that factory. Violations of those orders would then carry \na civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each individual violation.\n  The import ban deals only with goods that can be proven to have been \nmade with sweatshop labor and is not a ban of products based on the \ncountry of origin. In order to comply with nondiscrimination provisions \nof the WTO, the sales ban would apply to both domestic and imported \ngoods. The President could waive the application of this section to \nparticular goods, but the Congress would also be able to pass a joint \nresolution rejecting a Presidential waiver.\n  The legislation also creates a private right of action for U.S. \nretailers and their investors to bring a civil action against \ncompetitors who import or sell sweatshop goods. For each offense, \nplaintiffs can sue for damages of the higher of $10,000 or the actual \nvalue of the goods. They can also sue for injunctive relief, to prevent \nthe further entry of these goods into the U.S. marketplace.\n  This legislation is similar to S. 3485, a bill that I introduced late \nin the last Congress. I am happy that, in introducing the legislation \nin the 110th Congress, I am being joined by Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, who has agreed to lead the effort to advance it from the \nother side of the aisle. The legislation is also cosponsored by Senator \nSherrod Brown, who last year introduced a companion piece of \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. And I would also like to \nthank the other original cosponsors of the bill, Senators Byrd, \nFeingold, and Sanders.\n  I believe that one of the messages the American people sent to \nCongress in the November elections is that they demand fair trade. The \nlegislation I am introducing is a way for Congress to show that the \nmessage has been heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1236-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING SHARON RICHIE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor Sharon Richie of \nWatertown, SD. This month Sharon retired from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture after 17 years of dedicated Federal service.\n  Sharon has worked in the multifamily housing program in Watertown for \nthe past 15 years and is well-known and appreciated by the managers of \nthe housing projects. She has been a dedicated employee and is well-\nrespected for her knowledge of the program and her willingness to go \nthe extra mile to assist her clients. Sharon has played an integral \nrole in providing housing for low-income tenants in South Dakota \nthroughout her career.\n  Sharon has also been an active member of the Watertown community. \nPrior to working for the Department of Agriculture, Sharon was a \nhairdresser for 25 years, as well as being a teacher's aid and \nsubstitute teacher for the Deuel School System. She also managed a \nsupper club in Clear Lake and Altamont.\n  In addition, Sharon has been a valuable asset to South Dakota's \nagricultural community. Over the past years, she has worked \nfacilitating several rodeos throughout the region. She has organized \nand judged several rodeo queen contests for groups including the PRCA, \nlocal high school and 4-H rodeos. Sharon also enjoys helping out her \nhusband Cork with their livestock handling equipment business.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the recent \naccomplishments of a successful business that is headquartered and was \nfounded in my home State of Georgia, Flowers Foods. Flowers Foods is a \nleader in the baking industry with fresh products distributed \nthroughout the Southeast, Southwest, and Mid-Atlantic States. Flowers \nFoods frozen products can be found nationwide.\n  Forbes magazine recently named Flowers Foods to its prestigious list \nof the 400 Best Big Companies in America. In addition Flowers Foods was \nalso named the best-managed food company among the list of 400 Best Big \nCompanies. It should also be noted that this is the third time that \nFlowers Foods has been named to Forbes' prestigious list.\n  In creating the most recent list, Forbes reviewed the financial \nmetrics, Wall Street forecast, corporate governance ratings and other \npublic information of over 1,000 of the largest publicly traded \ncompanies in America. Once Forbes narrows this list down to 400 then \nthey select a best-managed company from each of the 26 industry areas \nthat are represented in the Best Big Companies list. The selection of \nthe best-managed company for each represented industry is based on \nfinancial performance, leadership, innovation and execution.\n  Flowers Foods has continued to be on the cutting edge of bakery \nproducts and technology since William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers \nopened Flowers Baking Company in Fitzgerald, Georgia in 1933. When the \ncompany first opened in 1933 they had the capacity to produce 30,000 \nloaves of bread each day. In 1999, Flowers Foods became the first \nwholesale baker to offer a sugar-free bread and they later became the \nfirst commercial baker to introduce a low-carb bread selection.\n  Through the years Flowers Foods has produced and marketed a variety \nof fresh and frozen bakery foods under name brands such as Nature's \nOwn, Cobblestone Mill, Sunbeam Bread, ButterKrust, Whitewheat, Bunny \nBread, BlueBird, Mrs. Freshley's, European Bakers, Mi Casa and \nTesoritos. It is no wonder that they are a market leader with this \nvaried mix of brands and products that ensures that there is something \ntasty for everyone.\n  Not only has Flowers Foods product line grown since its founding in \n1933 but their expansive operation has also grown. Their operations now \ninclude thirty-six bakeries that stretch from the Southwest to the Mid-\nAtlantic regions. These efficient and technologically advanced bakeries \nallow Flowers Foods to supply retailers throughout a large portion of \nthe United States with a constant supply of fresh products.\n  I am extremely proud of the recognition that Flowers Foods has \nreceived from Forbes magazine. I thank my colleagues for giving me the \nopportunity to recognize Flowers Foods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1236-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LESTER KARAS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

He plays an important role in keeping \nthese students safe as they travel back and forth from school. In \naddition, Mr. Karas teaches the children good safety habits that they \nwill use throughout their lives.\n  South Dakota's communities are held together by volunteers like Mr. \nKaras who dedicate their time and energy to helping those around them. \nIt gives me great pleasure to commemorate Lester Karas on this special \noccasion and to wish him continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1236-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following measure was discharged from the Committee on the \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs by unanimous consent, and referred \nas indicated:\n\n       S. 172.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \ntoday that would increase the mileage reimbursement rate for \nvolunteers.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organization or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, they are required to file an information \nreturn indicating the amount, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, for \n2007, the mileage reimbursement level permitted for businesses is 48.5 \ncents per mile, nearly three and a half times the volunteer rate.\n  While we are asking volunteers and volunteer organizations to bear a \ngreater burden of delivering essential services, the 14 cents per mile \nlimit is imposing a very real hardship for charitable organizations and \nother nonprofit groups.\n  I have heard from a number of people in Wisconsin on the need to \nincrease this reimbursement limit. One of the first organizations that \nbrought this issue to my attention was the Portage County Department on \nAging. Volunteer drivers are critical to their ability to provide \nservices to seniors in Portage County, and the Department on Aging \ndepends on dozens of volunteer drivers to deliver meals to homes and \ntransport people to their medical appointments, meal sites, and other \nessential services.\n  Many of my colleagues know the senior meals program is one of the \nmost vital services provided under the Older Americans Act, and \nensuring that meals can be delivered to seniors or that seniors can be \ntaken to meal sites is an essential part of that program. In fact, it \nis often the case that the senior meals program is the point at which \nmany frail elderly first come into contact with the network of services \nthat can help them. For that reason, these programs are important not \nonly for the essential nutrition services they provide, but also for \nthe many other critical services that the frail elderly may need.\n  Unfortunately, Federal support for the senior nutrition programs has \nstagnated in recent years, increasing pressure on local programs to \nleverage more volunteer services to make up for that lagging Federal \nsupport. Regrettably, the 14 cents per mile reimbursement limit has \nmade it far more difficult to obtain those volunteer services. Portage \nCounty reported that many of their volunteers cannot afford to offer \ntheir services under such a restriction. And if volunteers cannot be \nfound, their services will have to be replaced by contracting with a \nprovider, greatly increasing costs to the Department, costs that come \ndirectly out of the pot of funds available to pay for meals and other \nservices.\n  The same is true for thousands of other non-profit and charitable \norganizations that provide essential services to communities across our \nNation.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. As I noted earlier, for 2007 the comparable \nmileage rate for someone who works for a business is 48.5 cents per \nmile. This disparity means that a business hired to deliver the same \nmeals delivered by volunteers for Portage County may reimburse their \nemployees nearly three and a half times the amount permitted the \nvolunteer without a tax consequence.\n  This doesn't make sense. The 14 cents per mile volunteer \nreimbursement limit is badly outdated. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, Congress first set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents \nper mile as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not \nincrease it until 1997, when the level was raised slightly, to 14 cents \nper mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to a measure I \nintroduced in the 109th Congress, and largely the same as the version I \nintroduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses. It raises the limit on \nvolunteer mileage reimbursement to the level permitted to businesses, \nand provides an offset to ensure that the measure does not aggravate \nthe budget deficit. The most recent estimate of the cost to increase \nthe reimbursement for volunteer drivers is about $1 million over 5 \nyears. Though the revenue loss is small, it is vital that we do \neverything we can to move toward a balanced budget, and to that end I \nhave included a provision to fully offset the cost of the measure and \nmake it deficit neutral. That provision increases the criminal monetary \npenalties for individuals and corporations convicted of tax fraud. The \nprovision passed the Senate in the 108th Congress as part of the JOBS \nbill, but was later dropped in conference and was not included in the \nfinal version of that bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It will help ensure \ncharitable organizations can continue to attract the volunteers that \nplay such a critical role in helping to deliver services and it will \nsimplify the Tax Code both for nonprofit groups and the volunteers \nthemselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Tester, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan Mr.Enzi, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 404. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nrequire the implementation of country of origin labeling requirements \nby September 30, 2007; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is of \ngreat importance to livestock producers and consumers in my home State \nof Wyoming, and to people across the Nation. My bill would expedite the \nimplementation of mandatory country of origin labeling, or COOL, for \nbeef and other agricultural products, and set that date at September \n30, 2007. I am pleased that Senator Baucus joins me in this effort, as \ndoes Senator Thune, Senator Grassley, Senator Tester, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Enzi, and Senator Conrad.\n  Consumers drive our economy, and it is important that we provide them \nrelevant information about the products they are purchasing. U.S. \nconsumers overwhelmingly support mandatory COOL. They have a right to \nknow where their food comes from. Labeling provides more product \ninformation, increased consumer choice, and the chance to support \nAmerican agriculture. Labeling also allows our producers to distinguish \ntheir superior products. Trade is not going away. With increased trade \ncomes an increase in the importance of country of origin labeling. Many \nnations already label food and other products--including the United \nStates. If it is good enough for T-shirts, it ought to be good enough \nfor T-bones.\n  Mandatory COOL was signed into law with the 2002 Farm Bill. I was an \noriginal supporter of COOL during the Farm Bill debate, and I have \nbecome increasingly frustrated with efforts to delay its \nimplementation. The latest delay was inserted into the Fiscal Year 2006 \nAgriculture Appropriations bill, and I voted against the bill for that \nreason.\n  Producers and consumers have waited long enough for country of origin \nlabeling. It is high time we make it happen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Country of Origin Labeling \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. APPLICABILITY OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 285 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1638d) is amended by striking ``September 30, 2008'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 2007''.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring the implementation of country of origin labeling \nrequirements for food sold in the United States. Congress originally \npassed country of origin labeling in the 2002 farm bill, but has twice \nvoted to delay its implementation. Country-of-origin labeling is good \nfor American consumers; it is good for our farmers and ranchers, and \nthe time to implement it is now.\n  American farmers and ranchers raise the highest quality agricultural \ngoods in the world. Country of origin labeling benefits farmers and \nranchers by allowing them to market their world-famous products and \nconsumers who deserve to know where their food comes from.\n  Any American consumer can look at the tag on their shirt or under the \nhood of their car and know where it was made. But when meats and \nproduce move into the market place, their origin often becomes a \nmystery. Considering the importance of food to our health and safety, \nthe growth of our children, and the livelihood of our farmers and \nranchers, we should have as much information about the origin of our \nfood as possible.\n  When I was president of the Montana Senate in 2005, I helped lead the \nfight to pass and implement country of origin labeling because Congress \nhad failed to act. In Montana we are particularly proud of the quality \nof our agricultural products, and of the people who raise them. Our \nclean air and water, well preserved natural environment, and modern \nagricultural practices make consumers want to buy Montana meats, fruits \nand vegetables. Our State government has given consumers the \ninformation and the choice to purchase American raised products through \ncountry of origin labeling.\n  As a dry land farmer from Big Sandy, Montana I know how challenging \nit is to be successful in agriculture. American farmers and ranchers \nneed all the tools they can get. We no longer compete only with our \nlocal neighbors. We compete internationally with South America, Asia, \nAustralia and New Zealand. Country of origin labeling adds value in the \nmarket place that was already added by being grown on American farms \nand ranches.\n  American consumers will make choices to support our domestic industry \nand sometimes pay a premium to know that their food comes from the \nUnited States. They support American agriculture with its high-quality \nstandards, where money made stays in our rural communities and in the \nhands of American farmers and ranchers instead of going overseas. The \nbenefits of country of origin labeling are great, the costs are little \nand consumers have demanded it. Congress needs to take the next step \nand implement the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Ensign)\n  S. 405. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to specify the purposes for which funds provided under part A of \ntitle I may be used; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Ensign to \nintroduce legislation to ensure that Title I funds are directed towards \ninstructional services to teach our Nation's neediest students.\n  Title I provides assistance to almost every school district in the \ncountry to serve children attending schools with high numbers of low-\nincome students, from preschool to high school.\n  Although it has always been the intent of Congress for Title I funds \nto be used for instruction and instructional services, the Federal \nGovernment has never provided a clear definition of what instructional \nservices should entail.\n  This lack of Federal guidance has become especially clear now, as \nStates are struggling to comply with the Title I accountability \nstandards established under ``No Child Left Behind.''\n  While State Administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet \nthese specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to \nhow to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.\n  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this \nprocess as clear to States as possible.\n  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to \nget my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate \nversion of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, that language was \nstripped out and in its place language was inserted directing the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) to report on how states use their Title \nI funds.\n  In April 2003, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to \nsubmit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.\n  What GAO found is that while districts spent no more than 13 percent \nof Title I funds on administrative services, these findings were based \non their\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nown definition ``because there is no common definition on what \nconstitutes administrative expenditures.''\n  Therefore, the accounting office could not precisely measure how much \nof schools' Title I funds were used for administration.\n  Because uses of Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout \nthe states, the accounting office created their own definition by \ncompiling aspects of state priorities to complete the report.\n  The very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should be used--\nto create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--became the \ndefinitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing conclusions \nto their report.\n  The report highlights two concerns that I have with the lack of \nuniversal definitions in the Title I program: The lack of Federal \nguidance on effective uses of Title I funds and the government's \ninability to accurately measure whether the academic needs of low-\nincome students are being met.\n  This bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for states \nto retain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance \nneeded to administer the program uniformly throughout the country.\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague.\n  It says, ``a State or local educational agency shall use funds \nreceived under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that \nwould, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from \nnon-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in \nprograms assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''\n  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the \n``education of pupils.'' This is too ambiguous.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given states a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can be used.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: 1. construction or acquisition of real property; and 2. \npayment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to \nreimburse a parent for a salary lost due to attendance at a ``parental \ninvolvement'' meeting.\n  I believe we should give the Department, States and districts a \nclearer guidance in law.\n  This legislation would: Define Title I direct and indirect \ninstructional services. Set a standard for the amount of Title I funds \nthat can be used to achieve the academic and administrative objectives \nof this program. Ensure that the majority of Title I funds are used to \nimprove academic achievement by stipulating that ``a local educational \nagency may use not more than 10 percent of [Title I] funds received . . \n. for indirect instructional services.''\n  By limiting the amount of funds that schools can spend on \nadministrative or indirect services, school districts are restricted \nfrom shuffling the majority of Title I to pay for non-academic \nservices, but it also gives the districts flexibility to use the \nremaining funds for the indirect costs administering Title I \ndistribution.\n  Furthermore, by defining direct and indirect services, all States can \napply the same standards for how Title I funds are used nationwide.\n  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: Employing teachers and \nother instructional personnel, including employee benefits. Intervening \nand taking corrective actions to improve student achievement. \nPurchasing instructional resources such as books, materials, computers, \nand other instructional equipment. Developing and administering \ncurriculum, educational materials and assessments.\n  Examples of Indirect Services limited to no more than 10 percent of \nTitle I expenditures are: Business services relating to administering \nthe program. Purchasing or providing facilities maintenance, \njanitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of \nutility costs. Buying food and paying for travel to and attendance at \nconferences or meetings, except if necessary for professional \ndevelopment.\n  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: first, I believe \nthat states must use their limited Federal dollars for the fundamental \npurpose of providing academic instruction to help students learn. \nSecondly, I believe that it is nearly impossible to do so without \nproviding a clear definition of what is considered an instructional \nservice.\n  I am not suggesting that it is the fault of the school districts for \nnot focusing their Title I funds on academic instruction. They are \nsimply exercising the flexibility that Congress has given them.\n  If Congress also intended for those funds to educate our neediest \nchildren, federal guidance must be given to ensure that it happens.\n  It is my view that Title I cannot do everything. Federal funding is \nonly about 9 percent of the total funding for elementary and secondary \neducation and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total support for \npublic schools.\n  That is why it is imperative to better focus Title I funds on \nacademic instruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping \ndisadvantaged children achieve.\n  Schools must focus their general administrative budget to pay for \nexpenses that fall outside of the realm of direct educational services \nand retain the majority of federal funds to improve academic \nachievement.\n  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of \neducation: to help students learn. This is one step towards that \nimportant goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask for unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation directly follow this statement \nin the record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide \nopportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunting \nHeritage Protection Act of 2007. I cannot stress how important this \npiece of legislation is to ensure that our Nation's rich hunting \nheritage is passed on to future generations. This legislation preserves \nand protects the rights and access to Federal public lands that are \nvitally important to the sportsmen and women of America.\n  I have been an avid outdoor sportsman for the better part of my adult \nlife and I must say that the times I have spent hunting with my son or \nwith friends have been some of the best times of my life. Recreational \nhunting provides numerous opportunities to spend time and share \nvaluable experiences of some of life's lessons with children, family \nand friends.\n  It is hard to put a price tag on seeing the joy and excitement in a \nchild's eyes during their first hunting experience. It is one of the \nreasons that I decided to introduce this legislation. I believe that \nrecreational hunting should be an activity that everyone has the \nopportunity to experience.\n  One thing that all sportsmen and women have in common is that they \nare also conservationists. I, like my fellow hunters, understand that \nwithout wildlife conservation our Nation's rich hunting heritage will \nend with this generation. Sportsmen and women have continued to support \nsound wildlife management and conservation practices since the time of \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt who many consider to be the father of the \nconservation movement. Each year millions of hunters purchase licenses, \npermits, and stamps that contribute a significant amount of money to \nwildlife conservation. These hunters also contribute billions of \ndollars to the U.S. economy from other hunting related activities.\n  Hunting is a rural development activity. It is quite understandable \nhow hunting provides an important supplement to the income of many \nfarmers and ranchers, and even though this legislation pertains to \nFederal public lands many people overlook the related rural job \nopportunities that are created by hunting. These include guiding and \nincreased hotel and restaurant activity to name just a few. As our \nrural population decreases and our urban/suburban increases, hunting is \nan activity that allows many families to stay connected to the land and \nin so doing; it creates economic activity for our rural areas.\n  Recognizing hunters for their role in conservation efforts throughout \nthe U.S. is very important. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act not \nonly recognizes hunters for their conservation efforts but it also \nrequires that Federal public land and water are open to access and use \nfor recreational hunting when and where hunting is appropriate. It is \nimportant to note that this bill does not open all Federal public land \nto hunting.\n  Another crucial piece of this legislation is that it creates a policy \nthat requires Federal government agencies to manage Federal public land \nunder their jurisdiction in a manner that supports, promotes, and \nenhances recreational hunting opportunities.\n  As I mentioned before, sportsmen and women have contributed greatly \nto wildlife conservation over the years and it is important that \nCongress acknowledge this contribution by ensuring that the amount of \nFederal public land open to recreational hunting does not decrease. \nThat is why this legislation requires that actions related to the \nmanagement of Federal public lands should result in a ``no net loss'' \nof land area available for recreational hunting.\n  It is vitally important that we, as Members of the Senate, do all we \ncan to protect and preserve the tradition of hunting so that future \ngenerations will be able to experience this great outdoor recreational \nactivity. I believe that the ``Hunting Heritage Protection Act of \n2007'' meets these goals.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in supporting and preserving our Nation's rich heritage of hunting \nby supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hunting Heritage Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) recreational hunting is an important and traditional \n     recreational activity in which 13,000,000 people in the \n     United States 16 years of age and older participate;\n       (2) hunters have been and continue to be among the foremost \n     supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation \n     practices in the United States;\n       (3) persons who hunt and organizations relating to hunting \n     provide direct assistance to wildlife managers and \n     enforcement officers of the Federal Government and State and \n     local governments;\n       (4) purchases of hunting licenses, permits, and stamps and \n     excise taxes on goods used by hunters have generated billions \n     of dollars for wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management;\n       (5) recreational hunting is an essential component of \n     effective wildlife management by--\n       (A) reducing conflicts between people and wildlife; and\n       (B) providing incentives for the conservation of--\n       (i) wildlife; and\n       (ii) habitats and ecosystems on which wildlife depend;\n       (6) each State has established at least 1 agency staffed by \n     professionally trained wildlife management personnel that has \n     legal authority to manage the wildlife in the State; and\n       (7) recreational hunting is an environmentally acceptable \n     activity that occurs, and can be provided for, on Federal \n     public land without adverse effects on other uses of the \n     land.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Agency head.--The term ``agency head'' means the head \n     of any Federal agency that has authority to manage a natural \n     resource or Federal public land on which a natural resource \n     depends.\n       (2) Federal public land.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``Federal public land'' means any \n     land or water that is--\n       (i) publicly accessible;\n       (ii) owned by the United States; and\n       (iii) managed by an executive agency for purposes that \n     include the conservation of natural resources.\n       (B) Exclusion.--The term ``Federal public land'' does not \n     include any land held in trust for the benefit of an Indian \n     tribe or member of an Indian tribe.\n       (3) Hunting.--The term ``hunting'' means the lawful--\n       (A) pursuit, trapping, shooting, capture, collection, or \n     killing of wildlife; or\n       (B) attempt to pursue, trap, shoot, capture, collect, or \n     kill wildlife.\n\n     SEC. 4. RECREATIONAL HUNTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights, Federal \n     public land shall be open to access and use for recreational \n     hunting except as limited by--\n       (1) the agency head with jurisdiction over the Federal \n     public land--\n       (A) for reasons of national security;\n       (B) for reasons of public safety; or\n       (C) for any other reasons for closure authorized by \n     applicable Federal law; and\n       (2) any law (including regulations) of the State in which \n     the Federal public land is located that is applicable to \n     recreational hunting.\n       (b) Management.--Consistent with subsection (a), to the \n     extent authorized under State law (including regulations), \n     and in accordance with applicable Federal law (including \n     regulations), each agency head shall manage Federal public \n     land under the jurisdiction of the agency head in a manner \n     that supports, promotes, and enhances recreational hunting \n     opportunities.\n       (c) No Net Loss.--\n       (1) In general.--Federal public land management decisions \n     and actions should, to the maximum extent practicable, result \n     in no net loss of land area available for hunting \n     opportunities on Federal public land.\n       (2) Annual report.--Not later than October 1 of each year, \n     each agency head with authority to manage Federal public land \n     on which recreational hunting occurs shall submit to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural \n     Resources of the House of Representatives a report that \n     describes--\n       (A)(i) any Federal public land administered by the agency \n     head that was closed to recreational hunting at any time \n     during the preceding year; and\n       (ii) the reason for the closure; and\n       (B) areas administered by the agency head that were opened \n     to recreational hunting to compensate for the closure of the \n     areas described in subparagraph (A)(i).\n       (3) Closures of 5,000 or more acres.--The withdrawal, \n     change of classification, or change of management status that \n     effectively closes 5,000 or more acres of Federal\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\n     public land to access or use for recreational hunting shall \n     take effect only if, before the date of withdrawal or change, \n     the agency head that has jurisdiction over the Federal public \n     land submits to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee \n     on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives written \n     notice of the withdrawal or change.\n       (d) Areas Not Affected.--Nothing in this Act compels the \n     opening to recreational hunting of national parks or national \n     monuments under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n       (e) No Priority.--Nothing in this Act requires a Federal \n     agency to give preference to hunting over other uses of \n     Federal public land or over land or water management \n     priorities established by Federal law.\n       (f) Authority of the States.--\n       (1) Savings.--Nothing in this Act affects the authority, \n     jurisdiction, or responsibility of a State to manage, \n     control, or regulate fish and wildlife under State law \n     (including regulations) on land or water in the State, \n     including Federal public land.\n       (2) Federal licenses.--Nothing in this Act authorizes an \n     agency head to require a license or permit to hunt, fish, or \n     trap on land or water in a State, including on Federal public \n     land in the State.\n       (3) State right of action.--\n       (A) In general.--Any State aggrieved by the failure of an \n     agency head or employee to comply with this Act may bring a \n     civil action in the United States District Court for the \n     district in which the failure occurs for a permanent \n     injunction.\n       (B) Preliminary injunction.--If the district court \n     determines, based on the facts, that a preliminary injunction \n     is appropriate, the district court may grant a preliminary \n     injunction.\n       (C) Court costs.--If the district court issues an \n     injunction under this paragraph or otherwise finds in favor \n     of the State, the district court shall award to the State any \n     reasonable costs of bringing the civil action (including an \n     attorney's fee).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 409. A bill to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal \ninterests in the State of North Dakota; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Water \nInfrastructure Revitalization Act, which authorizes $60 million through \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist communities in North Dakota \nwith water supply and treatment projects.\n  Imagine if you went to turn on your kitchen faucet one day and no \nwater came out. This scenario became true for thousands in the \ncommunities of Fort Yates, Cannonball, and Porcupine just days before \nThanksgiving in 2003. The loss of drinking water forced the closure of \nschools, the hospital and tribal offices for days. About 170 miles \nupstream, the community of Parshall faces similar water supply \nchallenges as the water level on Lake Sakakawea continues to drop, \nleaving its intake high and dry. These and other communities in the \nState have faced significant expenditures in extending their intakes to \nensure a continued supply of water. In addition, the city of Mandan \nfaces the prospect of constructing a new horizontal well intake because \nchanges in sediment load and flow as a result of the backwater effects \nof the Oahe Reservoir have caused significant siltation problems that \nrestrict flow into the intake. These examples barely scratch the \nsurface of the problems faced by many North Dakota communities in \nmaintaining a safe, reliable water supply.\n  Since 1999, the Corps of Engineers has been authorized to design and \nconstruct water-related infrastructure projects in several different \nStates including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Montana. The State of North \nDakota confronts water infrastructure challenges that are just as \ndifficult as those in these other States. In fact, many of these \nchallenges are caused directly by the Corps of Engineers's operations \nof the Missouri River dams. As a result, it is only appropriate that \nthe Corps be part of the solution to North Dakota's water needs.\n  The Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act would provide important \nsupplemental funding to assist North Dakota communities with water-\nrelated infrastructure repairs. Under the act, communities could use \nthe funding for wastewater treatment, water supply facilities, \nenvironmental restoration and surface water resource protection. \nProjects would be cost shared, with 75 percent Federal funding and 25 \npercent non-Federal in most instances. However, the bill reduces the \nfinancial burden on local communities if necessary to ensure that water \nrates do not exceed the national affordability criteria developed by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  This bill is not intended to compete with or take away funds for the \nconstruction of rural water projects under the Dakota Water Resources \nAct. Instead, it is meant to provide important supplemental funding for \ncommunities that are not able to receive funding from the Dakota Water \nResources Act. It is my hope that this authorization will be included \nas part of the Water Resources Development Act.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to address an \nimportant issue in North Dakota.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 410. A bill to amend the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 \nto direct the Secretary of the Army to provide assistance to design and \nconstruct a project to provide a continued safe and reliable municipal \nwater supply system for Devils Lake, North Dakota; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct a new municipal \nwater supply system for the city of Devils Lake, ND. This project is \nvery important to the reliability of the water supply for the residents \nof Devils Lake and is needed to mitigate long-term consequences from \nthe rising flood waters of Devils Lake.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Devils Lake region has been \nplagued by a flooding disaster since 1993. During that time, Devils \nLake, a closed basin lake, has risen more than 25 feet, consuming land, \ndestroying homes, and impacting vital infrastructure. As a result of \nthis disaster, the city of Devils Lake faces a significant risk of \nlosing its water supply. Currently, 6 miles or approximately one-third \nof the city's 40-year-old water transmission line is covered by the \nrising waters of Devils Lake. The submerged section of the water line \nincludes numerous gate valves, air relief valves, and blow-off \ndischarges.\n  All of the water for the city's residents and businesses must flow \nthrough this single transmission line. It is also the only link between \nthe water source and the city's water distribution system. Since the \ntransmission line is operated under relatively low pressures and is \nunder considerable depths of water, a minor leak could cause \nsignificant problems. If a failure in the line were to occur, it would \nbe almost impossible to identify the leak and make necessary repairs, \nand the city would be left without a water supply.\n  The city is in the process of accessing a new water source due both \nto the threat of a transmission line failure and the fact that its \ncurrent water source exceeds the new arsenic standard. The city has \nworked closely with the North Dakota State Water Commission in \nidentifying a new water source that will not be affected by the rising \nflood waters and will provide the city with adequate water to meet its \ncurrent and future needs.\n  The bill will authorize the Corps to construct a new water supply \nsystem for the city. Mr. President, I believe the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to address the unintended consequences of this \nflood and mitigate its long-term consequences. This bill will help the \nFederal Government live up to its responsibility and ensure that the \nresidents of Devils Lake have a safe and reliable water supply. It is \nmy hope that this authorization will be included as part of the Water \nResources Development Act.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to address an \nimportant issue for the city of Devils Lake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncredit rate parity for all renewable resources under the electricity \nproduction credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill bring parity to all renewable energy facilities that qualify for \nthe production tax credit under section 45 of the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of the production tax credit. There \nare\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nsignificant wind facilities in Oregon, where we have over 335 megawatts \nof installed wind capacity. These facilities provide clean energy as \nwell as important revenues to farmers and rural counties in Eastern \nOregon.\n  Currently, however, some eligible renewable facilities get only half \nthe per-kilowatt credit that other types of facilities receive. My goal \nhere is to level the playing field for all eligible renewables without \nreducing the credit any facility currently receives. Therefore, my bill \nprovides that all eligible facilities would receive the higher credit \namount for each kilowatt of electricity produced.\n  I believe that this bill will help to provide the necessary \nincentives to diversify our renewable energy resources. It will also \neliminate the competitive disadvantage that certain types of renewables \ncurrently face. Utilities have little incentive to select renewables \nthat qualify for the lower credit rate when buying green power. The \neligible facilities that receive the lower rate include open-loop \nbiomass, incremental hydropower, and small irrigation systems, all of \nwhich are important energy sources that could help meet the growing \ndemand for electricity in my State of Oregon and in many other parts of \nthe country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in increasing the credit rate for \neligible renewables, and fostering the development and deployment of \nthese important facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 412. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the \n``Lane Evans Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to designate the U.S. Post Office at 2633 11th Street in \nRock Island, IL, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.''\n  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has been my closest friend in the \nIllinois congressional delegation. We came to the House of \nRepresentatives together and he proved to be an indomitable force. Time \nand again, Lane Evans showed extraordinary political courage fighting \nfor the values that brought him to public service. But his greatest \nshow of courage has been over the last 10 years as he battled \nParkinson's disease and those who tried to exploit his physical \nweakness. His dignity and perseverance in the face of this relentless \nand cruel disease is an inspiration to everyone who knows Lane Evans.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation to permanently and publicly \nrecognize Lane Evans and his service to his congressional district, our \nState of Illinois, and the entire United States by naming the Rock \nIsland Post Office in his honor. It would be a most appropriate way for \nus to express our appreciation to Congressman Evans and to commemorate \nhis public life and work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 412\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrequire the Government to label any food that comes from a cloned \nanimal.\n  I am strongly opposed to the FDA approving meat and milk products \nfrom cloned animals. No one needs cloned milk and meat. Most Americans \nactively oppose it.\n  But the Food and Drug Administration has decided that food from \ncloned animals is safe to eat. And, since they have decided this is \n``safe,'' they will not require that it be labeled as coming from a \ncloned animal.\n  The American people don't want this. Gallup Polls report over 65 \npercent of Americans think it is immoral to clone animals and the Pew \nInitiative on Food and Biotechnology found that a similar percentage \nsay that, despite FDA approval, they won't buy cloned milk.\n  The National Academies of Science reported that so far, studies show \nno problems with food from cloned animals but they also admit that this \nis brand new science. What about the possibility of unintended \nconsequences a few years from now? They cautioned the Federal \nGovernment to monitor for potential health effects and urged diligent \npost-market surveillance.\n  So even if we agreed the science appears safe, we need to follow it \nclosely. But, once the FDA determines this is safe they said they will \nallow the food to enter the market unidentified, unlabeled, unbeknownst \nto all of us and completely indistinguishable from all other food. We \nwon't be able to tell which foods were made the good old fashioned way \nand which came from a cloned animal\n  Must we be compelled to eat anything a scientist can produce in the \nlaboratory? Just because they can make it, should Americans be required \nto eat it? Of course not. The public deserves to know if their food \ncomes from a cloned animal.\n  To help the American public make an informed decision on this, today \nI will introduce a bill to require all food that comes from a cloned \nanimal to be labeled. This legislation will require the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the Department of Agriculture to label all food that \ncomes from a cloned animal or their offspring. We need to know and we \nmust be able to decide for ourselves. And I mean all food--not just the \npackages we buy in the supermarket but the meals we choose from a menu.\n  The FDA has a responsibility to guarantee the safety of our food. \nThough many aspects of food safety are beyond their control--this is \nnot. We do not know enough about the long term effects of introducing \ncloned animals, or their offspring, into our food supply to guarantee \nthis is safe. Is this decision to allow cloned animals into our food \nsupply influenced by factors other than keeping the public safe? Are \nthey allowing an eager industry to force a questionably scientific \nprocess on an unknowing public?\n  We simply don't have the same trust in the FDA as we once had. \nRecently the Wall Street Journal found that over half of Americans feel \nthe FDA does not do a good job keeping our drug supply safe. We want to \ntrust them with the safety of our food supply but what if they are \nwrong?\n  What if the FDA has made a mistake and finds out a few years from now \nthat there was a problem with this. If we do not keep track of it from \nthe very beginning--by clear and dependable labeling--we could \ncontaminate our entire food supply. If the food is not properly labeled \nwe can't remove it from the shelves like we did with problematic drugs \nsuch as Vioxx and Celebrex. We must be proactive. We must label these \nfoods.\n  I reject the notion that the FDA or anyone else should force \nAmericans to accept and consume any product that can be manufactured in \na lab--no matter how offensive the product is. We need to insist that \nthe FDA treat the public fairly. If cloned food is safe, let it onto \nthe market, but give consumers the information they need to avoid these \nproducts. We need to let Americans speak with their dollars and choose \nthe food they have confidence is safe.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1244-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n                            JANUARY 25, 2007\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 43--HONORING THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATION \n  OF THE ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, ON ITS 150TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

awakened the conscience and consciousness \n     of the Nation and used his message of hope to bring people \n     together to build the Beloved Community--a community of \n     justice, at peace with itself;\n       Whereas Dr. King was born on January 15, 1929, and attended \n     segregated public schools in Georgia;\n       Whereas Dr. King began attending Morehouse College in \n     Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 15, and received a B.A. degree \n     in 1948 from Morehouse College, following in the footsteps of \n     both his father and grandfather;\n       Whereas Dr. King received his B.D. in 1951 from Crozer \n     Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania and his Ph.D. in \n     theology in 1955 from Boston University;\n       Whereas in Boston Dr. King met Coretta Scott, his life \n     partner and fellow civil rights activist, and they married on \n     June 18, 1953, and had 2 sons and 2 daughters;\n       Whereas Dr. King was ordained in the Christian ministry in \n     February 1948 at the age of 19 at Ebenezer Baptist Church, in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, and became Assistant Pastor of Ebenezer \n     Baptist Church;\n       Whereas, in 1954, Dr. King accepted the call of Dexter \n     Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, and was pastor \n     there until November 1959, when he resigned to move back to \n     Atlanta to lead the Southern Christian Leadership Conference;\n       Whereas from 1960 until his death in 1968, Dr. King was \n     again a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, along with his \n     father;\n       Whereas between 1957 and 1968, Dr. King traveled over \n     6,000,000 miles, spoke over 2,500 times, and wrote 5 books \n     and numerous articles, supporting efforts around the Nation \n     to end injustice and bring about social change and \n     desegregation;\n       Whereas Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott for 381 \n     days to protest the arrest of Mrs. Rosa Parks and the \n     segregation of the bus system of Montgomery, Alabama, in the \n     first great nonviolent civil rights demonstration of \n     contemporary times in the United States;\n       Whereas during the boycott, Dr. King was arrested and his \n     home was bombed, yet he responded with nonviolence and \n     courage in the face of hatred;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court of the \n     United States declared the laws requiring segregation in \n     Montgomery's bus system to be unconstitutional, leading to \n     the end of the bus boycott on December 21, 1956;\n       Whereas Dr. King led the March on Washington, D.C. on \n     August 28, 1963, the largest rally of the civil rights \n     movement;\n       Whereas during that march, Dr. King delivered his famous \n     ``I Have A Dream'' speech from the steps of the Lincoln \n     Memorial and before a crowd of over 200,000 people;\n       Whereas Dr. King's ``I Have A Dream'' speech is one of the \n     classic orations in United States history;\n       Whereas Dr. King was a champion of nonviolence, fervently \n     advocating nonviolent resistance as the strategy to end \n     segregation and racial discrimination in the United States;\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n       Whereas Dr. King was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize in \n     recognition for his efforts, and, at the age of 35, was the \n     youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize;\n       Whereas through his work and reliance on nonviolent \n     protest, Dr. King was instrumental in the passage of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas the work of Dr. King created a basis of \n     understanding and respect and helped communities, and the \n     Nation as a whole, to act cooperatively and courageously to \n     achieve tolerance, justice, and equality between people;\n       Whereas, on the evening of April 4, 1968, Dr. King was \n     assassinated while standing on the balcony of his motel room \n     in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead sanitation \n     workers in protest against low wages and intolerable working \n     conditions;\n       Whereas in 1968 Representative John Conyers first \n     introduced legislation to establish a national holiday \n     honoring Dr. King;\n       Whereas Coretta Scott King led a massive campaign to \n     establish Dr. King's birthday as a national holiday;\n       Whereas in 1983 Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan \n     signed legislation establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day;\n       Whereas in 2007 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is celebrated \n     in more than 100 countries;\n       Whereas in remembering Dr. King we also honor his wife and \n     indispensable partner, Coretta Scott King, a woman of quiet \n     courage and great dignity who marched alongside her husband \n     and became an international advocate for peace and human \n     rights;\n       Whereas Mrs. King, who had been actively engaged in the \n     civil rights movement as a politically and socially conscious \n     young woman, continued after her husband's death to lead the \n     Nation toward greater justice and equality for all, traveling \n     the world advocating for racial and economic justice, peace \n     and nonviolence, women's and children's rights, gay rights, \n     religious freedom, full employment, health care, and \n     education until her death on January 30, 2006;\n       Whereas the values of faith, compassion, courage, truth, \n     justice, and nonviolence that guided Dr. and Mrs. King's \n     dream for the United States will be celebrated and preserved \n     by the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial on the \n     National Mall near the Jefferson Memorial and in the new \n     National Museum of African American History and Culture that \n     will be located near the Lincoln Memorial;\n       Whereas Dr. King's actions and leadership made the United \n     States a better place and the people of the United States a \n     better people;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should commemorate \n     the legacy of Dr. King, so ``that one day this nation will \n     rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold \n     these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created \n     equal' ''; and\n       Whereas Dr. King's voice is silenced today, but on the \n     national holiday honoring Dr. King and throughout the year, \n     the people of the United States should remember his message, \n     recommit to his goal of a free and just nation, and consider \n     each person's responsibility to other people: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes and celebrates the national holiday honoring \n     Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.;\n       (2) honors Dr. King's example of nonviolence, courage, \n     compassion, dignity, and public service;\n       (3) pledges to advance the legacy of the Dr. King; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to \n     celebrate--\n       (A) the national holiday honoring Dr. King; and\n       (B) the life and legacy of Dr. King.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url":

Mr. President, on this brisk day in Washington, \nweatherwise, we have had a refreshing debate about minimum wage. I have \nlistened to the majority leader say that those who have minimum wage \namendments and would like to have votes are, in fact, against raising \nthe minimum wage. I introduced my amendment yesterday. I highlighted \nthe wonderful work of Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, the managers of \nthe bill, the fact that we were long overdue for a minimum wage \nincrease, and that, as a Member of the Senate, I thought it was \nimportant we explore, as we do this, if we can make some changes that \nallow us to address other areas.\n  Now, I happen to be the Senator who offered the amendment--and I \nthank my colleagues Senator Coburn and Senator DeMint who are \ncosponsors--who suggested this--that with the $2.10 increase we make in \nminimum wage, we allow an employer to determine if they want to provide \nthat increase in wages or in health care benefits.\n  We have had a debate in this country for years, over the 13 years I \nhave been here, about the uninsured population and what we need to do. \nHere is an opportunity to do something. Here is a real opportunity to \ngive employers the incentive to provide to the most at-risk minimum \nwage workers a health care benefit that can be covered under the \numbrella of health coverage that we, as Members of the Senate and those \nof us who work for the Federal Government, actually have that protects \nus.\n  All Americans should have access to quality and affordable health \ncare. Under our current system, many get health care from their \nemployer. Let's increase the number of Americans under that umbrella of \ncoverage and take the opportunity, as we increase the minimum wage \nrate, to allow employers to be the ones to do it.\n  The majority leader has filed a cloture motion on S. 2. Let me \nexplain exactly what that means. We are going to cut off the ability to \noffer amendments on anything non-germane. Anyone listening to the \ndescription of my amendment would have to say, clearly, that is \ngermane. You will use the $2.10 increase in the minimum wage to allow \nemployers to offer health care with that $2.10. Now, this is not a shot \nat the Parliamentarian of the Senate, but this amendment is not \ngermane. In filing cloture without an agreement, we\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nwon't be allowed in the Senate to have a vote on my amendment. I can \ncome here and sell the merits of my amendment to those across the \ncountry who listen to this and they will say--that makes a tremendous \namount of sense. We want to extend health care to the uninsured. An \nexcellent way to do that is to use the power of the employer. As an \nemployer negotiated for the rest of his employees who may not be at the \nlower end of his pay scale, he can use the minimum wage workers in the \ngroup rate and access health insurance cheaper than they could as \nindividuals.\n  But no, filing cloture means without an agreement the Senate is never \ngoing to have a vote on this. We will be denied the vote because this \nis non-germane.\n  I am not sure where this fits in that open process I heard described. \nAs a matter of fact, we have actually filed cloture for a bill we have \nnot even called up, a resolution on Iraq. I guess that means we will \nlimit our debate on the war, too. Gee, that is a strange one to limit \ndebate on.\n  Let me take the time I have today to talk about my amendment. Mr. \nPresident, $2.10; what is that on an annual basis for an individual at \nthe lowest end of the income scale in America? It is $4,368. Some \npeople will be opposed to the amendment even though they will not get \nan opportunity to vote on it because they will say that is not enough \nmoney. Let me show what it can buy.\n  Mr. President, $4,300 a year can buy health insurance, 100 percent \nfor an individual. It can buy almost 50 percent of family coverage. \nThis is the average as followed by the Kaiser Family Foundation of fee-\nfor-service insurance: $3,782. I might say that regionally, where you \nlive in the United States dictates the cost of health insurance, but \nthis is an average for the United States, fee-for-service, traditional \nhealth care coverage, $3,782; a preferred provider plan, $4,150; a POS \nplan, $3,914; and a health maintenance organization, $3,767.\n\n  The argument that you cannot provide health care with the $4,368 \nincrease we are giving to a minimum wage worker clearly has been \ndemonstrated by the Kaiser Foundation to be wrong. You cannot only \nprovide it as an employer, you can pay 100 percent of it. A minimum \nwage worker would not have to put a dime out of their pocket to have \nhealth care coverage that is equal to what a Member of the Senate has. \nBut when you file cloture, when you limit debate, when you deny a vote, \nyou have now denied every minimum wage worker in the country of having \nan opportunity for their employer to work on behalf of their group to \nextend the health care benefit to minimum wage workers: a 100-percent \nbenefit.\n  The President and myself--I think we pay 25 percent of our insurance \npremium for health care, and that percentage certainly changes, \ndepending on who you work for. But an employer assumes some percentage. \nSome employers pay 100 percent, but it is rare today. Here is an \nopportunity to give employers an incentive to provide 100 percent of \nthe premium cost and still have money left over to provide to their \nemployees.\n  I am sure there are people listening to this debate who are saying \nthis is crazy. If we have 47 million uninsured in this country, how \nmany of those might fall into this category? The reality is, it is \nalmost 15 million Americans whose income is $25,000 or less.\n  The average minimum wage worker today makes a little over $10,000. \nThe actual national poverty level is a little over $9,000. They are \nvery close to it for a full 40 hours worth of work.\n  When we look at 47 million Americans, I am beginning to think we like \nthat number more for the purposes of debate than as a target or a goal \nto solve.\n  I said at the beginning, I believe all Americans should have access \nto quality, affordable health care. My opposition only wants that \naccess if the Government provides it instead of the private sector. \nThat was the debate in Part D Medicare when we created the first ever \ndrug benefit for seniors in this country. And there were two sides, \nthose who said only the Federal Government can provide this and those \nwho believed that the private sector could, in fact, negotiate prices--\nnot just for the price of the drugs but through that, the premiums--\nwhere seniors could be afforded choices.\n  Today, the majority of Medicare-eligible individuals are signed up \nwith the Part D prescription drug plan. Much to my amazement, for those \nwho are incredibly pleased with their plan, the percentage is close to \n100 percent because of their choices and those who want to assume more \nfinancial risk out of their pocket and pay a smaller premium can do it. \nThose who do not want to pay out of their pocket but want to pay a \nhigher premium can do that. For every milestone we have seen in Part D, \ndrug prices have reduced because we have injected competition, premium \nprices have reduced because we are now providing drugs to seniors who \nare actually taking them.\n  What does that do to our overall health care system? It means the \nmore they are taking their medications, the less likely they are to \nvisit the hospitals. Gee, I wonder if that is applicable to what we are \ntalking about here? Why are health care costs going so high? Yes, we \nhave a lot of new technology. That technology allows us to do things in \na noninvasive way. Instead of cracking a chest open and doing a bypass \non somebody's heart because maybe they ate the wrong things for 60 \nyears, now we can go in through their leg, we can go up through their \nvein structure, we can put in a stent and we can open and eliminate the \nrisk of a heart attack. The quality of life is better for them because \nthe recovery is shorter. In some cases it can be done as an outpatient \nprocedure. That $70,000 average cost of a heart bypass is reduced \nsignificantly and, consequently, with that, the overall health care \nsystem sees savings.\n  Imagine if we had not been doing that what the rise in health care \ncosts would be. Part of health care inflation today--and I suggest it \nis a large part--is the cost shift that goes on. What is cost shift? \nThe Presiding Officer and I have health insurance.\n  When we go in and access health care, the hospital, the doctor, the \nlab, and the pharmacist know they are going to get paid because we give \nthem an insurance card. There is no question in their mind. They know \nexactly what their reimbursement is going to be. If a Medicare \nbeneficiary at any point accesses health care, that doctor, that \nhospital, that lab knows exactly what the reimbursement is they are \ngoing to get from Medicare for the procedure they offer.\n  But when somebody goes into an emergency room who is uninsured and \nthey do not pay: What happens to the cost of the procedure they got? It \nis real simple. It gets shifted to us. It gets shifted to everybody who \nhas insurance. And to recover that, everybody's premium in the country \ngoes up.\n  So as I stand here and talk about a very specific group, minimum wage \nworkers in America, what everybody has to understand is what we do on \nthis issue affects everybody's health care in America. It affects \neverybody's premium amount in America. It affects 25 percent of all \nFederal employees costs. If you want to drive some costs down in the \nFederal Government, it is easy: Let's do this because we will eliminate \na significant part of the cost shifting that is going on in our health \ncare system in this country.\n  Studies have shown in order to get individuals to purchase their own \nhealth insurance, tax incentives to individuals need to cover half or \nmore of their health insurance premium. We are covering 100 percent of \nit. Many tax-based health care proposals to help the uninsured are \ncriticized because they do not meet the threshold of covering half or \nmore of an individual's health insurance premium. This is the first \ntime I have ever been criticized because we offered 100 percent of the \npremium.\n  Now, why might other people object to this? Well, quite honestly, \nthey might say the employees should get wages, not health care. Well, \nlet me restate what I said at the beginning, so it is clear.\n  All Americans should have health coverage. Mr. President, 14.6 \nmillion Americans make less than $25,000 a year and are uninsured. So \nif we are wondering in that pot of 47 million what makes up some of \nthem, here is 14.6 million of them right here. They make less than \n$25,000 a year, and we know for a fact they are uninsured.\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n  Mr. President, $2.10 a day can buy basic health insurance for a \nminimum wage worker. On this chart is a breakdown of millions of \nuninsured by household income. You notice that close to the largest \ngroup is shown right here: $25,000 and below.\n  This amendment is like a laser beam on exactly where we can make a \ndifference. You see, we are at a real crossroads in America. We have \ngotten used to the best health care delivery the world has ever seen. \nAs a matter of fact, if we tried to import from another country--and I \nwill not name one because I do not want to offend them--their health \ncare system into our country, the American people would rebel. They \nwould not wait. They would not accept half a loaf when they thought \nthey deserved a whole loaf. That is how our system is.\n  So if we want to get a handle on this incredible cost of health care, \nwe have to do two things. We have to provide coverage and we have to \npromote prevention and wellness.\n  You see, if we can teach people how to control disease, then the \nnumber of times they access health care is going to be less. That is \npretty much common sense. The problem is if we cannot create a \nrelationship between an individual and a health care professional, how \nin the world are we ever going to complete the educational process of \nwhat disease management is? How can we teach a diabetic that it is just \nas important to get exercise and to have a diet as it is to take their \nmedication and check their blood sugar?\n  As a matter of fact, in Asheville, NC, we are in the 10th year of a \nproject called the Asheville Project, where it has focused specifically \non diabetes. This idea was clearly out of the box because the community \ndecided, with a grant, they were going to reimburse pharmacists to \ncounsel diabetes patients.\n  Think about that: A diabetes patient goes in. They are getting their \nmedications filled. Now in Asheville, NC, and 10 other locations in the \nUnited States, that diabetes patient will sit down with the pharmacist, \nand the pharmacist will look through their drug regimen and make sure \nit is correct. They will make sure there is no interaction of different \nmedications that they are currently taking. They will talk to them \nabout exercise. They will give them suggestions if they are not getting \nexercise. They will check their progress if they are. They will talk to \nthem about diet. They will actually weigh them. Maybe that is what we \nare scared of: If we do this, they will start weighing all of us.\n  The reality is in Asheville, NC, and these 10 other cities across the \ncountry, there is now data. It is not me. It is the data that proves \nthey save $2,000 a year per diabetic because we now provide for every \ndiabetic this intense relationship with a health care professional.\n  Now, what you have to understand is that in Asheville's case, and \nthese other areas around the country, this is not the traditional entry \npoint where we would choose to educate. This is quite creative. As a \nmatter of fact, we have talked about it, and it has been rejected in \nthis institution before, that we actually pay pharmacists to do part of \nthe health care education. I hope it is something we will reexamine \nbecause I think there is tremendous merit to it. It has proven to be \nsuccessful.\n  But what does it prove? It proves that if prevention and wellness are \npromoted, there are savings that are derived across the system, and \nthose savings will drive down premium costs for every American.\n  Well, how do you get there? You get there by making sure every \nAmerican is covered. Mr. President, 14.6 million--that is a real chunk \nof people whom we have an opportunity to affect whether they actually \nhave health care coverage, whether they will actually have the \neducation they need with a health care professional on disease \nmanagement. It could be diabetes; it could be HIV/AIDS. There are a \nnumber of things that fall into the category.\n\n  But the reality is, if we miss this opportunity, we will continue to \nhave 14 million people who will access health care in the emergency \nroom on an as-needed basis, and the likelihood is, there will be an in-\nhospital patient with an average stay of over 3 days. And at the end of \nthat stay, they probably will not have the money to pay for it, and, in \nfact, that will get cost shifted to everybody's insurance across the \ncountry. They do not want to do that; they just do not have the money \nto pay for it.\n  Well, here is an opportunity for them not to be put in a difficult \nsituation. Here is an opportunity for an individual to have 100 percent \nof their insurance--let me go back to that. For an individual, $4,386, \nunder a traditional PPO, POS, or HMO, pays 100 percent of their premium \ncosts--better than we get as Senators--and for a family, $9,900, \n$11,000, $10,000--$10,000 is the average across the country, based upon \nthe type of plan you choose. We could pay 50 percent of a family's \nhealth care premium if we allowed employers to use the $2.10 and to \napply it to health care benefits versus wages.\n  One in five adults age 18 to 64 were uninsured in 2004--one in five \nadults. More than 54 percent of the uninsured are in families making \n200 percent or less of the Federal poverty guideline. Again, that is \n$9,800 a year. Americans living in households with annual incomes below \n$25,000 have a higher incidence of no insurance. Mr. President, 24 \npercent were uninsured in 2004, compared to 15.7 percent of the total \npopulation. You see, this is not just the norm percentage who do not \nhave insurance; this is almost double the national norm.\n  Now, why this bill? Why the way we chose to do it? Well, employers \nare the centerpiece of health care delivery in the United States today. \nThey may not be in the future. I am anxious to have that debate. \nPersonally, I believe a health policy should be like a 401(k) plan. You \nshould be able to take that health policy with you regardless of where \nyou go, that when you change employers, you should not have to lose \ninsurance coverage with a given company and the structure of your plan. \nYou should have the option to take that with you. So I am sure at some \npoint this year we will have that debate.\n  Mr. President, 174 million workers and their dependents received \nhealth coverage through the workplace in 2004. So if you ask yourself, \nwhy am I offering this on the minimum wage bill? it is because 174 \nmillion Americans receive their health care coverage via their \nemployer. We have this excellent opportunity right now, as we talk \nabout increasing minimum wage, where we can provide the incentive.\n  I might add, I said the ``option,'' that an employer have the option. \nI am not mandating that an employer has to offer health care. There is \na lot of work that goes into a company providing health care for their \nemployees. They have to meet with plans. They have to negotiate rates. \nThey have to keep records. There are going to be some employers who do \nnot provide health care as a benefit, and they may not provide it for \ntheir employees afterwards. But you also have a segment of America that \nis minimum wage workers where companies would like to find a way for \nthose folks to stay with them versus to leave for a nickel-an-hour or a \ndime-an-hour increase by somebody else.\n  I can tell you, if you offer them 100 percent of their health care, \nthen somebody is going to have to bid very high if, in fact, they are \nnot providing health care, too.\n  Workers, and especially low-income workers, feel more comfortable \nwith their employers negotiating health care benefits than going into \nthe individual market and purchasing it themselves. Why? It is real \nsimple. It is because an employer negotiates volume. When I walk in, \nthey see one individual, and they know I must be uninsured, if I am in \nthere to buy health care, and the likelihood is they are never going to \npull that sheet out of the middle drawer that says ``discounts.'' I \nwill never receive a discount as an individual.\n  And oddly enough, in this country, I have to say--and this is wrong--\nthe lower your income, the more the actuaries look at you and determine \nyou are going to cost more. It is 100-percent wrong. And part of it is \nthe structure of our model in this country: that we seldom promote \nwellness and prevention. I do not care where your income level is, if \nyou provide those individuals with the tools they need, they are as \nhealthy as the person next to them. What these folks do not have, \nbecause they do not have coverage, is they have\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\nno relationship with a health care professional. And that health care \nprofessional could be a primary care doctor; it could be a nurse; it \ncould be a hospital; it could be a community health center; it could be \na rural health clinic. And in the case of Asheville, NC, it could be a \npharmacist in a very targeted program.\n  More than 8 out of 10 of the uninsured are in working families. I am \nnot talking about isolated individuals. I am picking these folks and \nnot suggesting that we are doing something that just affects \nindividuals. These are families. That is why when I talk about the \nfamily piece, think about a family that has never had health insurance \nfor their children. Think about when they go in and their employer \nsays: You know, we have this new requirement that we have to raise the \nminimum wage $2.10. But I will offer you 50 percent of your health care \npremium for your entire family, your wife and your children. It is \ngoing to be in place until your children get out of college. Maybe that \nwill give them an incentive to encourage those kids to graduate from \nhigh school and to consider higher education as part of their future.\n  Six out of ten uninsured individuals have at least one family member \nworking full time year-round. This is a huge population we are talking \nabout affecting with this amendment. In 2002, 42 percent of wage and \nsalary workers, age 18 to 64, were not offered health coverage through \ntheir employers. Here is a tremendous opportunity, as we do something \nthat I have said I will support, and I doubt it will receive very many \nvotes in opposition--here is an opportunity for the Congress to \nsignificantly affect the uninsured. But I remind everybody, we are not \ngoing to have an opportunity to vote on this amendment. It is so timely \nthat I would come to the floor, I would wait my turn to talk about an \namendment that I couldn't talk about the other day because the \nleadership was in a hurry. So I called up my amendment so it would be \npending--pending means that it should get a vote before cloture would \nbe filed--only to find out from the majority leader when he stood, I \nthink he referred to my amendment as ``silly.''\n  I don't think it is silly. It may be non-germane, but the health \ninsurance of minimum wage workers is not silly. As a matter of fact, it \nis crucial to the health care change that we have to accomplish in this \ncountry if, in fact, we are going to keep health care affordable for \nall Americans, not just some Americans.\n  Let me talk about employers and employees. I believe my amendment is \na win-win. I challenge any Member of the Senate to tell me who loses. \nThink about it. An employer is able to negotiate for minimum wage \nworkers at the group rate which means he might be able to negotiate, \nbecause he is putting more people in the pool, an even lower cost for \nhis overall workforce than he had before. He is able to offer his \nemployees health care which his competitor might not. His employees \nhave a tendency, then, to stay with him longer because we all know that \nthere is a cost that is incurred by an employer, an investment to train \nthem, an investment to have them in the business. And the last thing \nthey want to do is see minimum wage workers that work a month or 2 or 6 \nmonths and keep moving from employer to employer. And by the way, the \none thing they don't have control over as an employer is the days that \nemployees call in because they are sick. Those are days that the \nemployer is planning on getting something done. That minimum wage \nworker, because they are now sick, picks up the phone and says: I can't \nbe there.\n  Maybe if we get them covered by insurance, maybe if they actually go \nfor prevention and wellness education, maybe if they learn through that \nhealth relationship the things they should do and should not do, maybe \nthey are not going to be picking up the phone and calling in and \nsaying: I will not be there.\n  The employers lose on those days, but the employees lose on those \ndays, too, because this is a minimum wage worker. They are paid by the \nhour. They are only paid when they are there. Provide them health care, \nenable them not to make that phone call, the employer doesn't have a \ndisruption in his business, and the employee doesn't have a subtraction \nin his paycheck. This is truly a win-win for employees and employers.\n  Employers will spend less time and less money overall by providing \nthe $2.10 increase in health benefits. Let me restate that. Employers \nwill spend less money overall by providing it in health benefits. Why? \nBecause they buy in bulk. What does that mean? It is more bang for the \nbuck. They are able to get more benefit for a smaller amount of \ndollars. That means that when they go and negotiate the structure of a \nplan, they could negotiate something that had an even richer benefit, \nmaybe no out-of-pocket cost, maybe no copayment for drugs because they \nhave another $500 there with which they can negotiate. Employers get \nthe same deduction in calculating taxable income, if they provide \ncompensation in the form of health benefits or compensation in the form \nof wages and salaries.\n  We all know because we have gone through part of the debate that when \nemployers and employees are covered by health insurance, that is done \nwith pretax wages.\n  My point is, the tax implication on the minimum wage worker does not \ngo up. They get the same advantage that we have, that their health \nbenefits are not only deductible for the employer, but they can access \nsome pretax dollars to do it.\n  To deny a vote on this amendment is to not give minimum wage workers \nthe same thing we have. Sure, there is a discrepancy in the difference \nthat you make and I make and they make, but now we are talking about \nfairness from the standpoint of benefits. We have an opportunity to \nchange that. And because we are in such a hurry in the Senate and \nbecause the majority leader is tired of people offering amendments--I \nthink all of them have merit. I haven't seen any that I thought were \nfor the purposes of delay. As a matter of fact, I would be for moving \nto wrap up this bill tomorrow if the majority leader would say I could \nhave a vote on this amendment. He is not going to give me a vote. You \ncan use the Senate rules to make sure that votes don't happen. And \nmaybe I could have designed this in a way that it was germane. But \nsometimes the best things are simple. Sometimes when you lay it out in \na way that people across the country, especially minimum wage workers, \nunderstand, it is better for them. We could hide it and make it \nconfusing and make it to where employers possibly couldn't provide \neverything that they could. But we decided to leave it simple.\n  What might be another objection to this bill? Well, can employers \ntruly implement this process. Let me go to another chart. I think you \nhave heard me say most of this except for the last one: Some coverage \nis better than no coverage. Will every employer get it right? Probably \nnot. Will every employer get as much bang for the buck as they possibly \ncan? Maybe not. Some coverage is better than no coverage. You have \nheard the percentages about the population that are at the income \nlevels that minimum wage workers are. If you only believed that this \namendment would provide some coverage, then you have to agree with me \nthat is better than no coverage.\n\n  Under our current health care system, employees will be better off \nwith health care coverage through their employers because employers get \nbetter pricing. If they don't or they can't, then I know what is going \nto happen. They are going to offer it in wages. But should we deny them \nthe opportunity to try to help us solve part of the health care problem \nthat we have in America, and that is the uninsured that are here?\n  I said earlier that I thought all Americans had a stake in this \namendment because it is their health care premium that is affected by \nevery health care policy we take up. When we add additional mandates \nfor coverage, we drive up premium costs. When the American people \nexercise, watch what they eat, they help us to moderate health care \ncosts and premium costs. Health insurance, even the most basic health \ninsurance, gives people access to a system of health care, that \nrelationship with a health care professional, that primary care doctor, \nthe prevention and wellness programs, routine testing for chronic \ndiseases that keep them out of a hospital.\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\n  I want to relate a story. I won't mention the company. Well, I will \nmention the company: Dell computers. I think it is important that you \nunderstand that they are in one of the most competitive industries in \nthe world. I daresay I don't think anybody is going to wake up tomorrow \nand say: I think I will get into computer manufacturing because there \nis so much money to be made. Everybody globally is in computer assembly \nand manufacturing. Dell does it the best. I don't say that just because \nthey have a plant in North Carolina. I say it because the experts say \nthat.\n  I might also say, since Lenovo has a plant in North Carolina, they do \na pretty good job, too. But Dell recognized one day that if they wanted \nto be competitive in this highly competitive industry of computers, \nthey had to do something about health care. They were self-insured. \nThey had already taken the first step. They assumed a lot of the risk \nas a company to drive down the cost of their health care for employees \nand, consequently, for the company. What did Dell find out?\n  Dell tried to make available prevention tools for their employees. If \nthey were overweight, they would give them a dietician to work with \nthem. If they had diabetes, they would give them somebody who could \ncounsel them about diabetes. If they smoked, they paid for a cessation \nprogram. What happened? Less than 10 percent of the Dell employees who \nwere affected by these things took advantage of the program. Less than \n10 percent of them signed up to receive the help.\n  Any other corporation in America might have said: I will just accept \nthe fact that we are going to have this high health insurance. But Dell \nrealized: We are still making computers. And if we can't fix this, we \nare not going to be competitive.\n  What did they do? Dell offered employees up to $250 cash if they \nwould sign up for the program. I will tell my colleagues, the American \npeople respond to money. They do respond to money. All of a sudden, the \nenrollment in these plans went sky high. Today, some 5 or 6 years later \nDell computers can prove that they save about $1,700 for every employee \nwho goes into that program. Those numbers may have changed since the \nlast time I met with them.\n  My point is this: Everywhere we looked--private sector, public, \nindividual, group--where we have been brave enough to go out and do it \ndifferently, where we have been brave enough to force prevention and \nwellness into the system, it works. It works for the employee and for \nthe employer. It is job security because they are more competitive. And \nevery American receives the benefit of it because there is less cost \nshift in the system.\n  Let me bring it back to where we are. All Americans should have \nhealth coverage. We have this unique opportunity, as we debate the \nopportunity for minimum wage workers to receive a $2.10 raise over a \nperiod of time, to give the option to every employer to provide that \n$2.10 increase in health care benefits versus in wages. And the Kaiser \nFoundation's health research proves that, for an individual, regardless \nof whether it is traditional fee-for-service insurance, point-of-\nservice, or health maintenance organization, that $4,368 a year pays \n100 percent of the premium cost for that minimum wage worker, which is \na higher percentage than a Member of the Senate is paid for by the \nFederal Government. That means a minimum wage worker is not required, \nsuch as I am, to pay 25 percent of their health care cost, but they \nwould get 100 percent. If, in fact, their family is uninsured, which \nthe majority of them are, the Kaiser Family Foundation says the average \nfor family coverage--wife, kids, unlimited--that an employer for a \nminimum wage worker can provide is almost 50 percent of the premium \ncost.\n\n  This is a tremendous opportunity, from a standpoint of health care \npolicy, that I so hope we are not going to miss the opportunity to do. \nBut if my colleagues on both sides of the aisle allow debate to be shut \ndown without an agreement from the majority leader that he is going to \nallow a vote--the only reason I can see not to have a vote is because \nnobody has figured out how to put a second-degree amendment on it. It \nis too simple. Procedurally, if they can kill it, they would.\n  In North Carolina, Mr. President, there are 1.3 million uninsured \nindividuals; 17 percent of my State's population is uninsured, compared \nto the national average of 16 percent. So, listen, I feel bad. I wish \nto see North Carolina do better. As a matter of fact, we have probably \nmore waivers in health care than any State in the country right now, \nfrom Medicaid to the soon-to-be dual eligibles under Medicare because \nwe are trying to lower the costs for everybody by being creative as to \nhow we do it. I will tell you this: In North Carolina, the centerpiece \nof our success is two words: Prevention and wellness. When we are able \nto establish a relationship with a health care professional, we now \nhave an opportunity to bring prevention and wellness into every \nperson's health care regimen. I am convinced this is absolutely crucial \nto the future of health care in this country and to the affordability \nof health care for the future.\n  Eight hundred and ninety eight thousand uninsured individuals and \nfamilies are on their own with one full-time worker in North Carolina. \nSo when I said 1.3 million uninsured, understand that almost 900,000 of \nthem are in families--families who could get 50 percent of their \npremium paid for by their employer, if we gave the employer the option \nof providing health care versus being forced only to provide wages.\n  In North Carolina, we have 204,360 uninsured part-time workers. That \nmeans they are not going to work 40 hours. So maybe they are only going \nto work 20 hours, and instead of getting $4,368, they are going to get \na little over $2,000. Well, even those part-time workers--uninsured \npart-time workers--if they are earning minimum wage under this program, \nas much as 50 or 60 percent of the premium of their health care could \nbe paid for. So it is not limited to full-time workers.\n  It is too simple. It is way too simple. Everybody in the country gets \nit. Why doesn't the Senate get it? How can anybody look at this and say \nwe should not do it? It is easy. The Senate rules allow you to not have \na vote. I am not trying to delay; I am trying to make the bill better. \nI am trying to learn from what we are learning all across the country--\nthat there are smart people outside Washington who are in companies, in \nStates, who are involved in the health care system, and we have a real \nopportunity to take what they have been telling us and apply it to the \nmost at-risk group of Americans, which are the minimum wage workers.\n  I have always shrugged it off when somebody came up to me and said: \nGee, do you guys ever listen in Washington? Do you pay attention to \nwhat is going on? Because I thought we did. I do. But, you know, what I \nam learning today is that ``we'' don't. You cannot come on the floor of \nthe Senate day after day and talk about the uninsured population and \nhow we have an obligation to take care of it, and here is a real \nopportunity to do it--and what is the majority's answer? We are not \ngoing to let you vote because we think you are trying to delay.\n  I am not trying to delay, I say to the majority leader; I am trying \nto provide health care for minimum wage workers--for maybe 14.6 million \npeople in this country. You know, the sad part is, even if I get this \ndone, there are still 30 million Americans who are uninsured. Maybe the \nfear is that it will work. Maybe they will find out that when these \nguys get insurance, they are no longer going to be sick. Maybe they are \nworried we are going to find out that if they are not sick, our \ninsurance will go down and every American's insurance will go down.\n  Health care continuously ranks as one of the top issues in this \ncountry. I have devoted 13 years now to understanding health care to \nthe degree that I feel like I can walk into an operating room and do a \nprocedure, even without staying at a Holiday Inn Express. But, you \nknow, we are not listening to them. We are not listening to doctors, \nnurses, community health centers or rural health clinics. And I can \ntell you this: We are not listening to the American people. We are not \ndoing what we can to provide the opportunity for health care coverage \nto be extended to them. Do you know what? People with high health care \ncosts, in the absence of having to spend that on health care, are not \ngoing to spend it in other areas. It is those other areas that create \njobs. It is the groceries, it is the\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\ngas, those things they pick up on the way home to eat that fuels our \nrestaurants.\n  If you want to have good balance and growth in the economy, if you \nwant Americans to be at work, if you want this country to prosper, this \nis a piece of it. This is a piece to make sure Americans have health \ncare coverage. I am confident this is not the last time we are going to \nhave this debate this year. We will have a debate, and it will actually \nbe considered germane. I have wondered for the time I sat and listened \nto the majority leader, what will be the excuse then? Maybe it is \nbecause it wasn't their idea. Maybe it is because they would like to \nwrap it into something bigger.\n\n  Well, as I said, 13 years after I have worked on health care--and I \nsee my colleague from Iowa and I know he wants to speak, and I will \nwrap up, and I don't know anybody who has devoted much more to health \ncare than he has. This is a real opportunity, Mr. President. It is an \nopportunity for the Senate to actually do something on health care \nversus sitting on the floor and talking about it. As it stands right \nnow, this opportunity for minimum wage workers in America will not \nhappen because the Senate will be denied the opportunity to vote as to \nwhether they would like this to be part of the plan. Again, I am sure \nit is difficult for America to believe that this is not germane to the \nminimum wage bill, as it was to me. But I am not here to battle the \ninterpretation of the Parliamentarian; I am here to suggest to you that \none of the reasons we are here is we are supposed to do what is right. \nWe are supposed to pay attention to what is going on across the \ncountry, and we are supposed to do what is right to fix it.\n  I ask you to think that I am doing something right today. I could \nwalk away having a vote where I didn't win. But not getting the \nopportunity to have a vote cheats America out of the opportunity to \nbegin to turn around our health care system. I hope that between now \nand Tuesday with the cloture vote, Members on both sides of the aisle \nwill have an opportunity to look at this vote and to encourage the \nmajority leader to allow us to have a vote and, if not, to encourage \nhim to vitiate the cloture vote and allow us to talk some more.\n  This is important. We ought to spend time talking about major policy \nshifts. For the 10 years I spent in the House of Representatives, I \ndreamed of the fact that I could come to this floor, with the \ntremendous thought and debate that goes into the work here--I am not \ngoing to tell you I am disillusioned, but I can tell you this: To take \nsomething of this importance and to suggest we are not going to vote on \nit, or to suggest that when we are talking about ways we can improve a \nbill, we haven't got time to sit and debate this, that is not the \nSenate I envisioned before I got here.\n  That is not the deliberative process, the open and balanced and \nthoughtful Senate I used to see from the other end of the Capitol. It \nis my hope that, as we move forward, we will be allowed the opportunity \nto debate this more. Hopefully, we will be allowed to vote up or down \non it. As I said, if I lose, I will save the debate for another day and \nanother bill. We are going to have an opportunity to debate health \ncare, I know. We are going to find more things to agree on than we \ndisagree on. I never envisioned the Senate saying that because this is \na tough vote we are not going to take it.\n  This vote is not near as tough as the fact that 14 million Americans, \nwho are, in all likelihood, minimum wage workers, could have the option \nof health care if we did this and are not going to have health care if \nwe don't vote. That is not silly, and it is not a delaying tactic; it \nis policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Carolina for \nhis timely speech. He knows what I mean by that. I didn't hear all of \nhis remarks, but I did catch the tail end of them, and I think I get \nthe import of his remarks, which is basically that we need to do \nsomething about health care in America. We need to debate it, discuss \nit, vote on it. But to the extent somehow some kind of blame is being \nlaid at the step of those of us on this side of the aisle--after all, \nwe just took over the Senate about 3 weeks ago--I remind my friend from \nNorth Carolina that his party has been in charge for the last several \nyears, and they have had the White House. We haven't seen anything come \nfrom the White House, nor have we seen anything come out of the \nCongress to deal with this over the last several years.\n  Be that as it may, I say to my friend from North Carolina, the \nPresident put forward a proposal in his State of the Union Message. We \nwill see what the budget looks like when it comes down next week. I \njoin with him. I hope we will have a good debate and discussion. It is \nthe most important issue we have confronting our society today. But it \nis not just, I say to my friend from North Carolina, the issue of how \nwe pay the bills and how we pay for people who get sick. The issue is \npreventive medicine. How do we make prevention pay? How do we make \nprevention the incentive? How do we incentivize prevention?\n  I noticed a full-page ad in the Washington Post this week and also in \nthe New York Times talking about prevention is the answer. If we really \nwant to get a handle on cutting down the cost of health care in \nAmerica, just jiggling how you pay the bills is not going to be the \nanswer. We have to get in front of this issue and make an incentive for \npeople to live a healthier lifestyle, for businesses to provide \nworkplace settings that are healthy, helping to make sure people get \ntheir physicals, annual checkups, mammogram screenings, cutting down on \nsmoking, making sure that our schools also teach kids at the earliest \nage what it means to stay healthy. We are building elementary schools \nin America now without playgrounds. What kind of nonsense is that?\n  So our whole thrust on this health care issue, I say to my friend \nfrom North Carolina, we always just keep focusing on how we are going \nto pay the bills. That is a problem, obviously, but if we want to get \nout ahead of it, we have to start focusing on preventive medicine. I \nlook forward to that debate hopefully soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1252-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1252-S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about \nthe issue that has been in front of us all week--I assume it is going \nto be coming to a close early next week--and that is the debate and \nvote on whether we are going to increase the Federal minimum wage.\n  I regret that previous Congresses have blocked any increase in the \nminimum wage. The Senate has rejected 11 attempts to raise the minimum \nwage since 1998--11 times. Last year, we had 52 Senators vote in favor \nof it, but we didn't have the 60 Senators to invoke cloture and get to \na final vote.\n  Scores of religious and antipoverty groups have called on Congress \ntime and again to recognize the basic principle that Americans who work \nfull time and play by the rules should not be consigned to poverty.\n  In 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr., said:\n\n       We know of no more crucial civil rights issue facing \n     Congress today than the need to increase the Federal minimum \n     wage and extend its coverage. . . . A living wage should be \n     the right of all working Americans.\n\n  I join with Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and say it ought to be a \nright. According to the Congressional Research Service, the real value \nof the minimum wage today, if it had the same purchasing power as it \ndid in 1968, the year Dr. King was so tragically assassinated, if the \nminimum wage had the same purchasing power today, the minimum wage \nwould be $9.19 an hour. What are we talking about increasing it to? We \nare talking about increasing it to $7.25 an hour. But at least with the \nearned-income tax credit, which is new since that time, food stamps--we \nhad food stamps then also, perhaps a little more generous now--that \n$7.25 an hour would at least get a family of four above the poverty \nline, and that would be a historic achievement for our Nation.\n  It is simply immoral to tell working Americans that they ought to try \nto provide for their family's needs on $5.15 an hour. My colleagues and \nI who offered this bill respect work, we value work, including the most \nhumble type of work. That is why we fought for years to try to ensure \nthe minimum wage kept pace with inflation and updated periodically. But \nfor 10 years, the\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nleadership has blocked us from increasing it.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nwhich instituted the minimum wage in 1938, one of the primary aims as \nenuciated by Franklin Roosevelt was alleviating poverty. Yet now the \nminimum wage condemns workers to a life of poverty for themselves and \ntheir children no matter how hard they work.\n  Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earn \nabout $10,712. That is $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree. The current minimum wage would not even keep a single person and \none child above the poverty line.\n  The inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage has declined by 20 \npercent since the last increase in 1997. I point out that since that \ntime, Congress has raised its pay eight times, $31,600.\n  Several of our colleagues have suggested all we have to do is \nincrease the earned-income tax credit and that would address it. I am a \nsupporter of the EITC, the earned-income tax credit. It makes a major \ndifference for millions of Americans in poverty, but I don't see it as \neither/or. You make the earned-income tax credit and the minimum wage \ngo hand in hand, and that really does alleviate poverty. There are a \nlot of people working in minimum wage jobs who don't understand the \nearned-income tax credit. Their employers may not inform them of it. \nThey may or may not get a mailing. Maybe they can read it, maybe they \ncan't. Possibly no one may inform them of it and they pass it by. That \nis why we have to raise their pay.\n\n  There is another aspect. It is saying to someone: We value your work. \nYour work is valuable, whether you are cleaning a hotel room, sweeping \nup, waiting tables. No matter what it is, your work is valuable.\n  When we erode people's pride in their work, we also erode their sense \nthat they are a valuable, contributing member of our society.\n  Those who suggest we just expand the EITC seem to be the same ones \nwho say how great the economy was last year. The economy was pretty \ngood last year for those in the top brackets. It is said that a strong \neconomy is a rising tide that lifts all boats. What if you don't own a \nboat? Shouldn't those at the very bottom also get a raise? Shouldn't a \ncollege kid working part time, who is technically not counted as living \nin poverty, get a raise to help pay for textbooks? Why is their hard \nwork valued at less than one-third of the median wage?\n  We have heard the outrageous suggestion that a rise in the minimum \nwage is somehow a threat to the economy. That is nonsense. Just before \nsigning the Fair Labor Standards Act, here is what President Franklin \nRoosevelt said. You can almost hear the echoes of his voice:\n\n       Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of \n     $1,000 a day tell you that a wage of $11 a week is going to \n     have a disastrous effect on all American industry.\n\n  Today, the average CEO makes a whopping 821 times more than a worker \non minimum wage. That is what this chart shows. Back in 1965, 1968, it \nwas about 51, 54--the average CEO made about 50 times more than a \nminimum wage worker. Today it is 821 times more. That means that the \naverage CEO makes more on one day before lunch than a minimum wage \nworker makes all year.\n  I remind my colleagues that corporate profits increased more than 21 \npercent in 2000 and reached a 40-year high. Yet the minimum wage is at \na 50-year low. As a result, people who work for profitable companies \nmaking the minimum wage, what happens? They are forced to use public \nhealth care. They are forced to get food stamps, another taxpayer-\nfunded assistance, to make ends meet. So are we subsidizing the huge \nprofits that these companies are making, which then turn around and pay \ntheir CEOs 821 times more than the minimum wage worker because we are \ntaking tax dollars from the middle class and helping to pay for their \nfood stamps, health care, and other needs?\n  Some business groups argue that raising the minimum wage would mean \nthat some jobs would be eliminated. In the absence of Federal \nleadership on the minimum wage, many States have taken it upon \nthemselves to raise the minimum wage. Currently, 30 States, the Virgin \nIslands, the District of Columbia, and, I might add, my own State of \nIowa have a minimum wage higher than the Federal minimum of $5.15 an \nhour. Do you know what. It didn't hurt any of those States.\n  The Fiscal Policy Institute has studied what happens to small \nbusinesses and job growth right after the minimum wage is increased. \nThat is what this chart shows. It shows States that have higher minimum \nwages and those that don't. Then we see the growth rates. There is not \nmuch difference. Both are about the same. So it doesn't hurt growth, \nbusiness growth, or anything else.\n  People say: How can that be if they pay a higher minimum wage? How \ncan their growth be the same or sometimes greater than a State that \npays less in minimum wage? It is very simple. People who make a decent \nwage work harder when they get a good night's sleep. If they are \nworking two jobs or have a sick kid at home, they may not get a good \nnight's sleep, and they can't be as attentive to their job. If they \nsleep in a well-heated apartment instead of a cold flat, when they are \nable to eat decently and have a good nutritious meal a couple of times \na day, they can be more productive. When they can get health care for \nan abscessed tooth that is driving them nuts rather than going to work \nand not being attentive to their job, they can be more productive. So \nwhen workers earn more money, they contribute more to society, and \neverybody wins.\n  Our failure to raise the minimum wage is more than an economic \nfailure. It is a failure of democracy. Again, we live in a society \nwhere we can afford to raise the minimum wage. We can afford to have a \nbasic standard of living for anyone willing to work for it. Yet we fail \nto insist, as Martin Luther King, Jr., said, on this basic right.\n  Unfortunately, it is hard to get people who earn the minimum wage to \ncome here and lobby for it. They can't afford the time off, much less \nthe airfare or even the gas to get here. Think about this: A worker \nmaking minimum wage can buy 2 gallons of gasoline for an hour of \nlabor--an hour of her labor. I say ``her'' because 59 percent of \nworkers who earn the minimum wage are women.\n  But even people who won't directly benefit from this legislation \noverwhelmingly support it. A recent AP poll found that 80 percent of \nAmericans of all income levels favor raising the minimum wage.\n  This country desperately needs this increase. With declining \nemployer-sponsored health care, the demise of other benefits, including \npension benefits, with dramatic costs and other costs of living--\nhousing, for example--workers have to pay for more with less.\n  The National Low Income Housing Coalition has calculated that the \nnational housing wage--that is the hourly wage needed to pay fair \nmarket rent for a two-bedroom apartment--was $15.78 an hour in 2005. In \nother words, the average for a two-bedroom apartment, $15.78 an hour, \nwas the minimum one needed to actually pay for rent and to provide food \nand other needs for a family. That is about triple the current minimum \nwage.\n\n  Economists are all saying that we have to raise it, we should raise \nit. They know it will improve the lives of working Americans without \nincreasing inflation or unemployment. But the average American doesn't \nneed to hear from Nobel Prize-winning economists to understand the \nbasic principle that people who work hard and play by the rules ought \nto be able to feed their kids, house them, and give them a good \neducation. It is really basic fairness, and it is fundamental economic \nmorality.\n  America should not be a nation that favors the powerful and well-\nconnected at the expense of low-income workers and their families. It \nis time to do right by the least fortunate among us. It is time to \nvalue and honor the work of those at the bottom of the income scale. \nAfter 10 long years, it is time to raise the minimum wage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/26/senate-section/article/S1253-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 29, 2007, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
