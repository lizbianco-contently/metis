Mr. President, this morning after morning business, we \nwill resume consideration of the Defense authorization bill. This is an \nannual bill that comes before us relating to the Department of Defense \nand the conduct of America's national defense. It is an important bill \nmade more important this year because the focus of debate at this \nmoment is on the war in Iraq.\n  We understand this is an issue that is on the minds of most \nAmericans. We also understand that this is a body, the Senate, where we \nrepresent the people of this country. I believe the debate should be an \nopen debate, one that gives opportunity for both points of view to be \nexpressed. I also believe that at the end of the debate on the central \nissue of the war in Iraq, we should take a majority vote and decide \nwhat the Senate stands for when it comes to our policy.\n  Those who stand for the President's position can oppose the Levin-\nReed amendment, which is pending and is going to be considered soon. It \nis an amendment which establishes a timetable for American troops to \nstart coming home. It is a timetable for ending this war responsibly, \nending our combat role by the spring of next year. It is the only \namendment pending which is specific and will change the policy and \ndirection in Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, the procedural issues ahead of us are very \ncomplicated. The Senate Republican leader, Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, \nhas insisted that instead of a majority vote on the war in Iraq, it \nwill be necessary to have 60 votes. I think that is unfortunate.\n  Last year, during the course of debating the Defense authorization \nbill, there were two major amendments related to the war in Iraq. Both \nof those amendments were considered and held to a majority vote \nstandard. Earlier this year, on the supplemental appropriations bill \nfor the war in Iraq, another question came up about change in policy--\nagain, a majority vote. But things have changed. Since that time, at \nleast three Republican Senators have stepped forward and said they \ndisagree with the President's policy and will vote to change the \ndirection of this war. Because of that, it is clear we have a majority \nsupporting this change in direction.\n  Now the Republican leader insists on 60 votes, insists on \nfilibustering the amendment that is before the Senate. He is trying to \nstop the debate on whether we will change direction in Iraq. As a \nresult, we are going to have an unusual session of this Senate which \nwill commence shortly and run around the clock until tomorrow morning, \nwhen we will face a cloture vote. A cloture vote is an opportunity for \nSenators to step forward and say whether they truly want a change in \nthe policy of this war. The Republican minority has insisted on this \n60-vote threshold, knowing it is more difficult to reach, but we \nhaven't given up. We believe that with the three Republican Senators \nwho have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the President's \npolicy, others may join. We know that Republican Senators back in their\n\n[[Page S9294]]\n\nhome States have said publicly and repeatedly they want to vote to \nchange policy. They will have that chance on the Levin-Reed amendment, \nwhich will be brought up for a cloture vote tomorrow morning.\n  This session, which we will now commence, is not likely to end during \nthe next 24 hours. During that period of time, it is an opportunity and \nan invitation for Members of the Senate to come to the floor and \nexpress their feelings about this war in Iraq. For those who support \nthe President's position and want to continue along this present \ncourse, they have their chance. For those on both sides of the aisle \nwho believe we ought to bring this war to an end, they also have their \nopportunity.\n  It is unfortunate the Republican minority has insisted on this \nprocedural obstacle, has insisted on filibustering this amendment, and \nis trying to stop us from getting to the heart of the issue about \nchanging this policy in Iraq. But the American people know this, and \nthey know that those who are doing their best to protect the President, \nprotect him politically, protect his position, are going to be well \nknown across this country at the end of this debate.\n  I hope those who agree with us on the Democratic side and the three \nRepublicans who join us will come together with us and dramatically \nchange this policy, change this war in Iraq, and bring it to an end \nresponsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9294-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, listening to my good friend from \nIllinois, the majority whip, discussing the 60-vote threshold reminds \nme of what the majority leader said back on January 30, 2007:\n\n       Sixty votes are required for just about everything. I have \n     talked with Senator McConnell about this. You know we have to \n     come up with a number of resolutions that require 60 votes \n     because, as you know in the Senate, a lot of times 60 votes \n     are required for just about everything.\n\n  Now, that is life in the Senate. On the Defense authorization bill, \nwe had two amendments last year, the Kennedy and Enzi amendments, and \nboth required 60 votes. We are happy to have this debate tonight. It is \nmy understanding the other side last evening agreed to accept the \nCornyn amendment to the Defense authorization bill. As we indicated, we \nhave a request for a rollcall vote on that amendment. However, we will \nbe happy to schedule that vote at a reasonable time today. I am told--\nand we heard again--that we plan to be here this evening leading up to \nthe cloture vote on the Levin amendment, and we would be happy to have \nthat vote today. There is no particular reason to have the Levin-Reed \nvote tomorrow; we could have it today.\n  But look, it is perfectly fine with us to stay here today and this \nevening to discuss this very important issue. I couldn't agree with my \nfriend from Illinois more that it is the significant issue in the \ncountry at this particular juncture. We will be prepared to work with \nthe majority whip and the majority leader to work out a floor schedule \nthat allows us to rotate back and forth on a regular basis throughout \nthe afternoon and the evening, and we look forward to working that out \nin a way that is fair to both sides and gives us ample opportunity for \na vigorous debate about this extremely important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9294-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the statement made by the \nRepublican leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn amendment be \nscheduled for a vote at 2:15 and that it be a majority vote and that \nSenator McConnell can withdraw his amendment, which is currently \npending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nCornyn is in a hearing this morning, so we would want to provide a \nlittle bit of time for him this afternoon, but I think we should be \nable to work this out shortly. We would pursue a discussion with the \nfloor staff and see if we can't lock this in. There is no particular \nreason why we couldn't work this out. For the moment, I object. Maybe \nthe vote could occur at 2:45. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I amend my unanimous consent request to \n2:45, with the time equally divided between 2:15 and 2:45, and that the \nCornyn amendment will then be called for a vote, with the standard of \nthe majority as to whether it passes or fails.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. And no second-degree amendments, I might add, and the \nMcConnell amendment withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, could we state the \nconsent request again?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can try. It is that the debate will commence at 2:15 on \nthe Cornyn amendment, with the time equally divided for 30 minutes; at \n2:45 the Cornyn amendment will be called for consideration--for a \nvote--with no second-degree amendments; that the vote standard for \npassage of the Cornyn amendment will be a majority vote; and that \nSenator McConnell will withdraw his pending amendment. I think that is \nthe sum and substance of it. The McConnell cloture motion would be \nwithdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to say in response to the \nRepublican minority leader, he found two amendments where we required a \n60-vote margin on the last Defense authorization bill. Those two \namendments did not relate to the Defense authorization bill. They were \nminimum-wage amendments. They required budget points of order. The \nSenator from Kentucky has been unable to find an Iraq amendment raised \nin the Defense authorization bill nor in the supplemental \nappropriations bill which required this extraordinary majority.\n  Now the Republican leader has agreed to a majority vote on the Cornyn \namendment, something we offered yesterday. Now we are asking that \nduring the course of this debate, I hope he will reconsider his \nposition on the Levin-Reed amendment. This too should be a majority \nvote, an up-or-down vote. What is so frightening on the Republican side \nof the aisle to face a majority vote?\n  We know an overwhelming majority of the American people want to \nchange this policy in Iraq. Yet the Republicans have insisted that when \nit comes to the key amendment--the Levin-Reed amendment, which will \nactually bring our troops home and end this war responsibly--in that \nsituation, they want an exceptional majority, 60 votes, to be \nconsidered. Well, we are going to debate that and we are going to \ndebate it long and hard between now and 24 hours from now. The Senate \nwill be in a rare all-night session. Some of the critics of this all-\nnight session have said that it is an effort to get some publicity. \nWell, if they are arguing that it is an effort to get the attention of \nthe American people, they are right because the American people want us \nto debate this honestly and openly.\n  I happen to believe as well that the Senate spending a sleepless \nnight is no great sacrifice. Soldiers and the families who pray for \nthem spend many sleepless nights. It is time for the Senate to do the \nsame. It is time for us to come to the floor and express what is in our \nhearts about this war--a war that has claimed over 3,611 American \nlives; a war which has cost us 30,000 injuries, 10,000 of them severe \ninjuries, including amputations, traumatic brain injuries, and severe \nburns; a war that has cost this Nation over $500 billion and costs us \nmore than $12 billion a month. Is it worth one night of lost sleep to \ndiscuss and debate that? You bet it is. That is why we are here. That \nis what the Senate is all about.\n  I hope the Republican minority leader, Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, \nhaving agreed to a majority vote on the\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\nCornyn amendment--a Republican amendment--will now give us a majority \nvote, an up-or-down vote, on the Levin-Reed amendment. I don't \nunderstand why he would agree to one standard for one Iraq amendment \nand then insist on a higher standard for a Democratic Iraq amendment. I \nthink most Americans can see through that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9295-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nBroadcast Freedom Act, which I offered along with my friends from \nMinnesota and South Dakota, Senators Coleman and Thune. Some would say \nthat the fairness doctrine is the perfect example of a regulation whose \ntime has past. Others would say it is a regulation that was never \nnecessary to begin with. In any event, it is certainly not a regulation \nthat we need today. I think it is worth a brief recap of history of \nAmerican mass media to show how utterly silly this doctrine would be if \nreinstated in today's environment.\n  In 1949, the year the fairness doctrine was created, there were 51 \ntelevision stations in the United States. In 1985, when the doctrine \nwas repealed by the FCC, there were 1,200. Today, there are nearly \n1,800 television stations. The radio industry tells a similar story. In \n1949, there were about 2,500 radio stations in the United States. In \n1985, the number had grown to 9,800. Today, there are almost 14,000. \nThere was significant growth of these numbers between 1985 and today. \nWe need to understand why it is happening.\n  You see, it was in 1985 that the FCC said the following when it \nrepealed the fairness doctrine:\n\n       We believe that the interest of the public and viewpoint \n     diversity is fully served by the multiplicity of voices in \n     the marketplace today.\n\n  That was when we had far fewer radio and television stations. That \nstatement was made over 20 years ago. The number of voices in the \nmarket was plentiful then. In the last two decades, those numbers have \ngrown even larger--by 50 percent in television and over 40 percent in \nradio.\n  Keep in mind, too, that there was no Internet in 1985, and there was \nno satellite radio offering hundreds of channels nationwide. There was \nno digital television or radio allowing for multicasting. There were \nnot even wireless phones, much less ones that could go on line and even \ncarry video. Of course, nobody had yet heard of the podcast, blogging, \nor YouTube. All of this has now changed. It is easy to see that if the \nfairness doctrine was unnecessary in 1985 because of the multiplicity \nof voices, it is downright laughable today.\n  I also wish to speak to the fact that this doctrine, if reinstated, \nwould have the opposite effect that its opponents tell us they seek. \nThey say they want both sides of important issues presented with equal \ntime. Well, what happens if nobody is available or willing to offer an \nopposing viewpoint? The answer, clearly, is that the discussion will \nnot take place at all. And all the bureaucracy that is required to keep \ntrack of what someone said and what has to be responded to would cause \nmost of these stations not to deal with important issues at all.\n  Commercial radio and television are businesses. They are on the air \nonly as long as someone is willing to pay for advertising. Advertising \nis only attractive when someone is watching or listening. People watch \nor listen to things they find worth their time. If a radio or \ntelevision station is prevented from airing programming on public \nissues or is forced to carry programming that may not suit their \naudience, they will have a very difficult time retaining listeners, \nadvertisers, and ultimately their businesses. It is not in the public \ninterest for the Government to force content on or prevent content from \nreaching the American people. The FCC recognized that in 1985, and we \nshould all recognize it today.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the Broadcast Freedom \nAct, which prevents the FCC, now or in the future, from reinstating the \narcane and damaging so-called fairness doctrine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9295-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9295-S9296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EARMARK TRANSPARENCY\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak now about the \nongoing efforts in the Senate to block the earmark transparency rules.\n  It has now been 180 days since they were unanimously adopted by the \nSenate. Yet they still have not been formally enacted. Even worse, the \nmajority wants to take them behind closed doors, where a conference \ncommittee can kill them in secret. They tried to kill these reforms on \nthe Senate floor but failed. Now they are falling back to their plan B, \nwhich is to gut them in conference.\n  That is not how we should write a bill about openness, honesty, and \ntransparency. I hope my friends on the other side will change their \nminds. These are Senate rules I am talking about, and there is no \nreason why we need to negotiate with the House. The House already has \ntheir earmark transparency rules. My friends on the other side should \nstop blocking earmark reform and stop trying to change these rules in \nsecret so we can move on.\n  Americans have seen the ethical problems associated with earmarks. \nThey have watched what happened to Duke Cunningham, and they have seen \na number of Members of Congress forfeit their seats on appropriations \ncommittees due to conflicts of interest. Americans understand that \nlobbying and ethics reform will not be complete--in fact, it would be \nmeaningless--if we don't do something to shine the light on earmarks. \nLet me repeat this because I think it is very important. Americans do \nunderstand that ethics reform is not complete without meaningful \nearmark reform.\n  Many of the reforms in the ethics bill address what people outside of \nCongress can do, but earmark reform addresses what we here in Congress \ncan do. That is the difference. Americans want, more than anything \nelse, Congress to be restrained and open about what we do. They want us \nto reform the way we spend their money and shut down the secret \ncongressional favor factory. Nothing would do more to restore America's \nfaith in their Government than enacting reforms that ensure their \nelected officials are not going to use their ability to spend Federal \ndollars to enrich their friends and supporters.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to an article \nthat ran this morning in The Hill newspaper about earmarks--earmarks \nthat have not been properly disclosed. The majority likes to say they \nare complying with the rules, but that doesn't appear to be the case. \nThis story says:\n\n       As a proposal to require full disclosure of all Senate \n     earmarks languishes, Senators have not claimed responsibility \n     for at least $7.5 billion worth of projects approved by the \n     Appropriations Committee, according to an analysis by a \n     budget watchdog group.\n\n  Obviously, the piecemeal approach being used by the Democrats is not \nworking. We cannot allow appropriators and other committees to police \nthemselves. They are not doing it now, and they never will. We need a \nsingle enforcement rule for the whole Senate that doesn't keep \nloopholes for secret earmarking. Let me repeat: $7.5 billion in \nearmarks already this year are undisclosed. This is business as usual \nin the Senate.\n  I wish to point out that the Defense authorization bill we are \ndebating now violates the rules. It discloses the earmark sponsors, but \nthe committee failed to post on the Internet the letters from these \nsponsors certifying that they do not have a financial interest in the \nearmark they have requested.\n  Before I conclude, I want to update the Senate on some progress we \nare making on earmark reform.\n\n[[Page S9296]]\n\n  First, we have added several cosponsors to S. Res. 123, which is the \nearmark disclosure rule. They are Senators Ensign, Enzi, Martinez, \nCoburn, McCaskill, and Cornyn. I thank them for their support. Some of \nthese Senators request earmarks, while others do not. But they all \nsupport earmark disclosure, and they all support this rule as it is \nwritten right now.\n  We have also added a couple cosponsors to S. Res. 260, the rule that \nwould stop the adding of earmarks in secret conference committees. They \nare Senators Allard and Cornyn. I thank them for their support. A \nselect few Members of Congress and their staffs should not be adding \nhidden earmarks to bills in the middle of the night when no one has the \nopportunity to review them and debate their merits. That is very bad \npractice, and it must end.\n  There was also an important editorial last Tuesday in the Roll Call \nnewspaper that supports our efforts to protect earmark reform. I will \nread a couple of excerpts:\n\n       Senate Democratic leaders are resisting [Senator DeMint's] \n     move and are insisting on going to conference on the ethics \n     bill, although they have yet to explain why already agreed-\n     upon earmark rules can't be adopted immediately.\n       We don't oppose earmarks in principle. . . . But as events \n     last year amply demonstrated, earmarks can be a source of \n     rotten corruption. Full disclosure is crucial, and the Senate \n     ought to institute it forthwith.\n       We think that on the merits Senate leaders should accede to \n     DeMint so disclosure of spending requests is not delayed \n     until President Bush signs an ethics reform measure that \n     still has not even gone to a House-Senate conference.\n\n  Mr. President, the blogging community is watching what we are doing \nhere. Countless bloggers, including The Corner on National Review \nOnline, Instapundit.com, MichelleMalkin.com, the Sunlight Foundation, \nPorkbusters.com, RedState.com, and many others, have weighed in on the \nneed for the Senate to implement these earmark transparency rules now. \nI thank them for paying attention to this debate and working to hold us \nall accountable.\n  Finally, we have received letters of support from several important \ntaxpayer watchdog groups, including Americans for Prosperity and \nCitizens Against Government Waste. These groups know how important \nearmark reform is, and they believe it should be implemented \nimmediately.\n  These rules need to be adopted immediately. They should not be \nallowed to go to conference with the House where they can be changed at \nwill. They need to be enacted now before a single appropriations bill \ncomes to the Senate floor.\n  It has been 180 days since they were unanimously adopted by the \nSenate. I have asked consent to enact these rules four times, but the \nother side has blocked them each and every time. Today needs to be the \nday that this obstruction stops. Today needs to be the day we end the \nearmark business as usual in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9296-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. On behalf of the Senator from Oklahoma, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me speak for a minute about this \nlegislation. I understand Senator DeMint's need to object on behalf of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. This is legislation that has broad--I do \nmean broad--bipartisan support. It was passed out of the Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee on a unanimous vote. It now represents a \nvery broad compromise worked on with the administration and with all of \nthe members of the committee, both Republican and Democrat.\n  I will review very quickly what this bill does. As everybody knows, \nwhen Katrina hit, we had a terrible time getting small business \nassistance to the countless thousands of small businesses that were \nimpacted, not only in New Orleans but in Baton Rouge and across into \nMississippi, Alabama, and elsewhere, where there were many services \nbeing provided by other folks. A lot of small businesses were impacted.\n  We learned there was not an adequate capacity within the Small \nBusiness Administration to deliver this kind of assistance in a rapid \nway. So we have worked now, after a series of hearings and over the \ncourse of 2 years, to pull together the Small Business Disaster \nResponse and Loan Improvement Act. It does a number of things.\n  It creates a new elevated level of disaster declaration, referred to \nas catastrophic national disaster. That triggers nationwide economic \ninjury disaster loans for adversely affected small businesses.\n  In addition, it requires the SBA to create an expedited disaster \nassistance business loan program to provide businesses with expedited \naccess to short-term money.\n  A lot of the businesses in New Orleans could have survived and might \nhave survived or chosen to try to if there had been some bridge money \nor available working capital. But the absence of it forced a lot of \nthem to close their doors. If we can provide assistance in a timely \nfashion, obviously subject to the administration's approval--and there \nis discretion in the bill--we would have the ability to do a better \njob.\n  In addition, there are improvements to the existing loan program \nwhich have been written in the bill. There is improved agency \ncoordination and marketing. It directs the SBA to coordinate with FEMA \nin a more effective way. It directs the SBA to create a proactive \nmarketing plan to make the public aware of the disaster response \nservices.\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\n  In addition, it provides improved planning and oversight and directs \nthe SBA to update the hurricane response plan to address all future \ndisasters.\n  This is, as I say, with bipartisan support. I have a letter from the \nAdministrator of the SBA, Steve Preston. He writes saying:\n\n       I am writing to express my thanks for the efforts you and \n     your colleagues have made to work with the Small Business \n     Administration and to address the administration's concerns \n     with some of the provisions in S. 163, the Small Business \n     Disaster Response and Loan Improvement Act of 2007. At this \n     point, if amended by the Bond amendment--\n\nAnd that is what we just sought to do--\n\n     the administration has no objections to Senate passage of S. \n     163. However, the administration would consider a longer \n     extension of the authorization language in section 3 to avoid \n     the need for concern over unintended expiration of programs \n     and activities.\n\n  We would obviously love to do that. It appears there is one person in \nthe Senate, the Senator from Oklahoma, who is opposed to moving forward \nwith this legislation. As I say, there was a unanimous vote by our \ncommittee, which wants to see if we could achieve this disaster \nassistance. Nobody understands how critical this is more than the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, who has been fighting from the \nmoment Katrina hit to try to get this kind of disaster assistance.\n  I wish to ask the Senator if she would share with us her observations \nas to why this legislation is so critical and what specifically we have \ndone to address some of the concerns of those who had previously \nexpressed those concerns in order now to have a consensus about this \nlegislation. I ask the Senator from Louisiana if she would explain the \nsituation in New Orleans, not just then but now, and why this \nlegislation is so critical.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nI begin by saying that his leadership has been on point and so focused \nfor the last 2 years in trying to help lead his committee, with the \nsupport and cooperation of his ranking member, the Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, to move Congress to adopt this important legislation.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct that the SBA was one of several \nimportant Federal agencies that was caught flatfooted when Katrina and \nRita hit the gulf coast and subsequently when the Federal levee system \nfailed in multiple places, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows \nbecause he has walked through neighborhood after neighborhood, mile \nafter mile, having visited with business owners and homeowners who lost \neverything they had, that took them generations to build. The Senator \nknows very well that this particular administration was anemic and very \nslow in its response. In fact, the gentleman leading it at the time was \nnot the appropriate leader. To the President's credit, they have \nnominated and we have confirmed a new leader for the SBA.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts will agree with me that the \nDirector, Steve Preston, is making some very good and fundamental \nchanges. But there is just so much this administrator can do without \nCongress doing its job to give him the tools he needs to get the job \ndone.\n  Why this legislation is being held up by the Republican side I am not \nsure. It is very disappointing, not just to me but to the millions of \npeople who are affected and are still struggling, having lost \neverything or having at risk everything they own because we cannot seem \nto get legislation passed because of obstructionist tactics.\n  I repeat, this bill is supported not only by the Chair but by the \nranking member. In addition, both Senators from Louisiana are \ncosponsoring this bill, Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, who has \nexperienced the disasters of hurricanes in Florida, and Senator Johnny \nIsakson from Georgia, who also has experienced disasters. This is not a \nDemocratic bill being rammed down the Republican side of the aisle. \nThis is a good Government efficiency, effective measure to try to \nreform the SBA. But because of bureaucratic delays, because of the \ninadequacy of the current law, we were not able to help the 18,000 \nbusinesses that were destroyed, many of them--I would say 97 percent of \nthem--small businesses.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I together visited a cleaning \nbusiness for hospital bedding and other items that was--I cannot think \nof the name of the business, but the Senator from Massachusetts and I \nwalked throughout New Orleans East. This is one of hundreds of \nbusinesses that not only found themselves flooded, but when the waters \nreceded, the hospitals they had serviced had closed. So basically \nthrough no fault of their own, they were struggling as well. This \nlegislation will help them.\n  This is not only important to the gulf coast and to the 18,000 \nbusinesses, many of them small businesses, that need help and \nassistance, but it is for the future. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nsaying let this Federal Government do better. If we believe business is \nimportant, and we do, and if we believe small business is important, \nand it is, then let's at least have our response honed and tuned to the \npoint where if, God forbid, another huge disaster happens, we will be \nmuch more prepared than we were last time.\n  Our constituents depend on us to be responsive. I say to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, that is exactly what this bill does. I again thank \nhim for his leadership and express truly my outrage that this is being \nheld up for no apparent good reason at the expense of thousands of \nbusiness owners who are looking to us for help and support.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. She has \nbeen not only a terrific member of the committee but has represented to \nthe whole Senate countless numbers of times on the floor the plight of \nthose folks down in New Orleans and in the immediate surrounding area.\n  I wish to emphasize what she has said and what I said previously, and \nthat is this has been worked on now for 2 years in a bipartisan way. \nSenator Snowe, the ranking member, who was, incidentally, the Chair \nwhen we first began working on this legislation, has supported the \nefforts to try to make certain that we address these concerns. Other \nRepublican members of the committee have contributed significantly to \nthis effort. Senator Bond had concerns about the energy program. We \nhave addressed those concerns.\n  I hope we can move forward. We tried actually to reach out to \nwhatever opposition there is with respect to this bill. We are happy to \nsit down and address any legitimate concerns. But at this point, this \nis long overdue. We are into the hurricane season now, about a month \nand a half into it. Our predictors have been pretty accurate in these \npast years, and they are suggesting we are going to have a very \nsignificant number of named storms and maybe as many as 10 projected \nfull-blown hurricanes this year, with 13 to 17 named storms.\n  Last year, they hit the number of named storms and hurricanes, but we \nwere very lucky; they didn't blow into the shore and we didn't get hit. \nObviously, we cannot sit around and be lucky all the time. We cannot \nafford another Katrina-like response. There are specific actions this \nlegislation empowers the SBA to do to take steps proactively, to be in \na position to address the concerns of small businesses rapidly. In \naddition, this bill helps private lenders get in early on and be \nimmediately on the scene and assist in the process of providing those \nloans. So it streamlines that process.\n  I wish to comment on Senator Landrieu's reference to that cleaning \nplace we visited in East New Orleans. We made arrangements to go down \nand see that place because we knew it needed help. We had talked with \nthe CEO before going there. About a week and a half later, when we got \nthere, we went into this cleaning facility, which had been completely \nflooded, as the Senator said. They cleaned it out themselves. They \nworked diligently to get the equipment up and working, what they could. \nMuch of it was ruined and was going to have to be disposed of. But \nthese folks were working this place.\n  Since they were dependent on the services of hotels and others for \nthe work they did, they were at the time mostly doing the hospitals \nthat had reopened, and that was it. But the CEO was so despairing in \nthe span of that week and a half or so between our making the \nappointment and getting there that when we arrived, the CEO had left \nwith his family, taken off; that was it, he had enough, and left in \ncharge was one of the workers who was the ``acting CEO'' who was \ndesperately trying to hold onto this business.\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\n  When people are working like that and run into that kind of \ndesperation, we have to be able to look them in the eye and say we have \ndone everything possible. We put in place the mechanisms they pay for \nand that they have a right to expect will be there to assist in that \nkind of an emergency. That is what we are trying to do here, in a \nbipartisan way, to make certain we don't lose CEOs, lose jobs, lose \nworkers, and lose hope as a consequence of our inaction in the \nSenate. So I hope we are going to be able to come back to this in short \norder. As I say, I think we have worked in good faith with every \nlegitimate question that has been raised with respect to this \nlegislation. We will happily sit down if another Senator still has a \nconcern, but we certainly will not tolerate--and at some point I hope \nthe leader will allow us to take the time in the Senate to continue on \nthe floor with this legislation. There is one Senator who is opposing \nit, without any rationale whatsoever.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I add something, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We have all learned many things since this disaster \nhappened, and one of the things we have learned, I guess rather \npainfully, is that it is not only the geographic area that is struck by \nthe high wind, the high waters or the flood waters that is impacted by \na catastrophic disaster, but it is also the perimeter of the area, the \ntowns that absorb people fleeing to higher ground and trying to settle \nwhere they can find work and schools for their children, and businesses \nthat might not have been directly impacted but have lost half or 75 \npercent of their customer base.\n  Right now, without Senator Kerry's bill, there is virtually no \nauthorization on the Federal books to allow loans to be made to these \nkinds of businesses. So because we don't have that authorization, we \nare, right now, basically making the disaster worse. I hope people can \nunderstand this. We, by our inaction, by our hardheadedness--and it is \nnot me, although I can be hardheaded but not on this issue--because of \nsome leadership decision on the Republican side, we are literally, \nright now, making this matter worse. Businesses are continuing to go \nout of business; businesses that didn't have a drop of water, \nbusinesses that didn't have one shingle let loose from the high wind \ncontinue to file bankruptcy and put up out-of-business signs because \nthere is no provision to allow low-interest loans to them if they \nweren't directly impacted. Unfortunately, they are directly impacted in \nterms of loss of customers, et cetera.\n  In addition, it is going to bring in the private sector. We heard a \nlot from the other side about Government can't do everything; let the \nprivate sector be engaged. Well, your bill allows for more private-\nsector involvement; does it not? It allows the banks that know these \nsmall businesses to be a part of helping them. This is what the \nbusiness community wants, this is what the banks want, and this is what \nwe recognized was a problem initially.\n  Yet we are being blocked, I understand, by the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwho has not made his specific objections clear to us. So I hope they \ncan be made clear, and if we can fix it, fine. If not, then the \nleadership on the Republican side, I would say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, has a decision: Do they want to be part of the \nnonsensical opposition by a Senator who is in Oklahoma, who is never \ngoing to have a hurricane or do they want to stand with the people in \nAmerica from New York to Texas who are threatened every 9 months with a \nhurricane season.\n  That is the decision the Republican leader from Kentucky is going to \nhave to answer. Is he going to support a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that aids businesses that are literally threatened from New \nYork to Texas or is he going to stand with some nonsensical opposition \ncoming from the middle of the country that will never be hit by a \nhurricane.\n  I hate to be so pointed about it, but that is basically where it is. \nThis is 2 years after the storm. This isn't 2 months or 6 months after. \nThis is a bill that Senator Snowe herself started and Senator Kerry is \nfinishing, and the people of the gulf coast are still waiting. So this \nis a real leadership question, and I hope that as the day goes by and \nthe week goes by, we can make some progress, and I thank the Senator \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. As I \nsaid previously, she has been tireless on this. Louisiana has been \nlucky to have her intervention every step of the way. The billions of \ndollars that have gone down there is a consequence of the hard work she \nhas done.\n  Let me summarize what is being obstructed. First, expedited \nassistance from the SBA to small businesses injured by a disaster; \nsecond, private disaster loans. Private disaster loans. The ability of \nprivate-sector lenders to become involved in the process quickly, \nextending credit to the folks who need it as a consequence of that \ndisaster, which, incidentally, can only occur when the President of the \nUnited States has legitimately declared a disaster; third, improvements \nto the existing program; why we wouldn't want to improve the existing \nprogram after we saw how it was incapable of meeting the problems of \nKatrina is beyond me. That is what we are doing here in a complete and \ntotal bipartisan, unanimous committee vote that suggests these \nimprovements are important and will make a difference; improved agency \ncoordination in marketing. These are the things that make a difference. \nWhen you can get the bureaucracy out of the way, when you can \nstreamline, you are getting better production for the taxpayers' \ndollars, and that is exactly what we are doing; improved planning and \noversight and disaster assistance staffing, necessary to be able to \ndeliver the services because we didn't have sufficient personnel to be \nable to process the loan requests that came in.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Small Business Administrator, Steve Preston.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           U.S. Small Business Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2007.\n     Hon.

We would also recommend clarifying that the \n     Administrator would have flexibility under section 205 to \n     designate portions of a declared catastrophic national \n     disaster area as a HUBZone area, without extending this \n     designation to an entire disaster area.\n       We look forward to working with you when the bill goes into \n     conference discussions with the U.S. House of \n     Representatives.

Mr. President, I had hoped to offer an amendment today to \nthis year's Defense authorization bill regarding Iraq. I understand the \nleadership has decided to act on the Levin-Reed amendment before \nconsidering other amendments to this legislation. Given the existing \nparliamentary situation, I am not confident there will be an \nopportunity to get an up-or-down vote on my amendment or, for that \nmatter, any other amendments that meaningfully mandates a change of \ncourse with respect to the administration's policy in Iraq.\n  It is deeply troubling and it saddens me that in the Senate, on the \nmost critical issue of our day, we cannot consider, debate or vote on \namendments affecting the lives and well-being of our servicemen and \nwomen and the conduct of U.S. foreign policy in the most troubled spot \nin the world today. I believe those who refuse to allow this Senate to \nvote on this critical issue do a grave disservice to the American \npeople by enabling the President to continue with his failed strategy \nin Iraq.\n  Every additional day we ``stay the course'' in Iraq, our Nation is \nless safe and the people of Iraq get further away from coming together \nto fashion a political and diplomatic solution to their civil conflict. \nOur men and women in uniform have served this Nation valiantly in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and they will continue to do so, I am confident, until \nour political leaders see the error of their judgment in this case and \nbegin the process of drawing down U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  It is imperative, I believe, we change course in Iraq immediately. I \nthink this is vitally important for our country and the well-being of \nthat part of the world. Sadly, the President and his allies stand in \nthe way of that goal. Support for the President's policy erodes as each \npassing day unfolds with more violence and chaos in Iraq.\n  I predict the day will come when Congress will have the courage to \nsay enough is enough, but, sadly, it would not be before more American \nlives are lost or more wanton destruction occurs in the beleaguered \nnation of Iraq.\n  Let me speak briefly about the amendment I had hoped to offer--still \nhope to offer--and which I would like to offer at the earliest \nopportunity if, in fact, this logjam breaks. My amendment seeks to \naccomplish two critical tasks. First, to bring the Iraq war to a close \nby ending the financing of combat operations, mandating a phased \nredeployment of combat forces from Iraq, and ensuring the \nadministration actually carries out that redeployment.\n  Second, the amendment proposes to redirect any savings realized from \na reduced military presence in Iraq, to restore the readiness of our \nvery war-battered National Guard and armed services. I strongly believe \nwe must not wait any longer to achieve either task.\n  Now is the time for us to make difficult choices. Now is the time for \nthe Senate to enact legislation that, I believe, will hold this \nadministration accountable to this policy.\n  I support the Levin-Reed amendment, and I thank both our colleagues, \nthe authors of that amendment, for demonstrating leadership in trying \nto move this body one step closer to bringing this disastrous war to a \nclose. It is my hope that their amendment will do that, but I remain \nconcerned about some aspects of that amendment--the extended delay in \ncommencing redeployment and the absence of any funding linkage to \nredeployment. Based on past experiences with this administration, my \nconcern is the President will simply ignore the legislation proposed by \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the senior Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  It has been quite difficult to track the ever-changing justifications \nfor continuing our combat operations in Iraq, including the surge, and \nthere appears to be no end in sight.\n  First, the administration simply refused to admit there was no \nmilitary solution in Iraq or that Iraq was in a State of civil war.\n  Then, instead of acting upon a unique chance to implement the \nbipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission, which Congress supported, \nSecretary Rice explained that the administration was implementing a \nsurge tactic, but assured us that it was an Iraqi plan. ``Most \nimportantly,'' she claimed, ``the Iraqis have devised their own \nstrategy, and our efforts will support theirs.''\n  Our country was told that despite the catastrophic policy failures of \nthis administration up until that point, that the surge would take time \nto work and that we couldn't judge its success until U.S. forces had \n``surged'' to their maximum levels--and that would take up to 6 months.\n  But that the surge is at full force, and we are told yet again that \nthe time isn't right to make a judgment about the success or failure of \nthe administration's policy. Now we are told we must wait until \nSeptember to determine the success of the surge. I strongly suspect, as \nI stand here in July, that as September draws near the administration \nwill once again come up with some additional arguments to delay the day \nof reckoning on the policy in Iraq.\n  I do not need any more time, or any more reports and briefings to \nconfirm what most of us already know. The American people and the Iraqi \npeople don't need any more time to realize that the administration's \nIraq policy, including the surge, has been a failure. With the \nexception of a handful in this body, I have not said anything that most \nof my colleagues do not believe themselves. Why, then, are we waiting? \nAs we wait yet another 2 or 3 months to decide what most of us here \nhave already concluded, while disagreeing about how best to achieve \nthis result, there is a consensus that has emerged that I think is \nprobably more than a supermajority. After all the time waiting here, \nour servicemen and women and the beleaguered people of Iraq will pay an \nawful price indeed, as we fool around and dicker while deciding to come \nto the conclusion we have all basically reached already.\n\n  The highly respected International Crisis Group recently released a \nreport on Iraq which examined the complex reasons for the current \npolitical violence in Iraq, and concluded that any surge based on a \npurely military operation with a simplistic view of the bloodshed's \norigins was destined for failure.\n  We mustn't sacrifice any more lives, we shouldn't countenance any \nmore bloodshed, and we shouldn't support the continuation of the failed \nescalation of a disastrous policy. The April-May American death toll is \na new 2-month record. The civilian casualty rate in Iraq is at an all-\ntime high. Overall violence in Iraq is up and, according to the Iraqi \nRed Crescent, the number of internally displaced Iraqis has quadrupled \nsince January. In fact, the Iraqi Red Crescent warns that there is \ncurrently a human tragedy unprecedented in Iraq's history.''\n  As recent GAO reports have highlighted what we all intuitively have \nconcluded--that there has been little progress on the key detailed \nprovisions of Iraq's hydrocarbon law, let alone on reforming the Iraqi \nconstitution, on debaathification, or on a host of other essential \npolitical components to a functioning Iraqi government, focused on \nreconciliation. In fact, Foreign Policy magazine recently released \ntheir ``failed state index'' and Iraq rose to No. 2 on that index, \nclosely behind Sudan.\n  The President told the American people that the surge of troops into \nkey cities in Iraq was being executed in order to provide the Iraqis \nwith some political breathing space to start the reconciliation \nprocess. Secretary Rice explained that ``the most urgent task now is to \nhelp the Iraqi government establish the confidence that it can and will \nprotect all of its citizens, regardless of their sectarian identity, \nand that it will reinforce security with political reconciliation and \neconomic support.''\n  But none of that has happened--and falsely claiming that it has, \nwon't make us safer, won't secure Iraq, won't secure our interests in \nthe region, and won't rebuild our military.\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\n  As my friend Senator Lugar, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee said recently\n\n       In my judgment, the current surge strategy is not an \n     effective means of protecting these interests. Its prospects \n     for success are too dependent on the actions of others who do \n     not share our agenda. It relies on military power to achieve \n     goals that it cannot achieve. It distances allies that we \n     will need for any regional diplomatic effort. Its failure, \n     without a careful transition to a back-up policy would \n     intensify our loss of credibility. It uses tremendous amounts \n     of resources that cannot be employed in other ways to secure \n     our objectives.\n\n  I fully agree with my friend and colleague from Indiana.\n  That is why my amendment also calls on the administration to appoint \na high-level special envoy to Iraq to engage in a new diplomatic \noffensive--exactly what the Baker Hamilton Commission called for over 6 \nmonths ago. It is imperative that we engage Iraqi leaders, regional \nleaders and international organizations such as the United Nations and \nthe Arab League to promote reconciliation and stability in Iraq. I know \nof no other way this is likely to occur.\n  This administration has long neglected the key diplomatic and \npolitical aspects of the conflict in Iraq, despite the calls of many of \nus, including my good friend Senator Hagel, who recently outlined a \nplan to ``internationalize'' our efforts to help Iraqis reach political \nreconciliation, including appointing a U.N. Security Council-backed \ninternational mediator.\n  The amendment offered by Senators Levin and Reed also calls for such \na mediator, which I fully support.\n  But, despite the fact that there is no military solution to this \nconflict, which we have said for now almost 3\\1/2\\ years, this \nadministration and too many in the Congress are still wedded to only \nmilitary solutions. In fact, these defenders of the Iraq war continue \nclaim that we are in Iraq to fight al-Qaida, just like they continue to \nfalsely claim that al-Qaida had links to Saddam Hussein.\n  But according to a recent article by Michael Gordon, the coauthor of \nCobra II:\n\n       al-Qaida in Mesopotamia [the action of al-Qaida currently \n     in Iraq] did not exist before the Sept. 11 attacks. This \n     Sunni group has thrived as a magnet for recruiting and a \n     force for violence largely because of the American invasion \n     of Iraq in 2003, which brought an American occupying force of \n     more than 100,000 troops to the heart of the Middle East, and \n     led to a Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad.\n\n  Moreover, according to recent media accounts, it is the Mahdi Army, a \nShiite militia led by the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, not al-Qaida \nin Mesopotamia that poses the greatest risk to American troops in \nBaghdad. Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Mahdi Army's \nfrequent and brazen attacks on U.S. soldiers also appear to challenge \nthe idea that the Mahdi Army has been lying low to avoid confrontations \nwith Americans.\n  Perhaps most frustrating of all, while feverishly attempting to find \nlinkages between Osama bin Laden and Iraqi insurgents, the \nadministration has taken its eye off the ball of the bigger threats \nposed by looming terrorists having little or nothing to do with Iraq.\n  The GAO recently slammed the administration's anti-terrorism efforts \nin a report entitled ``Law Enforcement Agencies Lack Directives to \nAssist Foreign Nations to Identify, Disrupt and Prosecute Terrorists.'' \nThe report found that there is a tremendous deficit of communication \nand coordination among key U.S. agencies, which in turn severely \nhampers our efforts at fighting international terrorism and aiding \nforeign governments in doing so.\n  Six years after 9/11, this administration has singularly focused on \nIraq, while failing to effectively fight international terrorism. It \nmay be true that for the Bush administration that Iraq is the central \nfront in their ``war on terror'', but this misplaced focus has made \nAmerica less secure as a result.\n  Simply put, we must stop the downward spiral in Iraq, and refocus our \nefforts at effectively and robustly combating extremism and terrorism \naround the world--and my amendment would begin to do just that. Why is \nthat the case?\n  Because my amendment sets clear timelines for the phased redeployment \nof our troops out of Iraq, with three specific exceptions for \nactivities that are critical to our national security interests and the \ninterests of Iraq: First, conducting counterrorism operations in Iraq, \ntargeted at al-Qaida in Mesopotamia; second, training and equipping \nIraqi forces; and third, force protection for U.S. personnel and \ninfrastructure.\n  This amendment also provides a specific timeline for all combat \nforces to redeploy out of Iraq, aside from the three exceptions I just \nmentioned, by April 30, 2008.\n  To ensure that this process gets underway without any stonewalling by \nthe administration or anyone in his administration, my amendment sets \nan interim deadline of December 31, 2007, at which point at least \n50,000 troops must have been redeployed out of Iraq.\n  Failure to meet this initial milestone will result in a funding \npenalty. The amendment would withhold 25 percent of the fiscal year \n2008 military budget for Iraq-related activities until the President \ncertifies that he can meet the overall April 30, 2008, deadline.\n  Ultimately, this amendment calls for the redeployment of \napproximately 90,000 combat troops within the next 9 months, leaving \nabout 70,000 to complete the three non-combat missions that I have \nalready outlined.\n  The redeployed forces would be comprised of a majority of the \ndeployed Army brigade combat teams and the Marine Expeditionary Force \ncurrently in theater.\n  Now, some may say that such redeployment is not logistically \nachievable within the timeframes laid out in the amendment.\n  However, I want to remind my colleagues that in the ramp up to the \nfirst gulf war, the Department of Defense coordinated the movement of \nover 500,000 troops and 10 million tons of cargo and fuel in the same \ntimeframe that this amendment grants to redeploy a force one-fifth the \nsize.\n  In January 1991, alone, the Transportation Command moved \napproximately 132,000 troops, 1 million tons of cargo, and over 1 \nmillion tons of fuel. If it is possible to coordinate the logistics to \ngo to war, it is certainly possible, in my view, to get our troops out \nof harm's way and bring our military involvement in this civil war to a \nclose.\n  Of course, there is always a concern about the cost of conducting a \nredeployment. Senator Conrad, now chairman of the Budget Committee, \nasked this very question to the Congressional Budget Office in 2002, \nrequesting an assessment of the costs of the Iraq war; including the \neventual redeployment of our forces. The CBO concluded that the \nredeployment of our forces to their home bases would cost approximately \n$7 billion, less than the cost of 1 month of ongoing operations in \nIraq.\n  Can we trust this figure? The very same report notes that monthly \ncosts for the war would run between $6 billion and $9 billion per \nmonth--that was in 2002; which is exactly what we saw until the \nincursion of additional surge related costs.\n  Up until now, the cost of the war in Iraq has been mainly measured in \nthe number of lives lost and U.S. Treasury spent--and rightly so. Mr. \nPresident, 3,600 brave American servicemembers have been killed, tens \nof thousands of Iraqis have lost their lives, and Congress has approved \napproximately $450 billion.\n  But there is yet another cost of war--our military's readiness.\n  While long, arduous deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are testing \nthe morale of our troops in the field and their families, they are also \ntaxing critical stocks of aircraft, vehicles and equipment that our \nmilitary needs to prepare for other challenges in the 21st century.\n  According to recent military reports, two-thirds of the U.S. Army is \nunable to report for combat duty, and the Army's top generals have said \nthat if the administration continues to fail to meet these needs, the \nsituation could further deteriorate.\n  The situation for our National Guard is even worse. According to \nNational Guard Bureau Chief, LTG Steven Blum, ``88 percent of the force \nthat are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped today \nin the Army National Guard.'' Such a statistic is unconscionable to \nme--and it affects the National Guard units in every State of every \nlast Senator in this Chamber.\n  My amendment will take steps to remedy this dire situation and begin \nto rebuild our military. This debate is\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\nabout priorities. Will we continue to fund a failed strategy, in my \nview, in Iraq that is leaving us less secure and that is hollowing out \nour military?\n  Or will we meet our commitments to our service members and our \nNation, by restoring the readiness of our forces which have been \nseverely damaged by this administration's policies?\n  In my view, the answer is simple. Our military's top generals and \nadmirals have submitted to Congress lists of critical military \npriorities that would not be funded under the President's fiscal year \n2008 budget proposal.\n  Billions of dollars a week are being squandered in Iraq, while our \nNation's military is calling out for additional resources to repair the \ndamage caused by the administration's policies.\n  My amendment therefore reprioritizes our defense budget to rebuild \nour military. It stops financing combat missions in Iraq and redirects \nfunding to meeting priorities for the armed services.\n  Savings made available by downsizing our force in Iraq would be \ninvested in items identified by each of our military's Service Chiefs. \nFunding levels for these items would not exceed the amounts specified \nin their official fiscal year 2008 unfunded requirements lists \nsubmitted to Congress earlier this year.\n  The Army Chief of Staff has found over $10 billion in critical \nshortfalls, including funding for specially armored trucks known as \nMRAPs or mine resistant ambush protected vehicles; night vision \ngoggles, and bomb disposal gear.\n  The Marine Corps' ``unfunded requirement list'' submitted by the \nCommandant includes over $3 billion for similar priorities as well as \nnew helicopters; communications gear and training equipment.\n  The Navy's list totals over $5.6 billion, including helicopters, \nsailor housing, and aircraft maintenance.\n  The Air Force's unfunded priorities, totaling over $16 billion, \nincludes much needed resources to modernize radar systems and restore \nour fleet of cargo aircraft to help redeploy our troops and their \nequipment.\n  The National Guard Bureau Chief has identified over a billion dollars \nneeded to begin rebuilding Guard forces across the United States--to \nreplace and repair vehicles, aircraft, and personal gear, necessary for \nhomeland security missions.\n  The amendment I would like to offer would allow for funding to \nrestore National Guard equipment readiness. Due to the administration's \nmismanagement, the National Guard is facing a $38 billion equipment \nshortfall, according to General Blum.\n  A recent report by the U.S. Commission on the National Guard and \nReserves disclosed that the administration's policies have actually \nendangered the Guard's abilities to perform both their overseas and \nhomeland defense missions. Under orders by the administration, the \nNational Guard troops have been forced to leave their State's equipment \nin Iraq and Afghanistan for our troops rotating into combat theaters. \nMany of their military vehicles and aircraft are being worn down or \ndestroyed in battle, but any critical equipment that may have survived \nis simply being transferred to other units coming into Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, the adjutant general, MG Thaddeus \nMartin, recently reported that equipment shortages exceed $200 million \nin my State. This includes more than 200 humvees, 21 large support \nvehicles and tankers and heavy-cargo vehicles, over 600 personnel and \ncrew-served weapons systems, over 1,500 night-vision devices, and even \none medium-lift helicopter.\n  What does all of this mean? It means that we are short of equipment \nto respond to natural or manmade disasters here at home, short of \nequipment for training, short of equipment to maintain the standard of \nmaintenance rotation for equipment currently in the field, short of \nequipment for units deploying into harm's way--short of equipment to \nprotect the American people themselves.\n  The Government Accountability Office highlighted this very important \npoint in testimony released on October 20, 2005, and I quote it. It \nstated:\n\n       The cumulative effect of these personnel and equipment \n     transfers has been a decline in the readiness of Army \n     National Guard forces for future missions, both overseas and \n     at home.\n\n  This data alone should demonstrate to everyone unequivocally that \neach of us has to fulfill our obligations to our warfighters. Now is \nthe time to begin the rebuilding process. In my view, the sooner we \nredeploy out of Iraq, get our military out of that situation, the \nsooner we can redirect these vital funds to rebuild our forces here at \nhome.\n  None of our choices are easy. I don't suggest by my remarks here that \nthey are. But they are clear choices. It is about time we made them. To \ngovern is to choose the policy that is best for our Nation, even in the \nface of extreme difficulty. So I call on my colleagues here today to \nmake those choices which experience, commonsense, and overwhelming data \ncompel; that is, to force the President to redeploy, to rebuild our \nArmed Forces, and to end this disastrous involvement in the civil war.\n  The last several months have been a story of squandered chances. We \nhave paid for them in American lives. Again, to delay another 2 or 3 \nmonths to arrive at a conclusion most of us have already arrived at is \nsomething I think is unacceptable. And that lives which may be lost or \ndamaged because we waited 2 or 3 months to arrive at a conclusion that \nmost here already believe to be the case, is certainly a sad day for \nthis body. We cannot even have votes, we cannot even consider the \nvarious ideas we bring to the Chamber that might bring this war and our \ninvolvement in it to a close.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

And I hope people will want to speak, will come \nand speak on the amendment, because hopefully we can get to enough \nvotes tomorrow so that we can actually have a vote on Levin-Reed, that \nwe can get to 60 votes, to achieve cloture. We would then be able to \nhave a vote on the pending amendment. Other than that, we would be \nthwarted. There would be a procedural roadblock in reaching a vote on \nLevin-Reed.\n  So that is the goal, if everyone is given a chance to speak on Levin-\nReed, whatever side they are on, so that we can then, hopefully, end \nthe debate on Levin-Reed and actually get to a vote on it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not object, but I ask unanimous \nconsent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Michigan about \nour plans for the day. For example, I understand there is a Cornyn \namendment which may be voted on as well?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is indeed, as I understand it, a \nconsent which has been already reached that there be a vote on the \nCornyn amendment at 2:45. There was an offer yesterday, as a matter of \nfact, to, I believe, simply accept that amendment, but someone wanted \nto have a rollcall vote on it. That is their right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could ask my colleague further, I understand we also \nhave well over 100 pending amendments on the bill as well. I would hope \nthat at some point, Senator Levin and I can sit down and maybe start \nsorting through those if we have any hope whatsoever of completing this \nbill.\n  I would remind all of my colleagues that this body has passed--and \nhas been signed into law--a Defense authorization bill for the last 45 \nyears. There are aspects of this bill, as the Senator well knows as the \ndistinguished chairman, that we worked very hard on, such as pay raises \nand other authorizations for much needed equipment, training, et \ncetera. I would hope the Senator from Michigan and I can start working \non those aspects of the bill, if we have any hopes of passing an \nauthorization bill this year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield, it is my fervent hope that we \nhave a bill this year. It is not only my intent to try to work out \namendments, it has been our intent for many days to work out those \namendments. I understand there is some kind of a procedure that some \nMembers on your side have insisted upon which has slowed down that \nprocess significantly. So our staffs and I, and I know the Senator from \nArizona, the ranking member on the committee, are more than ready to \nwork out these amendments, as many as possible. Usually, we can work \nout as many as 100 on an authorization bill. I think there are 190 \namendments filed. We are up to the task. Our staffs are up to the task. \nWe have to be allowed to proceed. I understand there is some kind of \nroadblock that perhaps the Senator from Arizona could identify and help \nto remove.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Levin. As I understand it, we will be \ndebating the amendment of the chairman and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland throughout the day and through tonight, and perhaps a cloture \nvote sometime tomorrow. Is that your understanding?\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe it is set for 1 hour after the Senate convenes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the parliamentary procedure, I would ask?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no time for that yet, for the Senate to come in \ntomorrow. We have to await that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Levin.\n  This is the second week, as we know, we are on this bill. We have not \ngotten to many of the amendments that have anything to do with other \naspects of defending this Nation besides the issue of Iraq. I look \nforward to working with him as we can try to not break a 45-year custom \nhere that we provide the much needed authorization for the men and \nwomen in our defense establishment and provide for our Nation's \nsecurity, which I think we all agree is our highest priority.\n  So, if I may continue the colloquy for just one moment, I know that \nthere are--now we will be beginning, and I will give a statement after \nthe chairman, if it is his desire, and then we will have speakers \ncoming all day long on either side of this issue. I know many want to \nspeak, and I hope they will be prepared to do so.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield further, last week, we did \naccomplish a major achievement in terms of the wounded warrior \nlegislation, which is now on this bill, and I believe, on Friday, there \nwere speakers on the Iraq issue, on Levin-Reed and other amendments, \nand there were yesterday as well. So the debate on the Iraq amendments \nhas taken place, and it is now going to continue today and into the \nnight. Hopefully, we can get to a vote on Levin-Reed and not be \nthwarted by this 60-vote procedural roadblock.\n  Again, I want to say something that has been the case before. We had \na number of votes on Iraq in the last authorization bill, and those \nwere 50-vote votes. There was not a threat of a filibuster that \ndeprived the Senate of voting on those amendments in the last \nauthorization bill. For instance, there was a Levin-Reed amendment in \nthe last authorization bill which I believe received 39 or 40 votes. \nThere was also a Kerry amendment on Iraq which was voted up or down \nwithout that procedural roadblock.\n  I would hope that on this bill, given the absolute importance of this \nissue and the expression of opinion of the American people last \nNovember about this issue, that we would be allowed to vote up or down \nand to remove that 60-vote filibuster threat, the roadblock that has \nnow been put in the way, and will determine tomorrow whether cloture \nwill be invoked and that roadblock can be removed. But the Senator is \ncorrect, there is ample opportunity for people to come down today to \ncontinue the debate on the Iraq amendment should they choose.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I thank Senator Levin for all the great work we \nhave been able to do together and the wounded warrior legislation, \nwhich Senator Levin, under his leadership, we have now adopted as part \nof the bill.\n  There is another compelling argument to complete the bill. If we are \ngoing to take care of our wounded veterans and we are going to take \ncare of the men and women who have served, I think it is a compelling \nargument that we get this legislation passed.\n  Finally, we have been back and forth on this issue. I do not like to \nget into the process and go back and forth. But 60 votes was not \ninvented on this side, nor was it invented on the other side. The 60-\nvote procedure has been employed by the minority in recent years--in my \nview, all too often. But the fact is, to somehow say it was invented \nhere on this side of the aisle obviously is not the case. There were \nmany times, when the Democratic Party was in the minority in this body, \nwhere I saw 60 votes invoked, the procedure invoked, because it was \nfelt, appropriately, because that is the way the Senate works, as the \ncriteria for moving forward because of the urgency or the importance of \nthe pending legislation.\n  So what is missing here, I would say to my friend from Michigan--and \nI think he agrees with me--is what we have seen is the erosion, over \nthe past 20 years I have been here, of an ability to sit down and \ndiscuss and agree and move forward. That is what is the missing \ningredient here, and it has been missing for some years.\n  I regret it. I may be a little optimistic, but I think if it were \nonly between the Senator from Michigan and me, we could dispose of most \nof these issues rather readily and establish a procedure for moving \nforward. We are now at the point--let's have some straight talk--that \nthis entire bill is in jeopardy because of the imbroglio of the war in \nIraq being added to an authorization bill which was not intended to be \na national security piece of legislation. It was intended to be a bill \nto authorize the necessary funding, training, and equipping of the men \nand women in the military, and care for our wounded veterans has been \nadded. I regret the situation as it is, but that is the way it is. We \nwill spend today debating this issue and discussing it. I hope at some \npoint we will realize the war is going to be going on. This bill, if it \nis passed with the Reed-Levin amendment on it, would be vetoed by the \nPresident. That would be a bad thing to happen. The war will be \ndiscussed in September again--we all know that--when General Petraeus \nis ready to report to the Senate. At some point I would hope we could \nmove forward on the authorization bill and do the things that are \nnecessary to help equip and train and ready the men and women serving \nin the military and preserving our national security.\n  Again, I appreciate the efforts the Senator from Michigan, \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, is making in this direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend for his willingness to always sit down \nand try to work things out. The roadblock here to our proceeding will \nbe either kept in place or removed tomorrow with the vote on whether to \nallow Levin-Reed to come to a vote. The Senator is right that there \nhave been times when people have filibustered matters. There have been \ntimes when they have decided not to. On the Iraq issue, on the last \nauthorization bill, there were votes up or down without a 60-vote \nprocedural roadblock being put in place to the then Levin-Reed and \nKerry amendments. So that is the precedent we established last year \nthat I would hope the Republican leader would allow to be followed, \nbecause--one other comment--I can't think of a more appropriate place \nto be debating Iraq policy, frankly, than on an authorization bill. \nWhether I am right or wrong, that is what happened last year. I hope it \nwill again be followed this year.\n  I thank my good friend. My remarks will be coming this afternoon.\n  Senator Kennedy will be following the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, the foregoing \nrequest to have the Senator from Massachusetts follow the Senator from \nArizona is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the \nchairman and the Senator from Rhode Island. Let's be very clear what \nthis amendment would do. It would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. forces \nfrom Iraq. The debate that has taken place on this floor for some \nmonths now comes down to a simple choice. The sponsors of this \namendment would have us legislate a withdrawal of U.S. combat forces \nfrom Iraq within 120 days of enactment, leaving in place only forces \nauthorized to carry out specific, narrow missions. That is one choice, \nto force an end to the war in Iraq and accept thereby all the terrible \nconsequences that follow. The other is to defeat this amendment, to \ngive General Petraeus and the troops under his command the time and \nsupport they have requested to carry out their mission, to allow them \nto safeguard vital American interests and an Iraqi population at risk \nof genocide. That is the choice.\n  Though politics and popular opinion may be pushing us in one \ndirection, to take the easy course, we, as elected leaders, have a \ngreater responsibility. A measure of courage is required, not the great \ncourage exhibited by the brave men and women fighting today in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but a smaller measure, the courage necessary to put our \ncountry's interests before every personal or political consideration.\n  I wish to spend a few moments reviewing the state of affairs in Iraq \ntoday. The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus's \nnew counterinsurgency strategy arrived several weeks ago. From what I \nsaw and heard on my recent trips and from briefings and reports since \nthen, I believe our military, in cooperation with Iraqi security \nforces, is making progress in a number of areas. The areas where they \nare operating have\n\n[[Page S9304]]\n\nnot suddenly become safe, but they do illustrate the progress that our \nmilitary has achieved under General Petraeus's new strategy. The most \ndramatic advances have been made in Anbar Province, a region that last \nyear was widely believed to be lost to al-Qaida. After an offensive by \nU.S. and Iraqi troops cleaned al-Qaida fighters off of Ramadi and other \nareas of western Anbar Province, tribal sheikhs broke formally with the \nterrorists and joined the coalition side.\n  Ramadi, which just months ago stood as Iraq's most dangerous city, is \nnow one of its safest. In February, attacks in Ramadi averaged between \n30 and 35. Now many days see no attacks at all--no gunfire, no IEDs, \nand no suicide bombings.\n  In Fallujah, Iraqi police have established numerous stations and have \ndivided the city into gated districts, leading to a decline in \nviolence. Local intelligence tips have proliferated in the province. \nThousands of men are signing up for the police and the army, and the \nlocals are taking the fight to al-Qaida. U.S. commanders in Anbar \nattest that all 18 major tribes in the province are now on board with \nthe security plan. They expect that a year from now, the Iraqi Army and \npolice could have total control of security in Ramadi. At that point, \nthey project, we could safely draw down American forces in the area.\n  The Anbar model is one our military is attempting to replicate in \nother parts of Iraq with some real successes. A brigade of the 10th \nMountain Division is operating in areas south of Baghdad, the belts \naround the capital which have been havens for al-Qaida and other \ninsurgents. All soldiers in I brigades are living forward and \ncommanders report that local sheikhs are increasingly siding with the \ncoalition against al-Qaida, the main enemy in that area of operations.\n\n  Southeast of Baghdad the military is targeting al-Qaida in safe \nhavens they maintain along the Tigris River, and MG Rick Lynch, \ncommander of operations there, recently reported that attacks on \ncivilians in his area of operations were down 20 percent since April \nand civilian deaths have declined by 55 percent. These and other \nefforts are part of Operation Phantom Thunder, a military operation \nintended to stop insurgents present in the Baghdad belts from \noriginating attacks in the capital itself.\n  In Baghdad, the military, in cooperation with Iraqi security forces, \ncontinues to establish joint security stations and deploy throughout \nthe city in order to get violence under control. These efforts have \nproduced positive results. Sectarian violence has fallen since January. \nThe total number of car bombings and suicide attacks declined in May \nand June, and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence \ntips has risen. Make no mistake: Violence in Baghdad remains at \nunacceptably high levels. Suicide bombers and other threats pose \nformidable challenges, and other difficulties abound. Nevertheless, \nthere appears to be overall movement in the right direction.\n  North of Baghdad, Iraqi and American troops have surged into Diyala \nProvince and are fighting to deny al-Qaida sanctuary in the city of \nBaquba. For the first time since the war began, Americans showed up in \nforce and did not quickly withdraw from the area. In response, locals \nhave formed a new alliance with the coalition to counter al-Qaida. \nDiyala, which was the center of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Islamic \ncaliphate finally has a chance to turn aside the forces of extremism.\n  I offer these observations not in order to present a rosy scenario of \nthe challenges we continue to face in Iraq. As the horrific bombing in \nSalah ad-Din Province illustrates so graphically, the threats to Iraqi \nstability have not gone away, nor are they likely to go away in the \nnear future. Our brave men and women in Iraq will continue to face \ngreat challenges. What I do believe, however, is that while the mission \nto bring a degree of security to Iraq and Baghdad and its environs in \nparticular, in order to establish the necessary precondition for \npolitical and economic process, is still in its early stages, the \nprogress our military has made should encourage all of us.\n  It is also clear that the overall strategy General Petraeus has put \ninto place, a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes \nprotecting the population and gets our troops off of bases and into the \nareas they are trying to protect, is the correct one.\n  Some of my colleagues argue we should return troops to forward \noperating bases and confine their activities to training in targeted \ncounterterrorism operations. That is precisely what we did for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, which I, time after time, said was doomed to failure. The \nsituation in Iraq only got worse. I am, frankly, surprised that my \ncolleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld-Casey \nstrategy. No one can be certain whether this new strategy, which \nremains in the early stages, can bring about ever greater stability. We \ncan be sure, however, that should the Senate seek to legislate an end \nto the strategy as it is just commencing, then we will fail for \ncertain.\n  Now that the military effort in Iraq is showing some signs of \nprogress, space is opening for political progress. Yet rather than \nseizing the opportunity, the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not \nfunctioning as it must. We see little evidence of reconciliation, and \nnone of the 18 benchmarks has yet been met. Progress is not enough. We \nneed to see results. Today. I am sorry to report the results are not \nthere. The Iraqi Government can function. The question is whether it \nwill. If there is to be hope of a sustainable end to the violence that \nso plagues that country, Iraqi political leaders must seize this \nopportunity. It will not come around again.\n  To encourage political progress, I believe we can find wisdom in \nseveral suggestions put forward recently by Henry Kissinger. An \nintensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties could limit violence, \npromote reconciliation, and put the political system on a more stable \nfooting. At the same time we should promote a dialog between the Iraqi \nGovernment and its Sunni Arab neighbors, specifically Egypt, Jordan, \nand Saudi Arabia, in order to build broader international acceptance \nfor the Iraqi central Government in exchange for that Government \nmeeting specific obligations with respect to the protection and \npolitical participation of the Sunni minority. These countries should \ncease their efforts to handpick new Iraqi leaders and instead \ncontribute to stabilizing Iraq, an effort that would directly serve \ntheir national interests.\n  Finally, we should begin a broader effort to establish a basis for \naid and even peacekeeping efforts by the international community key to \npolitical progress in Iraq. In taking such steps, we must recognize \nthat no lasting political settlement can grow out of a U.S. withdrawal. \nOn the contrary, a withdrawal must grow out of a political solution, a \nsolution made possible by the imposition of security by coalition and \nIraqi forces.\n  Secretary Kissinger is absolutely correct when he states \n``precipitate withdrawal would produce a disaster'' and one that \n``would not end the war but shift it to other areas, like Lebanon or \nJordan or Saudi Arabia,'' produce greater violence among Iraqi \nfactions, and embolden radical Islamists around the world.\n  Let us keep in the front of our minds the likely consequences of \npremature withdrawal from Iraq. Many of my colleagues would like to \nbelieve that should the withdrawal amendment we are currently debating \nbecome law, it would mark the end of this long effort. They are wrong. \nShould the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq, it would \nmark a new beginning, the start of a new, more dangerous, and more \narduous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement.\n\n  No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality \nof Iraq to the war on terror, there can simply be no debate that our \nefforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against \nviolent Islamic extremism. Already, the terrorists are emboldened, \nexcited that America is talking about not winning in Iraq but is, \nrather, debating when we should lose. Last week, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-\nQaida's deputy chief, said the United States is merely delaying our \ninevitable defeat in Iraq and that the Mujahedin of Islam in Iraq of \nthe caliphate and Jihad are advancing with steady steps toward victory. \nHe called on Muslims to travel to Iraq to fight Americans and appealed \nfor Muslims to support the Islamic State in Iraq, a group established \nby al-Qaida.\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\n  General Petraeus has called al-Qaida ``the principal short-term \nthreat to Iraq.'' What do the supporters of this amendment believe to \nbe the consequences of our leaving the battlefield with al-Qaida in \nplace? If we leave Iraq prematurely, jihadists around the world will \ninterpret the withdrawal as their great victory against our great \npower. Their movement thrives in an atmosphere of perceived victory. We \nsaw this in the surge of men and money flowing to al-Qaida following \nthe Soviet Union withdrawal from Afghanistan. If they defeat the United \nStates in Iraq, they will believe that anything is possible, that \nhistory is on their side, that they can bring their terrible rule to \nlands the world over. Recall the plan laid out in a letter from \nZawahiri to Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi before his death. That plan is to \ntake shape in four stages: Establish a caliphate in Iraq, extend the \n``jihad wave'' to the secular countries neighboring Iraq, clash with \nIsrael--none of which will commence until the completion of stage one: \nExpel the Americans from Iraq. The terrorists are in this war to win \nit. The question is, Are we?\n  The supporters of this amendment respond that they do not, by any \nmeans, intend to cede the battlefield to al-Qaida. On the contrary, the \nlegislation would allow U.S. forces, presumably holed up in forward-\noperating bases, to carry out targeted counterterrorism operations. But \nour own military commanders say this approach will not succeed and that \nmoving in with search and destroy missions to kill and capture \nterrorists, only to immediately cede the territory to the enemy, is the \nfailed strategy of the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  MG Rick Lynch, who is directing a major part of the Baghdad \noffensive, said over the weekend that an early American withdrawal \nwould clear the way for the enemy to come back to areas now being \ncleared of insurgents. ``When we go out there,'' he said, ``the first \nquestion they ask is: `Are you staying?' And the second is: `How can we \nhelp?' ''\n  General Lynch added that should U.S. forces pull back before the job \nis complete, we risk ``an environment where the enemy could come back \nand fill the void.''\n  On Monday, last Monday, Lieutenant General Odierno, the No. 2 \ncommander in Iraq said:\n\n       My assessment right now is I need more time. I'm seeing \n     some progress now here in Iraq. We have really just started \n     what the Iraqis term ``liberating'' them from al-Qaida.\n\n  Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority \nwould turn Iraq into a failed State and a terrorist sanctuary in the \nheart of the Middle East. We have seen a failed State emerge after U.S. \ndisengagement once before, and it cost us terribly. In pre-9/11 \nAfghanistan, terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with \nimpunity. We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are \nplanning attacks against Americans. We cannot make this fatal mistake \ntwice.\n  As my friend, GEN Brent Scowcroft, has said recently, one of the men \nI respect more than most any in America:\n\n       The costs of staying are visible. The costs of getting out \n     are almost never discussed. If we get out before Iraq is \n     stable, the entire Middle East region might start to resemble \n     Iraq today. Getting out is not a solution.\n\n  Natan Sharansky has recently written:\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by \n     comparison.\n\n  Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability, we \nwill invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives \nare already moving weapons, training fighters, providing resources, and \nhelping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our \nefforts to bring stability to Iraq. Iran will comfortably step into the \npower vacuum left by a U.S. withdrawal, and such an aggrandizement of \nfundamentalist power has great potential to spark greater Sunni-Shia \nconflicts across the region.\n  Leaving prematurely would induce Iraq's neighbors, including Saudi \nArabia and Jordan, Egypt to Israel, Turkey and others, to feel their \nown security eroding and may well induce them to act in ways that \nprompt wider instability. The potential for genocide, wider war, \nspiraling oil prices, and the perception of strategic American defeat \nis real, and no vote on this floor will change that.\n  Don't take my word for it. Consult, perhaps, the Iraq Study Group, \nwhich says:\n\n       A chaotic Iraq could provide a still stronger base of \n     operations for terrorists who seek to act regionally or even \n     globally. Al-Qaida will portray any failure by the United \n     States in Iraq as a sinificant victory that will be featured \n     prominently as they recruit for their cause in the region and \n     in the world.\n\n  The report goes on to say that:\n\n       A premature American departure from Iraq would almost \n     certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further \n     deterioration of conditions. The near-term results would be a \n     significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional \n     destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al-Qaida \n     would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.\n\n  Or perhaps ask the Iraqis. BG Qassim Attam, the chief Iraqi spokesman \nfor the Baghdad security plan, said last Sunday the Iraqi military and \npolice force need more time before they are capable of assuming control \nof the country's security.\n  Or maybe our intelligence agencies which in the January National \nIntelligence Estimate concluded:\n\n       If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term \n     of this estimate, we judge this almost certainly would \n     lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of \n     sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to \n     the Iraqi government, and have adverse consequences for \n     national reconciliation. The ISF would be unlikely to \n     survive as a nonsectarian national institution; \n     neighboring countries might intervene openly in the \n     conflict; massive civilian casualties and forced \n     population displacement would be probable; AQI outside \n     Iraq would attempt to use parts of the country to plan \n     increased attacks in and out of Iraq, and spiraling \n     violence and political disarray in Iraq, along with \n     Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk and strengthen autonomy, \n     could prompt Turkey to launch a military incursion.\n\n  These are the likely consequences of a precipitous withdrawal. I hope \nthe supporters of such a move will tell us what they believe to be the \nlikely consequences of this course of action. Should their amendment \nbecome law and U.S. troops begin withdrawing, do they believe that Iraq \nwill become more or less stable? That al-Qaida will find it easier to \ngather, plan, and carry out attacks from Iraqi soil or that our \nwithdrawal will somehow make this less likely? That the Iraqi people \nbecome more or less safe? That genocide becomes a more remote \npossibility or ever likelier?\n  This fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone. It is greater than \nthat and, more important still, about whether America still has the \npolitical courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for \ndefeat with all the terrible things that accompany it. We cannot walk \naway gracefully from defeat in this war.\n  How we leave Iraq is very important. As the Iraq Study Group found:\n\n       If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range \n     consequences could eventually require the United States to \n     return.\n\n  General Petraeus and his commanders believe they have a strategy that \ncan, over time, lead to success in Iraq. General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker will come to Washington in September to report \non the status of their efforts and those of the Iraqis. They request \ntwo things of us: the time necessary to see whether their efforts can \nsucceed and the political courage to support them in their work. I \nbelieve we must give them both.\n  Right now, as we continue our debate on the war in Iraq, American \nsoldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen are fighting bravely and \ntenaciously in battles that are as dangerous, difficult, and \nconsequential as the great battles of our armed forces' storied past. \nAmericans who fought in France's hedgerow country; those who bled in \nthe sands and jungles of the Pacific Islands, who braved the onslaught \nof the Chinese Army in the frozen terrain of Korea and who fought a \ndesperate battle to retake Hue from the enemy during the Tet Offensive \nand against numerically superior forces in an isolated Marine base at \nKhe San, will recognize and honor the sacrifice of Americans who now \nfight with such valor, determination, and skill to defend the security \ninterests and the honor of our country in desperate battles in Iraq.\n  The hour is indeed late in Iraq. How we have arrived at this critical \nand\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\ndesperate moment has been well chronicled, and history's judgment about \nthe long catalog of mistakes in the prosecution of this war will be \nstern and unforgiving. But history will revere the honor and the \nsacrifice of those Americans who, despite the mistakes and the failures \nof both civilian and military leaders, shouldered a rifle and risked \neverything--everything--so the country they love so well might not \nsuffer the many dangerous consequences of defeat.\n  We read in our leading newspapers about those veterans of the Iraq \nwar who have organized to oppose its continuation. They have fought for \nAmerica's freedom, and they have every right to exercise their freedom, \nto oppose their Government's policies. I wish, though, that the press \nwould pay at least equal attention to the many veterans--many more \nveterans, many more veterans--who have fought, suffered, and witnessed \nthe ultimate sacrifice, the loss of their dearest friends, and yet are \nstill committed to America's success in Iraq, and to those who have \nserved multiple tours in this terrible war and yet reenlist because \nthey remain steadfast in the belief that they can achieve the mission \nthey have already risked so much to achieve. The American public, those \nwho still support our effort in Iraq and those who desire a quick end \nto it, should be daily reminded that although our country is deeply \ndivided about this war, most of the many thousands of Americans who \nhave suffered its worst miseries are still resolved--still resolved--\nthat it not end in an American defeat.\n  Our new counterinsurgency strategy is succeeding where our previous \ntactics failed us. We are taking from the enemy and holding territory \nthat was once given up for lost. Those who have falsely described \nGeneral Petraeus's efforts as ``staying the course'' are the real \nadvocates of continuing on the course of failure. Many of those who \ndecry the way we got into this war and the way we fought it are now \nadvocating a way out of it that suffers from more willful refusal to \nface facts than they accuse the administration of exhibiting. Although \nwe all seem to be united in recognizing the mistakes and failures of \nthe past, the proponents of reducing our forces in Iraq and keeping \nthem in secure bases from which they could occasionally launch search \nand destroy missions are proposing to return to the very tactics that \nhave brought us to the point of trying to salvage from the wreckage of \nthose mistakes a last best hope for success.\n  That is what General Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to \ncommand are trying to do--to fight smarter and better, in a way that \naddresses and doesn't strengthen the tactics of the enemy and to give \nthe Iraqis the security and opportunity to make the necessary political \ndecisions to save their country from the abyss of genocide and a \npermanent and spreading war. So far, the Maliki Government has not \nrisen to that challenge, and it must do so. It is obvious that America \nis losing our resolve to continue sacrificing its sons and daughters, \nwhile the Iraqi Government will not take the political risks to do what \nis plainly in the best interests of the Iraqi people.\n  But we do not fight only for the interest of Iraqis, Mr. President, \nwe fight for ours as well.\n  We, too, we Members of Congress, must face our responsibilities \nhonestly and bravely. What is asked of us is so less onerous than what \nwe have asked from our servicemen and women, but no less consequential. \nWe need not risk our lives, nor our health, but only our political \nadvantages so that General Petraeus has the time and resources he has \nasked for to follow up on his recent successes and help save Iraq and \nAmerica from the catastrophe that would be an American defeat. That is \nnot much to risk compared to the sacrifices made by Americans fighting \nin Iraq or the terrible consequences of our defeat. For if we withdraw \nfrom Iraq, if we choose to lose there, there is no doubt in my mind, no \ndoubt at all, that we will be back--in Iraq and elsewhere--in many more \ndesperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in \nAmerican lives and treasure.\n  Little is asked of us to help prevent this catastrophe, but so much \ndepends on our willingness to do so, on the sincerity of our pledge to \nserve America's interests before our own. The Americans who must make \nthe greatest sacrifices have earned the right to insist that we do our \nduty, as best as we can see it, and accept willingly and graciously \nwhatever small sacrifice we must make with our own personal and \npartisan ambitions. Ours is a noisy, restive, and contentious \nprofession. It has always been thus, and it always will be. But in this \nmoment of serious peril for America, we must all of us remember to whom \nand what we owe our first allegiance--to the security of the American \npeople and to the ideals upon which we our Nation was founded. That \nresponsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to \nhave discharged it honorably will, in the end, matter so much more to \nall of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim, electoral \nadvantage or office. The history of this country, after all, is not \nmerely a chronicle of political winners and losers, it is a judgment of \nwho has and who has not contributed to the continued success of \nAmerica, the greatest political experiment in human history.\n  It is my sincere wish that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nshould know in our hearts whatever mistakes we have made in our lives, \npersonally or politically, whatever acclaim we have achieved or \ndisappointment we have suffered, that we have, in the end, earned \nhistory's favor. I hope we might all have good reason to expect a \nkinder judgment of our flaws and follies because when it mattered most \nwe chose to put the interests of this great and good Nation before our \nown, and helped, in our own small way, preserve for all humanity the \nmagnificent and inspiring example of an assured, successful and ever \nadvancing America and the ideals that make us still the greatest Nation \non Earth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, these are very difficult days in our \nhistory, and I welcome the comments of my friend and colleague from \nArizona and his views about the position of the United States and its \npolicy with regard to Iraq. He reminds us that we ought to free \nourselves from these political considerations. This situation is too \ndemanding. The value of our involvement in terms of American service \nmen and women is too dear. The resources of this country are too \nimportant to squander them.\n  A number of us had serious reservations about involving the United \nStates in military engagement, a war with Iraq. A number of us still \nremember being on the Armed Services Committee and listening to the \ncombat commanders--the first panel in the Armed Services Committee on \nthat particular day. We listened to General Hoar, from Hyde Park, MA, a \nhighly decorated marine. We saw a number of decorations for bravery and \ncourage in Vietnam. We listened to General Nash, who had been in the \nfirst gulf war and had been our Commander in Bosnia. We read through \nGeneral Zinni's comments at that time. We listened to General Clark as \nwell. They are a group of combat commanders, and all urged that the \nUnited States keep its focus and attention on those who brought the \ntragedy to the United States on 9/11.\n  Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida were the real danger and threat to the \nUnited States. They were located in Afghanistan. They said that is \nwhere our focus and attention should be and that involvement in Iraq \nwould be clearly not in our interest. I remember those extraordinary \nwords of General Hoar, who said if we become involved in Iraq, the \nbattle in Baghdad that he foresaw would make the first fifteen minutes \nof ``Private Ryan'' look like a church picnic. ``Private Ryan'' was \nthat extraordinary film by Steven Spielberg. That made a very profound \nimpression upon me. That impression was enhanced when we listened to \nthe statements that were made by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld when they \ntalked about the weapons of mass destruction being on the north, south, \neast, and west of Baghdad.\n  The ranking member of our committee, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Carl Levin, had suggested that we give information \nto the inspectors. The response was that we cannot give it to the \ninspectors because Saddam Hussein will move them. Senator Levin said: \nWell, why don't we then watch where they are being\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\nmoved to, to be able to convince the world community about these \nweapons of mass destruction?\n  At least it was assumed by the response that was given at that time \nthat we were going to make available to the inspection teams the \nlocations of those weapons of mass destruction. We found out, \nhistorically, that never happened because there weren't any. So there \nwas important debate and discussion within the administration.\n  Should we follow the precedent of President Bush 1, which said this \nis a very important issue about going to war in Iraq, and rather than \nattaining it in the course of an election, let's have an election and \nthen have the Congress make a judgment and decision. The decision said \npublic opinion at that time was overwhelmingly to go to war, and we \nwere going to have that vote just prior to the election. I hope we are \ngoing to spare ourselves this idea that those of us who are supporting \nthe Levin-Reed amendment are looking at the politics of it. We saw the \nrealities of it when we made the mistake in going to war.\n  Secondly, we are very mindful that Iraq is a country with 26 million \nor 27 million people. It basically has an extraordinary history and \nincredible culture, amazing oil reserves, many different kinds of \nassets. But it was defeated 10 years ago by the United States of \nAmerica in a war--defeated. We had the air space, controlling that over \nIraq. We have the best fighting force in the world over there now for \nin excess of 4 years fighting.\n  As many of us have said, the military has done everything they were \ncalled to do. Does anybody doubt the finest military force which swept \nthrough western Europe and Africa and Italy, went through the Pacific \nin less time in World War II? We have had them over there bogged down \nin this country of 27 million people. Has anybody doubted that we need \nmore than a military resolution and solution, and the fact that we \ncontinue to keep the American service men and women in harm's way, that \nwe are somehow protecting them? Is that what we are being asked to \nbelieve after they have been over there for 4 years, when they are able \nand capable of doing everything which they have done, and done so \nbravely, I say it is time to bring them home. I say it is time to \nsupport the Levin amendment.\n  I hope during this debate we are not going to have the continued \nreferences on the issues of patriotism. We have worn out that argument, \nand we heard it all. It didn't work in the last election, where many of \nus who were strongly opposed to the war faced those kinds of drum \nbeats.\n  Secondly, our Founding Fathers had a very important view about what \nthe Senate of the United States should be and the importance of \nprotecting minority views in this body. This was going to be the \ninstitution that was going to be able to permit individuals who \nrepresented minority views, differing views, to be able to express \nthemselves. As we have learned historically so often, those expressed \nby a small group often become the majority accepted views in future \nyears. The Founding Fathers understood that. They wanted to make sure \nthose ideas and concepts were going to be protected.\n  What the Founding Fathers never anticipated was that rules were going \nto be used to abuse the American people's right to be able to express \nthemselves, particularly on issues of war and peace. That is what we \nare seeing now--delay for delay's sake, not delay so that we can have \ngreater information about what is happening over in Iraq. That is not \nthe issue. It is delay for delay's sake, a refusal to permit the Senate \nto express itself.\n  The House has expressed itself. Permit the Senate to express itself. \nLet's have a debate and discussion. The American people have made up \ntheir minds on this issue. We don't have to doubt that. The American \npeople have made up their minds. They want their elected \nrepresentatives to speak. I understand why the Republicans don't want \ntheir name on that rollcall as supporting this President, this war, at \nthis time. I understand it. That, my colleagues, is really what this is \nabout. People just refuse, don't want it.\n  Let's have some process or procedure, some way to avoid calling the \nroll and taking a stand on an issue of war and peace. That is what this \ndebate, at least for the next several hours, is going to be about.\n  Are we going to be able to permit this institution to function in the \nway it was intended to function; that is, at a time when the American \npeople have made a judgment and a decision on a particular issue, to be \nable to call the roll and have accountability, or whether we are going \nto be denied that. After all of the rhetoric about the role in history \nand the importance of this issue, that is where it comes down.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an extremely important debate. What is so \nimportant to understand is this is not an issue that is going away. \nThose of us who were opposed to the war continue to be opposed to it. \nListen to the argument about what the consequences are going to be. \nWhat are the consequences going to be now, what are they going to be in \n3 years, what are they going to be in 5 years, what are they going to \nbe in 7 years? Many of us are sufficiently uncertain about this issue \nthat we voted ``no'' in terms of giving to this President the authority \nto move this country and commit it in a way we have done so.\n  America is paying an enormous cost for a war we never should have \nfought, and it is time to bring it to an end. The war has divided us at \nhome. It has made us more isolated in the world. Never before, even in \nthe Vietnam war, has America taken such massive military action with so \nlittle international support.\n  As the intelligence community confirmed yet again today, the war has \nbecome a significant recruitment tool for al-Qaida. What was the surge \nintended to accomplish? The surge was meant to reduce violence; it has \nnot. To permit reconstruction; it has not. To promote reconciliation; \nit has not. All we have to do is read the Administration's own reports.\n  As the intelligence community confirmed yet again today, the war has \nbecome a significant recruitment tool for al-Qaida. The NIE says:\n\n       We assess that Al Qaeda's association with Al Qaeda Iraq \n     helps Al Qaeda to energize the broader Sunni extremist \n     community, raise resources, and recruit and indoctrinate \n     operatives, including for homeland attacks.\n\n  This has obviously made the war on terrorism harder, not easier, to \nwin. Nevertheless, the administration still continues to turn a deaf \near to all the voices calling for change. It continues to plead for \nmore and more time to pursue its failed course in Iraq. Republicans in \nthe Senate continue to filibuster any effort to outline a clear \ntimetable for the withdrawal of American troops.\n  The disastrous consequences of our policy could have been avoided if \nthe President and his advisers had asked the right questions before \nrushing headlong into an unnecessary and unjust war.\n  In my church, there are six principles which guide the determination \nof just war. They were developed by Saint Augustine in the 5th century \nand expanded by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. To be just, a \nwar must have a just cause, confronting a danger that is beyond \nquestion. It must be declared by a legitimate authority acting on \nbehalf of the people. It must be driven by the right intention, not \nulterior, self-interested motives. It must be a last resort. It must be \nproportional so that the harm inflicted does not outweigh the good \nachieved. And it must have a reasonable chance of success.\n  These are the sound criteria by which the President should have \njudged our war in Iraq, but he failed our men and women in uniform by \nrefusing to seek honest answers to these important questions before \nrecklessly plunging the Nation into war.\n  We now know with crystal clarity that the war in Iraq did not meet \nthese criteria. Saddam did not pose the kind of threat that justified \nthis war, but we went to war anyway without legitimate support from the \ninternational community. The administration was wrong to allow the \nanti-Iraq zealots in its ranks to exploit the 9/11 tragedy to make war \nagainst Iraq a higher priority than the war against terrorism in \nAfghanistan.\n  War with Iraq was most certainly not the last resort. All options \nwere not pursued. We should have given inspectors more time to reveal \nthat there were, in fact, no weapons of mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S9308]]\n\n  The human cost of this war has been unacceptable. More than 3,600 \nAmericans have been killed and nearly 27,000 wounded. Tens of thousands \nof Iraqis have been killed and Iraq has descended into civil war.\n  The administration's incompetence in waging this misguided war has \nleft no reasonable chance for success. Americans have spoken clearly \nand urgently about the need to end the war, and it is time for the \nPresident to listen to their pleas. We should end this war with a \nscaled-back mission for our troops and a clear timetable for withdrawal \nspecified in the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  America has been sadly diminished in the world because of this \ncolossal blunder. Anti-Americanism is on the rise. We have seemed to \nhave lost our way, our vision, and our confidence in the future.\n  In his farewell address to the Nation in January 1989, Ronald Reagan \ndescribed one of the singular triumphs of his Presidency: the recovery \nof America's standing and morale. I believe he was right when he said:\n\n       America is respected again in the world and looked to for \n     leadership.\n\n  Other nations understood that the best guarantee of peace and \nstability was for the United States to live up to its ideals as a \nbeacon of hope for the rest of the planet. We were admired for our \ndemocracy and respected for our economic strength.\n  Today, others have stopped listening to us the way they once did. At \nthe end of June, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that since \n2002, the image of the United States has plummeted throughout the \nworld. Our image is abysmal in most Muslim countries and continues to \ndecline among the people of many of America's oldest allies. We have \nstrained the extraordinary alliances that advance our ideals, as well \nas our interests.\n  At the root of much of the anti-Americanism that has surfaced in \nrecent years is the perception of American unilateralism in \ninternational affairs. I am astonished when some say it does not matter \nthat so many in the world no longer respect the United States. Of \ncourse, it matters. It matters to our security, as it has mattered \nsince the first days of our Republic.\n\n  The opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence acknowledges \nthe importance of a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. That \nrespect is as important today as it was when our Founders signed the \nDeclaration, affirming it on the first Fourth of July.\n  To restore America's standing and strength, we must end the war in \nIraq and recapture that combination of realism and idealism that has \ninspired Americans for generations. Ending this unacceptable war is \nessential to our security and to regaining our respect in the world.\n  The great challenges facing our fragile planet require an abundance \nof hope that only a united and a determined America can provide. \nAmerica has to lead. America has to inspire. But we cannot do so if we \nremain bogged down in Iraq's civil war. Might alone cannot make America \nright. By prescribing our own rules for the modern world, we have \ndeprived our great Nation of the moral claim that is the basis of our \nbeing, the purpose of our power, and we are paying an exorbitant price.\n  We can and sometimes must defend democracy by force, but we cannot \nimpose it by force. Democratic principles are universal, but democracy \nmust find its champions within each country's culture and traditions. \nWe need to end the war and regain a time when America is able to seek \ncommon ground with our friends. We need to renew the alliances that \nkept the world safe for human rights and human survival when the threat \nfor nuclear war was a clear and present danger.\n  We will always defend our interests, but we put them at grave risk \nwhen we act unilaterally in an independent world. We live in a time of \nenormous possibility and enormous risk. No nation is guaranteed a \nlimitless future of prosperity or security. We have to work for it. We \nhave to sacrifice for it. The sacrifices we are making in Iraq are no \nlonger worth the immense cost in human lives or the immense cost to our \nnational prestige and interest.\n  President Bush has squandered every opportunity to stabilize Iraq. \nAny honest assessment can realistically lead to only one conclusion: \nAmerica's interest will best be served when our military disengages \nfrom Iraq. Certainly, there will be violence when our combat troops \nleave, but there will be far more violence if we continue to police \nIraq's civil war indefinitely, as the President proposes.\n  Last week President Bush said, ``There is war fatigue in America. \nIt's affecting our psychology.'' For once the President is right. There \nis fatigue in America. Americans are tired of an administration whose \nill-conceived notion of a preventive war plunged this Nation into \nIraq's bloody civil war. Americans are tired of an administration that \ntold us the mission was accomplished when the tally of American dead \nwas only beginning to mount. Americans are tired of an administration \nthat continues to promise that hope is just around the corner and begs \nfor time for a policy that stands no chance of succeeding now, in \nSeptember, or ever.\n  Years ago, one of the giants of the Senate said:\n\n       Partisanship should stop at the water's edge.\n\n  Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, who was chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, worked closely with President Truman \nto lay the foundation for the foreign policy of the United States that \ncould guide us through the Cold War. Senator Vandenberg set the bar \nhigh for us in the Senate. We can aspire to that idea, but it is hard \nto achieve it in this Congress, as it has been in other Congresses.\n  Over the past few weeks, a shift has begun to take place, not as \nquickly as many of us feel is necessary, but nonetheless a change. Two \nweeks ago, in a speech on this floor, one of the successors of Arthur \nVandenberg as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, our \ndistinguished colleague from Indiana who was himself chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, reminded us that we do not owe the \nPresident our unquestioning agreement, but we do owe him and the \nAmerican people our constructive engagement.\n  Last Friday, Senator Lugar was joined by the senior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, in offering an amendment that would require the \nadministration to review our Iraq strategy and outline plans for an \norderly redeployment of our troops.\n  Two weeks ago in a statement on this floor, Senator Lugar said:\n\n       The United States has violated some basic national security \n     precepts during our military engagement in Iraq. We have \n     overestimated what the military can achieve, we have set \n     goals that are unrealistic, and we have inadequately factored \n     in the broader regional consequences of our actions. Perhaps \n     more critically, our focus on Iraq has diverted us from \n     opportunities to change the world in directions that \n     strengthen our national security.\n\n  I agree with that judgment, although I believe the Warner-Lugar \namendment does not go far enough in bringing this war to an end. It is \nundeniable that the American people have turned against this war, and \nit is imperative for the President to understand and accept that basic \nfact. We call for the President to end the war, not as Democrats or \nRepublicans, but as Americans who are deeply concerned about the \nperilous path on which the Nation is moving.\n  The American people understand there are no easy options, but they \nalso understand that the President's strategy simply does not protect \nU.S. interests. They understand it is wrong to buy time, to hand off \nthe mess in Iraq to the next President, and to keep our troops in \nharm's way with a policy that is not worthy of their sacrifice.\n  The overarching question is not whether we leave Iraq but how we \nleave Iraq. Disastrous choices and disastrous leadership have brought \nus to this dangerous point. We need to redefine our strategic goal in \nIraq and the region and have a realistic policy that supports that \nobjective. Whatever we do, it is going to be difficult, but we need to \nmove forward and begin the process, and soon.\n  We need to work with Iraq's neighbors to mitigate the damage the \nPresident's policies have created and minimize outside intervention, \nbut we cannot allow the fear of instability to put the brakes on the \nprocess of military disengagement.\n  Majorities in free countries bordering Iraq--Turkey, Jordan, and \nKuwait--say\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\nour troops should be removed. In Turkey, one of our most important \nallies in the region bordering Iraq, only 9 percent support our \nposition. Even in Iraq, just a few months ago, tens of thousands \nmarched demanding an end to what they call the ``American occupation.''\n  Each country in the region has an interest in Iraq's stability, and \nwe need to work with them diplomatically to find common ground and \nmitigate the damage caused by the President's failed policy. They need \nto come forward and work with our Nation and play a constructive role. \nPart of that effort needs to address the growing needs of the millions \nwho have fled the violence in Iraq.\n  More than 2 million Iraqis have fled to neighboring Jordan and Syria, \nand they are a destabilizing force in the region. The toll of suffering \nis immense. The danger these tragic circumstances pose for our national \nsecurity and the countries in the region hosting these vulnerable \npeople is real. The anger, the desperation, the hopelessness that \nenvelope these refugees is a breeding ground for terrorists and will \nundoubtedly be exploited by our enemies.\n  America has a fundamental moral obligation to help, especially those \nwho have supported America in Iraq. There is no doubt that Iraqis who \nhave worked in positions in direct support of the United States have \nbeen killed or injured in reprisals for that support. Many more Iraqis \nassociated with the United States have fled in fear and lost all they \nhad. We must keep faith with those who now have a bull's-eye on their \nback because of their ties with our country.\n  At a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year, \nIraqis offered chilling testimony about the dangers they face because \nof their association with America. A translator for U.S. and coalition \nforces told of seeing his name posted on death lists and said his \nfriends turned on him because they believed he was a traitor. An Iraqi \ntruck driver who delivered water to American forces said that terrorist \ngroups had targeted him, his wife, and their six children because of \nhis support for our soldiers.\n  Not only do we have an obligation to help those who have helped us, \nwe have a precedent for action. As the war in Vietnam drew to a close, \nPresident Ford emphasized America's duty to rescue those who had helped \nand assisted us. He called our response to that refugee crisis a \nreaffirmation of America's awareness of the roots and ideals of our \nsociety, and he personally greeted Vietnamese refugees on their arrival \nhere.\n  But, sadly, there are many Iraqis working with our Armed Forces, our \ndiplomatic mission, and our reconstruction teams in Iraq who have \nperformed valiantly but have been abandoned by our Government in their \nhour of need. Because of this support, insurgents have threatened and \nattacked their family members. Many have lost their lives, and many \nmore have lost their houses, property, and livelihood. For some, it \nwill be too dangerous to ever return.\n  America cannot resettle all of Iraq's refugees, but we must show \nleadership by accepting far greater numbers of refugees closely \nassociated with our military operation. Keeping our troops in Iraq \nindefinitely, as the President proposes, is simply not the solution to \nthe humanitarian and refugee crisis.\n  The consequences of the decisions we make here in Congress profoundly \naffect our military, their families, and the communities they have \nleft. We have an obligation to our soldiers to make sensible decisions \nthat will not place them needlessly in harm's way. In February, I spoke \nabout the 65 soldiers from Massachusetts who had died in Iraq. Since \nthen, Massachusetts has lost 10 more. We in Massachusetts feel \nespecially deeply the loss of these sons and daughters killed in Iraq:\n  PVT John Landry, SGT Adam Kennedy, CPT Anthony Palermo, SSG William \nCallahan, 1LT Ryan P. Jones, SPC Kyl Little, LCpl Walter O'Haire, LT \nAndrew Bacevich, SGT Daniel Newsome, and SSG Robb Rolfing.\n  We salute them, we pray for their families, we honor their sacrifice \ntoday and every day. We must insist on a policy worthy of their \nsacrifice.\n  The choice is clear: We can continue on the same failed course as \nthose who are leading this filibuster in the Senate are proposing or we \ncan adopt the Levin-Reed amendment and begin to bring our troops home \nto the hero's welcome they have earned and so obviously deserve.\n  For the sake of our men and women in uniform and our national \nsecurity, I hope we will change course and approve the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will respond very briefly to the \ncomments of the Senator from Massachusetts on several points in his \nthoughtful statement.\n  He talks about indefinite--indefinitely the United States Armed \nForces in Iraq. I think that is a far cry from what we are seeking \nhere. What we are seeking here is an opportunity for the surge strategy \nto have a chance to succeed, the last part of which was put in place a \nfew weeks ago. In fact, as the Washington Post points out:\n\n       Generals have devised a new strategy, believing they are \n     making fitful progress in calming Baghdad, training the Iraqi \n     army, and encouraging anti-al-Qaeda coalitions. Before \n     Congress begins managing rotation schedules and ordering \n     withdrawals, it should at least give those generals the \n     months they asked for to see whether their strategy can offer \n     some new hope.\n\n  It is not about indefinite presence, it is about giving a new \nstrategy a chance to succeed. I find it ironic, in a way, that I was \none of the greatest critics of the Rumsfeld-Casey strategy--which was \ndoomed to failure--which was a replica of the old search and destroy, \nwhere we went in and tried to kill people and left. This new strategy, \nthis new general, I think, is showing some signs of success, and--not \nleaving our forces there ``indefinitely''--allowing this strategy a \nchance to succeed is important.\n  There are very few people in the world I admire more than Natan \nSharansky, a man who knows the meaning of oppression, imprisonment, and \nsuffering, and he lives in the region. Natan Sharansky says:\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal--\n\n  Which is what we are talking about here, Mr. President, not an \nindefinite U.S. presence.\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by \n     comparison. Without U.S. troops in place to quell some of the \n     violence, Iranian-backed Shiite militias would dramatically \n     increase their attacks on Sunnis. Sunni militias backed by \n     the Saudis or others would retaliate in kind, drawing Iraq \n     more and more into a vicious cycle of violence. If Iraq \n     descended into a full-blown civil war, the chaos could \n     trigger similar clashes throughout the region as Sunni-Shiite \n     tensions spill across Iraq's borders. The death toll and \n     displacement of civilians could climb exponentially.\n\n  I am quoting from a piece Natan Sharansky wrote entitled ``Leave Iraq \nand Brace for a Bigger Bloodbath.''\n  We are not seeking an indefinite presence of the United States of \nAmerica in Iraq. We are seeking the opportunity for this surge to have \na chance to succeed. As General Lynch was quoted as saying:\n\n       Surge forces are giving us the capability we have now to \n     take the fight to the enemy. The enemy only responds to \n     force, and we now have that force. We can conduct detailed \n     kinetic strikes, we can do coordinate searches, and deny the \n     enemy sanctuaries. If those surge forces go away, that \n     capability goes away, and the security forces aren't ready \n     yet to do that mission.\n\n  I am not asking us to blindly follow the lead of our military \nleaders, but I am asking us to give the person whom we unanimously \nvoted to confirm as our military commander in Iraq, knowing full well \nwhat his strategy and surge was, a chance to succeed.\n  Time after time we hear General Lynch, the 3rd ID commander, say:\n\n       Pulling out before the mission was accomplished would be a \n     mess. You would find the enemy regularly gaining ground, \n     reestablishing sanctuaries, building more IEDs, and the \n     violence would escalate.\n\n  I share the frustration that all Americans do. This war has been \nmishandled. We have paid an enormous sacrifice, both the sacrifice of \nAmerican blood and treasure, but I believe, as the Washington Post \nsaid:\n\n       Before Congress begins managing rotation schedules and \n     ordering withdrawals, it should at least give these generals \n     the months they asked for to see whether their strategy can \n     offer some new hope.\n\n  I hope we understand what this debate is about, whether we will set a \ntimetable for troop withdrawals within\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\n120 days or whether we will give General Petraeus and his able \ncommanders and the brave young men and women who are serving an \nopportunity to see if this new strategy can succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had made arrangements with the managers \nto speak between 12 and 12:30 on another matter, the pending nomination \nof Judge Leslie Southwick for the Fifth Circuit. Others have spoken \nlonger, so I would ask unanimous consent that at this time I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes. I will try to make it a little \nshorter.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSpecter, Klobuchar, and Harkin, in that order, each be recognized for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business, and that at the conclusion of \nthose remarks the Senate stand in recess, as previously ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I need a little more time than that. I \nwill try to be shorter, but I would like the leeway of up to 15 \nminutes, as I had asked a few moments ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WEBB. I so modify my request, unless there is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                nomination of judge leslie h. southwick\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as stated a moment ago, I have sought \nrecognition to speak about the nomination of a Mississippi appellate \ncourt judge, Leslie H. Southwick, to be a Federal judge on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I have asked for this time because Judge \nSouthwick has been before the Judiciary Committee on several occasions \nand, because there is not much known about his record, there have been \ncertain objections raised. I have talked to our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, and when they hear about his record, they are \nsurprised that he is not moving through expeditiously. I thought it \nwould be important to take a few moments to acquaint Senators with his \nrecord and, beyond that, to acquaint the public with the pending \nnomination.\n  This Chamber has seen some very contentious moments, going back over \nthe past two decades, of partisanship on judicial nominations and \nextensive filibusters in 2004. Judges of both sides have been held up, \nwith Republican Presidential nominees held up by a Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate, and the same thing with President Clinton's nominees \nbeing held up by a Republican Senate. I moved and supported President \nClinton's nominees when they were qualified, and broke ranks. It seems \nto me that we ought to be looking at the merits of these nominees and \nnot engaging in partisanship to block nominations when courts such as \nthe Fifth Circuit are urgently in need of additional judicial manpower.\n  Judge Southwick has a very outstanding record, which I will detail \nbriefly. I also want to deal with the objections which have been raised \nagainst him, which I do not think are substantial--not disqualifiers by \nany sense. Judge Southwick is 57 years old--a perfect age to come to \nthe court of appeals, considering his background. He is a cum laude \ngraduate of Rice University in 1972 and has a law degree from the \nUniversity of Texas. He served as a law clerk on the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals, and then he was a law clerk to Judge Charles Clark on \nthe Fifth Circuit. So he has had experience in a clerk's capacity on \nthe court to which he has now been nominated. He practiced law for 12 \nyears, with a distinguished practice first as an associate and then as \na partner at a respected Mississippi law firm. He was Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General for the United States Department of Justice for 4 \nyears between 1989 and 1993.\n  He is an adjunct professor at the Mississippi School of Law. He has \nbeen a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity doing community service. He \nwas the recipient of the Judicial Excellence Award from the Mississippi \nState Bar and was rated by the American Bar Association as unanimously \nwell qualified.\n  When he was 42 years old, in 1992, he obtained an age waiver in order \nto join the Army Reserve. Then, in 2002, he volunteered, at the age of \n53, to transfer to a line combat unit, and he served on forward-\noperating bases near Najaf in Iraq.\n  Major General Harold Cross characterized Judge Southwick's \nvolunteering for duty in Iraq as follows:\n\n       This was a courageous move; as it was widely known at the \n     time that the 155th was nearly certain to mobilize for \n     overseas duties in the near future.\n\n  He is a man with an outstanding background and a courageous man who \nstepped forward at an advanced age to volunteer for service in Iraq, \nsomething that doesn't happen very often. It is a very rare occurrence.\n  On the Mississippi Court of Appeals, Judge Southwick has participated \nin between 6,000 and 7,000 cases--it is hard to be precise because many \nof them are unreported. He has written 985 opinions himself in the \ncourse of some 12 years.\n  The objections to Judge Southwick have focused on two cases. I wish \nto discuss very briefly these cases because I think, on their face, \nthey show there is not any reason this man should not be confirmed. I \ndiscussed these cases with him. I met with him at length and talked \nwith him about his judicial career and his service in Iraq. He is a \nmild-mannered professional who is a confident man--not flamboyant and \nnot overstated. We talked about legal issues. He is a solid lawyer and \nhas been a solid judge.\n  But the objections to him have focused on two cases. In one, a case \ncaptioned Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, the \ncase involved a State social worker, Ms. Bonnie Richmond, who used, \nadmittedly, an outrageous racial slur. The administrative board \nreviewing the matter to determine whether she should be dismissed or \ncensured made the determination that she should not be dismissed based \non the evidence before it: the racial slur was an isolated comment made \noutside the target's presence, it was followed by an apology which was \naccepted, and it did not result in significant disruption of the \nworkplace. Under these circumstances, the review board concluded the \ndismissal of a public employee was not warranted.\n  Under Mississippi law, the board's ruling could be reversed only if \nit was arbitrary and capricious. That is the general standard for \nreversing an administrative decision. The Mississippi Court of Appeals \napplied that standard, which is deferential to the fact finder, to \ndetermine if there was sufficient evidence to support it, and the court \ndecided that there was sufficient evidence.\n  This is a case where Judge Southwick did not write the opinion, only \nconcurred in the opinion. The Mississippi Supreme Court, while finding \nthat the administrative board needed to give more detailed reasons for \nits conclusions, nonetheless concluded that dismissal was not \nwarranted--agreeing with the appellate court on which Judge Southwick \nsat.\n  In the hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Southwick was \nasked about the case, and he said the slur was ``always offensive,'' \n``inherently and highly derogatory,'' and said there was ``no worse \nword.''\n  In the face of his overwhelmingly good record, how can a man be \ndenied confirmation on the basis of that situation?\n  There was another case about which Judge Southwick has been \nquestioned, S.B. v. L.W., a custody case where the chancellor awarded \nthe father custody of a child instead of the child's bisexual mother.\n  There were numerous factors leading to the award for the father, all \nof which were considered and weighed in favor of the father--steady \njob, higher income, owner of a large residence, and roots in the \ncommunity.\n  The objection came because the majority and concurring opinions--\nagain, not Judge Southwick's opinions, but ones that he joined--made \nreference to ``homosexual lifestyle.'' But, that is the same phrase \nused in Mississippi Supreme Court precedent. It is also a phrase which \nwas used by the majority in the Lawrence case, Lawrence v. Texas, and \nhas been used by many people, including President Clinton. So, there is \nhardly a basis for objecting to that kind of a reference, it seems to \nme.\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\n  My record on civil rights and on rights for people regardless of \nlifestyle is well accepted. I can't see how this man can be pilloried \non this basis. Moreover, he wrote an opinion, in a case called Hughey \nv. State of Mississippi, where he affirmed the trial court's decision \nto disallowed cross-examination as to the victim's sexual preference, \nsaying he recognized the victim was homosexual, but that was not \nrelevant to the defense and that such a line of inquiry would produce \nundue prejudice.\n  If there is a case where lifestyle is not involved, the trial court \nwould not allow a party to try to smear someone with a reference to his \nor her being a homosexual. Judge Southwick affirmed it, as anybody \nwould. But it shows his own sensitivity on this matter.\n  There are a couple of comments by some individuals who are very \nsupportive--one a woman named La'Verne Edney, a distinguished African-\nAmerican lawyer who is a partner in a prominent Jackson, Mississippi \nfirm. She had some very complimentary things to say about Judge \nSouthwick. He hired her as a clerk at a time when few others would hire \na young African-American woman. Similarly, a practicing attorney named \nPatrick Beasley, also African American, wrote about Judge Southwick's \nsensitivity on racial matters. Because of limited time, I ask unanimous \nconsent their statements be printed in the Record without my going into \nthem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2007.\n     Re letter of Endorsement for Leslie Southwick's appointment \n         to the United States Court of Appeals.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Judge Leslie Southwick has received a \n     nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit. I feel Judge Southwick would make an \n     outstanding addition to the Court of Appeals. I write to \n     support his application. My name is Patrick Earl Beasley. I \n     am a licensed attorney in Mississippi and Georgia and have \n     had the pleasure of knowing Judge Southwick for nearly a \n     decade; I was also employed as his law clerk while he served \n     as Presiding Judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals. \n     Additionally, we have both served as members of the \n     Mississippi Army National Guard. From these contacts, I \n     believe I can comment knowledgeably about his intelligence, \n     his character, and his commitment to excellence at large.\n       During my tenure as Judge Southwick's law clerk, I was \n     impressed by the constraint Judge Southwick exhibited as a \n     jurist on the appellate court. His most notable quality was \n     his commitment to following established precedent. This often \n     required him to put aside his personal convictions to uphold \n     his role on the Court. In my opinion, this is a quality more \n     jurists should emulate. His intellect is unsurpassed and be \n     approached his job as a public servant with the same vigor \n     and dedication that one would expect from a partner at a \n     major law firm.\n       Lastly, on the issue of fairness to minorities, I speak \n     from personal experience that Leslie Southwick is a good man \n     who has been kind to me for no ulterior reason. I am not from \n     an affluent family and have no political ties. While I \n     graduated in the top third of my law school class, there were \n     many individuals in my class with higher grade point averages \n     and with family ``pedigrees'' to match. Yet, despite all of \n     typical requirements for the clerkship that I lacked, Judge \n     Southwick gave me an opportunity. Despite all the press to \n     the contrary, Judge Southwick is a fair man and this is one \n     of the qualities that makes him an excellent choice for the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I would be pleased to provide any additional information in \n     support of Judge Leslie Southwick's appointment to the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. If you need any additional \n     information, please contact me at your convenience.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Patrick E. Beasley.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Brunini, Grantham, Grower &\n\n\n                                                  Hewes, PLLC,\n\n                               Jackson, Mississippi, June 5, 2007.\n     Re Judge Leslie Southwick Nomination.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am an African-American partner at \n     the law firm of Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, PLLC, \n     where Judge Southwick was once a member. I believe in \n     fairness for all people and salute our leaders for giving \n     their lives to assure that fairness. While I share the \n     sentiments of other African-Americans that the federal \n     judiciary needs to be more diverse, I believe that Judge \n     Southwick is imminently qualified for the United States Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals and write in support of his \n     nomination.\n       I met Judge Southwick during my third year of law school \n     when I interned with the Court of Appeals of Mississippi. \n     That internship allowed me an opportunity to work with most \n     of the Judges on the bench at that time. I was most impressed \n     with Judge Southwick because of his work ethic and his serene \n     personality. When I finished law school in 1996. I believed \n     that my chances for landing a clerkship were slim because \n     there was only one African-American Court of Appeals judge on \n     the bench at the time and there were very few Caucasian \n     judges during the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or \n     the Court of Appeals (which was fairly new) who had ever \n     hired African-American law clerks. In spite of the odds, I \n     applied for a clerkship. Judge Southwick granted me an \n     interview and hired me that same day. While Judge Southwick \n     had many applicants to choose from, he saw that I was \n     qualified for the position and granted me the opportunity.\n       During my tenure as clerk with the Court, Judge Southwick \n     thought through every issue and took every case seriously. He \n     earned a reputation for his well thought out opinions and his \n     ability to produce the highest number of opinions in a term. \n     It did not matter the parties' affiliation, color, or \n     stature--what mattered was what the law said and Judge \n     Southwick worked very hard to apply it fairly. Judge \n     Southwick valued my opinions and included me in all of the \n     discussions of issues presented for decision. Having worked \n     closely with Judge Southwick, I have no doubt that he is \n     fair, impartial, and has all of the other qualities necessary \n     to be an excellent addition to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       In addition to serving our State, Judge Southwick has also \n     honorably served our country. During his mission to Iraq in \n     2005, Southwick found the time to write me often to let me \n     know about his experiences there. Upon his return to the \n     United States, Judge Southwick shared with others his \n     humbling experience serving our country. It is clear from his \n     writings and speaking that he served with pride and dignity.\n       Over the years, Judge Southwick has earned the reputation \n     of being a person of high morals, dignity, and fairness. It \n     is unfortunate that there are some who have made him the \n     chosen sacrifice to promote agendas and have set out to taint \n     all that Judge Southwick has worked so hard to accomplish. I \n     am prayerful that those efforts will not preclude Judge \n     Southwick from serving as our next Judge on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n       If additional information is needed, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                A. La'Verne Edney.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I also ask unanimous consent that the following \nstatement highlighting praise for Judge Southwick be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Support for Leslie Southwick\n\n       Simply listening to those who know Judge Southwick best \n     makes it easy to understand why the American Bar Association \n     unanimously concluded that he is ``Well Qualified'' to serve \n     on the Circuit Court. Judge Southwick is free from bias and \n     committed to equal justice under the law.\n       La'Verne Edney, a distinguished African-American woman who \n     is a partner at a prominent Jackson, Mississippi law firm, a \n     member of the Magnolia Bar Association, the Mississippi Women \n     Lawyers' Association and a member of the Mississippi Task \n     Force for Gender Fairness, has shared her compelling story of \n     Judge Southwick giving her an opportunity when few would:\n       ``When I finished law school . . . I believed that my \n     chances for landing a clerkship were slim because there was \n     only one African-American Court of Appeals judge on the bench \n     at the time and there were very few Caucasian judges during \n     the history of the Mississippi Supreme Court or the Court of \n     Appeals . . . who had ever hired African-American law clerks. \n     . . . While Judge Southwick had many applicants to choose \n     from, he saw that I was qualified for the position and \n     granted me the opportunity.''\n       As a clerk, Ms. Edney observed, ``It did not matter the \n     parties' affiliation, color or stature--what mattered was \n     what the law said and Judge Southwick worked very hard to \n     apply it fairly. Judge Southwick valued my opinions and \n     included me in all of the discussions of issues presented for \n     discussion. Having worked closely with Judge Southwick, I \n     have no doubt that he is fair, impartial, and has all of the \n     other qualities necessary to be an excellent addition to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.''\n       Patrick E. Beasley, a practicing attorney in Jackson, \n     Mississippi, who also happens to be African American, \n     endorsed Judge Southwick for, among other qualities, his \n     fairness to minorities. Beasley wrote, ``I speak from \n     personal experience that Leslie Southwick is a good man who \n     has been kind to me for no ulterior reason. I am not from an \n     affluent family and have no political ties. While I graduated \n     in the top third of my law school class, there were many \n     individuals in my class with higher grade point averages and \n     with family `pedigrees' to match. Yet, despite all of the \n     typical requirements for the clerkship that I lacked, Judge \n     Southwick gave me an opportunity. Despite all the press to \n     the contrary, Judge Southwick is a fair man and this is one \n     of the qualities that\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\n     makes him an excellent choice for the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.''\n       Jose Alberto Cantu, a self-described lifelong Democrat, \n     expressed outrage over what he considered to be the unfair \n     characterization of his friend from Edinburg, Texas. After \n     reading an article in the Houston Chronicle, he wrote, ``I \n     was shocked to read about the opposition to his nomination on \n     this basis [race]. I was a classmate of Judge Southwick in \n     high school and knew him very well. I always found him to be \n     extremely polite and absolutely fair with everyone. What the \n     paper and the political activist referenced in the article \n     imply is that Judge Southwick is a racist because of the \n     ruling on the Court. This is absolutely ridiculous and \n     totally unfair. The Valley has a large Hispanic population, \n     and Leslie never showed the type of discriminatory attitudes \n     that were implied in the article. To the contrary, I remember \n     him as treating everyone fairly and with respect.''\n       John C. Hengan, a lifelong Democrat and former Chief of \n     Staff to a Democratic Governor of Mississippi strongly \n     refutes the mischaracterizations of Judge Southwick's \n     character. ``I cannot disagree more strongly with the \n     personal attacks that are being made against his character, \n     integrity, or fitness for office, or about his commitment to \n     civil rights for all people regardless of their race, color, \n     sex, creed, religion, or national origin. It is an \n     abomination that he should have to experience these unfair \n     and unjust personal attacks because they are quite simply \n     untrue and cannot be made by anyone who has had the \n     opportunity to meet, work, or be around Leslie for even an \n     abbreviated period of time.''\n       Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice James L. \n     Robertson, who has known Judge Southwick for 20 years, \n     attests to the judge's commitment to fairness. He observed, \n     ``Importantly, there is not a hint of racism in Judge \n     Southwick's being. I am certain that Chief Judge Leslie D. \n     King, and Judge Tyree Irving, his two African-American \n     colleagues on the Court of Appeals with whom Judge Southwick \n     served for many years, would be the first to tell you this, \n     were they not prohibited [by judicial ethics canons] from \n     such endorsements. . . . It is common knowledge in this area \n     that I do not support President Bush on very many of his \n     policy initiatives. I voted for Vice President Gore in 2000, \n     and I voted for Senator Kerry in 2004. But even a blind hog \n     will root up an acorn every once in a while. Judge Leslie \n     Southwick just might turn out to be a golden nugget.''\n       Phillip L. McIntosh, Associate Dean at the Mississippi \n     College School of Law, noted that Judge Southwick was \n     unanimously approved for a faculty position by ``a \n     politically and racially diverse faculty'' and that ``not one \n     note of concern about Judge Southwick's integrity, fairness, \n     or impartiality was sounded.''\n       Robert H Canizaro, a self-described ``Liberal Democrat,'' \n     expressed his ``strong[ ] support'' for Judge Southwick as \n     ``an intelligent, dedicated, hard working, moderate judge who \n     respects the rights of all.'' Canizaro stated that the New \n     York Times's suggestion to the contrary is ``ludicrous.''\n       Judge Southwick's temperament is what we hope for in a \n     federal judge.\n       Justice Kay B. Cobb, former Presiding Justice of the \n     Supreme Court of Mississippi, has written, ``Judge \n     Southwick's scholarship and character are stellar. The \n     opinions he wrote during his ten years on the Mississippi \n     Court of Appeals reflect his thoroughness and fairness as \n     well as the depth of his knowledge and the quality and \n     clarity of his reasoning and writing. . . . His awareness and \n     attention to promoting fairness and equality with regard to \n     race and gender are exemplary. Our country needs \n     conscientious and independent judges of impeccable integrity \n     and I cannot think of anyone who better qualifies for this \n     appointment!''\n       Jim Rosenblatt, Dean of the Mississippi College of Law, \n     wrote, ``In all my dealings with Leslie Southwick he has \n     shown himself to be respectful of others no matter their \n     station in life, their religious convictions, or their ethnic \n     background. He takes a genuine interest in people and spends \n     a great deal of time listening to others and little time \n     talking about himself. He is modest and self-effacing . . .''\n       Bronson E. Newburger, who worked with Judge Southwick on \n     the Board of the Jackson Servant Leadership Corps, an \n     organization that places recent college graduates in a \n     communal home where they can devote themselves full time to \n     serving the underprivileged in the inner city, came to know \n     Judge Southwick well. ``I found him to be levelheaded, \n     sensitive, and compassionate . . . He is a decent, fair, and \n     compassionate public servant dedicated to equal rights and \n     protections for all.\n       David J. Anderson, a retired career civil servant who \n     worked with Judge Southwick at the Justice Department, was \n     similarly impressed with Judge Southwick's character. Mr. \n     Anderson, who describes himself as ``a Democrat'' who is \n     ``moderate to liberal'' in his politics, wrote ``I have to \n     say that Leslie Southwick was an outstanding public servant, \n     head and shoulders above most political appointees I served \n     with during my 35 years in government. He was intelligent, \n     thoughtful, fair minded, and devoted to the rule of law. He \n     was no ideologue. I never saw him make a decision on any \n     basis other than the merits of a particular issue or \n     problem.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little more than 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, in the last 3\\1/2\\ minutes I have, I wish \nto point out what has happened in this matter.\n  Chairman Leahy advised me this nomination would go through the \nJudiciary Committee on a voice vote. Then, when that effort was made, \nSenator Feingold objected and any member of the Judiciary Committee has \nthe right to hold over a nominee for 1 week. So, it did not go through \non a voice vote, notwithstanding the fact that Senator Leahy, the \nchairman, said that was his plan.\n  Senator McConnell has advised that the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nhad said the nomination would be confirmed before the Memorial Day \nrecess, which is some time ago now. So, this nomination was on the \nbrink of confirmation, according to the chairman's statement that it \nwould go through committee on a voice vote. He didn't expect someone to \nraise an objection, and he was powerless to move it on a voice vote \nonce an objection was raised, but that was his expectation and mine.\n  And, as I said, the majority leader told the Republican leader there \nwould be a confirmation before the Memorial Day recess.\n  It is my hope we will not allow partisanship to once again grip this \nbody. This Senate, under Republican control, wouldn't give hearings to \nPresident Clinton's nominees and wouldn't bring them up for floor \nvotes. I objected to that, bucking my party, crossing party lines, and \nvoting for Clinton nominees.\n  We had protracted filibusters in 2004 and threats of the \nConstitutional--or ``nuclear''--option. I hope we do not go back to \nthat. This body, as we all know, works on unanimous consent. Any \nSenator can raise an objection to dispensing with a reading of an \namendment or a reading of the record, as we saw during the immigration \ndebate, and can tie up this Senate endlessly if someone wants to impede \nthe work of the Senate. It is my hope we will not descend to that.\n  We have very important matters to take up--Iraq, the Department of \nDefense reauthorization bill, the override of the President's veto on \nstem cells, and many appropriations bills. This man, Judge Southwick--I \nhave gone through his record in detail. My own record on the Judiciary \nCommittee is one of nonpartisanship. If I have found nominees submitted \nby Republican Presidents to be objectionable, I have not hesitated to \nsay so. But this man has an impeccable record, an outstanding record, \nwith 985 authored opinions. The two opinions that have been called into \nquestion are opinions which he didn't write, but merely joined, on \nmatters which--while they might have been articulated differently, \nmight have been more sensitive--certainly are not disqualifiers. This \nman ought to be confirmed. I have taken the time to go into some detail \non his record because I have told my colleagues about his record and \nmany people have been surprised there is controversy.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania for sitting \novertime and my colleague from Minnesota for her patience--I think she \nhas been patient--and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the Senate is in its second week of \ndebate on the future of U.S. military engagement in Iraq. It is a very \ntimely and momentous debate which reflects the American people's \nconcerns with events in Iraq, and I am hopeful more of my colleagues \nwill join those of us who have voted over and over again to limit the \nU.S. engagement in Iraq.\n  I opposed this war from the start, and I have long advocated for \nresponsible change of course in the administration's policy. I believe \nthe best that we can do for our troops, for our national interests, and \nfor the Iraqis themselves is to begin transitioning to Iraqi authority \nand to begin bringing our troops home in a responsible way, to remove \nthe bulk of U.S. combat forces by the spring of next year.\n  I remember being at the funeral for one of our brave, fallen soldiers \nin Minnesota and hearing a priest say--he noted that this young man was \na strong, strapping boy. He was over 6 feet tall. He said the kids we \nare sending over there may be over 6 feet tall,\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\nbut they are still our children. If they are over 6 feet tall, then our \nleaders must be 8 feet tall in making these difficult decisions. I hope \nthis week this Congress stands tall, this Senate stands tall and makes \nthe right decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9313-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9313-S9314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              POOL SAFETY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about another \nsubject, and that is an accident that happened in Minnesota over the \nFourth of July break. It brought home to me and many people in my State \nthat there are many ways that Government must act to protect its \ncitizens. Some of them are larger than life--the debate over the \nstrategy in Iraq. Others are smaller and quieter, a little girl lying \nmaimed in a hospital bed after an accident that a simple law could have \nprevented.\n  We are in the midst of the summer swimming season in our State and \nall over the country, a time when children of all ages take to the \nswimming pools--as they should. Today, I wish to speak about the \nterrible injury suffered by a young girl in my State only weeks ago. \nThat is why I feel such a sense of urgency about moving the legislation \nthat is currently pending in the Senate--it is going to be considered \nby the Commerce Committee this week--which would help prevent serious \ninjury or death for other children in the future.\n  Abigail Taylor, known as Abby, is a 6-year-old girl from suburban \nMinnesota, a girl with big brown eyes and a dazzling smile who loved to \nswim. Last month Abby went swimming at a local pool. She was in the \nshallow wading pool when she sat over an open drain hole and had most \nof her intestines torn out by the drain's powerful suction.\n  Somehow this little 6-year-old girl managed to stand up and take a \nfew steps before collapsing along the side of the wading pool. Now, \nnearly 3 weeks later, she remains hospitalized after undergoing several \nsurgeries. She will survive, thanks to a miracle, her parents believe, \nbut it is expected that she will need a feeding tube for the rest of \nher life. All of this, simply because she spent a sunny summer day at a \npool.\n  What happened to this little 6-year-old girl is horrific. My own \ndaughter's name is Abigail, and hearing about this incident brings \nchills to any parent. When I first saw this story about this in our \nlocal newspaper, I had to stop reading because the details of it were \nso disturbing. They would be for any parent.\n  I look at this first as a mother. Your daughter is enjoying a \nbeautiful summer day having fun playing at the local pool. It is not \neven a deep pool. It is just a kiddy pool. But suddenly something \nterrible happens, and your life is changed forever.\n  When it was first reported, like everyone else, I thought this was \nsome kind of freak, one-of-a-kind incident. I never thought I would be \nspending time talking about it on the Senate floor. But then I learned \nthat, unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened. As \nit turns out, although most pools are safe and well maintained, this \ntype of incident has happened too many times before, resulting in the \ndeaths of several dozen children over the past 15 years.\n  It even has a name: pool entrapment. It occurs when a child becomes \nstuck on a drain and is unable to escape due to the high velocity and \npressure of the water being sucked into the drain.\n  Another scenario occurs when hair or jewelry gets sucked into the \ndrain, making it difficult for a child to pull free. According to the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, the pressure on some pool drains \ncan be as strong as 300 pounds per inch. In fact, several years ago, \nthe Commission produced an educational video on this danger.\n  It showed a muscular man trying to pull an inflatable ball off a \nswimming pool drain. Using both arms and all of his might, he couldn't \ndo it; the suction force was just too powerful.\n  Two years ago the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report \nsaying it was aware of at least 27 deaths and many more emergency room \nvisits and hospitalizations due to this entrapment. Most of these \nvictims were children. It is unclear how many actual entrapment \nincidents have not resulted in death but severe injury because \nentrapment is a little-known risk. It is possible that many swimming \npool drowning deaths or other injuries have not been classified as \ncaused by entrapment.\n  I think it is curious that I know of three of these incidents: the \none in Minnesota, the one I am about to talk about involving Jim \nBaker's granddaughter, and another one in which former Senator Edwards \nrepresented a family with the tragic incident involving a pool drain.\n  You know, it never even crosses a parent's mind that at the bottom of \nthe kiddy pool is something that has enough force and will cause death \nor severe injury as it did to Abby Taylor. But it should never have \nhappened, and we must do everything we can to make sure it never \nhappens again to any child because it is preventable.\n  There are several simple ways, as we will discuss in the Commerce \nCommittee hearing this week, for manufacturers to reduce entrapment \nrisk at pools: installing antientanglement and antientrapment drain \ncovers; installing multiple drains, reducing suction force for each \ndrain; installing a gravity flow or a safety vacuum release system, \nthat prevents entrapment by automatically shutting off the pool pump.\n  These antientrapment measures are simple and inexpensive, and they \ncan literally save children's lives. I saw a drain today that costs 50 \nbucks. That, plus adequate monthly inspection, can save lives.\n  There are also reasonable measures that Congress can take to help \nstrengthen pool safety standards and prevent this kind of terrible \nincident from ever happening again to another child. The Commerce \nCommittee has jurisdiction over product safety. It is led by two of my \ncolleagues, Senators Inouye and Stevens, who have been leaders on this \nissue. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the legislation introduced \nlast week by Senators Pryor, Stevens, Dodd, and myself, which would \nstrengthen the safety standards for America's swimming pools and spas \nso we can prevent the kind of incident that happened to 6-year-old Abby \nTaylor.\n  As chairman of the Consumer Subcommittee, Senator Pryor has pushed to \nhave this legislation included on the agenda for this week's committee \nmarkup. This legislation is called the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and \nSafety Act, named in memory of the 7-year-old granddaughter of former \nSecretary of State James Baker.\n  It was an honor to meet this morning with Graeme's mother. She was \nhere in her daughter's memory talking to Members of Congress. Several \nyears ago, Graeme died as a result of suction entrapment in a spa. Her \nbody was held underwater by the force of the suction, and it took two \nadults to help pry her free from the drain. But it was too late. She \nhad already drowned.\n  This tragedy occurred at a graduation party that was well supervised \nby scores of adults. The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the \nlikelihood that any other child will end up like Graeme Baker or Abby \nTaylor.\n  This same bill was introduced last year. The Senate passed it by \nunanimous consent. But in the closing days of the last Congress, it \nfailed to pass the House of Representatives by a narrow margin. Now, \nwhat do you say when you talk, as I did, to the father of this little \ngirl, Abby Taylor, who is lying maimed in a hospital bed losing her \nintestines? You tell them that: Well, we got it through the Senate, but \nthe House just did not have the votes to do it.\n\n  These parents are so courageous that they have moved on from that. \nThey want her severe injuries to be discussed today. They are not \nafraid to have us talking about what happened to their little daughter \nbecause they want it never to happen to another child.\n  This year this legislation must pass. The legislation has several \nimportant provisions. It would take Consumer Product Safety Commission \nstandards for pool drains, which are now voluntary, and make them \nmandatory.\n  It would prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution of drain \ncovers that do not meet the standards established by the Commission. It \nis important to strengthen the legislation to make sure that not only \nnew pools but all public pools meet the same standard.\n  The legislation also provides incentives for States to adopt their \nown\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\ncomprehensive pool safety laws regarding certain water safety devices, \nthat they be installed to protect children. It also would contain \ngrants to create these incentives.\n  There is a saying that when an accident happens that could reasonably \nhave been prevented, then it is not accurate to call it an accident; it \nis actually a failure.\n  In the case of injuries and deaths caused by pool entrapment, it is \nnot a failure by children or by their parents, it is a failure of our \nproduct safety laws. This means it is also a failure that it is within \nour power to correct, a problem that can be fixed through reasonable \nmeasures contained in this legislation.\n  We deal with issues larger than life, as we will today as we debate \nthe war in Iraq. But sometimes a simple, small change in a law will \nsave the life of a small child. Let's never forget what happened to \ninnocent children such as Abby Taylor and Graeme Baker. For the health \nand safety of all of our children, I urge the Senate to take quick \naction to approve this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9314-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9314-S9317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DR. NORMAN BORLAUG'S RECEIPT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in a very beautiful ceremony in the \nRotunda of the Capitol this morning, Dr. Norman Borlaug was presented \nwith the Congressional Gold Medal, America's highest civilian award.\n  Dr. Borlaug, of course, as we know, is the father of the Green \nRevolution and the winner of the Nobel Peace Price in 1970. In 1986 he \nestablished a World Food Prize, which is headquartered in my home State \nof Iowa, to recognize individuals who have improved the quality, \nquantity, and availability of food around the globe.\n  Dr. Borlaug was born and raised in Iowa, earned his Ph.D. in plant \npathology and genetics at the University of Minnesota in 1942. After \ngraduation he went to work in Mexico where he developed high-yield, \ndisease-resistant varieties of wheat, which dramatically increased food \nproduction.\n  He then went on to introduce these and other high-yield wheat \nvarieties in Pakistan and India, which had the effect of nearly \ndoubling production in those countries, saving countless lives.\n  It was pointed out this morning that in the previous 4,000 years, \nrice production in those countries had leveled off, but in the 4 years \nafter Dr. Borlaug introduced his new strains of rice, they actually \ndoubled that production. Yields that had been basically unchanged for \n4,000 years, they doubled in 4 years with new genetics and practices.\n  Iowans are a humble people. But we are very proud of the long line of \nIowans who have been extraordinary leaders in bringing food to a hungry \nworld, people such as Herbert Hoover, Henry C. Wallace, Henry A. \nWallace, and first and foremost, Dr. Norman Borlaug.\n  When I think of Dr. Borlaug's achievements, I am reminded of those \nfamous words in the Book of Proverbs:\n\n       Where there is no vision, the people perish.\n       More than half a century ago, Dr. Borlaug surveyed a world \n     where starvation and malnourishment were rampant. And he had \n     a vision of a Green Revolution. Because of that vision, \n     upwards of 1 billion lives were saved across the globe, which \n     is an accomplishment of staggering proportions.\n\n  Well, that's not bad for a kid who began his education in a one-room \nrural schoolhouse near Cresco, IA.\n  Norman Borlaug has been called a great scientist, a great agronomist, \nand a great humanitarian. Of course, he is all of those things. He is \nalso a great persuader, a man who time and again overcame political and \ncultural challenges in order to spread his revolution, first in Mexico, \nthen in Asia, and now Africa.\n  The good news is that at the age of 93, Dr. Borlaug is still going \nstrong, still curious and creative, still full of dreams for changing \nthe world. As I said, he started the World Food Prize and has devoted a \ngreat deal of time and energy to strengthen and elevate that initiative \nwith crucial help from John Ruan of Des Moines. There is, for example, \nthe World Food Prize Borlaug-Ruan Internship Program, in which young \npeople, about 100 every year, take part. They present papers on \nresearch in different parts of the world, and then a number are chosen \nand are sent as interns to places around the world to learn and begin \nthe process, as Norman Borlaug did, of working with people to expand \nfood production.\n  Let me just read from one paragraph of Norman Borlaug's statement on \nthe occasion of the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony this morning on \nJuly 17.\n  He ended his remarks by saying:\n\n       My plea today to the members of Congress and to the \n     Administration is to re-commit the United States to more \n     dynamic and generous programs of official development \n     assistance in agriculture for Third World nations, as was \n     done in the 1960s and 1970s. Ever-shrinking foreign aid \n     budgets in support of smallholder agriculture, and especially \n     to multilateral research and development organizations such \n     as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center \n     (CIMMYT) where I have worked for 40 years, as well as its \n     sister research institutes under the Consultative Group for \n     International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), are not in our \n     nation's best interest, nor do they represent our finest \n     traditions.\n\n  In other words, he is saying cuts to these programs that we are \nmaking are not in our Nation's best interests and do not represent our \nfinest traditions.\n\n       As you chart the course of this great nation\n\n  Dr. Borlaug tells us--\n\n     for the future benefit of our children, grand-children, and \n     great-grandchildren, I ask you to think more boldly and \n     humanely about the Third World and develop a new version of \n     the Marshall plan, this time not to rescue a war-torn Europe, \n     but now to help the nearly one billion, mostly rural poor \n     people still trapped in hunger and misery. It is within \n     America's technical and financial power to help end this \n     human tragedy and injustice, if we set our hearts and minds \n     to the task.\n\n  One more thing that Norman Borlaug said this morning, is this: When \npeople are in misery and they are hungry and they do not have enough to \neat, all kinds of ``isms'' begin to flourish, including terrorism.\n  He said, if we really want to get at the root cause of terrorism and \nthe recruitment of terrorists, feed a hungry world. Make sure everyone \nhas enough to eat.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the full statement of \nNorman E. Borlaug on the occasion of his receiving the Congressional \nGold Medal this morning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNorman E. Borlaug--Statement on the occasion of the Congressional Gold \n          Medal Ceremony, United States Capitol, July 17, 2007\n\n       It is a great honor to be awarded the Congressional Gold \n     Medal, in recognition of my work to feed a hungry world. I \n     thank members of Congress for giving me an opportunity to \n     comment on the challenges and complexities of feeding a world \n     of 10 billion people who I expect will be living on the \n     planet Earth sometime this century.\n       When I was born--in 1914--there were only 1.6 billion \n     people on Earth. Today, we are 6.5 billion and growing by 80 \n     million per year. The task of feeding this growing population \n     has been made more complex, since agriculture is now being \n     asked not only to produce food, feed and fiber, but also raw \n     materials for bio-fuels. Thus, there is no room for \n     complacency for those of us working on the food front.\n       I am now in my 63rd year of continuous involvement in \n     agricultural research and production in low-income, food-\n     deficit developing countries. I have worked with many \n     scientists, political leaders, and farmers to transform food \n     production systems. Any achievements I have made have been \n     possible through my participation in this army of hunger \n     fighters. There are too many to name, but you know who you \n     are. I thank you for your dedication and assistance all of \n     these years. I also thank my family, and my late wife \n     Margaret, for the understanding and unselfish support you \n     have given me\n       The Green Revolution was a great historic success. In 1960, \n     perhaps 60 percent of the world's people felt hunger during \n     some portion of the year. By the year 2000, the proportion of \n     hungry in the world had dropped to 14 percent of the total \n     population. Still, this figure translated to 850 million men, \n     women and children who lacked sufficient calories and protein \n     to grow strong and healthy bodies. Thus, despite the \n     successes of the Green Revolution, the battle to ensure food \n     security for hundreds of millions of miserably poor people is \n     far from won.\n     The Green revolution\n       The breakthroughs in wheat and rice production in Asia in \n     the mid-1960s, which came to be known as the Green \n     Revolution, symbolized the beginning of a process of using \n     agricultural science to develop modern techniques for the \n     Third World. It began in Mexico with the ``quiet'' wheat \n     revolution in the late 1950s. During the 1960s and 1970s, \n     India,\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\n     Pakistan, and the Philippines received world attention for \n     their agricultural progress. In the 1980s and 1990s, China, \n     home to one fifth of the world's people, has been the \n     greatest success story. China today is the world's biggest \n     food producer and its crop yields are approaching those of \n     the United States with every successive year. However, it is \n     almost certain, that China and India--home to one third of \n     the world's people--will become the largest agricultural \n     importers in the coming decades, as their economies shift \n     from being agrarian to industrial.\n       Critics of modern agricultural technology invariably turn a \n     blind eye on what the world would have been like without the \n     technological advances that have occurred, largely during the \n     past 50 years. For those whose main concern is protecting the \n     ``environment,'' let's look at the positive impact that the \n     application of science-based technology has had on land use. \n     If the global cereal yields of 1950 still prevailed in 2000 \n     we would have needed nearly 1.2 billion ha of additional land \n     of the same quality--instead of the 660 million ha that was \n     used--to achieve the global harvest of that year. Obviously, \n     such a surplus of land was not available, and certainly not \n     in populous Asia, where the population had increased from 1.2 \n     to 3.8 billion over this period. Moreover, if more \n     environmentally fragile land had been brought into \n     agricultural production, the impact on soil erosion, loss of \n     forests and grasslands, biodiversity and extinction of \n     wildlife species would have been enormous and disastrous.\n       At least in the foreseeable future, plants--and especially \n     the cereals--will continue to supply much of our increased \n     food demand, both for direct human consumption and as \n     livestock feed to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for meat \n     in the newly industrializing countries. It is likely that an \n     additional 1 billion metric tons of grain will be needed \n     annually by 2025, just to feed the world, let alone fuel its \n     vehicles. Most of this increase must come from lands already \n     in production through yield improvements. Fortunately, such \n     productivity improvements in crop management can be made all \n     along the line--in plant breeding, crop management, tillage, \n     water use, fertilization, weed and pest control, and \n     harvesting.\n     Africa's food production challenges\n       More than any other region of the world, African food \n     production is in crisis. High rates of population growth and \n     little application of improved production technology during \n     the last two decades resulted in declining per capita food \n     production, escalating food deficits, deteriorating \n     nutritional levels, especially among the rural poor, and \n     devastating environmental degradation. While there are \n     more signs since 2000 that smallholder food production is \n     beginning to turn around, this recovery is still very \n     fragile.\n       Sub-Saharan Africa's extreme poverty, poor soils, uncertain \n     rainfall, increasing population pressures, changing ownership \n     patterns for land and cattle, political and social turmoil, \n     shortages of trained agriculturalists, and weaknesses in \n     research and technology delivery systems all make the task of \n     agricultural development more difficult. But we should also \n     realize that to a considerable extent, the present food \n     crisis is the result of the long-time neglect of agriculture \n     by political leaders. Even though agriculture provides \n     livelihoods to 70-85 percent of the people in most countries, \n     agricultural and rural development has been given low \n     priority. Investments in food distribution and marketing \n     systems and in agricultural research and education are \n     woefully inadequate. Furthermore, many governments pursued \n     and continue to pursue a policy of providing cheap food for \n     the politically volatile urban dwellers at the expense of \n     production incentives for farmers.\n       In 1986 I became involved in food crop technology transfer \n     projects in sub-Saharan Africa, sponsored by the Nippon \n     Foundation and its Chairman, the late Ryoichi Sasakawa, and \n     enthusiastically supported by former U.S. President Jimmy \n     Carter. Our joint program is known as Sasakawa-Global 2000, \n     and has operated in 14 sub-Saharan African countries the past \n     20 years. We have assisted several million small-scale \n     farmers to grow extension demonstration plots for basic food \n     crops: maize, rice, sorghum, millet, wheat, cassava, and \n     grain legumes.\n       The recommended production technologies come from national \n     and international agricultural research organizations, and \n     include: (1) the use of the best available commercial \n     varieties or hybrids (2) proper land preparation and seeding \n     to achieve good stand establishment, (3) proper application \n     of the appropriate fertilizers and, when needed, crop \n     protection chemicals, (4) timely weed control, and (5) \n     moisture conservation and/or better water use if under \n     irrigation. We also work with participating farm families to \n     improve on-farm storage of agricultural production, both to \n     reduce grain losses due to spoilage and infestation and to \n     allow farmers to hold stocks longer to exploit periods when \n     prices in the marketplace are more favorable. Virtually \n     without exception, farmers obtain grain yields that are two \n     to three times higher on their demonstration plots than has \n     been traditionally the case. Farmers' enthusiasm is high and \n     political leaders are taking much interest in the program.\n       Despite the formidable challenges in Africa, the elements \n     that worked in Latin America and Asia will also work there. \n     With more effective seed, fertilizer supply and marketing \n     systems, hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers in \n     Africa can make great strides in improving the nutritional \n     and economic well being of their populations. The biggest \n     bottleneck that must be overcome is lack of infrastructure, \n     especially roads and transport, but also potable water and \n     electricity. In particular, improved transport systems would \n     greatly accelerate agricultural production, break down tribal \n     animosities, and help establish rural schools and clinics in \n     areas where teachers and health practitioners are heretofore \n     unwilling to venture.\n     Crop research challenges\n       Crop productivity depends both on the yield potential of \n     the varieties and the crop management employed to enhance \n     input and output efficiency. Agricultural researchers and \n     farmers worldwide face the challenge during the next 25 years \n     of developing and applying technology that can increase the \n     global cereal yields by 50-75 percent, and to do so in ways \n     that are economically and environmentally sustainable. Much \n     of the yield gains will come from applying technology \n     ``already on the shelf'' but yet to be fully utilized. But \n     there will also be new research breakthroughs, especially in \n     plant breeding to improve yield stability and, hopefully, \n     maximum genetic yield potential.\n       While we must continue to push the frontiers of science \n     forward, we also must be mindful of the need to protect the \n     gains already made. Agriculture is a continuing struggle \n     against mutating pathogens and insects. A clear example is \n     the new race of stem rust that has emerged in East Africa, \n     which is capable of devastating most of the world's \n     commercial bread wheat varieties. Ironically, I began my \n     career in agricultural science combating stem rust some 60 \n     years ago and I am now in the twilight of my life, once again \n     facing my old nemesis. There hasn't been a major stem rust \n     epidemic for more than 50 years, since the virulent race \n     called 15B devastated much of the North America wheat crop \n     during 1950-54. Out of that crisis came new forms of \n     international cooperation in plant breeding, which led to \n     accelerated development around the world of high-yielding, \n     disease-resistant, broadly adapted wheat varieties. However, \n     in the ensuing years, complacency, increasing barriers to \n     international exchange of plant breeding materials, \n     declining budgets, staff retirements and discontinuity in \n     training programs, has resulted in a much weakened system. \n     This has been evident in the slow international response \n     to a very serious new stem rust race, called Ug99, first \n     spotted in Uganda and Kenya in the late 1990s. Ug99 has \n     now escaped from Africa and begun its migration to North \n     Africa and the Middle East. It won't be long before it \n     reaches South Asia and later China, North America and the \n     rest of the wheat-growing world. Wheat scientists are now \n     scrambling to control this disease before it gains a \n     foothold and causes catastrophic losses to the livelihoods \n     of several hundred million wheat farmers and widespread \n     global wheat shortages that will affect prices and the \n     welfare of several billion consumers. Since 2005, \n     excellent collaboration has been forthcoming from the \n     USDA, key land grant universities, and USAID. A far-\n     reaching research program is being considered by a major \n     U.S. foundation located in Seattle that if approved could \n     solidify and accelerate the progress to date. As part of \n     this research effort we also hope to identify why rice, \n     alone among the cereals, is immune to the rust fungi, and \n     then use biotechnology to transfer this genetic immunity \n     from rice to wheat and other cereals. If we are successful \n     in this quest, the scourge of rust, mentioned in the \n     bible, could finally be banished from the Earth.\n     What can we expect from biotechnology?\n       During the 20th Century, conventional plant breeding has \n     produced--and continues to produce--modern crop varieties and \n     hybrids that have contributed immensely to grain yield \n     potential, disease and insect resistance, stability of \n     harvests and farm incomes, while sparing vast tracts of land \n     for other uses, such as wildlife habitats, forests, and \n     outdoor recreation.\n       The majority of agricultural scientists including myself \n     anticipate great benefits from biotechnology in the coming \n     decades to help meet our future needs for food, feed, fiber, \n     and bio-fuels. Promising work, now utilizing the powerful new \n     tools of biotechnology, is also under way to develop greater \n     tolerance of climatic extremes, such as drought, heat, and \n     cold. Such research is likely to become more important in the \n     future as the world experiences the effects of climate \n     change. We must also persist in scientific efforts to raise \n     maximum genetic yield potential to increase food production \n     on lands currently in use while protecting against serious \n     negative environmental impacts.\n       Seventy percent of global water withdrawals are used for \n     irrigating agricultural lands, which account for 17 percent \n     of total cultivated land yet contribute 40 percent of our \n     global food harvest. Expanding the area under irrigation is \n     critical to meeting future food demand. However, competing \n     urban demands for water will require much great efficiencies \n     in agricultural water use. Through biotechnology we will be \n     able to achieve ``more crop per drop'' by designing plants \n     with reduced water requirements and adoption of improved \n     crop/water management systems.\n       Developing country governments need to be prepared to work \n     with--and benefit\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\n     from--the new breakthroughs in biotechnology. Regulatory \n     frameworks are needed to guide the testing and use of \n     genetically modified crops, which protect public welfare and \n     the environment against undue risk. They must be cost \n     effective to implement yet not be so restrictive that science \n     cannot advance.\n       Since the private sector patents its life science \n     inventions, agricultural policy makers must be vigilant in \n     guarding against too much concentration of ownership and also \n     be concerned about equity of access issues, especially for \n     poor farmers. These are legitimate matters for debate by \n     national, regional and global governmental organizations.\n       Even with private sector leadership in biotechnology \n     research I believe that governments should also fund \n     significant public research programs. This is not only \n     important as a complement and balance to private sector \n     proprietary research, but is also needed to ensure the proper \n     training of new generations of scientists, both for private \n     and public sector research institutions.\n       U.S. agriculture is being asked to produce more food, feed, \n     fiber and now biofuels, while protecting the environment and \n     not greatly increasing land use. Science is ready for the \n     task, but science will not succeed without wise and adequate \n     support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and \n     its congressional committees. Traditional programs of \n     research and education at USDA and in the land grant \n     universities must continue. Congress must also invest more \n     generously in fundamental research to learn more about the \n     cellular and molecular events that determine how plants and \n     animals reproduce, grow and fight off stresses such as \n     drought, cold and disease. Most of these major innovations \n     will start first with acquiring deeper fundamental \n     understanding.\n       Getting the most from fundamental research will require \n     changes in the culture of decision making in public \n     agricultural institutions. Leading scientists must be \n     involved in deciding which programs have scientific merit and \n     in setting realistic scientific priorities. There should be a \n     council, like those of the National Institutes of Health, \n     where scientists and stakeholders can pool their wisdom in \n     recommending research priorities. Building such changes into \n     the current farm bill is a high priority.\n     Educating urbanites about agriculture\n       The current backlash against agricultural science and \n     technology evident in some industrialized countries is hard \n     for me to comprehend. How quickly humankind becomes detached \n     from the soil and agricultural production! Less than 4 \n     percent of the population in the industrialized countries \n     (less than 2 percent in the USA) is directly engaged in \n     agriculture. With low-cost food supplies and urban bias, is \n     it any wonder that consumers don't understand the \n     complexities of re-producing the world food supply each year \n     in its entirety, and expanding it further for the nearly 80 \n     million new mouths that are born into this world annually? I \n     believe we can help address this ``educational gap'' by \n     making it compulsory in secondary schools and universities \n     for students to take courses on agriculture, biology, and \n     science and technology policy.\n       One exciting high school program, in which I am personally \n     involved, is the World Food Prize Youth Institute program \n     originated by Des Moines philanthropist Juan Ruan and led by \n     the World Food Prize Foundation. Each year, more than a 100 \n     high school students, mainly from Iowa but now expanding to \n     other states and countries, convene at the George Washington \n     Carver auditorium at Pioneer Hybrid Company headquarters in \n     Johnston, Iowa, with teachers and parents, to present their \n     well-researched essays on about how to increase the quantity, \n     quality, and availability of food around the world. They make \n     these presentations in front of past and present World Food \n     Prize laureates and other experts, and lively discussions \n     ensue. Each year, a select few graduating seniors win travel \n     fellowships to go to a developing country where they live and \n     work at an agricultural research institute, and learn first \n     hand about hunger and poverty, and the role that science and \n     technology can play to alleviate these calamities. It is \n     especially gratifying to see the growth and development of \n     these young, mostly female, summer interns. It literally is a \n     life-changing experience for them, and it shows in their \n     performance at university and in career selections. More \n     programs like this are needed, so that future generations of \n     Americans have a better sense about the complexities and \n     challenges of feeding a growing world.\n     Agriculture and the environment\n       As the pace of technological change has accelerated the \n     past 50 years, the fear of science has grown. Certainly, the \n     breaking of the atom and the prospects of a nuclear holocaust \n     added to people's fear, and drove a bigger wedge between the \n     scientist and the layman. Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, \n     published in 1962, which reported that poisons were \n     everywhere, also struck a very sensitive nerve. Of course, \n     this perception was not totally unfounded. By the mid 20th \n     century air and water quality had been seriously damaged \n     through wasteful industrial production systems that pushed \n     effluents often literally into ``our own backyards.''\n       We all owe a debt of gratitude to environmental movement in \n     the industrialized nations, which has led to legislation over \n     the past 40 years to improve air and water quality, protect \n     wildlife, control the disposal of toxic wastes, protect the \n     soils, and reduce the loss of biodiversity. However, these \n     positive environmental trends are not found in the developing \n     countries, where environmental degradation, especially in \n     Africa, threatens ecological stability if not reversed.\n       There is often a deadlock between agriculturalists and \n     environmentalists over what constitutes ``sustainable \n     agriculture'' in the Third World. This debate has confused--\n     if not paralyzed--many in the international donor community \n     who, afraid of antagonizing powerful environmental lobbying \n     groups, have turned away from supporting science-based \n     agricultural modernization projects still needed in much of \n     smallholder Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. This \n     deadlock must be broken.\n       We cannot lose sight of the enormous job before us to feed \n     10 billion people, 90 percent of whom will begin life in a \n     developing country, and many in poverty. Only through dynamic \n     agricultural development will there be any hope to alleviate \n     poverty and improve human health and productivity, and \n     reducing political instability.\n     Closing comments\n       Thirty-seven years ago, in my acceptance speech for the \n     Nobel Peace Prize, I said that the Green Revolution had won a \n     temporary success in man's war against hunger, which if fully \n     implemented, could provide sufficient food for humankind \n     through the end of the 20th century. But I warned that \n     unless the frightening power of human reproduction was \n     curbed, the success of the Green Revolution would only be \n     ephemeral.\n       It took some 10,000 years to expand food production to the \n     current level of about 5 billion tons per year. By 2050, we \n     will likely need to nearly double current production again. \n     This cannot be done unless farmers across the world have \n     access to high-yielding crop production methods as well as \n     new biotechnological breakthroughs that can increase the crop \n     yields, dependability, and nutritional quality. Indeed, it is \n     higher farm incomes that will permit small-scale farmers in \n     the Third World to make desperately needed investments to \n     protect their natural resources. As Kenyan archeologist \n     Richard Leakey likes to reminds us, ``you have to be well-fed \n     to be a conservationist.'' We have to bring common sense into \n     the debate on agricultural science and technology and the \n     sooner the better!\n       The United States is the greatest agricultural success \n     story of the 20th Century. Through science and technology and \n     farmer ingenuity, American agriculture has achieved levels of \n     productivity second to none. We also have a great tradition, \n     especially in earlier decades, of helping low-income; food-\n     deficit nations to get their own agricultural systems moving. \n     Our private agri-businesses have invested heavily in the \n     development of productivity-enhancing technology, not only to \n     the benefit of this country but also around the world. \n     American public institutions--the land-grant universities and \n     colleges, the USDA, and the U.S. Department of State--have \n     played key roles in the transformation of subsistence \n     agriculture, especially in Asia and Latin America. This has \n     been good for the American people and the world. Lest we \n     forget, world peace will not be built on empty stomachs or \n     human misery.\n       I would be remiss if I did not thank the Administration for \n     establishing the USDA Borlaug Fellows program in 2004, in my \n     honor, at the time of my 90th birthday. This is an \n     international program that actively engages universities like \n     my own Texas A & M University, my alma mater, the University \n     of Minnesota, and many other of our fine land grant \n     universities and colleges. The Borlaug fellows program also \n     has links to the international agricultural research centers \n     located abroad and to private agro-industry. The aim is to \n     provide relatively young scientists from developing countries \n     with opportunities to travel to the USA to gain practical \n     experience and upgrade their technical skills at advanced \n     agricultural laboratories. So far, USDA has been able, with \n     the assistance of USAID, to piece together funding for about \n     150 Borlaug fellows to come to the United States each year. \n     With more permanent funding, along the lines of the Fulbright \n     program, USDA and the partner universities could implement a \n     more substantial range of learning and personal development \n     opportunities for young scientists and agricultural leaders \n     from developing countries. This would be good for the \n     individual recipients, their sponsoring institutions and \n     countries, and also, I believe, for America. Texas A \n     University and Ohio State University have been working \n     through the National Association of State Universities and \n     Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) to prepare a more substantial \n     proposal for consideration by Congress.\n       My plea today to the members of Congress and to the \n     Administration is to re-commit the United States to more \n     dynamic and generous programs of official development \n     assistance in agriculture for Third World nations, as was \n     done in the 1960s and 1970s. Ever-shrinking foreign aid \n     budgets in support of smallholder agriculture, and especially \n     to multilateral research and development organizations such \n     as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center \n     (CIMMYT) where I have worked for 40 years, as well as its \n     sister research institutes under the Consultative Group for \n     International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), are not in our \n     nation's best interest, nor do they represent our finest \n     traditions.\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\n       As you chart the course of this great nation for the future \n     benefit of our children, grand-children, and great-\n     grandchildren, I ask you to think more boldly and humanely \n     about the Third World and develop a new version of the \n     Marshall plan, this time not to rescue a war-torn Europe, but \n     now to help the nearly one billion, mostly rural poor people \n     still trapped in hunger and misery. It is within America's \n     technical and financial power to help end this human tragedy \n     and injustice, if we set our hearts and minds to the task.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today in the Capitol Rotunda we \nhonored Dr. Norman Borlaug with the Congressional Gold Medal. This is \nthe highest expression of national appreciation.\n  At least two-thirds of Federal lawmakers must sign on to support a \nnominee before his or her nomination is allowed to advance through \nCommittees in the House and Senate. Previous recipients include \ndistinguished public servants, military heroes, humanitarians, \nentertainers, musicians, authors, athletes, religious leaders and \npioneers in the fields of medicine, science, and aeronautics including \nour Nation's first President, George Washington.\n  Many of you know that I farm in Iowa with my son Robin.\n  Those of us farming take satisfaction in feeding people through our \nlabors.\n  Through his labors, Dr. Borlaug has been able to feed many more \npeople that Robin and I will ever be able to, even if we worked day and \nnight.\n  He has spared more people from the sharp hunger pains that strike an \nempty stomach than anyone of us could ever dream of doing.\n  He has saved more lives than any other person in history.\n  An extraordinary man, with a brilliant vision, and the common sense \nto turn his dreams into a reality--that's Norm Borlaug.\n  I am grateful, but not surprised, that it didn't take long for \nCongress to advance the legislation giving Dr. Borlaug this award.\n  A few years ago, I spoke with Dr. Borlaug just outside the Senate \nChamber.\n  It was overwhelming just how many Senators came off the Senate floor \nto shake hands with him.\n  I was glad to be able to claim Dr. Borlaug as a native Iowan who has \nbecome a true citizen of the world--from a boyhood on a farm in \nnortheast Iowa--a one-room schoolhouse--to a PhD in plant pathology, to \ndecades in the poorest areas of rural Mexico, and a life of scientific \nbreakthroughs to ease malnutrition and famine all over the world. His \nwork in biotechnology has vastly improved food security for countries \nincluding India, Pakistan, and Mexico. This humanitarian hero has been \ninstrumental in seeking social justice and promoting peace around the \nworld.\n  Far from resting on his laurels, Dr. Borlaug continues to inspire \nfuture generations of scientists and farmers to innovate and lift those \nmired in poverty.\n  As a fellow Iowan said, ``If you never stick your neck out, you'll \nnever get your head above the crowd.''\n  Dr. Borlaug stuck his neck out and became a hero and a legend.\n  He deserves every bit of recognition and gratitude we can find to \noffer him.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nhonoring Dr. Norman Borlaug of Dallas, TX.\n  Today, Dr. Borlaug receives the Congressional Gold Medal--the \nNation's highest civilian decoration.\n  Dr. Borlaug's service to the world's hungry was cultivated on his \nboyhood farm in Iowa where he learned the value of hard work. He \nsharpened his knowledge of agriculture and science at the University of \nMinnesota and later applied his farm and classroom experiences to \nresearching and developing high-yield wheat varieties in Mexico that \nthrived in arid conditions. Under his leadership, these innovative \ncrops were introduced into India, Pakistan, and later Africa, having \nsince fed the hungry in astonishing numbers.\n  Never allowing himself to become satisfied with the status quo, Dr. \nBorlaug continued his humanitarian efforts, paving the way for other \nscientists to fight hunger and to feed the world's increasing \npopulation. Dr. Borlaug created the annual World Food Prize to \nrecognize and reward those who advance human development by improving \nthe quality, quantity, and availability of food in the world.\n  Each fall semester, Dr. Borlaug returns to Texas A University to \nteach those who would follow in his footsteps and continue to innovate. \nIn his role as distinguished professor of international agriculture in \nthe Department of Soil & Crop Sciences, aspiring Aggie students have \nthe opportunity to witness hard-working benevolence and learn from one \nof mankind's greatest and most humble benefactors.\n  There are many lessons we can learn from Dr. Borlaug's service. This \nman saw a need and applied his education to the realities of poverty \nand hunger. He chose to put his hands in the soil and work to make a \nvision become reality.\n  Dr. Borlaug reminds us that a single individual with the knowledge \nand courage to make a difference can indeed change the world.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the most recent addition to a long \nlist of accolades that Dr. Borlaug has earned throughout his lifetime, \nincluding the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his innovative work in \nagriculture. It has been suggested that Dr. Borlaug's humanitarian \nefforts have saved the lives of perhaps one billion of the world's \nhungry, and through his ongoing legacy of leadership his work will feed \nmany more.\n  We join in gratitude for his consistent dedication in applying the \nagricultural sciences to benefit so many. I am honored to have been \nable to cosponsor this award for Dr. Borlaug.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9317-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2100 offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise to discuss my amendment which lays out the consequences of a \nfailed state in Iraq. As every parent of a teenager knows, one of the \nthings you have to impress upon your teenager is the consequences of \ntheir actions. I think we need to have an adult conversation and talk \nabout the consequences of our actions in Iraq.\n  The one thing we all agree on is that we want to bring our troops \nhome. We want to bring them home as soon as we can. The line of \ndivision between us seems to be between those who want to do so based \nupon an arbitrary political timetable and those who want to do so based \non conditions on the ground. So I think it is important to have--as any \nadult would say to their child--a conversation about the consequences \nof your actions because I think these are the birds that are going to \ncome home to roost should the Levin amendment be adopted.\n  As we know from the Iraq Study Group as well as the National \nIntelligence Estimate, the consequences of a failed state in Iraq are \nnumerous, but they are significant and highly dangerous to the United \nStates.\n  First of all, Iraq would become a safe haven for Islamic radicals, \nincluding al-Qaida and Hezbollah, who are determined to attack the \nUnited States and U.S. allies. The Iraq Study Group found that a \nchaotic Iraq would provide a still stronger base of operation for \nterrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally. That is not me \ntalking; that is the Iraq Study Group. The Iraq Study Group also noted \nthat al-Qaida will portray any failure by the United States in Iraq as \na significant victory that will be featured prominently as they recruit \nfor their cause in the region and around the world.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate presented by the intelligence \ncommunity, which consists of the best and the brightest America has to \noffer, concluded that the consequences of a premature withdrawal from \nIraq would be\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\nthat al-Qaida would attempt to use Anbar Province for further attacks \noutside of Iraq, neighboring countries would consider actively \nintervening in Iraq, and sectarian violence would significantly \nincrease in Iraq, accompanied by massive civilian casualties and \ndisplacement. The Iraq Study Group found that a premature American \nwithdrawal from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian \nviolence and further deterioration of conditions. The near-term results \nwould be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional \ndestabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al-Qaida would \ndepict our withdrawal as a historic victory, much as they did when the \nSoviet Union was run out of Afghanistan.\n  A failed state in Iraq could lead to a broader regional conflict \ninvolving Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The Iraq Study Group \nnoted that Turkey could send troops into northern Iraq to prevent \nKurdistan from declaring independence. The Iraq Study Group noted that \nIran could send troops to restore stability to southern Iraq and \nperhaps gain control of oilfields. The regional influence of Iran could \narise at a time when that country is on a path to producing a nuclear \nweapon, as we know they are all about.\n  A failed state in Iraq would lead to massive humanitarian suffering. \nI know we are all concerned about what we see as the genocide in the \nDarfur region of Sudan, but those of us who are concerned about that \nhuge humanitarian crisis there must also be concerned about the \nhumanitarian crisis in Iraq should we prematurely withdrawal our troops \nand that country descend into massive ethnic cleansing and genocide and \nmassive dislocation of refugees to other areas of the Middle East.\n  A recent editorial in the New York Times said Americans must be clear \nthat Iraq and the region around it could be even bloodier and more \nchaotic after Americans leave. There could be reprisals against those \nwho work with American forces, further ethnic cleansing, and even \ngenocide. Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan, \nSyria, and Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make a power grab. The \nIraq Study Group found that if we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, \nthe long-range consequences could eventually require the United States \nto return.\n  My amendment commits the Senate to take no action that would lead to \na failed state in Iraq that would invariably, in the opinion of the \nIraq Study Group, a bipartisan group of experts, as well as the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, lead to consequences that would not \nonly be devastating for the Iraqis, it would be destabilizing in that \nregion and would lead to greater loss of life and greater insecurity in \nthe United States.\n  So I hope all of my colleagues will vote in favor of this amendment \nat 2:45 when that vote is scheduled. I can't imagine any possible \nobjection to this sense of the Senate on the consequences of a failed \nstate in Iraq.\n  Finally, I would say this is an important part of the overall debate \nwhere we talk about not only what our preferred policy is but what the \nconsequences of a failure would be. I think part of a responsible adult \ndebate is talking about what the consequences would be as we commit \nourselves to take no action that would lend an increased likelihood to \nthat failed state.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair notify me when I have \nspoken for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nexplaining his amendment. But when I hear him describe the Levin-Reed \namendment, I am afraid I don't recognize it because, unfortunately, the \nSenator from Texas has failed to include some of the most important \nelements of this Levin-Reed amendment.\n  This is the only amendment the Senate will consider during debate on \nthis bill which will change the policy of the war in Iraq. It is the \nonly amendment which establishes a timetable to bring this war to a \nresponsible end. It is the only amendment which in law will require \nAmerican troops to start to come home, the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. A sense-of-the-Senate resolution is done on a \nregular basis on the floor of the Senate. It does not have the power \nand impact of law. It is an observation made by the Senate. That is \nall. It is not binding on the President. It won't change the policy. \nThere is no suggestion that it even could.\n  What the Senator from Texas brings to us is the possibility that \nthings could get worse in Iraq than they are today, and that is a \npossibility. But let's be very honest about the state of Iraq today. It \nis a nation in chaos. It is a nation that is engulfed by its own civil \nwar. It is struggling to decide which faction within its nation will \ngovern. Frankkly, some question whether it will be a nation. I think \nthe Kurds, for example, given their way, would be independent of Iraq \nas we know it today. This struggle to define Iraq is part of the chaos \nand consternation we find in that country.\n  Finally, of course, this civil war is driven by so many elements--\ncriminal elements, al-Qaida elements, Ba'athist elements, Iranian \nelements, and, yes, a civil war generated by a division within Islam \nthat has gone on for more than 14 centuries. It is into this crucible \nof hate and killing that we have sent 170,000 American troops who each \nmorning get up, strap on their armor, and go out and pray to God they \nwill live for another day. Is that what we bargained for when President \nBush said we had to rid ourselves of Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass \ndestruction?\n  The Senator from Texas makes the argument that if we leave, things \ncould get worse. It is possible. But I will tell you this: \nStabilization will occur on Iraqi terms whenever the American military \ndeparts, and it is likely to be chaotic. We have to acknowledge that. \nWhether we leave in 10 months or 10 years, the Iraqis have to decide \ntheir own future.\n  The elements of the Levin-Reed amendment which the Senator from Texas \ndoes not acknowledge are absolutely essential. He will find, when he \nreads the Levin-Reed amendment, on page 3, paragraph 3, we will still \nhave troops engaged in targeted counterterrorism operations against al-\nQaida and al-Qaida-affiliated organizations and other international \nterrorist organizations.\n  The Senator from Texas suggests that we will leave and walk away from \nthe scene and hope for the best. That is not true. Under Levin-Reed, we \nwill continue to fight al-Qaida, the fight which we should have been \ndedicated to from 9/11 forward and a fight which by this time should \nhave brought us Osama bin Laden and his major lieutenants.\n  Secondly, the argument made by the Senator from Texas is that the \nLevin-Reed amendment is going to lead to a broader regional conflict as \nAmerican troops start to come home. I recommend for reading by the \nSenator from Texas page 2 of the amendment, which goes into graphic \ndetail about our hope that as we start to withdraw, as our troops start \nto withdraw from Iraq, we will initiate a comprehensive, diplomatic, \npolitical, and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement \nwith Iraq's neighbors and the international community for working out \ncollective stability in that country.\n  I would say to my friend from Texas, what he has suggested as part \nand parcel of the result of Levin-Reed is already taken care of. We \nwant to start bringing American troops home. Losing 100 American \nsoldiers every month, 1,000 seriously wounded, $12 billion in \ntaxpayers' money, put into a situation which is nothing short of a \ncivil war, is unacceptable.\n  The future of Iraq is in the hands of the Iraqis. They have to stand \nup and defend their own country. They have to decide their own future. \nIs it likely to be smooth sailing as we leave? No. But it is a process \nwhich will take place whether we leave within a few months or a year or \nwait much longer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look honestly at this Cornyn amendment. \nAs I reflect on it, I don't think it offers any serious challenge. None \nof us want to see a failed Iraq. But let's remember that the bottom \nline is the only\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\namendment which will change the policy in Iraq is the amendment by \nSenators Levin and Reed which we will vote on, after an all-night \nsession, first thing tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the distinguished \nmajority whip, the Senator from Illinois, but I do see things a little \ndifferently.\n  First of all, when he talks about a civil war in Iraq, he seems to \noverlook the fact that al-Qaida is present in Iraq and is the \nprecipitating cause for the sectarian strife we are all concerned \nabout. What would he do to deal with al-Qaida in Iraq, which they \nregard as the central front in their war against the West?\n  When my friend from Illinois says we need a limited presence of our \nAmerican troops in Iraq, I am not sure what that means, but I sure \nwould rather have the four star Army GEN David Petraeus determining the \nappropriate tactics to deal with the threat on the ground rather than \npoliticians, armchair generals here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will make this very brief. Isn't it a fact that over \nthe weekend, the Prime Minister of Iraq invited us to leave at any \ntime?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, to my knowledge, we are of one mind that \nwe do want to leave Iraq. The question is, Under what conditions? I \ndon't believe Prime Minister Maliki certainly is on record as saying he \nwants us to leave at a time when his government would be rent asunder \nand Iraq would descend into sectarian war and perhaps a regional \nconflict. But the fact is, GEN David Petraeus, the general whom we \nconfirmed unanimously just a short time ago, has recommended to the \nCommander in Chief a new strategy known as the surge, which was \ncompleted just last month, a few short weeks ago. Now he has said to \ngive that surge an opportunity to do its job and he will come back and \nreport to us in September. I think we ought to give that a reasonable \nchance.\n  While the distinguished majority whip wants to talk about the Levin \namendment, I think we will have plenty of time to talk about that \nduring the course of the evening.\n  The irony is, we are ready to vote on the Levin amendment at almost \nany time. But we are going to have a big political theater tonight. We \nwill have a lot of fun having a Senate slumber party for the benefit of \norganizations such as moveon.org, which is having a press conference at \n8:30 tonight. We ought to be having a serious debate and voting on \nthese amendments, which we are happy to do at virtually anytime.\n  I worry when I hear my friend say stabilization will take place on \nIraqi terms, as if the only consequences of a failure in Iraq would be \nborne by the Iraqis. The fact is, according to the National \nIntelligence Estimate, the intelligence community, the Iraq Study \nGroup, and others, it will make America less safe by creating a safe \nhaven for organizations such as al-Qaida to plot, plan, train, and to \nexport future terrorist attacks against the United States.\n  If we think they are modest in their goals, I think we need to think \nagain. Rather than a crude instrument like an airplane flying into the \nPentagon and the World Trade Center, this terrorist organization in \nIraq, which considers Iraq the central front in their war against the \nWest, is trying to get biological, chemical, and even nuclear weapons. \nWoe be the day that they get their hands on those and use them against \nAmerica or its allies.\n  So I think we should be of one mind with this sense of the Senate \nthat says we would take no action that would make it more likely that \nIraq would descend into a failed state to create that haven for \nterrorists.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think everybody in this body would like to leave \nIraq better than we found it. That is not the current situation. The \ncurrent situation is chaos and violence in Iraq. It is an Iraq that is \ntorn apart by sectarian violence. When you have group slaughtering \ngroup in a civil war, a sectarian type of war, it requires that the \nIraqi political leaders take action to end the violence. The only way \nto end the violence is if the Iraqi political leaders will reach a \npolitical settlement. I think almost everybody agrees with that. I \nthink our uniformed military agrees with that, our civilian leaders \nagree, and almost everybody agrees that there is no military solution \nin Iraq, and that the only solution, the only way to end this violence \nis if the Iraqi political leaders accept the responsibility to work out \npolitical agreements on a number of disagreements they have identified \nfor themselves.\n  We talk a lot about benchmarks, and the President said the other day \nthat on eight benchmarks we are making progress, and on eight we are \nnot--to make it sound like we have a glass that is half full. But that \nis not what the facts sustain or support. The facts are that we have a \nglass called Iraq which has a hole in the bottom. Whatever we pour into \nIraq goes right through that hole. It is going to continue to do that \nuntil one thing happens, and that is that the Iraqi political leaders \ndecide they are going to work out a political settlement. There is a \nconsensus about that, I believe, among almost all of us.\n  The Iraqi Prime Minister made the following statement, and every one \nof us, when we vote on Levin-Reed, ought to keep this one statement in \nmind, I believe, first and foremost. This is what Prime Minister Maliki \nsaid:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of bloodletting of innocents are the politicians.\n\n  Well, it is long overdue that the politicians in Iraq step up to \ntheir responsibility. The amendment before us, it seems to me, states \nsomething which is clear. I believe it is obvious that it is in \neveryone's interest that Iraq not be a failed state. I agree with my \nfriend from Texas. That should be a goal of everybody. The problem is \nthat Iraq is the No. 2 most unstable state in the world right now. That \nis the status quo. That is what we have to end. The only way to end it \nis with a political settlement by the Iraqis.\n  There was an article a few days ago in Foreign Policy magazine called \n``The States That Fail Us.'' It is about failed states. It has a list \nof about 60 states, and they give all of the indicators of instability. \nIraq is No. 2 on the list, right after Sudan. That is the status quo. \nThat is what we are trying to end--the failure of a policy in Iraq \nwhich has led the Iraqi leaders to believe that there is an open-ended \ncommitment on the part of the United States to give them protection in \nthat green zone to the extent that it exists. It is that open-ended \ncommitment of the United States that must end--if we are going to prod \nthe Iraqi leaders to finally step up, look into the abyss and make a \ndecision, do they want a civil war or do they want a nation?\n  Mr. President, we cannot save them from themselves. To say that we \ndon't want a failed state in Iraq is to say we don't want the status \nquo to continue, that the course must change in Iraq.\n  So I will vote for the Cornyn amendment because I think it states, in \ngeneral terms at least, what I hope Members of the Senate would all \nagree on--that a failed state in Iraq is not in the interest of this \nNation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 4 minutes. \nThe Senator from Texas controls 5 minutes. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am grateful for the statement of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nSenator from Michigan, in support of this amendment. I believe it is \nnoncontroversial. If there is one thing we ought to be able to agree \nupon in this debate, it is that it is not in our self-interest to leave \nIraq as a failed state.\n  Where we diverge is where the Senator says we have to put more \npressure on the politicians. I think we need to\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\ndo that, but not so much pressure that they simply collapse, which is \nmy concern. That is why I believe what General Petraeus has said, which \nis that the situation in Iraq is hard but not hopeless. That gives me \nsome hope that we can provide them the space they need in order to make \nthose hard political decisions, which are extraordinarily difficult. If \nyou think about it, the kind of decisions they are being called upon to \nmake--for example, the sharing of oil revenue--I might suggest that is \nequivalent to the U.S. Congress trying to solve the Social Security \ninsolvency problem. It is not easy for to us do. We have not done it \nyet. How in the world can we expect this new democracy, particularly \nunder such stressful and difficult circumstances, to do things that we \nourselves would find extraordinarily difficult to do? Talking about \ndebaathification and things like that--the Baathist Party, under Saddam \nHussein, was guilty of the most heinous sorts of crimes against the \nShiite majority. This is a country traumatized from years of a police \nstate under the boot heel of a terrible, blood-thirsty dictator like \nSaddam Hussein, where hundreds of thousands of people were killed by \nSaddam Hussein.\n\n  So it is not surprising that this traumatized nation is having \nchallenges coming back from that and that they are slow to make \ndecisions that we think they should be making. But the basic minimum is \nthat they need the security in order to have the space in order to make \nthose difficult decisions. That is what this new plan is, which is only \nin the early stages of being implemented by General Petraeus, designed \nto do.\n  What are the early reports? We are beginning to see some progress, \nparticularly in Anbar Province in dealing with al-Qaida that up until \nrecently basically had the run of the place. The tribal sheiks and \nothers are coming forward and volunteering for the police and security \nforces. So I guess we are seeing the most hard-bitten cynics, but there \nare some signs that things are getting a little bit better in terms of \nthe security context. It seems obvious that basic security has to \nprevail in order for the Iraqis, in exercising their new democratic \ngovernment, to try to reconcile some of these terrible and difficult \ndecisions.\n  I am delighted that the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee has said he will support this amendment. My hope is \nthat this is one thing in the course of all of this fractious debate \nthat we can unify behind.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address two comments made \nearlier by the Senator from Texas. He referred to the possibility of an \nall-night session in the Senate as a so-called Senate slumber party. \nTrust me, that is not what this is about. What we are facing on the \nRepublican side of the aisle is an objection to an up-or-down vote, a \nmajority vote, on the Levin-Reed amendment. That amendment is the only \namendment which establishes a time line and a timetable for ending this \nwar responsibly and beginning to bring our troops home within 120 days. \nIt is the only amendment before us that will achieve that. Other \namendments are interesting. None of them have the power of law.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment has the power of law. The President will \nhave to follow it or veto it. Those are his choices. That is why it is \nso serious. That is why the Republican leadership has opposed our \nhaving a majority vote on this in the Senate. They are filibustering \nit, trying to stop us from getting to a vote on that amendment.\n  Ordinarily, when you filibuster something, it is so sanitized and \ncivilized, you don't even know it is happening. Members of the Senate \nfile a cloture motion and go out for dinner and say: We'll see you in \nthe morning for the vote. Tonight they will stick around. If they want \nto filibuster this amendment that will change the policy in Iraq, they \nwill have to stay and debate it. It will be a real filibuster. If they \nbelieve this is still right, we will see if they feel that way at 4 \na.m. tomorrow morning. That is what this is about. It is not a slumber \nparty.\n  The Senator from Texas said, ``We are ready to vote.'' Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent to vote on the Levin-Reed amendment No. 2087 at 6 \np.m., with the time between 3:05 and then equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if this were the first time that a 60-vote \nrequirement were made, I would have some sympathy for the Senator from \nIllinois. I am having staff compile the number of times when the other \nside of the aisle was in the minority, they demanded 60 votes as well. \nYou cannot do it with a straight face.\n  You cannot say that all we are going to do here in the Senate is have \nus govern by 51 votes; otherwise, we may as well be unicameral because \nwe would have the Senate and the House exactly the same.\n  So, of course, I will object, Mr. President. I wish we would get off \nthis horse of saying that somehow the other side never employed the 60-\nvote requirement in the Senate, because they did. It is a tradition in \nthe Senate, and it is within the rules of the Senate. It may be \nfrustrating. It certainly was to us when we were in the majority and \nthe Democrats were in the minority and they employed it. But to somehow \nact as if what is being done is unprecedented--I will tell you what is \nunprecedented; it is taking a Defense authorization bill that is there \nfor the training and equipping and pay raises and necessities of life \nfor the men and women serving in the military, when we should be \npassing this--we all know it is going to come up in September. We \nshould be passing this so the men and women can get what they need and \ndeserve in order to defend the security of this Nation. Instead, Mr. \nPresident, what we are doing is having, again, for the eighth or ninth \ntime, without having passed one appropriations bill, including the \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill, which is ready to be \npassed--instead, we will have this ``argument'' against the filibuster.\n  Mr. President, it doesn't pass the smell test. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The time in opposition has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Texas has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have 1 minute remaining?\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona, of course. My \nbelief would be that if our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwanted to move up the cloture vote on the Levin amendment to 6 p.m. \ntonight, we could expedite things and get right to the vote that \nperhaps the distinguished majority whip wishes to have. I think there \nis no objection on this side to providing a vote on that cloture vote. \nWe could do that sooner rather than later. I certainly would support \nthat action. I will have to consult with the leaders on this side of \nthe aisle, but that certainly might help us get to the bottom of things \nthat much sooner.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment before \nus that would be a vote against any action that would enhance the \nlikelihood of a failed state in Iraq, which is not in America's best \nsecurity interests.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I need \nSenator McCain to listen. Apparently, the time the Senator from Arizona \ntook on his reservation came out of our time, and I am wondering if he \nwould give us a minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to give that to the \ndistinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on the question of the 60 votes, there is a \nprocedural roadblock which is being placed here. It is not the first \ntime in history, of course, but a decision has to be made here whether \nthe verdict of the American people last November that there be a change \nin policy is going to be thwarted by that procedural roadblock, and the \nRepublican leader has apparently decided it will be.\n  In terms of precedent, last year on the Defense authorization bill, \nthere\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\nwere at least two votes on Iraq, both majority votes. That is the \nprecedent. Last year, there was a Levin-Reed amendment that received 39 \nvotes and a Kerry amendment, both on Iraq on the Defense authorization \nbill, the most recent experience. This issue is so vital. It is so much \nin the minds of the American people that we should not throw up \nprocedural roadblocks to allowing the Senate to vote. That is why we \nhave asked that we be allowed to vote up or down on this amendment, and \nthat apparently has now been objected to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2100. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from South Dakota \n(Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 3, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 248 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--3\n\n     Byrd\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Biden\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n  The amendment (No. 2100) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, late this morning, I sent a letter to the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell. I addressed the \nletter ``Dear Mitch,'' and I will read the letter.\n\n       There are no more solemn decisions facing Members of \n     Congress than the conduct of the war and the placing of our \n     troops in harm's way. As you know, more than 3,600 brave \n     Americans have lost their lives and more than $400 billion \n     has been expended on the war in Iraq, which has now moved \n     into its fifth year, with no end in sight. Yet Senate \n     Republicans have chosen to prevent an honest debate, an \n     action on legislation to provide an Iraq strategy that will \n     allow us to responsibly redeploy our troops and refocus our \n     attention on the very real threat posed by al-Qaida. This is \n     partisan obstruction that I fear will make us less, not more, \n     secure, and I urge you to reconsider your course.\n       Today's headlines confirm the importance of allowing the \n     Senate to consider amendments to change the course in Iraq \n     and refocus our resources so we can more effectively wage the \n     war on terror. The news reports indicate that the violence in \n     northern Iraq has escalated at the same time the Director of \n     National Intelligence released a new assessment that al-Qaida \n     has regenerated key elements of its homeland capability. As \n     long as our troops are mired in policing an Iraq civil war, \n     they cannot focus on the enemy that attacked us nearly 6 \n     years ago, an enemy that, regrettably, has regenerated its \n     attack capacity since 9/11.\n       Furthermore, contrary to your previous assertions, there is \n     a long, bipartisan tradition of allowing Senators to offer \n     defense-related amendments on the Defense authorization bill \n     without the obstruction Senate Republicans are employing \n     today. The record also clearly shows that both Senate \n     Democrats and Republicans have recently foregone the \n     opportunity to block action on important Iraq-related \n     amendments.\n       For example, just last year the Senate voted up or down on \n     two Iraq-related amendments on the Defense authorization \n     bill. Additionally, Senate Democrats did not place a 60-vote \n     hurdle in front of Republican amendments to strike Iraq \n     policy language in the Iraq supplemental spending bill, nor \n     did votes on final passage of the Iraq supplemental require \n     60 votes.\n       Therefore, I renew the proposal I offered to you recently \n     to permit the Senate to act on a series of amendments \n     pertaining to Iraq. Under my proposal, the Senate would hold \n     up-or-down votes on the bipartisan amendments offered by \n     Senators Levin and Reed, Lugar and Warner, Salazar and \n     Alexander, and Nelson and Collins. There are other amendments \n     Republican and Democratic Senators wish to offer related to \n     Iraq, and I would be willing to work with you to ensure these \n     amendments also receive up-or-down votes.\n       For the sake of our troops and the American people, I hope \n     you reconsider your decision to obstruct Senate action on \n     critical amendments that would change the course of the war \n     in Iraq.\n\n  We have completed a vote, yet another example of an Iraq-related \namendment with a majority vote. We didn't demand a 60-vote margin on \nCornyn. It is another example of how amendments should be handled; that \nis, with a simple majority vote.\n  The American people deserve up-or-down votes, yes or no: Vote on the \namendment. The Levin-Reed amendment is a bipartisan amendment. For me, \none of the most significant paragraphs in that legislation was authored \nby Senator Hagel of Nebraska. It basically says we need to have the \nUnited Nations involved in this intractable civil war. It is a \nwonderfully written paragraph that strengthens this bipartisan \namendment.\n  We have three Republican cosponsors of this amendment.\n  A vote on this bipartisan amendment will be a vote to change course. \nA ``no'' vote would be a vote to stay the course, to continue the \nPresident's failed strategy indefinitely.\n  President Bush's term of office is winding down. We should not have \nto wait until he completes his term of office before we change course \non this war in Iraq. A ``yes'' vote on this bipartisan amendment would \nfinally bind President Bush to responsibly reduce combat operations and \nreturn our focus on the real and growing threats we face. That is why \nI, once again, request unanimous consent to move to an up-or-down vote \non Levin-Reed, along with the amendments my Republican colleagues wish \nto offer and other Democrats who wish to offer amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2088 be withdrawn and at \n6:30 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Levin-Reed amendment, No. 2087, \nwith the time between now and then equally divided in the usual form, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, either yes or no on this?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I believe I \ndo have the right to at least explain my reservation.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has asked for the regular \norder. The Senator has to object or not.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do object. I would like to ask if the \ndistinguished majority leader will give me an opportunity to at least \nrespond to some of the things he had to say. I think that would be the \nway we usually do business around here.\n  Mr. REID. I will be complete in a matter of minutes. We will have a \nfilibuster. He can speak for as many hours as he wants or minutes he \nwants. We are now at the time when the time for speeches has ended. It \nis time for voting. We want a vote on the Levin-Reed amendment. That is \nwhat we want. We have had a lot of good words from the other side of \nthe aisle. We want some votes, and that is what this is all about. This \nis not the time for reserving. Voting--that is what we want.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the majority leader yielded the floor, I seek \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, once again what we have seen with my friend from \nMississippi, and he is my friend--we have seen Republican leadership \nresort to technical maneuvers to block progress on this crucial \namendment. It would be one thing for Republicans to vote\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\nagainst this amendment. It is their right to do so. If they honestly \nbelieve stay the course is the right strategy, they have the right to \nvote no. But now Republicans are using a filibuster to block us from \neven voting on an amendment that could bring this war to a responsible \nend. They are protecting the President rather than protecting our \ntroops. They are denying us an up-or-down vote, yes or no, a vote on \nthe most important issue our country faces today.\n  I am speaking today for the American people; 67 percent of the \nAmerican people think the surge has been a failure--Democrats; not even \na majority of Republicans favor the surge. Of course, a significant \nmajority of Independents recognize that the surge has not been good. We \nare speaking for the American people on this bipartisan amendment.\n  We have no choice, as I have indicated earlier, but to stay in \nsession. The Republicans have a right to talk. Let them talk. It is \ntheir filibuster. But we will continue to speak in spite of that. When \nthey finish their filibuster, we will still be speaking, continue \nspeaking out on behalf of our troops and all Americans--all Americans: \nDemocrats, a majority of the Republicans, and the Independents--to \ncontinue requesting consent for an up-or-down vote on our amendment to \nend this war.\n  I don't want to make any more calls to the families in Nevada who \nhave lost a loved one. Tens of thousands of our bold, brave Americans \nhave been injured, wounded--a third of them grievously. When we hear \nthat there was an improvised explosive device and two soldiers were \nkilled, it doesn't talk about the maiming of other soldiers. \nThousands--thousands of American troops have lost multiple limbs. We \nhave heard from the experts about the head trauma. I can't get out of \nmy mind my trip to Walter Reed, where a woman said: I have been in the \nmilitary--I have been in the Army for 22 years. I have a master's \ndegree. My specialty was numbers. I worked in the Pentagon with \nnumbers. She said: I don't even know my own phone number. She said: I \nhave never had my skin pierced, but I have been knocked down; I have \nbeen in these explosions numerous times. I have no mind anymore.\n  That is what this amendment is all about--to change course. Is it \nnecessary we wait 60 more days until this magic day in September to \nchange course? How many more Americans soldiers are going to be killed? \nHow many are going to be maimed, wounded, lose their arms, lose their \nminds? So we have no choice but to stay in session and continue \nspeaking out on behalf of our troops and all Americans, to continue \nrequesting consent for an up-or-down vote on this amendment.\n  Our troops in Baghdad are 8 hours ahead of us here on the east coast. \nAs we begin our debate in earnest tonight, our troops are going to be \nwaking up. They will be waking up to the 1,582nd day of this war. They \nwill wake up, and it is very hot in Iraq this time of the year. They \nare a long ways away in some foreign land we call Iraq, far from their \nfamilies, and facing, every minute of the day, danger.\n  This is not a war where the troops gather and face each other. This \nis a war in an urban setting, most of the time, where people are blown \nup driving vehicles up streets buying groceries in a marketplace. What \nhappened yesterday? In a place that there had been no violence, more \nthan 100 were killed and more than 200 injured. The picture in the \npaper--there is a hole where that bomb went off as big and deep as this \nChamber we are in today.\n  The violence is escalating. The new report is out. It was leaked last \nweek; it is out today. ``Al-Qaida stronger,'' so says the report. The \nPresident disagrees, but that is what the report says. Can't have it \nboth ways.\n\n  So our valiant troops are going to wake up with this war facing \nthem--more than any one of us can understand, with the exception of \nmaybe Senator Webb, Senator Kerry, maybe John McCain--I am sorry if I \nmissed others--Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens. Senator Hagel, of \ncourse--with his brother--fought in Vietnam. They are going to wake up, \nas I said, far from their families, facing constant danger, for what? \nFor what? Mr. President, 69 percent of the Iraqi people don't want us \nthere. They are saying we are doing more harm than good. Al Maliki said \na couple of days ago he can do without us. We can leave whatever time \nwe want. They can handle the situation with the billions and billions \nof dollars we have spent training Iraqi troops.\n  We as Senators owe it to each of our men and women in Iraq to debate \nthe war openly and honestly, and we owe it to all Americans to finally \nvote for a responsible end to the war that has been so long in coming. \nI hope by the time this night is through and dawn has broken that we \nwill have the opportunity to vote.\n  We are willing to vote before that. Whenever we have an opportunity, \nwe are going to ask reasonably that we have a vote on the bipartisan \namendment. It is the right thing to do. It is what the American people \ndeserve.\n  We are spending, now, $12 billion a month. Is that enough to get our \nattention? We are trying to do other things. What are we trying to do? \nGet health care for kids. The President is very concerned about these \nappropriations bills which we are going to try to pass. Where is the \nmoney to pass them, giving the American people what they deserve? It \nhas been taken in the sands of Iraq, to the tune of more than a half a \ntrillion dollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question without the Senator \nyielding his right to the floor?\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the majority leader yield the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I will not do that. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the distinguished majority leader if he has not had \nexperiences similar to mine. I was in Vermont over the weekend, as I am \nmost weekends. I get stopped by people in the grocery store or putting \ngas in the car--we are a small State, and you tend to know everybody; \nthey are Republicans and they are Democrats--and I get asked the \nconstant question, if the President will not listen to us about getting \nout, can you people in Congress vote on something? Can you vote? Can \nyou either vote to keep us there or vote to get us out, but stand up? \nMy answer to them is we are prepared to vote on our side of the aisle. \nSenator Reid and those following him are prepared to vote, but we are \nstopped from voting.\n  I am wondering whether the distinguished majority leader, when he \ngoes home to Nevada, whether he doesn't hear similar sentiments about: \nLet us vote. Let us vote.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished chair of the \nJudiciary Committee, I don't have to go home. People call me. I talk to \nmy brothers. They tell me what they think is wrong. I talk to my \nfriends. I have tried every weekend when I have some time and I am \nhere--I try to reach some people in Nevada I haven't talked to in a \nwhile. They say exactly what my friend from Vermont says: Get us out of \nthere. Get us out of there.\n  That is what this Levin-Reed amendment is all about, to change course \nin Iraq. The American people deserve that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority leader, first, he has focused on the \nmost important part of this debate, the war that is claiming American \nlives. But, unfortunately, this debate also focuses on the rules of the \nSenate. I ask the Senate majority leader if he is aware of the fact \nthat in the last 7 years that the Defense authorization bill has been \nbrought to the floor, every amendment which has been offered was \nsubject to a majority vote, simple majority vote, except in five \ninstances which required a budget waiver, a specific provision in our \nSenate rules when there were budget waivers required as with the \nminimum wage and so forth, 60 votes. But is the majority leader aware \nof the fact that in every authorization bill, Defense authorization \nbill, in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, that \nevery amendment has been judged by a majority vote and that the \ndecision by the Republicans to obstruct the majority vote on this is \nthe first time in this long period of time that we have ever done this \non a Defense authorization bill?\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, during the years you have mentioned, \nthere have been democratically controlled Senates, Republican \ncontrolled Senates, but it doesn't matter who is controlling the \nSenate, we have always done these bills with simple majority votes.\n  For example, I can remember last year we had one vote, as I recall, \non minimum wage because it required 60 votes to waive a budget point of \norder. So this new thing about 60 votes on everything is something that \nhas been ginned up in the minds of people who want to avoid votes to \nchange the course in Iraq.\n  That is what it is all about. The war is not going well. We all know \nthat. We need to sit back and understand that it needs to change \ncourse. There is a column written today, I read it, op-ed about \nPresident Bush being stubborn. And he is. We all know that. That is not \nall together always a bad trait.\n  But, boy, I will tell you, he is sure showing his streak of \nstubbornness on this. He was unwilling to listen to anyone who \ndisagreed with him, and there are a number of people who have been \ndumped from the administration as a result. Someone who suggested the \nwar would cost $150 to $200 billion, Lindsey, he was gone quick.\n  We had one of our good generals who suggested we needed a lot more \ntroops there. Out the door he went. We could go through a list of \npeople who disagreed with the President who hit the road.\n  I would hope that on this issue, when so many people all across this \ncountry, on a bipartisan basis, agree that something needs to change in \nIraq, my friends, the Republicans, recognize that they also have \nresponsibility to the American people more so than the President.\n  Now, I would say this. My friend, Senator Lott, is still here. I am \ngoing to yield the floor and whoever grabs the floor can have it. I say \nto my friend, Senator Lott, who has always been a gentleman to me in \nthe many areas we have worked together here: This was a time that I \nwanted a ``yes'' or ``no'' response. He is a real pro in here. He knows \nthat he can get the floor again to explain whatever his position was. \nThis was in the middle of my speech. That is why I followed the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Nevada, the distinguished majority \nleader and my friend for many years, points out that in previous years, \nthe Defense authorization bill was passed without requirements for a \n60-vote majority. There is a simple answer to that. We never took up an \nissue such as this on the Defense authorization bill.\n  In fact, our focus and our attention was, for 45 years, providing men \nand women who are serving in the military with what they needed to \ndefend this Nation. Instead--instead, of doing what is necessary, \nincluding the 3.5-percent pay raise, including the Wounded Warriors \nlegislation on it to take care of our veterans--we are now gridlocked \nin the Senate because the Senator from Nevada knows he is not going to \npass a withdrawal from Iraq on this bill. If he did, the President \nwould veto the bill, because the President has said it. We all know \nthat in September this issue is going to come to a head, whether I \nhappen to favor that or not.\n  Most people believe that September is a time where we could make the \nkinds of judgments necessary to see whether we are making the kind of \nprogress that will justify continued effort in this new strategy, which \nI, of course, would remind my colleagues again, the last part of which \nwas put in place a few weeks ago.\n  Of course, we did not have requirements for 60-vote majorities in the \npast few years because no one had the temerity to put an issue such as \nthis on the very vital needs of the men and women in the military to do \ntheir job. So, of course, there was not a controversial necessity for a \n60-vote majority.\n  I am happy to tell my friend from Mississippi that Senator Levin and \nI are moving forward with clearing amendments so we can, we hope, wrap \nup this bill by the end of this week. I hope that once this display \nthat is going to take place tonight, all night, is concluded, and there \nis not sufficient votes in order to get the Levin-Reed amendment \npassed, at some point we can go back to the Defense authorization bill \nand get them the 3.5 percent pay raise they have earned; get them that \nMRAP equipment that they need; get this Wounded Warrior legislation \nthrough the Senate and to the desk of the President of the United \nStates.\n  We never grow tired, nor should we, of praising the men and women in \nthe military, particularly those who have sacrificed so much. All of us \nare embarrassed and ashamed at what happened at Walter Reed. Well, \nlet's pass this Wounded Warrior legislation on this bill and get it \ndone.\n  Who is holding up passage of the Defense authorization bill? Who is \nrequiring us to stay up all night to discuss it? My friends, this is \nnot necessary. We all know that General Petraeus was affirmed in his \nposition by the Senate by an overwhelming vote. General Petraeus, at \nthe time of his hearings, said we were going to have a new strategy--\nthat strategy is called surge--and that it would require additional \ntroops.\n  He also said at that time it would take time, that it would take a \nperiod of time before we would know whether it succeeded. Here we are, \nliterally weeks after the last part of this new strategy is in place, \nthe last detachment of an increase in troops, and we are telling them \nto set a date for withdrawal.\n  Now, you know, I share the frustration that my friend from Nevada \nstated about a failed policy. It was a failed policy. The Rumsfeld-\nCasey policy strategy was doomed to failure, and some of us recognized \nthat and stated that at the time. We said we had to have a new \nstrategy. It has to be the classic counterinsurgency strategy if we are \ngoing to succeed in Iraq.\n\n  Well, we got a new general. We got a new strategy. There are signs of \nsuccess. There are clearly some signs of progress, and those are \nreadily apparent. Now, is the Maliki Government acting in the way we \nwant them to? No, they are not. Is it disappointing that they are not? \nAbsolutely, it is disappointing.\n  But as far as Anbar Province is concerned, as far as some parts of \nBaghdad are concerned, yes, there is some progress which has been \npurchased at great and tragic cost, the sacrifice of young American's \nlives.\n  I would like to again assure my friend of many years, from Nevada, I \nunderstand the frustration that he shows is shared by many Americans. \nOur failure and our employment of a failed strategy for more than 3 \nyears is well articulated. But I also would plead with my colleagues to \nat least know that we are not going to stop this now. We are not going \nstop it now. Even if the majority leader got the 60 votes and got this \nincluded in the bill in some way, the President of the United States \nwould veto it. We do not want that to happen. We do not want that to \nhappen.\n  We know that in September, whether I happen to like it or not--I \nwould like to personally give it more time than September--we know that \nin September this whole issue is going to come to a head. Here we are \nin the middle of July. Can't we sit down and work out the amendments in \na way that Senator Levin and I and Senator Warner and previous chairmen \nand ranking members have for the last 20 years, get this bill done, get \nit out and get it to the President's desk? Then we go into recess. We \ncome back in September. I think that that is not an unreasonable path \nto follow.\n  So, my friends, we will continue to debate this issue all night \ntonight. I understand that. Hopefully, when the majority sees that, the \nleader sees there is not the votes, maybe we could then get down to the \nnuts and bolts of the Defense authorization bill of which at last count \nthere are over 100 amendments pending that Members have on both sides \nof the aisle, they want to be considered and voted on.\n  I fear--I fear--that the majority leader, because of a lack of time, \nmay feel it necessary to pull the bill from the floor. I think that \nwould not be in any way helpful to our Nation's national security \ninterests.\n  My friends, if we could lower the rhetoric around here a bit, let us \nsit down and talk about the best way to proceed, recognizing that \nSeptember will be a very important point, and pass this authorization \nbill and not for\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\nthe first time in 45 years have us not do what we need to do for our \nNation's security and the men and women who are serving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Arizona. We disagree on a number of issues. We have worked \ntogether on many others. I would like to respond to several things he \nsaid. Senator McCain asked us who is holding up this bill? Well, those \nwho followed the debate know that a few minutes ago the majority \nleader, Senator Reid of Nevada, asked to move to vote on the amendment \nby Senators Levin and Reed. He asked for unanimous consent to move to a \nvote within a matter of hours.\n  Where did the objection come from? From the Republican side of the \naisle. So in answering Senator McCain's question, who is holding up \nthis bill, it is your side of the aisle, and specifically the Senator \nsitting next to you who objected to moving to a vote. That is what is \nholding up this bill.\n  The second question asked by the Senator from Arizona: Why are we \ndebating the war on this bill? This bill happens to be the \nauthorization for appropriations for fiscal year 2007 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense. If you do not debate the war \nin Iraq on the bill authorizing appropriations for the Department of \nDefense, where would you turn, the agriculture bill? I don't think so. \nThis is the appropriate bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona has made that point. Included within the \namendments to this bill are provision for our warriors who are coming \nhome wounded. I have been part of putting that together. I thank \nSenator Levin, I thank Senator McCain. It is an important provision. \nBut let's be very honest. The reason they are coming home wounded is \nbecause there is a war. It is fit and proper for us to ask whether that \nwar is being waged effectively and whether our policy should be changed \nin this bill? If not on this bill, what bill would we use? I think, \nfrankly, that many would rather we did not debate this at all; give \npermission to the President to wage the war as he wants as long as he \nwants: step out of the way, Congress, the President is in charge.\n  I don't accept that. Each of us represents our own State, represents \npeople who expect us to articulate their point of view and speak for \nthem. We do not cede all power in this Government to one branch, not to \nthe executive branch. We have our own responsibility.\n  Let me say a word about waiting until September. Waiting until \nSeptember, what difference would it make if we wait until September? \nWhat could it possibly cost us if we wait until September? Well, it is \nlikely to cost us 200 American lives. We are losing 100 Americans, on \naverage, every single month of this war. It is likely to cost us 2,000 \nmore injured soldiers; that is what 2 months means.\n  It is likely to cost us $24 billion from America's Treasury. It is \nnot a matter of waiting for a convenient moment chosen by some to make \nthis decision. Many of us believe this decision should be made now and \nit should be made here, and it should be made with the Levin-Reed \namendment which is a reasonable bipartisan amendment.\n  The Republican side objects. They are filibustering. We have said \nthis will not be the most modern form of filibuster. This goes back to \nthe roots of the Senate. We will stay in business during the period of \ntime when we are supposed to be debating. Whether we go to this \namendment, we will invite members from both said of the aisle to \nexpress their point of view. I will tell you this, the people I \nrepresent in my State, the ones whom I meet, as Senator Leahy said of \nhis voters in Vermont, want us to change this policy in this war. They \nwant us to bring this war to an end. They understand, as we must \nunderstand, we never bargained for where we are today. America was \nmisled into this war. We were told there were weapons of mass \ndestruction, nuclear weapons, they threatened the Middle East, they \nthreatened America. Not a single one has been found.\n  We were told that this dictator, Saddam Hussein, was the reason for \nthis invasion. He is long gone--dug out of a hole in the ground, put on \ntrial, and executed by his own people. Yet we still stay in this war, a \nwar that has changed so drastically to the point that it is now a civil \nwar and our soldiers, as good as they are, are caught in the crossfire \nof sectarian violence, now victims of al-Qaida terrorism that did not \nexist when we invaded Iraq, not in that country.\n  They are the ones who are the victims of bad planning and bad \ndecisions. It is interesting to me how many Republican Senators see how \npoorly executed this war has been.\n  We all know our military is the best. But when it comes to the \nCommander in Chief and the generals, so many bad decisions have been \nmade at the expense of our troops. It is interesting to me, they \nconcede that point and yet want to continue: Let's just wait a few more \nmonths, maybe another year, maybe a year and a half, and then see what \nhappens.\n  I was one of 23 Senators who voted against this authorization to go \nto war.\n  Mr. BYRD. So was I.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Byrd, I remember your leadership on this issue as \nwell. I can tell you it was not the most popular position to be in at \nthe time.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The overwhelming majority of the American people heard \ntheir President say weapons of mass destruction, ruthless and \nbloodthirsty dictator, and said: Yes, maybe we should invade. But it \ndidn't add up. It didn't add up in terms of the threat or in terms of \nwhether we were prepared to accept the reality that it is far easier to \nget into a war than it is to get out of one. Here we are in the fifth \nyear of a war that has lasted longer than World War II, a war with no \nend in sight. This President's response: Send more American soldiers \ninto harm's way in Iraq.\n  That is unacceptable. It is time for the Iraqis to stand and defend \ntheir own nation. They will not do that until American soldiers start \ncoming home. That is what the Levin-Reed amendment is about.\n  I am sorry the Republican side has initiated this filibuster to block \na vote on this important amendment. I am sorry they are insisting on a \n60-vote margin which was rarely, if ever, used on a Defense \nauthorization bill over the last 7 years. Those are the facts. They \nhave done it because their ranks are starting to change. Three \nRepublican Senators have now stepped out and said they will join us in \nthis effort to change the policy of the war. Many more back home have \nsaid they have decided we need a new policy in Iraq. We want to give \nthem a chance for a vote that is significant.\n  Will the President veto it if we pass it? Probably. But does that \nmean we shouldn't try? Don't we owe it to these soldiers and their \nfamilies and to our Nation to change this failed policy before it \nclaims more American lives, sends more American warriors back wounded \nfrom battle and costs Americans the treasure we have gathered in the \ntaxes of our citizens?\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, we see this war differently, but I \nthink it is clear who is holding up this bill: the Republican minority \nwith their filibuster. Why this bill? Because if you didn't debate a \nwar on a Defense authorization bill, where would you debate it? Should \nwe wait until September? The cost is too high.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I was just given information by my \nstaff. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nDisposition of Measures Undergoing Rollcall Votes in the Senate, 109th \n                                Congress\n\n\n                   109th congress, 1st session (2005)\n\n     Number of measures on which there were rollcall votes in \n         2005: 40\n     Passed without a vote on cloture or another 60-vote \n         requirement: 29\n       (1) London Terrorist Attacks (S.

Passed after a cloture vote and/or other 60-vote \nrequirement in 2005, seven; passed after a cloture vote and/or a 60-\nvote requirement in 2006, 10; defeated by cloture or 60-vote \nrequirement, also in 2006, 10.\n  It is clear that when the Senator from Illinois was in the minority, \nthey used the 60-vote provision as well, and that is their right to do \nso. I don't in any way object to their having done that. I do object \nstrenuously to somehow conveying the impression that this is a \n``filibuster'' because we require 60 votes, that this is some Earth-\nshattering, precedent-shattering procedure. In fact, it is not. In \nfact, the Senator from Illinois knows very well that 60 votes is often \nrequired, whether it be a budget point of order or whether a cloture \nvote, and it has been used quite often by the minority as a tool to \nassert their rights as the minority. I understand that.\n  The Senator from Illinois talks about the bill that this has to be \non. This is either the eighth or ninth time we have brought up Iraq. He \ndidn't need the authorization bill to do it then. It is the right of \nthe majority to bring up whatever they want, whenever they want. I can \nassure my colleagues, the Defense authorization bill will probably not \nbe on the floor in September, and one thing I am pretty confident of is \nthat we will be taking up the issue of Iraq in September. So to somehow \nsay that this is appropriate, it is not appropriate because it is \ncontroversial, and we know it will not be passed with a provision that \nrequires what the Senator from Illinois wants on it. It will never \nbecome law because the President will veto it in the unlikely--in fact, \nhighly unlikely--situation where this bill was passed by both Houses of \nCongress.\n  What we are doing--have no doubt about it--is keeping the 3.5-percent \npay raise from going into law. We are keeping the wounded warrior \nlegislation from being enacted by both Houses and us acting as quickly \nas possible. The Senator from Illinois, I believe, and all other \nSenators voted on behalf of the nomination of General Petraeus in \nFebruary, knowing full well what General Petraeus's strategy was. That \nwas\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\nvery well articulated. So now we find ourselves some months later \nsaying: Well, we have to end it.\n  The distinguished majority leader, who is no longer on the floor, \ndeclared the war lost. I was astonished. Because if we lost the war, \nthen somebody won. Does that mean that al-Qaida has won the war? I \ndon't think the 160,000 young men and women who are serving in Iraq, \nwhom I visited about a week ago, think the war is lost. I don't think \nthe majority of Americans do either. Are they frustrated by what has \nhappened here? Of course, they are frustrated. They want to bring it to \nan end. But it is the obligation of people such as me to point out what \nhappens when we withdraw in 120 days.\n  Literally, in the view of every expert on national security, we will \npay a much heavier price in the long run. Chaos, genocide will ensue. \nQuite often I hear from the other side: What is plan B, if the surge \ndoesn't work?\n  What is plan B if the withdrawal results in chaos and genocide in the \nregion? According to most experts--including Henry Kissinger, Brent \nScowcroft, General Zinni according to most people who have spent their \nlives on national security issues, it will be chaos and genocide. What \nis plan B there?\n  I hope after the show is over tomorrow morning sometime--and it is \nclear to all that we will not set a 120-day withdrawal date from Iraq \non this legislation--we will then be able to sit down and move forward \non the bill so that we can get it passed into law. That is what we \nshould be doing. To somehow think that we have not required, as the \nmajority leader on many occasions required, 60 votes for passage of an \namendment or legislation, of course, flies in the face of the clear \nrecord which I have just asked to be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  America is now at a crossroads. America is now at a point where, \naccording to Natan Sharansky:\n\n       A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces could lead to a \n     bloodbath . . .\n\n  From Anthony Zinni, who was opposed to us going into Iraq:\n\n      . . . reality is that we simply cannot pull out [of Iraq], \n     as much as we may want to. The consequences of a destabilized \n     and chaotic Iraq, sitting in a critical region of the world, \n     could have catastrophic implications . . . there is no short-\n     term solution.\n\n  We have a system of government where the military is subordinate to \nthe civilian leadership, and it should be. It is the most appropriate \nway. But to completely ignore, as apparently my friend from Illinois \nis, the leaders whom we have appointed to fight over there and do the \ndying and carry out the leadership responsibilities, to completely \nignore their advice and counsel, they are on the ground. They know what \nis going on.\n  General Lynch, 3rd ID commander, says:\n\n     [pulling out before the mission was accomplished] would be a \n     mess.\n\n  By the way, these will be the guys who will be required to clean up \nthe mess, if we pass this resolution and we have a mess.\n  Continuing from General Lynch:\n\n     . . . you'd find the enemy regaining ground, reestablishing \n     sanctuaries, building more IEDs . . . and the violence would \n     escalate.\n\n  I have already quoted before from Henry Kissinger.\n  General Lynch:\n\n     [our soldiers] want to fight terrorists here, so they don't \n     have to fight terrorists back home . . . I now have the \n     forces I need to conduct that mission.\n\n  General Lynch, the 3rd ID commander, says he has the troops and the \nwherewithal and the success to get the job done.\n  The Senator from Illinois wants to say, no, you have to come home in \n120 days. I don't think that is right. I don't think General Lynch is \nreading any polls. I think General Lynch and General Petraeus are \nfighting an enemy that, according to them, they will be fighting here \nif we have a precipitous withdrawal.\n  General Lynch:\n\n     . . . surge forces are giving us the capability we have now \n     to take the fight to the enemy . . . the enemy only responds \n     to force, and we now have that force.\n\n  That is the force that the Senator from Illinois wants to withdraw \nwithin 120 days.\n\n       We can conduct detailed kinetic strikes, we can do cordon \n     and searches, and we can deny the enemy sanctuaries . . . If \n     those surge forces go away that capability goes away, and the \n     Iraqi security forces aren't ready yet to do that [mission].\n\n  Brent Scowcroft, who opposed our entry into the Iraq conflict:\n\n     [reduction of American presence in Iraq] should follow \n     success in our efforts, not the calendar or the performance \n     of others.\n\n  I hope that sometime my friends who were involved in this debate will \nlisten to the people we have delegated to lead the best Armed Forces in \nthe history of mankind who are doing one of the most difficult jobs in \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I have been waiting 1 hour to respond to \nsome comments that were directed at me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had hoped that in this debate and in this Congress, we \nwould be able to maintain some semblance, some modicum of courtesy. But \nit appears we have lost it all. I have been in Congress 35 years. I \nhave been in the Senate 19 years. I have been in a variety of \npositions. Never before have I been denied or did I ever deny any \nSenator the opportunity to have a reservation on his right to object to \na unanimous consent request. Now that has occurred. So that courtesy, \none of the few remaining ones we have left in this institution, is \ngone.\n  Let me correct some of the things that have been said here that the \nrecord will show, certainly, in the debate. The other side speaks about \na new standard for 60 votes. That is interesting.\n  During this Congress, 47 clotures have been filed. In the 106th \nCongress, there were 71; 107th, 72; 108th 62; the 109th, 68. This is \nnot a new phenomenon. It has occurred all the time, regardless of \nwhether Republicans or Democrats were in the majority. Even Senator \nReid said twice this year:\n\n       In the Senate it has always been the case you need 60 \n     votes. I don't have 60 votes--\n\n  The particular issue he was referring to--\n\n     60 votes are required for just about everything.\n\n  That was what Senator Reid had to say earlier this year.\n  We are ready to vote. We could have a vote on this amendment, the \nLevin-Reed amendment, right now. We are ready to go. We can have the \ncloture vote that would be scheduled in the morning in an hour, to be \nfair to everybody, so we could have wrapup statements. Everybody knows \nwe can have that vote now, or 5:30 or 6:30, or in the morning. I have \nbeen involved in these all-night discussions. Interestingly, the last \ntime we had one of these so-called all-night debates, it was because \nthe Democrats wanted to require 60 votes to confirm a Federal judge, \nwhich had not been the practice throughout the history of this great \ncountry.\n  I understand about the 60-vote requirement. Nobody is surprised by \nthis. We have already had 60-vote votes taken on amendments on this \nbill.\n  First, before the majority whip leaves, let me ask unanimous consent \nthat the cloture vote scheduled for the morning occur at 5:30 this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I have not yielded the floor, so I wish to \ngo ahead and complete my remarks on the broader issues that have been \nraised here.\n  We debated in March and April and May whether we should confirm \nGeneral Petraeus, whether we should go forward with the funds that our \ntroops needed to do the job, and whether the surge could go forward. \nThe vote was 80 to 14 in May to go forward with trying to bring down \nthe violence, get control and, of course, encourage the Iraqi \ngovernment to do more. We confirmed General Petraeus unanimously. They \nare already saying the surge has failed when, as a matter of fact, the \ntroops that were supposed to be involved in that effort have only been \nthere for some 3 weeks. So I think it is premature and unfair to the \nmen and women who are there on the ground doing the job. We need to \nhave the debate, allow both sides to have their say, but it is going to \nrequire 60 votes, and then we can go on to the underlying bill.\n\n  This is the Defense authorization bill. Every year we pass the \nDefense authorization bill. Yet I think we have had maybe one amendment \neven considered that has to do with the underlying bill, which provides \nfunds and authorization for our troops for the\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nequipment they need, the supplies, the ships, the planes, the pay \nraise, and quality of life. That is something we have to come to terms \nwith. We have to have a debate on amendments that affect this bill. We \ncould work out how to do that.\n  Somebody said amendments are being blocked. As a matter of fact, \nSenator Levin and Senator McCain are clearing amendments right now. The \nprocess is underway. So I would say I am very disappointed in the way \nthis issue is being handled. I must say I am even surprised we have \nallowed it to deteriorate to this level, but I think we will get \nthrough it. The Congress is not going to precipitously mandate that our \ntroops begin to be withdrawn. We are going to go forward and allow them \nthe time to do the job. In September and October we will debate this \nissue again, as we should. But to come back again after having just \nvoted in May to allow us to go forward and say here we are in July and \nthe surge has failed, I think that is a terrible mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, since the minority whip is ready to \nvote, I ask unanimous consent to vote on the Levin-Reed amendment No. \n2087 at 6 p.m. with the time between now and then equally divided in \nthe usual form.\n  Mr. LOTT. I object, Madam President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the objection is heard, and I think it \nis very clear. You cannot object to the vote, say you are ready to \nvote, and then object to the vote. You cannot have it both ways.\n  The fact is, when you look at these past votes on the Defense \nauthorization bill, they don't make the case that the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Mississippi say. I will go through each \none of them:\n  For the year 2000, considering the fiscal year 2001 Defense \nauthorization bill, of 14 amendments on which there were rollcall \nvotes, only 1 required 60 votes because it involved a budget waiver. In \n2001, when we considered the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization \nbill, of the 2 amendments on which there were rollcall votes, all were \nsimple majorities; no 60-vote requirements. In 2002, for the 2003 \nDefense authorization bill, of the 5 amendments on which there were \nrollcall votes, only 1 60-vote requirement; again, a specific budget \nwaiver, which is not the case with the pending amendment. In 2003, when \nwe considered the 2004 Defense authorization, of the 10 amendments on \nwhich there were rollcall votes, all were simple majorities; no 60-vote \nrequirements. In 2004, with the 2005 Defense authorization, of the 30 \namendments on which there were rollcall votes, all were simple \nmajorities; no 60-vote requirements. In 2004, with the 2005 Defense \nauthorization, of the 30 amendments on which there were rollcall votes, \nonly 2 required an extraordinary majority of 60 votes, both requiring \nbudget waivers. In 2005 when we considered the Defense authorization \nbill for 2006, for 25 amendments they were simple majority votes. None \nrequired 60 votes. In 2006, when considering the fiscal year 2007 \nDefense authorization bill, 15 amendments, only 2 required 60 votes. \nThey related to the minimum wage. They required budget waivers. Those \nare the only 2.\n  Let me also correct the record. When the Senator from Arizona says we \ndon't take up the war in Iraq on the Defense authorization bill, I \nwould remind him that in the last Defense authorization bill, there \nwere two specific amendments offered relative to the conduct of the war \nin Iraq--on this very bill last year: one by Senator Levin and Senator \nReed, another by Senator John Kerry, both of which only required a \nmajority vote.\n  I would say from the Senator from Arizona's point of view, there is \nscant evidence to support his position that No. 1, we never considered \nIraq on Defense authorization bills--we just did last year; No. 2, we \nalways require 60 votes when it comes to amendments on the bills. Six \ntimes in 7 years we did, each one because of a budget issue that is not \ninvolved in the Levin amendment.\n  Let me say a word about the other things said by the Senator from \nArizona before yielding the floor. I respect the men and women in \nuniform. I have been to Iraq twice. I have visited with them. I have \nbeen to send-offs in my State of Illinois as National Guard units have \nbeen activated. I have been there to welcome them home. I carry on many \nconversations with the Illinois soldiers overseas. I keep in touch with \ntheir families. I respect them very much. But to say this is the first \ntime we have heard from generals in Iraq that they just need another 6 \nmonths or another year, I think the Senator from Arizona knows better. \nWe have been told this over and over again: When they stand up, we will \nstand down. Do you remember that one? How many years have we been \nhearing that? How many hundreds of millions of dollars have we put into \nIraq for training Iraqi Army soldiers? Yet we are still there with a \nlarger force today than there we were just a year ago.\n  So when my colleague argues that just a little more time is all they \nneed, I hope he will understand the skepticism of the American people \nand many Members of the Senate. We have heard this before over and over \nagain.\n  I also want to take issue with one point the Senator from Arizona \nsaid--and I am sure he didn't mean to mislead anyone. We are not \ntalking about withdrawing the troops in 120 days, which is what has \nbeen said over and over again. The Levin-Reed amendment begins the \nwithdrawal of troops in 120 days, completing it on April 1 of next \nyear--transitioning by April 1 to a different force; not the combat \nforce we know now caught in the midst of a civil war but a force with \nthe specified mission of fighting al-Qaida and other terrorism, of \nhelping transition the Iraqi Army to self-defense, and protecting our \nown men and women and our assets and security during this transition. \nThose things are all included in this bill. So this notion that somehow \nin a matter of 120 days all the troops will be gone, that isn't even \nenvisioned in the Levin-Reed amendment.\n\n  So I would say to my friend from Arizona: Yes, I guess my patience \nhas worn thin. I guess I have heard from too many generals such as \nthose quoted by the Senator from Arizona that they just need a little \nmore time. I have seen what time has cost us. It has cost us American \nlives. It has cost us serious, debilitating injuries. It has cost us a \ngreat deal in terms of our national treasure and resources. I think it \nis time for a change of policy, and so do the American people. They \nsaid that in the last election. They don't want us to dream up \nprocedural obstacles to keep us from this decision. They want us to \nvote up or down to change the policy or keep the policy. That is what \nwe were sent here to do.\n  I hope the Republican side of the aisle, as they initiate this \nfilibuster, as they try to stop us from coming to a majority vote on \nthe Levin-Reed amendment, understand that America sees that clearly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Illinois--and this is growing a little \nwearisome, it really is. The fact is, 60 votes have been invoked by the \nminority time after time after time, whether it be a district judge or \nan appellate court judge, or most any other issue that is \ncontroversial. The Senator from Illinois knows that, and that is why it \nis very disappointing to see him using this kind of rhetoric when he is \nwilling to have 60 votes be required for some judge but somehow feels--\nwhich they did invoke when they were in the minority--and yet feels \nthat it is not appropriate to have 60 votes on an issue of this \nimportance.\n  The Senator from Illinois talks about beginning the withdrawal in 120 \ndays, beginning the withdrawal in 120 days. The day that is signed into \nlaw would be the day--would be the day, in the view of every military \nexpert, that al-Qaida would sit back and wait until we left.\n  The Senator from Illinois continues to call it a civil war. There is \nsectarian violence. There is very little doubt in the minds--of course, \nperhaps the Senator from Illinois and others know more than literally \nevery expert I know. It has become, in the words of General Petraeus, a \ncenter for al-Qaida and a central front in the war on terror, according \nto our leading generals.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n  Now, I resent a little bit this comment by the Senator from Illinois \nabout he has heard the generals before. I heard the generals before, \nand I disagreed with the generals, and that is our right to do. But to \ndenigrate their opinion I don't think is appropriate to people who \nspend their lives in the service of the military, defending this \nNation. General Petraeus, it is my understanding, has been wounded \nthree times in different wars fighting for this Nation. I think he \ndeserves respect rather than being dismissed by saying: Well, I have \nheard the generals say that before. We should pay attention to the \ngenerals. We should have paid attention to the generals at other times \nin our history, including those who disagreed with the former Secretary \nof Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  Again, I repeat, since we seem to be going in a certain circularity, \nconditions in Iraq today are terrible, but they become way worse as the \nU.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, a career foreign service \nofficer, recently told the New York Times. I am quoting from the \nWashington Post editorial of just a few days ago:\n\n       The generals who have devised--\n\n  The generals whom the Senator from Illinois derides--\n\n       The generals who have devised a new strategy believe they \n     are making fitful progress in calming Baghdad, training the \n     Iraqi Army, and encouraging anti-al-Qaida coalitions. Before \n     Congress begins managing rotation schedules and ordering \n     withdrawals, it should at least give those generals the \n     months they ask for to see whether their strategy can offer \n     some new hope.\n\n  Why do you think the Washington Post and literally most every \nnational security expert feels that this ought to be given an \nopportunity, remembering that the last part of it has just been put in \nplace a short time ago? Because the consequences of failure, as I have \njust quoted from many military experts, are a catastrophe.\n  General Lynch says:\n\n       What the Iraqis are worried about is our leaving. And our \n     answer is: We are staying, because my order from the Corps \n     Commander is that we don't leave the battle space until we \n     can hand over to the Iraqi security forces. Everybody wants \n     things to happen overnight, and that is not going to happen.\n\n  So when the amendment of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and the Senator from Michigan is passed, then the \nword is spread and General Lynch can no longer say to the Iraqis we are \nstaying, because we will be leaving.\n  General Odierno says:\n\n       My assessment right now is, I need more time to understand \n     how the current offensive targeting al-Qaida and Iraq \n     terrorists is working and how it could lead to political \n     progress in the months ahead.\n\n  Odierno said:\n\n       I am seeing some progress now here in Iraq. We have really \n     just started what the Iraqis term ``liberating'' them from \n     al-Qaida. What I've got to determine is what do I need in \n     order to continue that progress so that the political peace \n     can take hold and Iraqi sources can hold this for the long \n     term.\n\n  I want to point out to my colleagues that I am not guaranteeing \nsuccess. I wish it had gone better. I think there are areas, \nparticularly as far as the government is concerned, where dramatic \nimprovement has to take place. But I do know the consequences of \nfailure, and that view of setting a date for withdrawal is a clear \nrecipe for a much larger conflict with much greater involvement in the \nregion over time.\n  So when the Senator from Illinois and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle talk about how this won't be withdrawal if this is passed, I \nsay: My friends, this is withdrawal. This is the message to those \npeople who have to remain in the neighborhood: We are leaving and you \nare going to have to make adjustments to the neighborhood and the new \nbig guys on the block.\n  Again, I wish we could take up this issue in September. I wish we \ncould pass the necessary legislation to care for the men and women who \nare wounded. I wish we could pass the necessary legislation in order to \ntake care of the needs of the men and women in the military. If we pass \nthis bill this week--I tell my colleagues we are going to be going into \nthe August recess. We will be coming back in September with probably a \nvery contentious conference with the House. The chances right now of us \ngetting final passage and the President's signature on this bill by the \nfirst of October is not good. So the sooner we get this bill off the \nfloor and to the President, the better off we are going to be.\n  I certainly hope we will take into consideration the great needs that \nare existing in the military today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, tomorrow's vote in the Senate is not a \nvote on the Levin-Reed amendment. It is a vote on whether the Senate \nwill allow us to vote on the Levin-Reed amendment. It is a vote on \nwhether the Senate will break a filibuster so that the Senate can \nexpress its will, which I think is totally clear and reflects the will \nof the American people as expressed last November.\n  A change in course in Iraq is critical for our national security. If \nyou think the present course is working, if you think we are making \nprogress, as the President has said month after month, year after year, \nthen presumably you are going to vote against the Levin-Reed \namendment--if we can ever get to a vote on the Levin-Reed amendment. \nBut if you believe that changing course is the only hope of success in \nIraq, that forcing the political leaders of Iraq to accept \nresponsibility for their nation and to work out the political \nsettlements that could prevent this violence from continuing and lead \nto the ultimate success in Iraq, and if we can get to the Levin-Reed \namendment and break the filibuster, then you will be voting yes.\n  Madam President, it has been more than 4 years since the United \nStates invaded Iraq. Despite a military victory that toppled Saddam \nHussein and routed his army, Iraq soon became victim to a Sunni \ninsurgency, to Shiite militias bent on revenge, and became victim to an \nincursion of al-Qaida terrorists whose actions were aimed and are aimed \nat promoting an Iraqi civil war.\n  As the situation on the ground has shifted, so has President Bush's \nrationale for our involvement. He took us into Iraq to get rid of \nSaddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction. When no weapons of \nmass destruction were found, the President said we needed to create a \ndemocracy in Iraq. Now the President says we must stay on to fight al-\nQaida.\n  The President had a pre-surge strategy, a surge strategy, and now he \nhas offered a post-surge strategy. What has remained constant in all of \nthese strategies is one thing: They all have an open-ended commitment \nof U.S. forces in the middle of Iraq's civil war.\n  That open-ended commitment of a Muslim country by the West has played \nright into the hands of al-Qaida. Indeed, the intelligence community is \nrecently reported to have concluded that the years of our occupation of \nIraq have seen a surge of al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  It has come at a staggering cost--the loss of more than 3,600 of \nAmerica's best and bravest, seven times that many wounded, and a price \nof $10 billion each month. In spite of the heroic efforts of the U.S. \nservice men and women, chaos and destruction have deepened in Iraq.\n  Yet, month after month, year after year, the President has touted \nprogress in Iraq and called for patience. It has been a litany of \ndelusion. Just listen to President Bush's repeated claims of progress.\n  In October of 2003, President Bush said:\n\n       We are making progress about improving the lives of the \n     people there in Iraq.\n\n  On September 25, 2004, the President said:\n\n       We're making steady progress in implementing our five-step \n     plan toward the goal we all want: completing the mission so \n     that Iraq is stable and self-governing, and American troops \n     can come home. . . .\n\n  On April 28, 2005, the President said:\n\n       I believe we're really making progress in Iraq. . . .\n\n  On October 28, 2005, the President said:\n\n       Iraq has made incredible political progress. . . .\n\n  On November 14, 2005, the President said:\n\n       Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a \n     democracy.\n\n  On May 25, 2006, the President said:\n\n       We are making progress on all fronts.\n\n  On March 19, 2007, the President said:\n\n       There has been good progress.\n\n  The exaggeration and the hype continues to this day. On June 28, a \nfew weeks ago, the White House press release stated:\n\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\n\n       The Iraqi security forces are growing in number, becoming \n     more capable, and coming closer to the day when they can \n     assume responsibility for defending their own country.\n\n  But in the benchmark assessment report released last week we read:\n\n       There has been a slight reduction in units assessed as \n     capable of independent operations since January 2007.\n\n  That is referring to Iraqi units. Even that turned out to be an \nexaggeration. Just 2 days later, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Peter Pace, told the press that the number of Iraqi Army \nbrigades that were capable of independent operations had fallen from 10 \nto 6--quite a difference from a ``slight reduction.''\n  Madam President, one merely has to take note of recent incidents in \nIraq as reported in our newspapers to know that things are not going \nwell in Iraq and that the administration's assessments of progress have \nbeen consistently overblown through the years and continue to be \noverblown.\n  Consider the headline in USA Today on July 12: ``Iraqi police assist \ngunmen.'' The story described our Army investigation into a January \nattack in Karbala that killed five U.S. soldiers. Our investigation \nconcluded that the Iraqi police who were supposed to be partners with \nAmerican troops colluded with insurgents.\n  Then there was this story in the New York Times on July 14: ``U.S. \nTroops Battle Iraqi Police in East Baghdad.'' Those are the police who \nare supposed to be on our side trying to quell the violence in Baghdad, \nnot attacking American troops.\n  On the all-important area of political benchmarks, consider this \nheadline from the Financial Times of June 18: ``U.S. Military \nFrustrated at Lack of Iraqi Reconciliation.'' The story reports that \nGeneral Petraeus said there has not been any ``real substantial \nachievements in terms of political reform in progress.''\n  Reuters reported on June 18 that Iraq was ranked the second most \nunstable country in the world behind Sudan in the 2007 Failed States \nIndex, produced by Foreign Policy magazine. Failed state? Obviously, we \ndon't want Iraq to be left as a failed state. It is failing. It is on a \nfailing course. If we don't change that course, it is going to continue \nto descend into that failed status.\n  The administration's recent self-assessment of benchmarks that there \nis progress on 8 of the 18 benchmarks would have us believe that the \ncup in Iraq is half full rather than being half empty. Eight of \neighteen--that sounds pretty good, like progress. But as a matter of \nfact, Iraq is a cup with a hole in its bottom. We keep pouring in our \nmen and women and resources, and there is a hole in the bottom of that \ncup through which they go.\n  It is that Iraqi hole that Secretary Gates addressed on June 14 in \nBaghdad when he said the message he was delivering to the Iraqi people \nwas that ``our troops are buying them time to pursue reconciliation and \nthat, frankly, we are disappointed in the progress thus far.'' \nSecretary Gates was accurate in saying that ``our troops are buying \n[the Iraqis] time to pursue reconciliation.'' But what he left unsaid \nis that our troops and our Nation have paid, and continue to pay, far \ntoo high a price to give the Iraqis that opportunity, and the time is \nlong past due for the Iraqi political leaders to accept responsibility \nfor their own future.\n  Secretary Gates' statement that we are ``disappointed in the \nprogress'' was surely an immense understatement. The American people \nare downright incensed at the failure of the Iraqi leaders.\n  Everybody agrees there is no military solution in Iraq and that the \nonly way to end the violence is for the Iraqi political leaders to \nsettle their differences. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \nacknowledged that last November when he said--and these words should be \nseared, I believe, into the consciousness of each of us as we vote, if \nwe are ever allowed to vote on the Levin-Reed amendment. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of . . . bloodletting of innocents are the [Iraqi] \n     politicians.\n\n  Our service men and women are dying and being wounded while Iraqi \nleaders dawdle. The Iraqis themselves made commitments to share \nresources and power, amend their constitution, hold provincial \nelections, and take over responsibility for their own security in many \nmore places than they have. They made the commitments last year in \nwriting, but they have not kept them.\n  Secretary of State Rice recently confirmed in a letter to me that \nIraqi leaders themselves, including their Presidency Council, had \napproved those benchmarks and the associated timeline. Secretary Rice \nwrote me:\n\n       We have confirmed with Iraqi President Talabani's chief of \n     staff that the benchmarks were formally approved last fall by \n     the Iraqi political committee on national security. This \n     committee includes the presidency council, the President, and \n     the two vice presidents, as well as the leaders of all the \n     major political blocs in Iraq.\n\n  Well, the Iraqi leaders' record on meeting the political timelines, \nwhich they approved themselves with a timeline, is abysmal.\n  For example, they said they would approve provincial elections and \nset a date for those elections by October of 2006. That has not been \naccomplished. They didn't do what they promised they would do.\n  The Iraqi political leaders said they would approve the hydrocarbon \nlaw by October 2006. That was not done. That has not been accomplished. \nThey didn't do what they said they would do. The Iraqi leaders said \nthey would approve a debaathification law by November 2006. They didn't \ndo what they promised to do. The Iraqi political leaders said the \nConstitutional Review Committee would complete its work by January 2007 \nand hold a constitutional amendment referendum by March of this year. \nThey did not do what they promised they would do.\n  This is not us imposing our benchmarks on them, this is the Iraqi \npolitical leaders who adopted their benchmarks, and have not met them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Rice and her \nresponse be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, while our troops have done everything, \nand more, of what has been asked of them, while they have risked their \nall and given their all, the Iraqi political leaders remain frozen by \ntheir own history, unwilling to take the political risks that only they \ncan take.\n  If there is any hope of forcing the Iraqi political leaders to take \nresponsibility for their own country and to keep the commitments they \nmade to meet the political benchmarks that they set and to make the \ncompromises that only they can make, it is to have a timetable to begin \nreducing American forces and to redeploy those forces to a more limited \nsupport mission instead of being everybody's target in the middle of a \ncivil war.\n  We need to send a clear message to the Iraqi leaders that we will not \nbe in Iraq indefinitely, that we will not be their security blanket \nforever. That is what the Levin-Reed amendment would do if we are \nallowed to vote on it. Our amendment would require the President to \nbegin reducing the number of American troops in Iraq within 4 months of \nenactment.\n  It would require transitioning the mission of our remaining military \nforces to force protection, training of Iraqi security forces, and \ntargeted counterterrorism missions. Our amendment would require that \nthe transition to those limited missions be completed by April 30 of \nnext year. Finally, and importantly, it would call for a comprehensive \ndiplomatic, political, and economic strategy, including sustained \nengagement with Iraq's neighbors and seeking an appointment of an \ninternational mediator under the auspices of the U.N. Security Council \nin order to try to bring stability to Iraq.\n  Some have criticized our amendment because it contains a timeline for \nthe completion of the transition to new missions. We received similar \ncriticism in the past about the timeline for the commencement of the \ntransition. Timelines need to be established as the only way to force a \nchange of course in Iraq and to force the Iraqis to accept \nresponsibility for their own future. It is human nature to put off \ndifficult decisions. Passage of our amendment would serve as a forcing \nmechanism and serve to stimulate action by the Iraqi Government to \nreach a political settlement.\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\n  Delaying action until the receipt of the administration's plan in \nSeptember would only delay the time when Congress applies the needed \npressure. There is no indication that Iraqi political leaders will \ncompromise without our pressure. Indeed, there is every indication they \nwill not. As Secretary Gates stated in April:\n\n       Debate in Congress . . . has been helpful in demonstrating \n     to the Iraqis that American patience is limited . . . The \n     debate itself and . . . the strong feelings expressed in the \n     Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive \n     effect in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is \n     not an open-ended commitment.\n\n  There is no indication the administration is willing to change \ncourse. For years, they have deluded themselves and the Nation with \nclaims of progress while Iraqis descended into sectarian violence and \nchaos. On July 4, President Bush repeated his call for patience which \nhe has made so many times over the years.\n  After more than 4 years, over 3,600 U.S. deaths, seven times that \nmany wounded, and expenditures of $10 billion a month that we are \nborrowing from the future to finance this war in Iraq, the President's \npleas for patience not only have a hollow ring, it is exactly the wrong \nmessage to the Iraqi leaders. Our message should be we are out of \npatience, and the refusal of the Iraqi leaders to work out their \npolitical differences is something which is no longer acceptable.\n  Congress attempted to respond to last November's election with a vote \nthat we made on April 26. We adopted a bill that did provide a \ntimetable to begin the reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq, the beginning \nof a phased troop reduction, redeployment in no more than 120 days, and \na transition to a more limited mission focusing on counterterrorism, \nforce protection, and training and logistical support for the Iraqi \nArmy. President Bush vetoed our bill shortly thereafter.\n  Senator McConnell made a statement which was, I believe, very direct \nand very accurate, when he assessed not too long ago that ``the \nhandwriting is on the wall that we are going in a different direction \nin the fall.'' That Presidential veto does not wash away the \nhandwriting on the wall. It only makes the handwriting clearer and \nfirmer that there is going to be a change of direction in Iraq.\n  So the question is: Why wait? Why not decide on a change of course \nnow to save months of lost and wounded lives and huge additional \nexpenditure of funds?\n  The clearer the handwriting on the wall is to the Iraqi political \nleaders and the quicker they read it and accept it, the greater the \nprospect for political settlement.\n  The clearer the handwriting on the wall is that the open-ended \ncommitment of President Bush is over, not just rhetorically but in \nreality, the greater chance that an even wider civil war can be \navoided.\n  There are some who acknowledge that a change of course is needed in \nIraq, including U.S. troop reductions but who then say not now. But \nsurely time is not working for us in Iraq. The sooner we shift strategy \nto force Iraqis to take responsibility, the better.\n  If we wish to improve the chance of a positive report on political \nprogress in September, we need to put great pressure on Iraqi political \nleaders in July. We cannot and must not continue to have the lives of \nAmerican servicemembers held hostage to Iraqi political intrigue and \nintransigence.\n  If we can get to the Levin-Reed amendment, if we can overcome the \nfilibuster, and if we can adopt the Levin-Reed amendment which provides \nfor the beginning of the reduction of our forces in Iraq in 120 days \nand transitioning to more limited missions, no more than 120 days after \nenactment, if we can adopt an amendment which says we will complete \nthat transition by April 30, 2008, if we can adopt our amendment which \nprovides for the appointment of an international mediator under U.N. \nauspices, we believe we will have passed the best chance of success in \nIraq, and we will have adopted the only course of action which has a \nchance of pressuring the Iraqi leaders to do what only they can do.\n  The clock is ticking. We are losing more American lives and more \nAmerican resources every day we delay. The time has come to set \ndeadlines, to reduce our forces in Iraq, to transition to the new \nlimited missions, and to embark on a comprehensive, diplomatic, \npolitical, and economic strategy to bring stability to Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I am writing in connection with your \n     letter of January 20, 2007 in which you advised me regarding \n     a set of benchmarks that the Government of Iraq has set for \n     itself.\n       You wrote that ``Iraq's Policy Committee on National \n     Security agreed upon a set of political, security, and \n     economic benchmarks and an associated timeline in September \n     2006. These were reaffirmed by the Presidency Council on \n     October 16, 2006, and referenced by the Iraq Study Group; the \n     relevant document (enclosed) was posted at that time on the \n     President of Iraq's website.''\n       Yesterday, I met with Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Prime Minister \n     Maliki's national security adviser. During the course of our \n     meeting, Dr. Rubaie stated that the Presidency Council never \n     reaffirmed the benchmarks. He was adamant on this point even \n     after I showed him the statement in your letter.\n       This is an important point as the Presidency Council, whose \n     three members, President Jalal Talabani (Kurd), Deputy \n     President `Adil `Abd al-Mahdi (Shia Muslim) and Deputy \n     President Tariq al-Hashimi (Sunni Muslim), are elected by the \n     Council of Representatives and represent the three major \n     ethnic groups of the country.\n       Earlier today, State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack \n     stated ``These are the benchmarks that they've laid out for \n     themselves. We didn't come up with them. They came up with \n     them. And they need to be seen in the eyes of the Iraqi \n     people as delivering for the Iraqi people.''\n       It seems to me that it would make a difference if the \n     benchmarks and associated timeline were only approved by an \n     advisory group as compared to the Presidency Council.\n       Accordingly, please confirm that the benchmarks and \n     associated timeline, which you attached to your January 30, \n     2007 letter, were reaffirmed by the Presidency Council after \n     being agreed upon by the Policy Committee on National \n     Security, as stated in your letter.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter inquiring \n     about the benchmarks that the Government of Iraq set for \n     itself last fall.\n       As you mentioned, I sent to you a letter in January in \n     which I noted that Iraq's Political Committee on National \n     Security agreed upon a set of benchmarks and an associated \n     timeline, which were reaffirmed by the Iraqi Presidency \n     Council in October 2006.\n       We have confirmed with Iraqi President Talabani's Chief of \n     Staff that the benchmarks were formally approved last fall by \n     the Iraqi Political Committee on National Security. This \n     committee includes the Presidency Council--the President and \n     the two Vice Presidents--as well as the leaders of all the \n     major political blocs in Iraq. The Iraqi Presidency Council \n     then posted the benchmarks on its website for several months.\n       Thank you for your interest in this issue. Please feel free \n     to contact us on this or any matter of concern to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, yesterday a man whom I had the \nopportunity of meeting and knowing a little bit, British Army \nLieutenant General Jim Lamb--General Lamb is the Deputy Commander of \nMultinational Forces Iraq and senior British military representative in \nIraq--was asked by Jamie McIntyre of CNN about how ``the growing \nsentiment in our Congress to bring U.S. troops home sooner'' affected \nthe mood of his troops deployed in Iraq, meaning the British troops. \nLieutenant General Lamb responded that those troops find it ``a touch \ndifficult.'' I think that is a very interesting phrase, ``a touch \ndifficult,'' because while it is so clear to them that we are making \nprogress, it is not reflected by those who are not in the fight but are \nsitting back and making judgment upon what they, the troops, can see \nwith absolute clarity.\n  Lieutenant General Lamb noted that those making such judgments and \nnot taking note of the progress ``are not going out every day in a \nhumvee.'' Moreover, he further noted that the progress the troops see \nis seldom reported. They see provincial counselors,\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nthey see water going to people who didn't have it before, they see \nelectricity coming online, they see stability to the networks. They see \nall this stuff that no one portrays.\n  I say to my friend from Michigan and the Senator from Illinois and \nothers, I hope they pay a little attention to General Lamb's statement \nor reject it out of hand, of course, as apparently is being done.\n  I have to repeat, General Lamb responded that his troops find it ``a \ntouch difficult.'' While it is so clear to them we are making progress, \nit is not reflected by those who are not in the fight but are sitting \nback and making judgment upon what they, the troops, can see with \nabsolute clarity.\n  I don't think I have to editorialize anymore on General Lamb's, I \nthink, totally accurate statements.\n  The New York Post reported on July 10 an interview with General \nPetraeus. He is asked by Ralph Peters, a person for whom I have \nenormous respect:\n\n       The current military operations in Iraq appear \n     comprehensive and tenacious, part of a long-term, integrated \n     plan. What can we realistically expect to achieve?\n       Petraeus: Our primary goal is to work with our Iraqi \n     counterparts to improve security for the Iraqi people. This \n     is intended to give the Iraqi leaders the time to resolve the \n     tough political issues they face and to pursue internal \n     reconciliation.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       As to reasonable expectations, we can expect a reduction in \n     sectarian deaths and the gradual spread of Iraqi government \n     authority. The level of sectarian deaths in Baghdad in June \n     was the lowest in about a year. Nevertheless, the extremists \n     still have been able to carry out car bomb and other attacks.\n       Wherever we operate, we try to reconnect Iraqi ministries \n     and local governments to meet the needs of the people. \n     Finally, we provide opportunities for Iraqis to use their \n     local knowledge to help root out al Qaeda. Successful \n     operations of this nature have played out in recent months in \n     Ramadi, Hit and Baquba. In each case, Iraqis turned against \n     al Qaeda and sided with the Coalition.\n\n  Question:\n\n       Now that the surge is fully in place, what's your sense of \n     the positives and negatives thus far? If you could have more \n     of any one item, what would it be? Troops? Time? Iraqi unity?\n\n  General Petraeus's answer:\n\n       I can think of few commanders in history who wouldn't have \n     wanted more troops, more time or more unity among their \n     partners; however, if I could only have one at this point in \n     Iraq, it would be more time.\n\n  I repeat, General Petraeus said:\n\n       . . . if I could only have one at this point in Iraq, it \n     would be more time. This is an exceedingly tough endeavor \n     that faces countless challenges.\n\n  So what does the Levin-Reed amendment do? Deny General Petraeus \nexactly that. As Senator Levin points out in his statement, the \nannounced withdrawal would force the Iraqi Government to act and, \ntherefore, then we would see progress. What if, I say to my colleagues \nwho support this amendment, what if instead the situation deteriorates \ninto a chaotic situation, then what do we do? Then what do we do if the \nsituation gets worse? Do we come back in? Do we sit on the sidelines \nand watch another genocide? What if, I say to my colleague who often \nasks me what is plan B, the surge doesn't work? What is plan B if the \nwithdrawal doesn't work?\n  I don't think that most people would believe that an international \nmediator is exactly a solution that is viable.\n  I wish to talk a minute about the region. Finally, after our stunning \nmilitary victory and shock and awe and the invasion side of the \nconflict was over, America was in pretty good shape in the region. The \nSyrians were trying to be cooperative. There were efforts on the part \nof the Iranians to join with us in efforts to bring about an end to \nterrorism in the region. Then we began to fail, and that failure has, \nobviously, been chronicled in many books. I recommend to my colleagues \nthe book ``Fiasco'' or ``Cobra II'' or a number of other books that \nhave been written that describe the failed Rumsfeld strategy. We paid a \nvery heavy price for it. All of us know that. It has been the sacrifice \nof our most precious asset.\n  What has happened since? We find the Syrians continuing to intervene \nin northern Lebanon. We find the Syrians, according to many experts, \ntransporting suicide bombers through the airport in Damascus into Iraq. \nWe find the Iranians not only orchestrating attacks and providing \nintelligence and even money and funding, in some cases, but there is \nclear and compelling evidence that the IEDs, the most lethal IEDs are \nexported from Iran into Iraq, those that have the lethality even of \ngoing through the armor of a tank. We find the Iranians more aggressive \nin the region with Iranian support for Hezbollah and Hamas. The Syrians \ncontinue to try to unsettle the Government of Lebanon, and the \nGovernment of Lebanon is having great difficulties.\n  There is a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for the \ndisarmament of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. There has been no effort \nwhatsoever to achieve the goals set forth in that U.N. Security Council \nresolution. In fact, there is strong evidence that Hezbollah in \nsouthern Lebanon is being resupplied with the rockets they expended in \ntheir latest attack on Israel which provoked an attack on Israel. We \nfind the Saudis becoming more and more uneasy. We once had a report--\nthat fortunately turned out to be false--that the Turks had crossed \nover into the Kurdish areas because of Kurdish insurgents who are \noperating out of the Turkish areas, at least according to the Turks. So \nwe have seen, because of our failure in Iraq, more strife, more \nconflict, and more threats to the State of Israel.\n\n  Meanwhile, the Iranians continue on the path to develop nuclear \nweapons. A great fear of many of us is not a nuclear weapon aimed at \nIsrael from Iran. One of our great fears is a nuclear weapon passed to \na terrorist organization by the Iranian Government, which has stated \nthrough its President and its policies their dedication to the \nextinction of the State of Israel. I could argue that the State of \nIsrael is probably in more jeopardy from a national security standpoint \nthan at any time in its history, since that very young nation achieved \nits independence.\n  So what happens in the region when we adopt the Levin-Reed \nresolution, and the signal is sent throughout the region ``don't worry, \nthe Americans are leaving.'' I think the consequences are fairly \nobvious. So we are not just talking about Iraq, as serious and \nconsequential as that situation is. We are talking about the region. It \nis hard for me to believe the Sunnis would not intervene to protect \nSunnis if there is a bloodletting in Baghdad, where 2 million Sunni \nreside and 4 million Shia. But according to the premise of the Levin-\nReed amendment, this will force the Iraqi Government to act and to \ncontrol their own destiny.\n  My question is: What do we do if they can't? What do we do if they \ncan't?\n  Some of my colleagues have talked about this ``gradual withdrawal.'' \nA gradual withdrawal. I think most military experts would tell you that \nthe most difficult operation in military tactics and strategy is a \n``gradual withdrawal.'' It is fraught with difficulty. When an army is \ndefeated, and an army tries to come home, it is the most difficult of \nall military operations.\n  So I think that as we discuss this specific amendment and the issue \nof whether we stay or go in Iraq, whether we allow the new strategy of \nGeneral Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs of Staff a chance to succeed, \nwhich calls for a surge in Iraq, while we debate this, I don't think we \nshould ignore the larger implications for the region. I believe, and I \ncannot absolutely predict the future, but a failure in Iraq, according \nto most experts, would lead to a chaotic and unsettled situation in the \nregion.\n  So I would at least ask for my colleagues' consideration of an \narticle by Stephen Biddle in the Washington Post on July 11, entitled \n``Iraq: Go Deep or Get Out.'' I think perhaps we ought to start looking \nat this situation from that respect. Mr. Biddle, in his piece, says:\n\n       The result has been a search for some kind of politically \n     moderate ``Plan B'' that would split the difference between \n     surge and withdrawal.\n\n  I think that adequately describes the Reed-Levin amendment.\n\n       The problem is that these politics do not fit the military \n     reality of Iraq. Many would like to reduce the U.S. \n     commitment to something like half of today's troop presence \n     there. But it is much harder to find a mission for the \n     remaining 60,000 to 80,000 soldiers that makes any sense \n     militarily.\n       Perhaps the most popular centrist option today is drawn \n     from the Baker-Hamilton commission recommendations of last \n     December. This would withdraw U.S. combat brigades, shift the \n     American mission from one of training and supporting the \n     Iraqi security forces, and cut total U.S. troop levels in the\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\n     country by about half. This idea is at the heart of the \n     proposed legislative effort that Domenici threw his support \n     behind last week, and support is growing on both sides of the \n     aisle on Capitol Hill.\n\n  The politics make sense, but the compromise leaves us with an \nuntenable military mission. Without a major U.S. combat effort to keep \nthe violence down, the American training effort would face challenges \neven bigger than those our troops are confronting today. An ineffective \ntraining effort would leave tens of thousands of American trainers, \nadvisers, and supporting troops exposed to that violence in the \nmeantime. The net result is likely to be continued U.S. casualties with \nlittle positive effect on Iraq's ongoing civil war.\n\n       It is unrealistic to expect that we can pull back to some \n     safe yet productive mission of training but not fighting--\n     this would be neither safe nor productive.\n\n  So, Madam President, I think we ought to look at what we are \ndiscussing here not only from the standpoint of Iraq but the \nimplications for our presence in the region. And I will say something \nthat is very seldom stated on the floor of the Senate: as long as we \nare dependent on oil in the region, our greater national security \ninterests are at stake in what happens with the outcome of Iraq. The \npossibility of success in Iraq, of seeing the world's third largest oil \nreserves being modernized and used, and those revenues used for the \nbetterment of the American people, also presents a goal that I think is \nworth striving for.\n  I would like to again return to the fact that I am deeply \ndisappointed in the Maliki government. Their failure to act unhinges \nthe very important aspect of the military, political, social, and \neconomic aspects of any successful counterinsurgency operation. But I \nalso believe that nothing would embolden the Iranians more, nothing \nwould embolden the Syrians more, nothing would frighten the Jordanians \nand the Saudis more, not to mention the Egyptians, than the passage of \nlegislation which would require the withdrawal of the United States.\n  So I urge my colleagues not only to look at how this legislation and \nthis debate affects America vis-a-vis Iraq but affects our western and \nnational interests and values in the entire Middle East.\n  Madam President, I note the patience of my friend from Rhode Island, \nwho is a thoughtful and valued member of the Armed Services Committee \nwhose friendship I appreciate a great deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the kind words. And \none of my first reactions was a bit of confusion. He referenced General \nLamb, the British officer in Baghdad, expressing chagrin at the \nproposals to reduce the troop strength of the American forces. He must \nhave been beside himself last February when Prime Minister Blair \nannounced the reduction of British forces. In fact, Prime Minister \nBlair stated at that time that 7,100 troops would be drawn down to \napproximately 5,500. That is down from a level of 40,000.\n  So at the time that the British are withdrawing troops, we are trying \nto surge troops. I think the general's peak or discomfort is somewhat \nmisplaced with the United States. I think it should more properly be \ndirected to Prime Minister Blair.\n  But let me get on with issues that I want to address, and that is to \ntry to clarify from my perspective some of the concepts and terms that \nhave been talked about. One is a repeated reference to General \nPetraeus's plan. The President makes it, and my colleagues make it. \nThis is the President's plan. General Petraeus was asked specifically \nin his confirmation hearing what role he played, and here was his \nanswer.\n\n       I met with the Secretary of Defense a couple days after he \n     took office and before he left for his first trip to Iraq, \n     and we discussed the situation there during that meeting. We \n     subsequently talked after his trip. I also talked to the \n     chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff several times in this \n     period, noting that a population and security emphasis in \n     Baghdad in particular was necessary to help the Iraqis gain \n     the time and space for tough decisions.\n       As the strategy was refined, I talked on several occasions \n     to General Odierno. I relayed my support for those levels \n     that General Odierno recommended to the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs. I also supported the additional emphasis in the \n     advisory effort.\n\n  This is not a precise quote, but paraphrases his remarks. General \nPetraeus is not the author of this plan. He, like many officers, \nparticipated, was asked questions; he had great experience. He was the \nhead and led the 101st Air Mobile Division in Iraq and was head of our \ntraining effort. But this is not his plan.\n  Now, he has accepted this plan. He did that publicly. But this is the \nPresident's plan. And at the heart of the President's plan is the \nstatement he made on January 10 when he announced it.\n\n       I have made it clear to the prime minister and Iraq's other \n     leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the \n     Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it \n     will lose the support of the American people and lose the \n     support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act. The \n     prime minister understands this.\n\n  Well, apparently, the prime minister did not understand, because in \nthe intervening months, exactly what the President feared has happened. \nThere has been no adequate political progress in Iraq. That is key \nrationale for the increased forces in Iraq. And without this political \ndecisiveness on the part of the Iraqis, our military efforts will not \nbe decisive. And what has happened because of this failure to act is \nprecisely as the President suggested? The American people have \nincreasingly become critical of the policy in Iraq. Their support is \neroding, and similarly the Iraqi people.\n  So you have a situation now where the logic and the premise for the \nsurge, for the troop levels we are maintaining in Iraq, was the fact \nthere would be political progress. Since January, to date there has not \nbeen political progress. I daresay there is very few, if any, of my \ncolleagues that will argue that between now and September 15 we will \nsee remarkable progress by the Iraqi Government. Indeed, it is \nsuspected, confirmed practically, that the Iraqi Assembly will adjourn \nin August for the month. So the reality is that on these critical \nissues of political will and decisiveness and political progress, we \nwill know nothing in September that we do not know now.\n  Given the incredibly complicated political system, the incredibly \ncomplicated institutional challenges facing the Iraqi Government, the \nnotion that we will know more even at the end of this year or the \nbeginning of next year is doubtful. Without this political progress, \nall our military efforts will not produce success. That is one reason I \nthink we have to begin to change course. We have to begin to adjust our \neffort to protect our self-interests and our interests in the region, \nbut no longer be the broker, if you will, for political progress in \nIraq that does not materialize.\n  My colleagues have been on the Senate floor and said time and time \nagain that there have been deadlines imposed, in many cases by the \nIraqis themselves, that have not been met. The latest report, just a \nfew days ago, suggested these political benchmarks have not been \nissued. Without that, our efforts and the brave sacrifice of our \nsoldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors, and every man and woman who is \nout there, are not producing the results we want and need. So we have \nto look again at this strategy.\n  But there is another factor, too, that I think is important to note. \nI was just in Iraq--as so many of my colleagues have traveled there, I \nhave also--and I spoke with General Petraeus directly. He gave me every \nindication that he was not waiting for September; that he had been able \nto make an assessment over the several months he has been in command, \nand he is prepared to make a recommendation--unless I misunderstood \nhim--before the end of August.\n  Now, he might be overruled by the White House in Washington, but he \nhas a pretty good sense of what is happening on the ground, and we \nshould have that same sense in the Congress.\n  The other factor that seems so critical when it is put next to the \nissue of no apparent progress by Iraqi political leaders is the fact \nthat by April of next year, April 2008, our military forces will not be \nable to generate 160,000 troops on the ground in Iraq. The surge will \ncome to an end regardless of what happens on the ground. Unless, of \ncourse, the President is prepared to\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nmake Draconian personnel changes, extend deployments to 18 months or \neven longer, calling up Reserve and National Guard units that are not \nscheduled to be called up, continuing to rely upon the stop-loss \npractice, where individuals who are eligible to leave the service after \nhonorable service are denied the opportunity to leave and in many cases \nare forced to deploy; picking reservists and people who are in the \nindividual Ready Reserve, those are individuals who served their full \nactive commitment, they have left, many of them have gone on with their \nlives and suddenly they are called up and told get back in uniform, you \nare going overseas.\n\n  Without such draconian decisions, then by next April we will not be \nable to field 160,000 troops in Iraq as we are doing today. So the \nreality is this policy will change. The question is, will it change now \nor then and will it change in a way that strengthens the national \nsecurity of the United States? Also, will it change in a way it will \ngain the support of the American people?\n  One of the factors in a counterinsurgency is the fact that you need \npopular support. That is not something that is a special thing to have \nor a nice thing to have, it is essential to the strategy. We are \nlosing--the President is losing--popular support with respect to these \noperations. Without that support, we will not be able to maintain our \npresence in Iraq.\n  We are seeing already Americans across the political divide, across \nthe geographical divide, demanding that this Congress act. They have, \nfrankly, little confidence in the President's ability, after all these \nyears, to get it right. That is one of the major reasons we are here \ntoday debating, and we will be tonight debating, because the American \npeople are looking for a new direction in Iraq.\n  The other factor that I think should be mentioned is that, while we \nhave pursued a strategy of increasing our forces, our adversaries--and \nthey are multiple in a complicated theater of operations--have reacted. \nFirst of all, they have taken the battle, if you will, the battle we \ntried to orchestrate in Baghdad, and they have spread it around the \ncountry. They have moved where there are fewer troops. This has caused \nus to spread our operations around. The surge, if you will, the \nadditional approximately 30,000 troops, were initially intended to go \ninto Baghdad.\n  If you, as I did, listened closely to General Petraeus at his \nconfirmation hearing, if you listened to the President in his January \n10 speech, the concept was Baghdad was going to be locked down. It was \ngoing to be saturated with American and Iraqi forces. That has not \nhappened because our tactical leaders have determined they must get out \nof Baghdad, they must go ahead and pursue some of these elements \noutside of Baghdad, and our adversaries have decided they would rather \nmove on than take us in a head-to-head fight.\n  Time, regretfully, is always on the side of the insurgent. If they \ncan survive a day, then that is a day that is in their favor. As a \nresult, even with these additional 30,000 troops, there is a question \nof whether they are an adequate number to take over this population \nprotection mission the President has announced. The population of Iraq \nis significant. That is another factor I think we have to consider when \nwe look at the adequacy of even the President's proposal today.\n  The Levin-Reed proposal talks about doing what is not only necessary \nbut frankly inevitable. We have to begin to redeploy our forces. We \nhave to begin to reduce our forces. We cannot sustain this effort \nbecause of the structure of our military forces.\n  The President had an opportunity several years ago, in the wake of \nour success in Afghanistan and in the wake of the operations in Iraq, \nto dramatically increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps. \nSenator Hagel and I came to the floor and we proposed an amendment, in \n2003, to do that. This was opposed by the administration because, if \nyou recall, back then this Iraq operation was basically all but over \nand they were getting out.\n  Now it is very difficult to increase the size of the military forces. \nThe Army has missed, for the last 2 months, its recruiting objectives. \nBut even if we stayed on track recruiting, we are still in a situation \nwhere we cannot grow the Army fast enough, the Marine Corps fast \nenough, to maintain indefinitely these forces in Iraq. So the strategy \nmust change. If the strategy is not only not supported by our end \nstrength, it certainly must change in the light of the American people.\n  I think the President made a significant mistake last January. After \nan election that sent a very strong signal all across this country that \nthe American people wanted change, after the report of the Iraq Study \nGroup, wise men and women on both sides of the aisle, with no \nparticular special interest they were trying to protect or advance--\nthey were true patriots coming forward to give their best advice--\nsuggested that our strategy should be remarkably similar to what we are \ntalking about today: the redeployment of the American forces; switching \nmissions to training, force protection, counterterrorism; engaging in \nrobust diplomatic activity in the region.\n  Those recommendations were cast aside by the President. At that \npoint, if not earlier, the American public began to seriously question \nthe direction of his policy in Iraq. Without public support, you cannot \nconduct military operations effectively or for any length of time.\n  So we face two realities in the United States. Ultimately, the \ninability to generate this force structure indefinitely and the fact \nthat the American people are growing increasingly intolerant of our \noperations in Iraq--not our forces there, not those magnificent men and \nwomen who are fighting and sadly dying each day but our presence there \nand the lack each day, in their minds, of any real progress and the \ndocumented lack of political progress. It was documented a few days ago \non the part of the Iraqi Government.\n  So we have to change. The question then is what is the best way to do \nit? We can debate about this. But certainly this amendment, offered by \nmyself and Senator Levin, represents a change. Not a hortatory request \nfor further assessment, not a discussion of possibilities or reference \nto another study group but a plan of change.\n  It begins by initiating a reduction of our forces 120 days after \npassage. That probably will be sometime toward the end of this year, \ngiven the nature of the legislative process. It doesn't specify any \nspecific level of reductions. That is the President as Commander's \nprerogative. It doesn't specify a particular timetable when they can \nleave, who should go first. Again, that is his prerogative. But what it \ndoes suggest and, in fact, requires is that by April of next year, that \nwe have transitioned to three missions--again, missions that were \nsupported significantly by the Iraq Study Group: Force protection--we \nalways have to protect our forces and facilities in the field; \ncounterterrorism, because we never want to give up not only the option \nbut the obligation to strike at terrorist cells wherever they may be, \nparticularly in Iraq; and third, the continued training of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  These I think are missions that are not only critical but they \nadvance our national security interests. Again, this fight against \nterror cannot be given up. We have to continue it. To the extent that \nwe can create effective Iraqi security forces, mitigates against the \nreal concerns that have been expressed on this floor of the aftermath \nof what I think is almost an inevitable reduction in our presence. We \nhave to be concerned about that.\n  One of the vexing things, though, about training the Iraqi security \nforces, is it is relatively easy to teach map reading and squad drills. \nIt is relatively easy to teach calling for artillery fire. What is hard \nto teach, because you really can't teach it, is the political \nreliability, with a small ``p,'' the dedication to the country, the \nsituation in which professional officers are truly professional. That \nis one of the nagging doubts that everyone has about the Iraqi security \nforces, particularly the Iraqi police, and to a less degree the Iraqi \nArmy. There are many factors there, too, but we still have to, I think, \npress forward and try to train these forces.\n  Our amendment represents the only real possibility of change today, \nof all those that might be discussed on the floor. It represents not a \nprecipitous withdrawal. It is a phased reduction to missions that are \nimportant and are\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\nwell within the capacity, I believe, of our military forces to sustain \nover time. They serve, I think, the much broader interests of the \nUnited States.\n  All of this, of course, has to be complemented by robust political \nactivity, diplomatic activity in Iraq and around the region, something \nthe President has been woefully lacking in his pursuit of, over the \nmany months we have been engaged. We have to make the case--it is \ndifficult to make, but we have to make the case to the neighbors, \nparticularly, that an Iraq that becomes this caldron of instability and \nchaos that some of my colleagues fear--and, frankly, that we have to at \nleast anticipate, in terms of our diplomacy and some of our military \npreparation--that this situation would be detrimental to them as much, \nif not more, than to us.\n  A chaotic, turbulent, anarchy on the border of any country spells \nserious problems for that country. That case should begin to be made \nimmediately, not only by our diplomats but by the international \ncommunity.\n  We suggest, also, we have to try again to involve others in this \neffort; not just the United States and Great Britain but others, the \ninternational actors. They, too, I think have an interest in a stable \nregion, a stable Iraq.\n  It has been discussed on this floor that al-Qaida is sitting back and \nhoping we leave. It is an interesting concept because there is some \ncontradictory evidence. Ayman Zawahiri, who is the second in command of \nal-Qaida, was quoted recently as suggesting that our departure would \nactually be something that would cause them some concern. Not because \nthey don't wish us ill, they certainly do. Not because today they don't \ncontinue to try to attack us. But because they believe our presence in \nIraq, in his words as translated, is a ``historic trap,'' that we are \ntrapped there and that they can use their forces there--not the al-\nQaida elements but all the sectarian groups, some of them operating \nagainst us because we are there--they can use these forces to attack \nour troops, diminish our presence, and effectively continue to apply \npressure on us.\n  I think there is a suggestion there that our departure might, in \nfact, help us in our overall strategy. It certainly will help us to \ncounteract the image which the propagandists, the Zawahiris of the \nworld present, that the United States is committed to destroying the \nMuslim community by imperialistically invading holy territory. We are \nin a battle of ideas ultimately, and we are not doing a very good job \nbecause what they are able to show throughout the entire Islamic world \nis our forces in Iraq and our forces in Afghanistan but particularly in \nIraq and try to validate their claim, their propaganda, that is why \nthey exist, to resist us.\n  In the course of our strategy going forward, one should think at \nleast about the efficacy of our presence there, not in terms of a \nbulwark of security in Iraq but as a way that we, in fact, are playing \ninto the hands of many of these Iraqi terrorists, these international \nterrorists.\n  One of the other aspects we face as a reality on the ground is the \ncomplex situation in Iraq. Too often I think the President and others \ntry to simplify this as this battle for Iraq is the central front in \nour battle against al-Qaida. I would argue the central front in our \nbattle against al-Qaida is somewhere in Pakistan. That is where bin \nLaden is, where Zarqawi is, that is where it is reported that hundreds \nof Iraqis and others, Europeans, Chechens, are training to be jihadist \nterrorists across the globe. But regardless of where the central front \nis, the issue I think we have to recognize and grasp is that our \npresence in Iraq is something we cannot sustain indefinitely.\n  We have to focus, I think, on the other threats, focus more \ndiligently on these other threats. Now, we have a situation in Iraq, a \ncomplicated situation of Kurds, Shia, and Sunni, together with \ncriminals, together with terrorist elements, al-Qaida. Too often, as I \nsaid, we try to make the point it is just about al-Qaida.\n  We have made progress in Anbar Province because in that Sunni region, \nthe Sunni tribal leaders have united against al-Qaida. But that does \nnot define the most decisive factor in Iraq, and that is the conflict \nbetween the Sunni community and the Shia community; a community on one \nhand, the Sunnis, who feel profound entitlement, and on the other hand, \nthe Shia, who feel a profound sense of paranoia.\n  I think we have to ask ourselves seriously, will that profound \nconflict between the two communities be resolved in 30 days, on \nSeptember 15; will it be resolved in a week; more than that; October 1; \nwill it be resolved 6 months from now?\n  It has lasted for hundreds and hundreds of years. It is the fuel that \nis generating the conflict we see in Iraq today. Without the political \nsteps of the Iraqi Government leaders at least to attempt to deal with \nthis issue, our presence will not deal with--I think in the short \nterm--the solution.\n  Senator Levin and I have proposed what I believe is the most \npractical, feasible, realistic policy we can pursue today in Iraq; \nindeed, as I suggest, a policy which perhaps not in the same terms but \nin the same substance will inevitably be the policy of this country. I \nhope today, though, we can take decisive action to move to our bill, \navoid a filibuster, to vote up or down and move forward with a new \ndirection for Iraq, a new direction for our country.\n  I note the presence of the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Senate turns its attention to the \nfiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, every Member of \nthis body is focused on the security of our Nation and the safety of \nour troops in Iraq. Senators Levin and McCain, along with the other \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, have worked hard, very hard, \nto put together a bipartisan bill that provides our troops with the \nresources they need and sets priorities for defense spending for the \nyear ahead.\n  This is a strong bill. I was proud to support it in committee. But it \nis incomplete--incomplete because we cannot possibly claim to have \ntruly provided for our Nation's security until we have addressed the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  It is now more than 4 years since President Bush declared the mission \nin Iraq has been accomplished. Since ``mission accomplished,'' more \nthan 3,400 U.S. soldiers have died, died in Iraq. A sectarian civil war \nis now deeply entrenched, deeply entrenched and raging.\n  The political compromises that for years we have been promised by the \nIraqis seem to be more distant than ever. Civilians are dying in ever \ngreater numbers, and every day more American troops are hurled into the \ncrossfire.\n  It is time, yes, far past time, for the Congress--that is us--to have \na real debate about this war and about where our national security \ninterests ultimately lie. We must start by sunsetting the outdated and \nopen-ended 2002 authorization to use force in Iraq and requiring the \nPresident to request a new authorization that outlines the new mission \nwhich our troops are being asked to perform.\n  The amendment Senator Clinton and I are offering does exactly that. \nIt will end the 2002 authorization on its 5-year anniversary, October \n11, 2007. That authorization which was passed to confront the threat \nthat we were told faced us from the government of Saddam Hussein is no \nlonger relevant. Our troops have toppled the dictator. The Iraqis have \nvoted in a new government. No weapons of mass destruction have been \nfound.\n  Meanwhile, American soldiers continue to die, die in the crossfire of \nanother country's civil war, while the President fails to clearly \narticulate our mission, our strategy or our goals for continuing our \noccupation of Iraq. He must clearly explain his vision, his vision to \nan increasingly skeptical public, the American people, those people out \nyonder, the American people.\n  We were told this year would mark a turning point, a new direction in \nthis war with a new strategy intended to give Iraq's political leaders \nbreathing room in order to forge a political consensus. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the way events have unfolded. Despite the addition of more \nthan 20,000 American troops into Baghdad, civilian deaths have actually \nincreased as the insurgents have engaged in a surge of their own--a \nsurge of their own--far from creating breathing room for peace.\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\n  The President's current course appears to be pumping oxygen into the \nfire of sectarian violence. The decision to go to war--the decision to \ngo to war--to send our sons and daughters into the line of fire, to ask \nthem to kill and be killed on our behalf, is the weightiest decision \nthat a Member of Congress can ever, ever, ever make.\n  It is wrong, wrong I say, it is wrong for Congress to continue to \nfail to reassess that outdated authority without a real debate about \nwhere the occupation of Iraq is headed. The authorization that Congress \npassed in 2002 to give the President authority to go to war in Iraq was \nrushed through here 3 weeks before Congressional elections--yes, rushed \nthrough.\n  It was passed in the shadow of warnings of mushroom clouds and the \nnot-so-subtle implication that anyone who voted against the war could \nnot be trusted with matters of national security.\n  It was a hasty and unconstitutional abdication of Congress's \nauthority in matters of war. It is time to bring that authorization to \na close--yes--and have an honest debate about the way forward. We do \nour troops a disservice if we do not take a fresh look, and the \nPresident should welcome the opportunity to solicit our renewed support \nfor his policy. We must think of our national interest and think \nagain--yes--of our brave troops. We must put politics aside.\n  At a recent Senate hearing, I asked Defense Secretary Gates if the \n2002 authorization still applies to Iraq. His response, may I say, was \nsurprisingly candid:\n\n       I don't know.\n\n  I believe the answer to that question is clear and that it is time \nfor the President to make the case to the Congress of the United States \nand to the American people of the United States for the U.S. military's \nchanged mission in Iraq. Our country will benefit from the debate.\n  This amendment puts the ball right back in the President's court, \nrequiring him, the President, to request a new authorization for the \nnew mission that challenges our military. The White House has \nrepeatedly asserted that General Petraeus needs until September to \nassess the progress of the security escalation in Iraq. This amendment \ngives him that time. But this amendment also ensures that Congress and \nthe people will have the opportunity to examine that progress to \ndetermine our course in Iraq. It is a simple, commonsense approach that \nreestablishes the congressional authority decreed by the Constitution \nof the United States. It also respects the President's role as the \nCommander in Chief.\n  It is important to emphasize to all of my colleagues that supporting \nmy amendment does not preclude voting for any other legislative \noptions. This amendment addresses the legal foundation for this \nhorrible war. We are a nation of laws, not of men. My amendment simply \nstates the obvious truth, that the facts on the ground do not match the \nopen-ended authorization that is still in force. Any Senator wishing to \nvote for legislation mandating a withdrawal date or to restrict the war \nfunding or to implement the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group \nshould also support the Byrd-Clinton amendment.\n  As the President himself said earlier this year:\n\n       The fight we are in is not the fight that we entered.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. This is not the fight Congress authorized. I \nurge this body to schedule a vote on the Byrd-Clinton amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand our staffs have reached a \npoint where we were able to clear something like 26 amendments on this \nbill but that there is one last hurdle on the Republican side. I am \nwondering whether my good friend from Arizona feels there may be a \npossibility that we can jump over that hurdle in the next couple hours.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \nshort colloquy with my colleague from Michigan, the distinguished \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my colleague that we have one individual, and we \ndo have some 26 amendments that I think are cleared that we could get \nout of the way. I am working on that right now. I thank my colleague \nand most of all the staffs for their close cooperation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  I understand the Senator from Nebraska wants the floor, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the Levin-\nReed amendment. As we know, Iraq is the most important issue facing our \ncountry today. The core challenge in Iraq is the cycle of violence, \ndespair, and retribution that is tearing Iraq apart and threatening \nwider regional instability. There is no significant progress in Iraq. \nBy any measurement, the situation in Iraq is getting worse as each week \npasses. Prime Minister al-Maliki's Government is essentially paralyzed \nand dysfunctional, in part by boycotts and sectarian rivalries and an \nintense sectarian war.\n  The Interior Ministry in Iraq, which controls Iraq's police forces, \nis still a disaster and does not function as a national ministry. \nHorrific violence in Iraq is spreading beyond Baghdad. Yesterday, car \nbombs and attacks in Kirkuk and Diyala Province killed more than 100 \nand injured almost 200 Iraqis. Kirkuk is an area of Iraq in the \nnorthern part, Kurdistan, that has been considered by this \nadministration as one of the most secure areas of Iraq. Recent events \nin Kurdistan over the last few months have shown otherwise. \nIncreasingly, regions that were previously seen as relatively stable \nand secure, such as the Kurdish area, are now being engulfed by \nviolence. The southern four provinces in Iraq near Basra, which \ncontains most of Iraq's oil and Iraq's only port and outlet to the sea, \nare out of control. Shiite militias control the southern four provinces \nof Iraq, including the most significant oil reserves in Iraq's one \noutlet to the sea. Shiite militias and criminal gangs control these \nprovinces and today even demand tribute, and we pay it. The Iraqi \nGovernment pays tribute to Shia militias to use Iraq's primary port. \nThe last remaining pipeline into Baghdad has been blown up, crippling \nBaghdad's access to oil, and there are no operating refineries in \nBaghdad. Hence, the product that comes to Baghdad today is trucked in \nfrom Kuwait. This is the nation that has the third largest oil reserves \nin the world. The green zone is being attacked daily.\n\n  Last week, 9 people were killed, including Americans, and over 30 \nwounded inside the green zone. These daily attacks on the green zone by \nmortar fire, rocket fire increase.\n  I have listened today to some of my colleagues argue that the surge \nstrategy--the surge strategy--has only just begun; why don't we give it \na chance to work; we are at a very early stage; we must give the \nPresident more time.\n  Let me remind our colleagues it has been more than 6 months since the \nPresident of the United States announced to the Nation on January 10 \nthe decision to send tens of thousands of additional U.S. troops into \nIraq. That was the beginning of the surge, not now. It has been more \nthan 5 months since these additional U.S. troops began arriving in Iraq \nin early February. We have had months to judge the situation in Iraq. \nOnly last week, the President reported to Congress that there has been \nno progress--no progress--on any of the political benchmarks in Iraq. \nThe violence that is tearing Iraq apart has intensified and spread over \nthe last 6 months. The current strategy is failing, and the so-called \nsurge that some of my colleagues refuse to recognize that began almost \n6 months ago has cost 532 American men and women their lives since that \nbegan. We have lost more than 3,600 Americans who have died and over \n26,000 wounded over the last 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  We must change our policy in Iraq. Central to our new strategy must \nbe diplomacy, regional engagement, and the\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\ninvolvement of the international community, all of these coming \ntogether within the framework of a new policy, using all of the \ninstruments of power to help achieve Iraqi political accommodation--\npolitical accommodation. We are captive to a cycle of violence. We \ncannot break out of the cycle of violence. More troops will not do \nthat. We have put burdens on our troops and asked them to make \nsacrifices and do things they cannot achieve in the course of finding \nan answer to break the cycle of violence. It is bigger than the \nmilitary. General Petraeus has said so. As a matter of fact, General \nPetraeus has said there will be no military solution in Iraq. Every \ngeneral I have met in my five trips to Iraq, every general I have met \nhere in and out of uniform, has said there will not be--cannot be--a \nmilitary solution.\n  I have cosponsored the Levin-Reed amendment because it requires that \nthe United States move toward a comprehensive policy on Iraq--a \ncomprehensive policy on Iraq--not just continuing to feed American \ntroops into the middle of a civil war, which is clearly not working, \nbut something in addition to our military security. That new policy \nmust be centered on diplomacy and helping achieve Iraqi political \naccommodation to get to political reconciliation.\n  This amendment is responsible. It is comprehensive, forward-looking, \ncompelling, and not all that different, incidentally, from what my \nother colleagues are offering on the floor of the Senate as options. \nYes, it requires a phased, responsible reduction of U.S. forces from \nIraq. I say again, a reduction--not a withdrawal--of our forces. No one \nI know is calling for any sort of precipitous withdrawal or precipitous \naction to take America out of Iraq now. We couldn't do that anyway. \nEven if we wanted to withdraw precipitously or quickly, the reality of \nthe logistics would prevent it. The fact is, we are where we are. We \nhave national interests in the Middle East. We have national interests \nin Iraq. We should not confuse the issue that we debate today. We are \nnot advocating a cut-and-run strategy. I am not sure what cut and run \nmeans. It is catchy. It is good sloganeering. But I have yet to hear \nanyone come to the Senate floor and say: I am for cutting and running. \nThose who use that term or accuse others of employing that term should \ndefine what that means.\n  Of all the resolutions I am aware of that have been introduced in the \nSenate on this issue, none that I am aware of is a so-called cut-and-\nrun amendment.\n  We are talking about a transition in the mission being carried out by \nU.S. forces in Iraq. A policy, a strategy. Let's make something else \nclear. The military does not make policy. The military implements \npolicy. The Congress is part of making that policy. Constitutionally we \nhave a role with the President in helping frame and make policy. The \nmilitary has input into that policy, as they must and as they should, \nbut once the policy is given to the military, they can't alter the \npolicy. They are captive to policy. That is constitutionally the way it \nis and the way it should be. We are talking about a new policy, a new \nstrategy. We have a legitimate mission to carry out in Iraq, and those \nvarious missions are critical to our security, and hopefully, at some \npoint, the stability of Iraq. The Levin-Reed amendment focuses solely \non those missions and the transitions of those missions: \nCounterterrorism, targeting terrorists and other global organizations; \ntraining Iraqi forces, protecting U.S. and coalition personnel and \nfacilities, helping maintain territorial integrity of Iraq.\n  As I have said, nearly all of the other significant amendments I am \naware of that have been introduced on the floor of the Senate on Iraq, \nincluding the Warner-Lugar amendment, the Salazar-Alexander amendment \nfocused largely on the same limited mission, as the Levin-Reed \namendment, as does the Nelson-Collins amendment, on a limited mission. \nThere is an emerging consensus on how our military mission should \ntransition in Iraq as well. Our amendment includes a timeline and would \nrequire that this shift in our military mission be completed by April \n30 of next year.\n  Our amendment is not alone in establishing a timeline. Again, the \nother significant amendments on Iraq also have timelines. The Warner-\nLugar amendment recommends beginning the military transition no later \nthan December 31, 2007. That is a timeline. The Salazar-Alexander \namendment sets as the sense of the Congress that the transition be \ncompleted by the first quarter of 2008. Now, that is a timeline. There \nis yet another emerging consensus on establishing a timeline to \ntransition our military mission in Iraq. Our amendment also respects \nthat only military professionals--the generals, those who have the \nresponsibility of carrying out the policy; not making the policy, but \ncarrying it out--those professionals determine how many troops will be \nneeded to carry out our limited military mission in Iraq.\n\n  So the talk I hear more than occasionally on the Senate floor that \nsomehow the Congress is micromanaging the war is not correct; that we \nare micromanaging the army is not correct.\n  Once again, our amendment, the Levin-Reed amendment, sets policy of \nthe military mission in Iraq. That is policy. What is the mission? What \nis the strategic, diplomatic mission of employing America's power and \nprestige in Iraq? That is the policy. But the scope of the reduction--\nthe reduction, not the withdrawal but the reduction--of U.S. forces in \nIraq will be determined by, and needs to be determined by, our military \nprofessionals based on a troop-to-task analysis; not the Congress, not \nthe committees telling the generals how to do anything.\n  Troop to task is a very simple concept. You connect the requirements \nof your mission with the force structure needed. We are way out of \nbalance. We have been out of balance since we invaded Iraq in March of \n2003. We never had enough force structure. Some of the same people on \nthe floor of the Senate who are now saying: Well, let's listen to the \ngenerals, where were they when the generals warned this administration \nthat we didn't have enough men and women and force before we went into \nIraq, I didn't hear many of them talking about how much faith we should \nput in our generals then.\n  The former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General \nShinseki, said it. He said it openly in the Presiding Officer's Armed \nServices Committee. When asked the question: What would it take in \nmanpower to remove Saddam Hussein from power and help stabilize and \nsecure Iraq, General Shinseki said: It would take hundreds of thousands \nof American troops.\n  This administration completely dismissed that as wildly--I believe as \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense at the time said--wildly off the mark. \nWell, he wasn't off the mark, I say to my colleagues. He was exactly \nright. He was exactly right.\n  So we have never had the forces to match the mission. That is not \nnew. Some of us may be coming to that conclusion for the first time, \nbut it is not new. We have never had the force structure to match the \nmission. That is not the fault of the generals. That is not the fault \nof the military. That is the fault of policymakers.\n  Our amendment also respects that only military professionals can \ndetermine those numbers. The scope of the reduction would stay firmly \nin the hands of the military professionals. This approach is \nresponsible. Not one U.S. general today will tell you that there can \nbe, there will be, there is a military solution in Iraq.\n  Then the next question is--and a statement being made often on the \nfloor of the Senate is: Well, we need to buy the Iraqis time. We need \nto give the Maliki government time. That is true. That is why we have \nbenchmarks. That is why we have some sense of where this is going? Are \nwe making progress or not making progress? Is it getting better or is \nit getting worse? Now, 4\\1/2\\ years into this, we should have some \nmeasurements of giving the government time, but time for what? What is \nthe end game as more Americans sacrifice their lives and a half \ntrillion dollars of America's taxpayers' money has sunk into the sands \nof Iraq? We are buying time for what? For a political reconciliation \nbrought about by the Iraqis themselves to be able to functionally \ngovern their country with some sense of stability and security. That is \ngoing the other way. That hasn't gotten better; it has gotten worse by \nevery measure. So we continue to buy time with American blood and \nAmerican treasure, for what? For\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nwhat? No one wants to answer that question, by the way. We end it with \nwe have to buy time, but the additional part of that equation is: Buy \ntime for what? Do we buy time for another 2, 3, or 4 years?\n  It is also clear that the generals have said when April comes, and \nthere is a timeline already that is built in--whether we ever deal with \nit or not in the Congress--there is a timeline built in, and it is \ncalled manpower. It is called deployment rotations.\n  We are pushing our young men and women now to 18-month rotation, and \nsome, by the way, are longer than that because of what is known as a \nstopgap measure where the Secretary of Defense can stop anyone from \nleaving a war zone based on the speciality of his or her MOS or job. So \nwe are actually having people stay there longer than 18 months. But now \nit is 18 months, even though the Secretary of Defense testified in \nJanuary before the Senate Armed Services Committee that we need to get \nback to 12 months.\n  Senator Webb and I and others, a bipartisan group of Senators / last \nweek had two amendments on that issue. We couldn't get the required 60 \nvotes to go back to a 12-month deployment. So now it is 15 months, and \nwe are pushing even 18 months.\n  The generals have told us that when this spring comes, there is no \nmore give in those deployment rotations. There is nothing left. So \nthere is a timeline built in already. Whether any of us want to \nacknowledge that or introduce that, that is a reality.\n  Any change to policy in Iraq cannot be done in isolation, separate or \ndisconnected, from the broader sense of dynamics in Iraq and the Middle \nEast. That is why this amendment requires a phased reduction be \nconducted as part of a comprehensive, diplomatic, political, and \neconomic strategy that includes sustained engagement to Iraq's \nneighbors and the international community.\n  I am very pleased to note that today the announcement came from the \nState Department that the United States is now prepared to hold new \ndirect talks with Iran. That is progress, not because Iran wants to be \nour friend. Of course not. But Iran is a significant power in the \nMiddle East. It is working against our interests in the Middle East. We \nmust engage Iran. I have been calling for dialog with all Middle East \nnations, including Iran and Syria, or over 3 years. A constructive \nregional framework for Iraq can only be achieved through sustained \ndiplomacy, not hit or miss, not ``if we have time.''\n  A vital element of this comprehensive diplomatic strategy must be to \ninternationalize Iraq through an international mediator under the \nauspices of the U.N. to engage all of Iraq's political, religious, \nethnic, and tribal leaders.\n  I first called for an international mediator in a letter to President \nBush in May. Since then, I pressed this issue with Secretary Rice last \nweek, our National Security Adviser, Steve Hadley, 2 weeks ago, and \nagain today with the United Nations Secretary General. It is time to \ntake the American face off Iraq's political process.\n  The United States is seen as the occupier in Iraq. We must have a new \nstrategy that will further invest the region and the rest of the world \nto helping stabilize Iraq, reversing Iraq's slide into chaos. And it is \nchaos, Mr. President. I hear on the floor of the Senate, gee, if we \nchanged our mission, if we moved in any different direction, if we \nreduced our forces, if we did anything different, Iraq would end in \nchaos. Some of my colleagues must not understand what is going on in \nIraq. We have chaos. We have real chaos in Iraq today. That means there \nare no good options today. The optics here should be clear, and we \nshould base our new policies and our new strategies on those clear \noptics that Iraq is in chaos today.\n  Creating an international mediator would help build some new common \ninterests in the region and in the world. This amendment represents the \ncore elements of a different U.S. strategy for Iraq, a strategy that \nmore accurately understands the grim realities we face today, that we \nwill face at the end of this year, that we will face next spring, and \nwe will face next year. The question is whether the President and \nCongress will come together to present a new policy for Iraq that can \nbe supported by the American people and protect and advance America's \ninterests in Iraq and the Middle East.\n  We are coming dangerously close to the moment when the American \npeople will demand that we leave Iraq and pullout of the Middle East. \nAlmost 70 percent of the American people today, by every measurement, \nsay enough is enough. This is not in the U.S. interest nor the world's \nto leave Iraq that way. That is why the United States needs a new \nstrategy for Iraq now.\n  Well into our fifth year in Iraq, we are beyond nonbinding language \nof resolutions. We are beyond calling for new plans or new reports. We \nare beyond sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. We have to understand where \nwe are today. We are in a very dangerous position in Iraq. Our policy \nin Iraq has been a disaster. Why are we kidding ourselves otherwise? By \nany measurement, it is a disaster. It must change now. The time for \nsuggestions is over. If we do not believe our current policy is worthy \nof the sacrifices being made by our troops, then it is wrong to simply \nsay we will wait until this fall to change course or let's hang on for \n2 or 3 more months to see what happens.\n  We know what is happening. We know what is happening today, we know \nwhat has been happening, and we know what is going to happen tomorrow.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to express myself on this \namendment. I also appreciate the opportunity to cosponsor this \nresponsible amendment with my colleagues. I note again it is a \nbipartisan amendment, and I hope all my colleagues in the Senate will \ntake a look at all the different options and amendments and spend some \ntime on each because they are each worthy of time, but in the end, the \nconsistency of the amendments that have been presented so far are about \none thing, and you can paint it any way you want, but that is a change \nof mission in Iraq and a new policy in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I would be remiss if I did not recognize Senator Hagel's \nleadership on this issue and his articulate vision and years ago his \nbrave service as a soldier in our Army.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \npermitted to meet today at 7 p.m. in 215 Dirksen Senate Office Building \nto consider an original bill entitled the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act of 2007, which will provide health care for \nneedy children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair did not hear the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I objected in a timely manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know you did not hear me. I do not \nwish to keep the Finance Committee from meeting, except that we are \nbeing held for a very important debate, and if we are going to be held \nall night, it is the view of this side of the aisle that we should keep \nour focus on this very important issue.\n  I rise today because this is such an important issue. I don't think \nthat any Member on this side of the aisle or the other side of the \naisle is insincere in their views about this issue. However, I do think \nthe disagreements are real, and it is so important the Senate do the \nright thing.\n  We have before us, of course, the Levin-Reed amendment that would set \na deadline and cut and run from Iraq without regard to anything that is \nhappening on the ground, including the Commander in Chief saying: For \nGod's sake, don't do this.\n  So here we are debating this issue, but I think we have to also talk \nabout the other amendments that are on the floor because we are now \nseeing a different variety. I think there is an attempt by many of our \nMembers to send a message. None of these amendments would ever become \nlaw. I think everyone acknowledges that fact. So every\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\namendment is meant to send a message.\n  What is the message? It appears that the basic message is to tell the \nPresident to change strategy or to tell the generals what to do or to \nmicromanage the war. All different kinds of messages are being \nproposed. But the bottom line is we cannot tell the Commander in Chief, \nthe President, nor the commander on the ground, General Petraeus, how \nto do the jobs we have asked them to do.\n  We heard from General Petraeus what the new strategy will be. I keep \nhearing people say we need a new strategy, we need a new plan, a new \nplan. We are in a new plan. Yet the Senate is saying, when the new plan \nis in its infancy, when the surge of 30,000 troops has been completed \nwithin the last 2 weeks, and yet we are pulling the rug out from under \nthe new plan. It doesn't make sense.\n  I think all these amendments, all these message amendments are the \nwrong thing at the wrong time.\n  We cannot be the greatest country on Earth and say: Don't trust us if \nyou are our ally and don't fear us if you are our enemy, and that is \nexactly what we would be doing if we leave Iraq because Congress sets a \ndeadline regardless of what is happening on the ground in Iraq.\n  This is about a war on terror and protecting our freedom. This is not \nabout Iraq in a bubble. It is about making sure we kill terrorism in \nthe world before it ruins everyone's way of life and takes freedom from \neveryone.\n  If I believed we were just talking about Iraq and we could isolate \nIraq, that would be a very different issue. This is about making sure \nIraq does not become a stronghold for terrorists. This is to make sure \nal-Qaida cannot take over Iraq, terrorize the people as they have done \nin Afghanistan for years, have the oil revenue that would feed their \nterrorism and spread it throughout the world. We are fighting al-Qaida \nin Iraq.\n  General Petraeus came to the Senate and put forth a different \nstrategy. I asked him about it because I was very concerned about this \nstrategy. I asked him why he thought this would work, why putting our \ntroops outside the green zone and outside the protected areas embedded \nwith Iraqis would make a difference. He talked about the need for the \ncounterinsurgency measures to go to them and also to win over the \nneighborhoods.\n  It is said by those who are on the ground and have the expertise that \nit is working, that in the al-Qaida strongholds, the people have turned \nagainst al-Qaida and they are helping America, and the tribal \nchieftains in that area are helping Americans.\n  I met with a group of veterans today who have come back from Iraq. \nThey were so strong and so firm. It was uplifting to talk with them, \njust as it is uplifting to talk with any of our Active-Duty military. \nBut to talk to those who have had the boots on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who know what is happening, one cannot fail to believe we \nhave to give this a chance, even if the armchair generals back here in \nWashington have misgivings.\n  It is so important that despite the sincerity of so many of my \ncolleagues in trying to put forward a different kind of a message, a \nmessage to the President--do a plan; we are not going to make you \nimplement the plan, but we are going to make you do one--all the way up \nto the amendment that we are debating and on which we are going to have \na vote tomorrow which is to cut and run.\n  That is the variety of message amendments that we have pending on \nthis bill, and none of those is the right message. Look at the \nconsequences. Look at the consequences if we leave without making sure \nIraq is stable.\n  Today, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense announced \nthere is going to be a rejuvenation of the talks that include all the \npeople in the region. That is so important. This is something I have \ntalked about for a long time. No longer can the neighbors to Iraq sit \nback and watch what is happening there and criticize America or anybody \nelse and not take a hand in helping to solve the problems in this area. \nNo longer can they sit back and grade America when it is they who have \nthe very most at stake with an Iraq that might become a haven for \nterrorists. That is in no one's interest in that region, not even \npeople who want the destruction of America, such as the President of \nIran. It is not in his interest or Iran's interest to have a terror \nstronghold in the Middle East. It is certainly not in the interest of \nthe moderate Arab nations that are trying to have stabilization in that \nregion.\n  Here we are with a new strategy that is in the process of being \nimplemented, and we have the Senate debating whether to set a deadline \nand leave, regardless of what has happened on the ground.\n  This does three bad things. No. 1, it dishonors those who have \nalready died or been maimed. I met people today. I have met people at \nBrook Army Medical Center in San Antonio who have been maimed. I have \nmet with the loved ones of people who have been lost in this war \nalready. If we cut and run, it is akin to saying there wasn't an \nunderlying cause for which they died. That is not true. There is an \nunderlying cause. It is a fight for freedom every bit as much as any \nwar which we have ever fought because if we let a caliphate take over \nthe Middle East, we are not going to live in freedom. That is the \npurpose the terrorists have, and we cannot let them succeed. We cannot \ndishonor those who have died for this cause.\n  No. 2, it puts every one of our troops who have boots on the ground \ntoday in Iraq and Afghanistan in harm's way that is a much greater harm \nthan they face in the war itself. It puts a bull's-eye on them because \nthe enemy knows they are leaving, so why not do worse things to our \ntroops, why not get rid of them? That has happened before in retreats \nin wars.\n  That would be the worst thing we could do, is to say to the enemy: \nThis is when we are leaving, this is when we are going to draw down, \nthis is when the troops go away. I cannot imagine we would do such a \nthing.\n  And No. 3--and this is the policy that the Senate must stand for, and \nthat is to stand for the integrity of America, the integrity of the \ngreatest country on Earth--that we will be a formidable enemy and a \nreliable ally, that we will not flinch when times get tough. It is a \nlegitimate argument about why we got here or when we should have had \nmore troops or how the war has been run up to now. That is legitimate. \nWe can talk about that, and it is a legitimate area to debate. But what \nis not legitimate is--because it is a very tough time--that we would \nsay times are too tough; America must leave. What kind of honor would \nthat bring on our country and this United States Senate? None. It would \nnot bring honor on this country to cut and run because times are tough.\n\n  This is a fight for freedom. This is a fight to live in peace and \nharmony with people of different backgrounds and different faiths. This \nis taking a stand for freedom because America is the country that has \nthe commitment and the capacity to fight for freedom in the world.\n  If we cut and run because times are tough, who would stand for \nfreedom? Who would have the capability to stand for freedom?\n  It would be unthinkable to go against the general who is in charge in \nIraq, the head of the CIA, Michael Hayden, who has said also that ``if \nwe withdraw from Iraq prematurely it would become a safe haven, perhaps \nmore dangerous than the one al-Qaida had in Afghanistan.'' We would be \ngoing against one of the wisest Secretaries of State we have ever had \nin our history, Henry Kissinger, who said:\n\n       Whatever our domestic timetables, the collapse of the \n     American effort in Iraq would be a geopolitical calamity.\n\n  It would go against the wisdom of wars all the way back to the \nbeginning.\n  During the Civil War, General Ulysses S. Grant, who did lead the \nUnion forces to victory, said:\n\n       Experience proves that the man who obstructs a war in which \n     his Nation is engaged, no matter whether right or wrong, \n     occupies no enviable place in life or history.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not a new concept. This is a concept that has \nbeen tested time and time and time again, and retreating without honor \nis not an option for the greatest country on earth.\n  I hope the Senate will not look at the election next year or the \npolitical whims, even though I know they are strong, and I know \nsometimes it is\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\ntough to stand up and do what is right for the long term when the short \nterm is very tough. But this is the Senate. We are the elected leaders \nof the States of our country. And they look to us for leadership. We \ncannot do less. Any of these amendments that are message amendments \nthat will never become law, and we know it, are an undercutting of our \ntroops when they have boots on the ground.\n  No matter how sincere the effort of all the authors of these \namendments are, and I know they are sincere, I know they are looking \nfor a way to send that right message, there is no message in these \namendments that can be right for our country. It is very simple and \nvery clear. We are the United States of America, and the world expects \nour country to lead, to be strong, to be unwavering, and to be as good \nas our military, which everyone acknowledges is the best in the world. \nI just hope the Senate can meet that test.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are the greatest country in the world, \nand that is why I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2088 be \nwithdrawn and that at 7 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment, No. 2087, with the time between now and then equally divided \nin the usual form and no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is once again clear, in the greatest \ncountry in the world, where debate is supposed to be free and open, \nwhere majority rules, we have been blocked now by our Republican \nfriends for the third time from having a vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment, which simply says it is time to change course in Iraq.\n  It is not cut and run. You can stand here and say anything. I could \nsay anything: Black, white, pink, brown. It means nothing. This is not \ncut and run. Read the amendment. The amendment is very clear. It is \nvery well thought out.\n  What it says is that we will start a redeployment of our troops out \nof Iraq in 120 days; that we will seek diplomatic solutions; that we \nwill change the mission, get our brave,--unbelievably brave--and \ncourageous troops out of the middle of a civil war and give them a \nmission that can be accomplished. And that mission, actually, is \nthreefold--one is to go after al-Qaida in a counterterrorism effort, \none is to continue to train the Iraqi forces, and one is to protect our \ntroops, force protection.\n  You can say cut and run. It isn't cut and run. It sounds good. Create \na straw man. But that is not what Levin-Reed does.\n  It is clear our Republican friends will not allow us to vote on this \namendment, and I think I know why. I think we can win this amendment, \nfor the first time. I think we can get more than 50 votes, including a \nfew brave Republicans for the first time on a real amendment. And so \ninstead of allowing us to vote, as we allowed them to vote on their \namendment, the Cornyn amendment, they will not allow a vote. They are \nsetting an artificial number--60. We have to meet a 60-vote threshold \nin order to get to the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  All we are saying is let us vote. People are dying--our people--every \nday. They are getting blown up. They are wounded. My State has lost 21 \npercent of the dead, many of whom never saw their 21st birthday. We can \ndo better. We can do better. We have given this President 1 year, 2 \nyears, 3 years, 4 years, almost 5 years, and we are in a worse \nposition.\n  Oh, my colleague from Texas says, things are working. If you listen \nto her you would think it is just wonderful over there. Then I would \nask, in a rhetorical fashion: Why do 60 percent of the Iraqis think it \nis OK to shoot and kill an American soldier? This is where we are going \nto keep our troops? And that is because we are the greatest country in \nthe world?\n  The greatest country in the world doesn't keep the status quo going \nif it isn't working. The greatest country in the world steps up to the \nplate and says: It is time for a change. And it is time, Mr. President, \nfor a change.\n  The head of Iraq said: America, you want to go? Go. We can take care \nof ourselves.\n  You know what is interesting is, I met with General Petraeus when I \nwas in Iraq. He was at that time the head of training the Iraqis, and \nhe was high on the Iraqi soldiers. He told me, and he told Senator \nMurray--he told all of us on that trip--we had Republicans and \nDemocrats--don't you worry. At that time he said: We have trained \n200,000 Iraqis, and they are top notch--they are top notch--and they \nwill be able to take over.\n  Unfortunately, the head of Iraq didn't think that was true. But \nGeneral Petraeus, oh, he was Mr. Rosy Scenario. He said everything was \ngreat. And when I came back I gave a report to my constituents, and I \nsaid: You know, I never voted for this war--I thought it was a \nmistake--but I bear good news. The Iraqis are being trained. As they \nstep up, we will step down.\n  I believed the President when he said that one. Not to be. Not to be. \nThe money we are pouring into that country a minute, folks--$250,000 a \nminute--while we turn to our poor kids and say: Sorry, we can't renew \nthe children's health insurance; and, gee, we are really sorry 2 \nmillion kids are waiting in line for afterschool. We are really sorry. \nSo we are sending good dollars after bad dollars, endlessly, open \ncheckbook.\n  The Iraqis don't want us there. They do not want us there. The head \nof Iraq said: Go, leave, we are fine. What are we doing? Are we that \nstubborn as a nation? Well, I think the majority of this United States \nSenate might very well be ready to vote to begin the redeployment of \nthe troops. I don't know that. My colleagues will not let us get there. \nWell, maybe I have convinced them, so I am going to try this again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2088 be \nwithdrawn and that at 7:30 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment No. 2087, with the time between now and then equally divided \nin the usual form and no second-degree amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California retains the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is now the fourth time--the fourth \ntime--that our colleagues have objected. This Senate must not be a \nrubberstamp for any administration, especially when our constituents \nare getting killed. We are here to speak for the people.\n  Now, my colleague from Texas says we need to take a stand for \nfreedom--we need to take a stand for freedom--and I agree with her. \nHowever, once we allow the Iraqis, with our Armed Forces protecting \nthem every step of the way, to have three elections--three elections--\nto be able to draw up a constitution, to have the ability to self-\ngovern, we can't force them to do that.\n  It is true that there is al-Qaida there. Al-Qaida, according to our \nown military, is responsible for 15 percent of the violence--15 \npercent--and it is ugly violence, it is horrific violence, and we \nshould go after it. After all, al-Qaida cells didn't exist in Iraq--I \nhave the document to prove it--until we went in. We have been a \nrecruiting tool. Unfortunately, this policy has been the recruiting \ntool. I have the documentation from the State Department that showed \nright before 9/11 how many cells there were in each country. Iraq \nwasn't even mentioned. But they are there now, and we need to get them, \nand that is part of the Levin-Reed amendment: to change the mission to \ngo after them.\n  A fight for freedom? If people don't want freedom, can we force them \nto want freedom? If people decide to kill their neighbor, what are we \ngoing to do? Shia on Shia violence, Sunni on Shia, Shia on Sunni--just \nread the history books and you will see how long this has been going \non, and we put our brave men and women right in the middle.\n  This is the greatest country on Earth, by far and away, and the \ngreatest country on Earth doesn't have a Senate that is a rubberstamp. \nIt doesn't have a Senate that fights for the status quo when the status \nquo isn't working. The greatest country on Earth shouldn't send our men \nand\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\nwomen back two, three, four, and five times to fight without adequate \nrest, and yet our Republican friends set up a 60-vote hurdle for \nSenator Webb and Senator Hagel so we couldn't even pass something that \nsaid give them rest before they go back; give them the equipment before \nthey go back. It is not what the greatest country on Earth does to its \nfighting men and women. That is wrong.\n  A New York Times story, here is a woman, April Ponce De Leon, who \ndescribes herself and her husband as ``gung-ho marines,'' and in 2 \nweeks she deploys to Iraq where her husband has been fighting since \nMarch. But she says she stopped believing in the war last month after a \ntelephone conversation with him.\n\n       He started telling me he doesn't want me to go and do the \n     things he has been doing.\n\n  That is what CPL Ponce De Leon, 22, speaking by telephone, said as \nshe boxed up her belongings in their apartment near Camp Lejeune, NC.\n\n       He said that we have all decided it's time for us to go \n     home.\n\n  And the wife said:\n\n       You mean go home and rest? And he said, I mean go home and \n     not go back.\n\n  And she said:\n\n       This is from someone who has been training for the past \n     nine years to go to combat and who has spent his whole life \n     wanting to be a marine. That's when I realized I couldn't \n     support the war anymore, even though I will follow my orders.\n\n  So when we listen to some of our colleagues make it sound as if those \nof us who want to change the mission and start redeploying the troops \nin 120 days don't stand behind our troops, I say, Mr. President, it is \nthe opposite. They can't speak out. They do not have a box to stand on \nand a microphone. We owe them the truth as we see it.\n  It is perfectly legitimate for our colleagues to disagree with us. \nAbsolutely. And I would die for their right to disagree with us. But \nwhat I think is wrong is when it comes to a vote of conscience like a \nwar, to set up a 60-vote hurdle. Let's have a vote. Let the majority \nrule. Let's see what happens.\n  What are you afraid of? The President has already said he is going to \nveto this thing, but it is our job to keep the pressure on, Mr. \nPresident. So I am very proud to stand here tonight. I am very sorry I \nhave asked twice to go straight to a vote on the Levin-Reed amendment, \nbut we are not able to do that.\n  Others will come, and I will be back after several hours myself. When \nyou lose 21 percent in your home State, you have a lot on your heart; a \nlot you want to say. So I look forward to coming back to the floor. And \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know this is a tough \nnight. I know it is emotional, but I am glad we are doing it. And I \nhope at the end of the day, when someone asks unanimous consent to go \nto a vote, there will be no objection and we can do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would comment that in the process of \nworking out votes, the minority leader has offered to the majority \nleader to schedule votes on this and other amendments at an appropriate \ntime. There is no need to do the all-night gig. It may make grand \nHollywood theater, but it doesn't necessarily move forward what is an \nextremely important bill.\n  This is a bill that not only authorizes our war fighters, it provides \nadditional resources. It provides them a badly needed 3-plus percent \npay increase. We traditionally move these bills forward because, when \nwe are fighting a war, we need to support the troops. But these \namendments are designed to substitute the judgment of 535 generals in \nthis wonderful air-conditioned Capitol for the judgment of the generals \nand the commanders in the field who every day go out and fight that \nbattle to maintain peace, restore peace and security in the area, and \nto protect our home front.\n  The Iraqis have said they don't want us there permanently. I think we \nall agree we don't want to be there permanently. But they also said we \nneed to continue to train their troops. We need to make sure they \nmaintain security in the area. They are not ready to do that now.\n  Sunni sheiks in Al Anbar Province, which I was pleased to visit 2 \nmonths ago, are working with our forces and they are making great \nprogress. They have been sending in their young Sunni men to be trained \nas Iraqi police and Iraqi Army. They need training. They are not ready \nyet. They are being very successful because our American marines are \nembedded with them. With them, they have taken Ramadi, the capital of \nAl Anbar, which was totally under the control of al-Qaida a few months \nago, and made it a safe place not only for Americans but for everyday \nIraqis to walk the streets, to do their business, to get back to a \nnormal life.\n  I am here today as the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence to talk about an important report issued today. Today, \nthe Director of National Intelligence released key findings that could \nbe made public on the National Intelligence Estimate, or NIE, on the \nterrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. That report outlined a number of \nkey findings of which I think our colleagues and all Americans should \nbe aware.\n  First, today's intelligence report found that carrying the battle to \nal-Qaida, gaining worldwide cooperation in the war on terror, has set \nthem back. They have made our country and other free countries safer \nbecause al-Qaida and its related radical Islamist groups are no longer \nable to have the free rein they had prior to our attacks to clean them \nout of Afghanistan and to keep them out of Iraq.\n  In fact, our efforts have prevented al-Qaida from attacking the \nUnited States since the September 11, 2001, attacks, and they have \ndisrupted a number of terrorist plots outlined in the classified \nportion of the report, designed to take effect in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  One of the good parts about it is that the terrorist groups are now \ntelling each other the United States is a harder target. That makes \nthem less likely to attack here. That is great news. It means the hard \nwork of our men and women in the military, our intelligence services \nand our law enforcement in the United States, are doing their job--and \nthey are succeeding.\n  While America is safer, there are still threats around the world, and \nwe have to remain vigilant in fighting terrorists at home and abroad. \nThe intelligence report notes that al-Qaida leadership continues to \nplan attacks. They have a relative safe haven in the northwest area of \nPakistan known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or FATA. \nThey are increasing their capabilities from that area to launch attacks \non the United States.\n  It is important to point out that these findings do not mean, as some \nerroneously reported last week, that al-Qaida is as strong as it was \nbefore the September 11 attacks, or even nearly as strong. It does mean \nthat America must always be prepared for attacks on our homeland and \ncontinue to take appropriate offensive and defensive counterterrorism \nactivities.\n  Unfortunately, the intelligence report, the NIE, also finds that \ninternational cooperation against terrorism may wane as September 11 \nbecomes a distant memory. That ought to be a real concern to all of us. \nI hope my colleagues take note because this should serve as a warning \nto all of us, a warning for Congress, and the American people to remain \nvigilant and committed to the war on terror. Our responsibility in \nCongress is to continue to give law enforcement and the intelligence \ncommunity the tools they need to track, interrogate, capture or kill \nand prosecute terrorists, such as the PATRIOT Act and the modernization \nof the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--very important; \nAlso, the 9/11 Commission recommendations on changing congressional \noversight to make it effective in dealing with the new challenges put \non the intelligence community today.\n  Knowing full well that the retreat-and-defeat crowd does not have the \nvotes, I see the majority has opted for political gains and political \ntheater. With apologies to our dedicated floor staff and the many \nwonderful men and women who keep this place operating, you are going to \nbe operating all night long, around the clock, for a political show, \nnot to achieve anything significant in terms of helping win the war.\n  Foremost, the biggest losers from all this grandstanding are our \nfighting men and women who are risking their lives on the line in Iraq, \ncarrying out\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\ntheir mission and the mission they believe they are carrying out \nsuccessfully.\n  The majority has a political game plan. But, sadly, it is not about \nhow to achieve victory, it is a plan blindly fixated on trying to \nembarrass the President, trying to figure out a way they can win votes \nfor November 2008. It offers no help for the creation of stability and \nfreedom in Iraq and thus continued safety for ourselves.\n  Our commanders and fighting men and women, while this debate is \nunderway, are actually trying to achieve victory. But they have been \nlistening to us and they have questions. They send questions to us \nsaying: Why are you not going to give General Petraeus's plan, which he \nsaid he would report on in September, an opportunity to demonstrate it \ncan work? Why have you no patience? We, who are sitting in the air-\nconditioned Halls of Congress while they are out in 130-plus degree \nheat risking their lives. They are willing to wait. But they are \nwatching and listening to the cut-and-run arguments. So are our allies, \nSunnis, such as the Sunni sheiks in Al Anbar Province who are risking \neverything if we run and leave because they have taken on al-Qaida. \nThey don't want to live under al-Qaida. The neighbors of Iraq who are \ngradually realizing they have a role in helping Iraq be stable are \nseeing us falter and hesitate.\n\n  Do you know who else is listening? Al-Qaida and the violent \nterrorists with whom we are at war, and I suspect they are absolutely \nrevelling in what they are hearing. I imagine they loved hearing our \nmajority leader saying the war has been lost. That is not a great \nmessage for our troops but one that certainly brings cheer to the \nhearts of al-Qaida.\n  They call for troop withdrawal deadlines. They say the cost of war is \ntoo high. The constant barrage of negative news without the balanced \nreport on the progress our troops are making--we need only listen to \nthe words of the terrorists themselves who have identified Iraq as the \ncentral front on the war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden, in his audio \nmessage to what he hoped were his fellow Muslims in December of 2004, \nsaid:\n\n       The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital \n     of the caliphate.\n\n  Our own servicemembers such as 1LT Pete Hegseth, an Iraqi war veteran \nand director of the Vets for Freedom recently, knows the importance of \nachieving victory. He said, as one who has been on the frontlines:\n\n       Iraq today is the front line of a global Jihad being waged \n     against America and its allies. Both Osama bin Laden and \n     Ayman al-Zawahiri have said so.\n\n  But despite this enormous effort, the retreat-and-defeat crowd still \nwants to micromanage this war 8,000 miles away from the fight and set \ntimetables and troop movements and ultimately to engineer a defeat \nbrought on by retreat.\n  These actions most egregiously send mixed messages to our enemies all \nacross the globe that our Nation is fractured, weak, and does not have \nthe will to see it through. This same message can discourage allies and \nthe millions of Iraqis who are risking their lives for a chance at \nfreedom by supporting us. For not only is the safety and security of \nour Nation and allies at stake but so, too, is our credibility.\n  Critics of us have frequently claimed the war has damaged the U.S. \nimage and credibility throughout the world. Yet the retreat-and-defeat \ncrowd ignores the irreparable harm that would be done here were we to \nleave this mission unfinished.\n  If you think our image and reputation has plummeted, wait and watch \nit nosedive if we were to leave Iraq before finishing the job. Think \nabout what would happen to the millions of Iraqi citizens and leaders \nwho took a stand against terrorism, who committed to take a stand with \nus to rebuild their country and fight against the forces of radical \nIslam and terrorism. What are we to say to the millions of Iraqis who \ntrusted America and believed we would stay until the mission was \ncomplete, only to see them slaughtered by terrorists as a result of our \nabandoning them before they were able to stand on their own.\n  I mentioned on this floor before, what did we say to the thousands of \nSouth Vietnamese or millions of Cambodians who put their trust in \nAmerica and were slaughtered after we abandoned them? History has \ntaught us that when America abandons its commitments to spreading \nliberty and freedom, we are not the only ones who suffer. Hundreds of \nthousands may well suffer, but it will come back to harm us and haunt \nus in our homeland--not only our credibility.\n  In January of this year, before the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthe leaders--the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA Director, \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency Director--testified in public session. \nThey said if we pulled out on a political timetable, chaos would ensue. \nWhat would happen?\n  No. 1, there would be a tremendous increase in slaughter among Sunni \nand Shia in Iraq.\n  No. 2, al-Qaida would be able to establish a safe haven, a platform \nwhere they could get the oil revenues they needed to fund their efforts \nand significantly increase the threat to our United States of America \nand possibly even to foment a regionwide civil war, as other nations \nwould come in to the rescue of their coreligionists in Iraq.\n  To ignore these considerations and questions simply because they are \nperceived to be more politically palatable than continuing the vital \nmission that our troops are fighting is shortsighted at best and \ndangerous at worst. Those who are attempting to end the war \nprecipitously because they are vested politically in defeat do not want \nto talk about the fact that the war in Iraq will do anything but end--\nin fact would only grow more dangerous--if we leave our enemies in \nIraq, unlike in Vietnam, the victors. The victors would follow us home. \nThe North Vietnamese did not follow us home after we lost in Vietnam. \nAl-Qaida will follow us home if we allow them to achieve victory over \nus in Iraq.\n  We have seen in recent weeks, since the implementation of General \nPetraeus's plan, movement has begun in the right direction. When I \nreturned from Iraq in May, I observed, even at that point, some initial \nsigns that the planning and working was moving in the right direction. \nSunni sheiks in Anbar are now fighting al-Qaida; more than 50 joint \nU.S.-Iraq stations have been established in Baghdad, conducting regular \npatrols, resulting in increased security and actionable intelligence.\n  Muqtada al-Sadr has felt the heat. His followers, while perhaps have \ndemonstrated against American troops, are not contesting them. They and \nJaysh al-Mahdi, the Shia militant group, has stood down. The Iraqi Army \nand police forces are increasingly fighting on their own, with their \nsize and capability growing.\n  July 16, the Wall Street Journal carried an article by Omar Fadhil. \nHe said the surge is working, fully operational for barely a month. He \ndefines the two most dangerous enemies in Iraq we face in Iraq, Muqtada \nal-Sadr's militia and al-Qaida, and he says:\n\n       Sadr's militias have moved the main battlefield south to \n     cities like Samwah, Nasiriyah and Diwaniyah where there's no \n     American surge of troops, and from which many Iraqi troops \n     were recalled to serve in Baghdad. But over there, too, the \n     Iraqi security forces and local administrations did not show \n     the weakness that Sadr was hoping to see. As a result, Sadr's \n     representatives have been forced to accept ``truces.''\n       This may make things sound as if Sadr has the upper hand, \n     that he can force a truce on the state. But, the fact this is \n     missing from news reports is that, with each new eruption of \n     clashes, Sadr's position becomes weaker as tribes and local \n     administrations join forces to confront his outlaw militias.\n       And regarding al-Qaida, he writes that they, al-Qaida, have \n     not been any luckier than Sadr, and the tide began to turn \n     even before the surge was announced. The change came from the \n     most unlikely city and unlikely people, Ramadi and its Sunni \n     tribes.\n       He goes on to say: In Baghdad the results have been just as \n     spectacular so far. The district where al-Qaida claimed to \n     have established it Islamic emirate is losing big now, and at \n     the hands of its former allies who have turned on al-Qaida \n     and are slowly reaching out to government.\n  MG Rick Lynch, 3rd Infantry Division Commander, provided a telling \nexample in yesterday's New York Times.\n  In the village of Al Taqa, about 20 miles southwest of Baghdad, Lynch \nsaid women and children were taping plastic pipes on streetlamps to \nwarn Iraqi security forces of roadside bombs. He also stated that \nlocals have exposed al-Qaida hideouts, helped troops locate 170 large \ncaches of arms, and guaranteed organized armed neighborhood controls \ncould keep safety.\n  While I would agree that there is no guarantee of victory, and we \nhave a\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\nlong way to go, we certainly need to make every effort to achieve it. \nThe war in Iraq is far more important on a front that is far larger \nthan that battlefield. It is the global battlefield. That is why we are \nfighting in Iraq, to keep our country safe, to make sure al-Qaida does \nnot get the upper hand, to make sure our troops, who are carrying out \ntheir mission to stop al-Qaida, can do so in Iraq rather than hand them \nthe victory which will embolden them, which will allow them significant \nresources from the oil-rich Iraqi sands and give them the courage to \nexpand recruiting and attack our country.\n  We cannot allow cut-and-run amendments to be added to a vital \nauthorization bill to support our American troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I welcome the debate on the U.S. role in \nIraq, and I urge my colleagues to allow us to vote on the issue. I \nthink each of us was elected to cast our votes and this is the most \ncritical issue that is facing this Nation and we should be able to cast \na vote on this issue, hopefully tonight.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Senators \nLevin and Reed to the Defense authorization legislation. It is similar \nto the provisions Congress originally passed on the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that President Bush vetoed.\n  We now have more information than we did 3 months ago when we acted \non the supplemental appropriations bill. We know the President's surge \npolicy has not worked. By the President's own assessment, the Iraqis \nhave failed to meet the most important interim benchmarks required for \nstability in Iraq. The Levin-Reed amendment would change our mission in \nIraq to limit U.S. involvement to conducting counterterrorism \noperations, protecting U.S. forces and military infrastructure during \nredeployment, and training Iraqi forces.\n  It would set a deadline of April 30, 2008, for all U.S. combat troops \nto be removed from attempting to quell the civil war in Iraq. We should \nnot wait a single additional day in changing the U.S. mission in Iraq.\n  I have opposed the war from the inception. In October 2002, I voted \nagainst giving President Bush the authority to use U.S. troops in Iraq. \nI have likewise opposed the President's management of this war. The \nadministration misrepresented or ignored intelligence about Iraq. The \nadministration's effort to garner international support for the war was \ntotally inadequate. Our troops went to Iraq without adequate equipment. \nThe President failed to prepare for the insurgency. The leadership in \nthe White House wrongfully ordered the dismantling of the internal \nIraqi police, putting the local communities at the mercy of the \ninsurgents.\n  Our Nation and the Iraqis have paid a heavy price for the \nadministration's mistakes. To date, over 3,600 U.S. soldiers have died \nand over 23,000 have been wounded, many sustaining life-changing \ninjuries. Seventy-seven of the brave men and women who have lost their \nlives have been from Maryland. U.S. taxpayers have spent at least $320 \nbillion so far. According to the Congressional Research Service, the \nwar in Iraq currently costs $10 billion per month.\n  These expenditures represent lost opportunities in our own country.\n  Tragically, we have lost our focus in the war against terrorism. \nAfghanistan is not secure, and Osama bin Laden is still at large. For \nover a year, there has been a significant increase in the level of \nviolence in Iraq. The main reason for this escalation has been \nsectarian violence.\n  U.S. military commanders have confirmed that the Sunni-Shiite \nconflict is the greatest source of violence in Iraq. Iraq is in the \nmidst of a civil war, and the presence of American troops in the middle \nof a civil war is counterproductive. In fact, there is not one civil \nwar raging in Iraq, there are many civil wars in Iraq. In Baghdad, \nSunnis are fighting Shias. In Anbar and Diyala, Sunnis are fighting \neach other. In southern Iraq, Shiites are fighting each other. And \naround Kirkuik and Mosul Kurds are fighting Sunnis.\n  Our first priority should be to remove our troops from the middle of \nthese civil wars. The Levin-Reed amendment will do just that. In order \nto bolster our military and refocus its attention on the global \nterrorism threat, this Congress has attempted, on more than one \noccasion, to redeploy U.S. forces and change the mission of our \noperations in Iraq.\n  President Bush and a minority in Congress have rebuffed this effort. \nInstead, President Bush proposes a strategy he claimed would improve \nthe situation in Iraq: increasing the number of troops deployed, and \nstepping up traditional counterinsurgent operations.\n  According to President Bush, increased U.S. troops would stabilize \nthe country so that its national leaders could operate in a safe \nenvironment in which to reach political agreement on oil and revenue \nsharing laws and amend their constitution. Furthermore, so the theory \nwent, increased U.S. troop levels would enable us to accelerate \ntraining initiatives so that the Iraqi Army and police force could \nassume control over all security in the country by November 2007.\n  President Bush sent over 28,000 more soldiers into Iraq with the hope \nof fulfilling the goals of his plan. President Bush insists on \ncontinuing this surge policy. But the so-called surge is not working. \nSome of the most brutal acts of sectarian violence have occurred during \nthe surge.\n  For example, in March of this year, a truck bomb in a Shia \nneighborhood killed 150 people. The Shia-controlled police units \nresponded by systematically kidnapping and murdering 70 Sunnis. This is \nnot an isolated episode.\n  Approximately 600 U.S. soldiers have died during the surge, and more \nthan 3,000 have been wounded. Violence in many sectors of Iraq has \nincreased. Despite the valiant effort of our troops, terrorist attacks \nin Iraq and around the world continue to rise. Tensions between \ncountries in the Middle East region are growing.\n  Middle East autocrats have an even firmer grip on power. The Arab-\nIsraeli conflict has deteriorated. Our military is stretched thin. And \nthe most recent intelligence analysis reports that the al-Qaida group \nthat attacked our Nation, the al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan, is \nstronger now than at any time since September 11, 2001.\n  The 2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill required \nPresident Bush to report to Congress and the American people on the \nprogress Iraqis are making in achieving certain benchmarks. These \nbenchmarks were established so there could be a new way forward in Iraq \nwith regard to securing civilian populations, establishing the Iraqi \nsecurity force's capacity, and supporting an Iraqi Government that \nwould have credibility and confidence at the national and provincial \nlevels.\n  We now have received the first report from the administration. This \nassessment confirms the failures of the President's policies in Iraq by \nhis own objectives. The Iraqis have failed to make satisfactory \nprogress in key areas. For example, it is critical, critical for the \nIraqi Parliament to pass legislation ensuring equitable distribution of \nthe hydrocarbon oil revenues. Without such legislation, it is difficult \nto believe that the ethnic communities will have confidence in their \ncentral government. The Bush administration's assessment on this \nbenchmark: not satisfactory.\n  Another benchmark concerns disarmament of the militias. We have heard \nabout the militias and how they run their own affairs and take over \nethnic communities. It is necessary that the Iraqi security forces be \nthe national military. Eliminating militia control of local security is \nan additional benchmark. The Bush administration's assessment on those \nkey benchmarks: not satisfactory and unsatisfactory.\n  Our goal has always been for the Iraqi commanders being able to make \ntactical and operational decisions without political intervention to \nuncover and pursue all extremists on all sides. The Iraqi security \nforces provide even-handed enforcement of the law. That is critical if \nthe Government is going to have the confidence of its people. The Bush \nadministration's own assessment on these benchmarks: unsatisfactory.\n  It is critical that the Iraqi security forces be able to operate \nindependently. This benchmark is particularly important if we are going \nto be able to\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\ndraw down on the U.S. troops in Iraq. The Bush administration's \nassessment on this benchmark: not satisfactory.\n  The interim report the administration released last week confirms \nthat Iraqi security forces still cannot be trusted to enforce the law \nfairly. Some have taken part in sectarian violence, and some even have \nturned on American troops.\n  In order to have national reconciliation and the political elements \nfor stability in Iraq, it is necessary to enact and implement \ndebaathification reforms; another critical benchmark that was \nestablished with the United States and the Iraqis. The Bush \nadministration's assessment on this benchmark: not satisfactory.\n  Most troubling, the Iraqi Government is seriously weakened, and many \npredict its collapse. The major Sunni party is currently boycotting the \nGovernment. Without Sunni participation, meaningful progress on any key \npolitical benchmarks is impossible.\n  Whatever progress the President's interim report claims, it is clear \nthat our military has not curbed sectarian violence, nor has the troop \nescalation provided sectarian influence over and infiltration of the \nIraqi security forces, or forced Iraqi political leaders to make the \ntough decisions necessary to move forward toward peace.\n  I think it is time to acknowledge that President Bush's troop \nescalation has failed. It has failed to make Iraq more secure. The \nIraqi Government remains incapable of organizing its security forces or \nits legislature to achieve a semblance of stability or political \nreconciliation.\n\n  It is time to change the mission in Iraq. The cost of further delays \nin lives, material, treasure, standing in the world, is just too great. \nPresident Bush's strategy has put this Nation at greater risk, a risk \nthat metastasizes each day that we sit by and wait. Wait for what? For \nnew evidence of failure to accumulate, for news that more American \nsoldiers have died and Iraqi civilians have been killed?\n  It is critical for the United States to change policy in Iraq, and it \nstarts by removing our troops from the middle of a civil war. The \nLevin-Reed amendment would do that. Our new mission must recognize that \nthe opportunity for sweeping regional change, if it ever existed, has \npassed.\n  Instead, we need to focus on realistic objectives which include \npreventing the conflict in Iraq from igniting a broader regional war \nand preventing genocide.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot rewrite history. The United States does have \na responsibility toward assisting the Iraqis and working for peace in \nthat region. It is in the interests of our country to do that. There is \nno easy path to achieve the objectives of stability in Iraq and \nprotection of all of its ethnic communities.\n  As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group noted:\n\n       There is no action the American military can take that by \n     itself can bring about success in Iraq.\n\n  The efforts will most certainly include stepped-up diplomatic \nefforts. Iraq's neighbors have a stake in Iraqi stability. The war in \nIraq has produced hundreds of thousands of refugees. An escalation of \nthe conflict will mean even more refugees, which is a major concern to \nIraq's neighbors.\n  An escalation in the conflict means the spread of fundamentalism and \nsectarian violence, and an increase in basic crime and lawlessness, not \njust to Iraq but to the region.\n  We must support and broaden efforts made to create the International \nCompact for Iraq, a 5-year plan launched this past April under the \nauspices of the United Nations with benchmarks for Iraq's national \nreconciliation and economic reconstruction.\n  That compact includes formal commitments of support from the \ninternational community. But we must begin to have a broader diplomatic \nand economic vision in the Middle East that includes engaging both the \nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, OSCE, in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The various agencies of the United Nations are best suited to tackle \nthe myriad problems plaguing Iraq. Matters of security, training, \neconomics, and community development and providing electricity, water, \nand sanitation service are all areas where the United Nations has \nexpertise.\n  Just as important, the United States should request OSCE to assist \nIraq as a partner for cooperation. There is precedent for this. \nAfghanistan has already moved in that direction. Afghanistan has begun \nparticipation in OSCE proceedings under this program. This status could \nallow OSCE to assist Iraq with collective border security, police \ntraining--which is desperately needed--immigration and religious \ntolerance efforts.\n  Engaging the UN and OSCE could help initiate much needed multilateral \nand bilateral engagement with both friendly nations such as Turkey and \nwith hostile nations such as Iran and Syria.\n  Engagement of the international community to deal with Iran and \nSyria's destabilizing regional policies is a critical factor that is \nneeded and a renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n  Iraq should request assistance from the United Nations and other \ninternational forces to help prevent continued ethnic cleansing. \nAccording to the United Nations 2005 World Summit, a high-level plenary \nmeeting of the 60th session of the General Assembly, states have a \nresponsibility to protect their population from genocide, war crimes, \nethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. This is an international \nresponsibility, not solely a U.S. responsibility.\n  I believe the strategy I have just outlined presents the best chance \nof helping the Iraqis negotiate a government and a governmental \nstructure that has the confidence of its people, that protects the \nrights of all of its citizens, and builds the democratic institutions \nsuch as an independent judiciary and a market-based economy that are so \nvital to a successful country.\n  There is a difference between being resolute and being stubborn. We \ncan no longer ignore overwhelming evidence or recoil from the cold \nreality the facts on the ground reveal. President Bush's policies have \nfailed. The world has an interest in a safe and secure Iraq. I believe \nefforts to rebuild the country must be a shared responsibility among \nnations.\n  There is no more time for delay. It is time to change the mission, \nredeploy our troops currently stationed in Iraq, and internationalize \nthe effort to bring stability to that country and to the Middle East. \nSuch a strategy could give the Iraqis a real hope for peace and give \nAmericans the best chance to achieve our objectives in that region of \nthe world.\n  Our soldiers have honored our country by their incredible service. We \nowe it to our soldiers to change our mission now so we have the best \nchance to achieve these objectives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, you would never know it from our debate \nthe last couple of weeks, but we are here to talk about the Defense \nauthorization bill, this rather large bill that is at all of our desks. \nMuch broader than just any particular conversation about Iraq, or any \nparticular battle, this is to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2008, for military activities and the Department of Defense, for \nmilitary construction, for defense activities and the Department of \nEnergy, to proscribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \nand other purposes.\n  One of the most important bills that we debate and pass, this \nincludes money for aircraft, missiles, weapons systems, vehicles, all \nof the things we need to protect and secure our country--a very \nimportant bill.\n  I appreciate that the minority a number of times this evening has \nsaid: We need to go ahead and vote, particularly on the amendment in \nfront of us, the Levin amendment. And while the normal procedure is to \nget agreements between the sides on when we vote, the minority filed \ncloture on this bill. There is really no need to delay the cloture vote \nany further.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Could I just offer an observation? We are not the \nminority, we are the majority.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you. Bad habits die hard. Thank you for correcting \nme.\n  But we do need to move ahead with the cloture vote. There is no need \nfor the theatrics through the evening on this. And since the majority \nhas filed for a cloture vote, I ask unanimous\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\nconsent that the cloture vote for the pending Levin amendment occur at \n8:30 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nwill repeat that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \npending Levin amendment occur at 8:30 this evening.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is clear that the cloture motion as has \nbeen filed by the majority is clearly not what they want to happen this \nevening. So it does seem to be that this is all about a political \ncircus to keep us here all night for some political theater to try to \nembarrass the President and in the process demoralize our troops and \nembolden our enemies.\n  Instead of talking about substantive amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill, what I hear the majority speaking of is message \namendments, to try to message their political theater.\n  The fact is, this is about winning elections. The majority has given \nmany quotes to the media. One senior Democratic aide on Fox News, when \nasked about staying up all night, said: Is this a publicity stunt? Yes.\n  Senator Reid was quoted as saying at a press conference: I don't know \nif we will get 60 votes, but I tell you one thing, there are 21 \nRepublicans up for reelection this time.\n  Senator Reid was quoted in the Washington Post as: We are going to \npick up Senate seats as a result of this war. Senator Schumer has shown \nme numbers that are compelling and astounding.\n  So while the majority is putting us through political theater in \nhopes of picking up Senate seats in 2008, our National Intelligence \nEstimate, which just came out, is very clear in their key judgment. It \nsays: We judge that the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and \nevolving terrorist threat over the next 3 years.\n  The main threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups themselves, \nespecially al-Qaida driven by their undiminished intent to attack the \nhomeland and a continued effort by these terrorists groups to adopt and \nimprove their capabilities.\n  The report is clear that we have a broad threat, a global threat. It \nis not just about Iraq. The whole Defense authorization is very \nimportant. We should not be sidelining the discussion of important \nissues of national defense and security with political theater this \nevening.\n  But it is important, as some of my colleagues have done, to kind of \nreview what we have been through the last few months. Certainly, all of \nus are concerned about the progress in Iraq, the safety of our troops. \nWe all want to finish our job with honor, with victory, to bring our \ntroops home.\n  We have had a lot of debate this year. But recently when the \nPresident submitted his war spending bill, emergency supplemental bill, \nto fund our troops, we had a lot of debate. My Democratic colleagues \nhad a lot of different ideas. The President vetoed one version. After \nthat, we came to an agreement. The Democrats would force the President \nto agree that after we sent General Petraeus there--and that was a \nunanimous thing, to send General Petraeus to Baghdad to secure the \narea, we sent thousands of new troops. The Democrats agreed on that \nfunding, but they requested that we have a report from General Petraeus \nin the middle of September to find out what progress we were making. We \nall agreed to that. But after we all agreed and had the signing at the \nWhite House, that is now not good enough for my Democratic colleagues.\n  As we heard one political strategist say about the Democrats, any day \nthey are not talking about Iraq is a bad day. They want to make \npolitical hay out of this difficult situation that our country faces.\n  We have a new plan almost every day of how we are going to withdraw \nand retreat, a strategy du jour in the Senate. We will be talking about \na lot of those new strategies as we go through the evening.\n  But as has already been mentioned by some of my Republican colleagues \nwho talk a lot with the troops who come home, almost without exception \nthey believe in our mission, and they believe they can win. What we are \nasking tonight of the majority is to let them win. Let Petraeus do what \nwe sent him to do. Give him the time that we gave him--until \nSeptember--to demonstrate that we can secure Baghdad, at least \nreasonably, in a way that the Government can function and the economy \ncan rebound and the country can begin to establish itself as a free and \nindependent democracy.\n  What we are seeing again is what we have seen over the past years. My \nDemocratic colleagues, while well intended, are very often weak on \ndefense and national security on almost every measure fighting for \nsecurity. We would not even give our homeland security the same tools \nto fight terrorists as we give our law enforcement to fight drug \ndealers. Certainly, terrorists are as much a threat to us.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have even said this is a bumper \nsticker campaign, not a real war. I think we have to begin this whole \nprocess by recognizing, as our national intelligence estimate tells us \ntime and again, this is a real threat, a continuing threat, one that we \nneed to be prepared for in many ways, and we need to develop more of a \nconsensus in the Senate of how we are going to fight it.\n  Our troops do believe in what they are doing. They believe it is a \nright cause, and they believe they can win. We need to let them win. We \nshouldn't continue to talk through the night and talk day after day \nabout ``we have lost'' or ``we can't win'' or ``we shouldn't be there'' \nor ``we are not making progress,'' when those who are there doing the \nfighting are telling us quite a different story.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address at least one amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill that I think is an example of what we need \nto be doing to make our military more efficient. There are a lot of \nthings we do as a Congress that force our military to do things maybe \nfor political reasons that don't help us militarily. One is related to \naircraft retirement.\n  I have an amendment that I hope we can get to, amendment No. 2302, \nthat is related to aircraft retirement. Some call it flyable storage. I \nwas amazed to find out that Congress has required the Air Force to \nmaintain in flying condition permanently grounded aircraft at the cost \nof millions of dollars a year. Many of these older aircraft, because of \nstructural integrity, safety concerns, will never fly again. Yet we \nrequire them to be maintained in operational status for that last \nflight to the junkyard.\n  Between 2000 and 2007, retirement restrictions cost the Air Force \n$893 million, and almost $143 million has gone to modify aircraft the \nAir Force would like to retire. This year, the Air Force will spend \n$8.1 million to maintain the aircraft in flyable storage, $8.1 million \nto maintain aircraft that will never be used again. This will happen \nyear after year.\n  There has been some political pressure to keep this because some \nmaintenance happens in different States where various Senators and \nCongressmen want that to continue.\n  My amendment will just give the Air Force the flexibility to retire \naircraft that needs to be retired. Most Americans would think that is \njust basic common sense, and I hope we can agree on that in the Senate.\n  I hope we can get back to the debate on this Defense authorization \nbill. I am very sorry that the majority will not let us move to the \ncloture vote on the Levin amendment, which is pending. But if we need \nto talk through the night, we will continue to talk through the night.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Maryland finishes her remarks, then on the Republican \nside, I understand Senator Warner will be the next speaker, and then \nthat Senator Schumer be recognized on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould just like to add Senator Bunning after Senator Schumer, if I may.\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am glad we got one of them. Maybe we can start a \nmomentum here.\n  Mr. President, I never thought I would see the day in the Senate when \nthere would be essentially a gag rule on the subject of war, \nessentially a gag rule preventing us from voting on the deployment of \nour troops and a framework for them to be able to come home. We are \nsupposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body, but the other \nparty has chosen to throw sand in the gears to give us a vote where we \nwould present a framework.\n  The previous speaker talked about that we Democrats present a \nstrategy du jour on the war. I challenge that statement and say it is \nthe White House that gives us a strategy du jour, a strategy of the \nweek, always changing goals. When the war was originally voted for, it \nwas to get rid of Saddam Hussein and get rid of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Saddam is gone and there were no weapons of mass \ndestruction. If that was the goal of the war, come back home. Then it \nwas to create democracy in Iraq. Now it is to secure Baghdad. It is a \ngoal and a strategy du jour.\n\n  We have to come up with the right kind of framework, but we also need \nto be able to offer our votes. Mr. President, 47 times this year the \nRepublican minority has threatened a filibuster on a variety of bills \nthat we want to bring up on both domestic and foreign policy; 47 times \nthey have threatened a filibuster, and now they have gone too far. Now \nthe other party refuses to give us a vote on the most important issue \nwe face: the war in Iraq and the deployment of our troops.\n  Our President talks about building a democratic Iraq. We should start \nwith building democracy right here in the Senate.\n  Democracy is built on fundamental principles. One of the fundamental \nprinciples is freedom of speech, but not in the Senate. We are in a gag \nrule. We face strong-arm tactics to prevent our vote on a troop \ndeadline.\n  Another fundamental principle of democracy is majority rule, but not \nin the Senate. It now takes 60 votes to win a vote. The reason we \nobjected to the cloture is to end the filibuster. But we want to end \nthe war, and that is why our unanimous consent request is a direct vote \non that point. They want to hide behind parliamentary procedure. We \nwant to go directly to the point.\n  Our Constitution calls for a system of checks and balances, but that \nis not what the White House wants. They want us to write the checks, \nbut tonight we are trying to provide the balance. That is why we stand \nhere the way we do.\n  Some people say Democrats are micromanaging the war. Well, hey, \nsomeone has to manage it, and it is about time. For the last 5 years, \nCongress has been under the rule of the other party. It has been a \nrubberstamp for the Bush administration. The results have been \ndevastating to our military, to America's standing in the world, to the \nIraqi people. We had troops sent to battle with inadequate protection \nand no plan for victory. We had modest international support, and now \nthat is dwindling. Our former Secretary of Defense was imperious and \nturned a blind eye to cronyism and corruption at every level of the \nreconstruction.\n  You know what, it is time for someone to manage the war, and we are \nready to do it. We are ready to lead. We just need to have a vote.\n  It is time to stop talking, it is time for action, and it is time for \nthe Senate to have its say and its day on an actual vote.\n  This isn't about theater, it is not about polls, and it is not about \npolitics. It is about the will of the American people. It is about \nhonoring democratic principles. It is about doing the job we were \nelected to do.\n  I support the bipartisan amendment of Levin, Reed, and Hagel and \nother Republicans because it begins the process of bringing our troops \nhome. But it not only brings them home, it brings them home safely and \nswiftly.\n  The Iraqis must understand the future of their nation is now in their \nhands, and our troops have to understand that the Congress is with them \nand we want to be with them when they are on the battlefield and when \nthey come home. We believe the best way to support our troops is to \ncreate a framework to bring them home swiftly and safely.\n  There are those who want to talk about alternatives. There are those \nwho are blocking the vote on this amendment saying it is too soon to \nwithdraw. They have suddenly discovered the recommendations of the Iraq \nStudy Group, something I supported 7 months ago, 210 days ago.\n  Mr. President, 210 days ago, the Iraq Study Group gave us a \nframework. They called it a way forward. They had 79 recommendations. I \nstood on this floor and said out of the 79, certainly there were 60 on \nwhich we could agree. Let's have a meeting, let's pick our favorite 60, \nand let's start moving forward on a military solution, a political \nsolution, a diplomatic solution, but a solution it would be.\n  It was dismissed. It was dismissed by the other party, the other side \nof the wall, the other side of the aisle--it seems like a wall \nsometimes--and it was dismissed by the President of the United States.\n  So now all of a sudden they found the Iraq Study Group. Seven months \nago that Iraq Study Group did call for diplomatic and political \nefforts. I think we make those efforts, and I also think that is \nincluded in the spirit and substance of Levin-Reed-Hagel-Snowe and \nothers amendment.\n  Now is the day that we should refocus our mission in Iraq and also \nfollow the path forward that was recommended and have our troops home \nby April 1, 2008. We know the Levin-Reed-Hagel, et al, amendment \ndirects the Secretary of Defense to begin reducing the number of U.S. \nforces in Iraq no later than 120 days to begin those important \ndiplomatic and political strategies. And it also leaves U.S. forces \nthere for three missions: protecting other U.S. troops, completing the \ntraining of Iraq troops, and engaging in targeted counterterrorism \noperations. But it also requires them to complete it by April 30, 2008. \nThis is what I advocate.\n  I am not new to this position. I never wanted to go to war in the \nfirst place. You see, I read all those intelligence reports, and I \nnever believed that the President should be granted unilateral \nauthority to engage in a war where there was no imminent threat to the \nUnited States of America. I was one of 23. Four years ago on October \n11, I opposed the President giving this authority and asked that we \nexhaust our diplomatic options, asked us to stick with the U.N., and I \nsaid: I am just so concerned that I don't know if our troops will be \nmet with a parade or a landmine. We know where we are. So off we went. \nWe went to war with Iraq, and now we are at war within Iraq. Saddam is \ngone, but we are still there mired in a civil war.\n  No one could ask more of our troops. They have been brave, they have \nbeen courageous, and they have followed the request of their Commander \nin Chief. We need to look out for them. I believe we will. Other \naspects of this bill, particularly the Wounded Warriors Act, look out \nfor the veterans who have been injured, look out by reforming the \ndisability benefits system, look out for the health care they need from \nthe VA.\n  It is time for a new direction. It is time for us to have this vote. \nIt is time for the Iraqi elected officials to stand up. Twelve Members \nof the 38-Member Parliament no longer attend Cabinet meetings; 75 \nMembers of the Iraqi Parliament are boycotting their own Parliament so \nthat they cannot get a quorum to do their job, whether it is for oil \nrevenue sharing or power sharing.\n\n  I think it is time now, I think it is time for us to have a vote. I \nthink it is time to refocus the mission. I think it is time to redeploy \nour troops. I think it is time to bring our troops home by April 30, \n2008. And that is why I think it is time to vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I therefore, ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2088 be withdrawn and that at 8:30 p.m. today, the Senate vote on \nthe Levin-Reed amendment No. 2087 with the time, in all fairness, \nequally divided on both sides in the usual format, and no second-degree \namendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  Mr. WARNER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so sorry to hear that objection. \nBut I have now concluded my remarks for this part of the evening and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, I am given \nan opportunity now, which I have been looking forward to, to have a \nlittle colloquy with my long-time friend, Senator Levin, now chairman \nof the committee, and address one or two issues to explain why I feel \nvery strongly that I have to oppose this amendment.\n  Just 49 days ago, the President signed into law an appropriations \nbill which contained legislative language, which legislative language \noriginated on the floor of the Senate. I was privileged to be a part of \nthe drafting of that language, and it eventually has become now the law \nof the land. I would like to review some of the points we put in that \nlanguage which is the law.\n  It, first, requires the President to come forward on July 15, which \nhe did. He submitted an assessment of the benchmarks. It further \ndirected that General Petraeus be here in September with Ambassador \nCrocker. It further called upon the new organization which was created \nin this most recent appropriations bill, again originating, this part \nof the legislation, on the floor of the Senate. We put together a \nrequirement that there be an independent study group of the Iraq \nsecurity forces.\n  We have periodically through the years received reports from the \nDepartment of Defense describing how many battalions of the Iraqi \nforces are trained, how many are equipped, how many are ready to take \nthe point by themselves, how many are dependent on U.S. forces. That is \nquite an accumulation of data. I felt very strongly, and other \ncolleagues did, that we wanted to have a report independent of the \nDepartment of Defense, and that report performed by individuals who had \nmany years of experience assessing the capabilities of men and women in \nuniform.\n  How fortunate we were that the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nGeneral Jones, offered to head that group. He formed a group of fellow \nofficers, most of them three and four stars now retired, who likewise \nhave had years of experience and training in evaluating our Armed \nForces. And they added two police chiefs. They just finished this past \nweekend. They returned on Saturday from a 1-week trip to Iraq to study \nthe forces.\n  Part of the law requires that they come forward with a report. And I \nam pleased to say, having consulted with General Jones, that report \nwill be available early in September, such that the President, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others can take it into consideration \nas they formulate the sequential requirement of the President to come \nforth and report to America, the Congress, and his people his opinion \nof the situation in Iraq as of September 15 of this year.\n  It is for that reason that I believe we should hold in place \nadditional legislation at this time until the President has had the \nopportunity, that Congress has had the opportunity, and, most \nimportantly, the American people have had the opportunity to study all \nof these facts provided by the professionals.\n  I would like to also add that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Pace, has also stated he will have a report, his own \nassessment, of the situation over there, and his assessment of the Iraq \nsecurity forces; that is, both military and police, prepared for that \nSeptember timeframe. So that is the focal point.\n  I say with deep respect to my colleague, Senator Levin, chairman of \nthe committee, which I am proud to have served on now 29 years with \nSenator Levin, side by side, that it seems to me we have passed a law \nwhere we put in the process by which America would proceed to the 15th \nof September, at which time the President will report to the Nation \nabout such changes as he deems--the President, as Commander in Chief, \nexercising his clear authority under the Constitution, to change or \nrevise the strategy and how our forces will be implemented in the \nfuture.\n  Later this evening, perhaps when I have further time, I will address \nthe Warner-Lugar amendment, which goes into some detail about our \nrecommendations to the President--I repeat: recommendations. Not \ndirecting him as a matter of law--on that report on 15 September; to \ninclude certain items in it. But the point I wish to make is I feel \nthat if the Senate were to adopt, by way of a vote--which now requires \n60 votes--the Levin amendment, it would be in contravention to the very \nspirit, letter, and purpose of the law that this body adopted 49 days \nago. That would bring about confusion in the minds of the troops, \nconfusion in the minds of the world.\n  How can America take such a zigzag course in legislation at such a \ncritical time in our history, while trying to provide the Iraqi people \nwith a stable situation so they can have some measurable quality of \nlife and freedom and move ahead and hopefully have a nation that will \njoin other nations in the world in our struggle against terrorism? That \nis my main concern.\n  I also point out that my good friend, Senator Levin, voted for the \nCornyn amendment, which we adopted this morning, and among the findings \nare, as follows: The Cornyn amendment, which Senator Levin and I, and \n90-some other Senators supported, stated:\n\n       A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda.\n\n  We read today in the National Intelligence Estimate addressing the \npotential of al-Qaida and how so much of that potential is directed, \nclearly, at the United States.\n  The Cornyn amendment also said:\n\n       The Iraq Study Group report found that ``(a) chaotic Iraq--\n\n  should we have a precipitous pullout--\n\n       could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally.''\n\n  Further, the Cornyn amendment recited:\n\n       A National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \n     consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq would be \n     that--(A) Al Qaeda would attempt to use Anbar province to \n     plan further attacks outside of Iraq; (B) neighboring \n     countries would consider actively intervening in Iraq; and \n     (C) sectarian violence would significantly increase in Iraq, \n     accompanied by massive civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n  Now, I read that because my valued friend, Senator Levin, appeared \nlast night on a national program, the Jim Lehrer show, and he was asked \nrepeatedly in that interview about how he would envision an Iraq having \nto experience a withdrawal timetable, which is fixed in his amendment. \nHow would Iraq be, once that timetable went into effect and those \ntroops would withdraw? I read through very carefully the transcript, \nwhich I have here, and I cannot find in there the specific references, \nmuch like what was in the Cornyn amendment. It seems to me there might \nbe some disconnect between what you said publicly last night and the \ndocument to which you attached your vote in support today.\n  So I would like to entertain a colloquy and have my good friend \nexplain how he envisions what the consequences to Iraq would be should \nhis amendment be law eventually. We would first have to pass it here \nand then it would have to go to a conference with the House and then \nsurvive and become a part of the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can respond to my good friend's question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Michigan \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We know what we hope will happen, and there are some \nthings we can predict that will happen.\n  What do we know? We know that Iraq is in chaos. We know that the \nIraqi President, or Prime Minister more accurately, has said the only \nway to end the bloodletting of innocents in Iraq is if the Iraqi \nleaders reach a political settlement. We know that. We know there is no \nmilitary solution in Iraq. We know there is only a political solution \nand that the violence cannot end unless Iraqi leaders reach a political \nsettlement.\n  I think those are consensus points. Those are things we know. We know \nhow many of our troops have been killed and how many are killed every\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nmonth and how many are wounded and come home. We know those things.\n  Then the question is: Since there is no military solution, there is \nonly a political solution--that is the only hope of succeeding in \nIraq--how do you promote a political settlement in Iraq? Is the current \ncourse we are on succeeding or do we need to change the course?\n  We all have the same goal. We all want to maximize the chances of \nsuccess in Iraq. If you believe we are succeeding in Iraq now, then you \nvote to stay the course. If you believe after all these years and all \nthese deaths and all these wounded and all these expenditures, now over \n$10 billion a month, that we need to change course because we are not \nsucceeding in Iraq, you have to ask yourself: How do we change course? \nHow do we change what is going on in Iraq?\n  So those are the things that we, each of us, I think in our own \nconscience, are trying to figure what is the best way to maximize the \nchances of success in Iraq. I believe the only hope in getting the \nIraqi leaders to reach the political settlement, which everybody agrees \nis the only hope, is to force them to accept responsibility for their \nown nation, to work out the political differences on revenue-sharing, \non elections, on debaathification amendments, and on constitutional \nchanges.\n  They have been dithering for years. They made a promise to their \npeople, to the American people, and to the world last year. It is on \ntheir Web site, 16 of their benchmarks--not ours, their benchmarks. \nThey have not carried out the commitments they have made. There was a \ntimetable attached to those benchmarks. I put that timetable in the \nRecord. It was part of a letter that Secretary Rice sent to me.\n\n  So we have a situation--\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, the amendment which I worked on and \nwhich went into the appropriations bill, those are the same benchmarks \nin that bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. They are different.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, they track, in large measure, the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Some are the same, some are different, but they are \npolitical benchmarks which the Iraqi leaders said they would meet. They \nmade those benchmarks. We didn't impose them, those are their \nbenchmarks. The letter from Secretary Rice makes it explicit that the \nPresidency Council, which represents all the factions in Iraq, formally \nadopted those benchmarks. They were supposed to have been adopted in \nOctober, November, December, January, and in February. They have not \nbeen met.\n  How are we going to get them to meet them, to keep an open-ended \ncommitment, which is what the President wants us to do. Another delay \nand then patience. The President asks us to be patient? We should be \ndownright impatient with the Iraqi leaders. The message to the Iraqi \nleaders shouldn't be, for heaven sakes, after all these casualties, \nthat we are going to be patient with them when it is in their hands as \nto whether this civil strife is going to end.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say to my colleague, the President, when he \nenunciated his new policy on January 10, the purpose was to lay a \nfoundation of security such that the Iraqi Government could perform in \na manner given that the security is very serious in Iraq.\n  Even though I had misgivings about the surge, I put those aside once \nthe President had made a decision to go forward. I wish to support the \ntroops, and they are carrying out this mission. I think there is a \nstrong chance there will be some measure of achievement of the surge \nmilitarily.\n  I agree with my colleague, the performance of the Iraqi Government to \ndate has been extraordinarily disappointing. I have stated that on this \nfloor a number of times, as have other colleagues. But the point I wish \nto urge is that if we were to take--tomorrow, for example--and begin to \nchange the intentions of the Senate, which were expressed in law 49 \ndays ago, and suddenly announce a withdrawal program, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan has in his amendment, it would be \nperceived as an undercut to the very military operation we are trying \nto bring about now.\n  Why can't we wait until September, until the President has had the \nbenefit of all the convergence of this information, and then, as a \nbody, review his remarks and statements and possibly change the \nstrategy subsequent to the 15th of September? Because I do believe that \nyour amendment is in conflict with what we did 49 days ago.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for an answer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senate spoke also prior to adopting your \namendment. We voted 51 to 48, adopted an amendment which said we will \nbegin to reduce our forces and to transition to the new mission, and \nthat we would begin that transition within 120 days. That was vetoed by \nthe President.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senate spoke even before it adopted the amendment of \nthe Senator from Virginia. So we have spoken in many ways over the \nyears. But now it is our belief, those of us who support this \namendment, that the earlier we put pressure on the Iraqi leaders to \nreach a political solution, which everybody agrees is the only hope, \nthe earlier we put that pressure on them, the better.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member, \nMr. McCain, in his remarks of this morning, made it very clear that the \nPresident made it very clear, if we proceed with the course of adopting \nyour amendment, then there will be another veto, and then we are back \ninto that sequence and a veto on a bill which you and I have worked on \nfor these 29 years.\n  How many times have we been on the floor supporting the annual \nauthorization bill? We have gotten a bill each of those 29 years that \nwe have been on that committee. This will be the first time a President \nwas compelled to veto it because he is repeating his actions he took \nearlier, 2 months ago.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senator is well aware this President is not \ncompelled to veto anything. As a matter of fact, the report the Senator \nrefers to, which is due in September, will be coming in before this \nbill gets to the President. At least there is some hope the President \nwill see what the Republican leader in the Senate saw a month ago. It \nwas the Senator from Kentucky who a couple of months ago said: The \nhandwriting is on the wall. There is going to be a change of course in \nSeptember.\n  Now, why wait? We are losing men and women, our best and our \nbrightest, our bravest, every day in Iraq. Those who return wounded \nwill have a lifetime of recovery in many cases. We have record numbers \nof problems that have come up--post-traumatic stress disorder, we have \ntraumatic brain injuries which are plaguing our troops who survive. \nThank God we have great medical care on the battlefield. Why wait until \nSeptember? The Republican leader said the handwriting is on the wall. \nThere is going to be a change of course in September. There should be a \nchange of course, not just in September, it should have changed a long \ntime ago. But there is no way to change this course unless the leaders \nof Iraq do what only they can do, what their own Prime Minister said \nhad to happen before the bloodletting of innocents ends in Iraq. They \nand they alone have it in their hands to work out the political \nsettlement, which, according to their own agreement, was supposed to \nhave been reached months ago.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct, that Government \nhas not performed. But we, 49 days ago, structured a careful sequence \nof events between now and September to make certain the information, \nthe facts, the opinions, the conclusions which would guide the \nPresident in that revision of strategy the distinguished Senator \nMcConnell made observation about some time ago, that information is \nconverging at that very point in time.\n  I say to the Senator, we are so close. I would not want to see the \nCongress disrupt what it has already enacted and put it into law as to \nwhat is to take place in September. It is for that reason I simply \ncannot support my distinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend, and I don't view this at all as \npersonal.\n  A matter of fact, we had this interim report on July 15. What did it \ncome in and say? It came in and said, on the political side, nothing \nhas happened in Iraq; and on the political side, we see no advances. \nBut the political side is\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\nwhere the advances have to take place. As a matter of fact, the \nPresident said, when he came up with this surge policy, that the \npurpose of the surge was to give the political leaders an opportunity \nto reach a political settlement.\n\n  Well, they have had that opportunity, they haven't done it, and the \nsurge has not accomplished anything in the area of a political \nsettlement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will conclude my time and yield the \nfloor because other colleagues sequentially are participating. Perhaps \nwe will be able to reopen this colloquy at another time during the \ndebate. But I certainly share with you the enormity of loss of life, \nthe loss of limb, of the hardships of the military families. Even those \nfamilies who fortunately have not suffered loss of life or limb \nnevertheless have repeated tours of duty and separations from their \nloved ones brought on by this war.\n  But I am concerned we might lose all of that which has been given if \nwe make the wrong decision now and precipitously fix a date for \npullout. All that sacrifice might be lost. I am certain my colleague \nshares with me that one of the goals we should have in this situation \nis to make certain those losses were not in vain.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I think we all share that view, \nbut the amendment, if it is anything, it is not precipitous. This is \ncoming after a great deal of debate. We have had a vote on this. The \nSenate voted to do something very similar to this, and it was vetoed.\n  We have a 120-day period to begin to reduce forces. That is not \nprecipitous. That gives the Iraqis notice, now 4 months more notice \nafter enactment, which can't come for many months, that they have to \nbegin to get their political act together.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my time is nearly up. It may not be \nenacted for 4 or 5 months, but the signal will go out of this Chamber, \nif we adopt your amendment, that the Senate, in less than 40 days, has \nchanged the law that it passed a short time ago, and it looks like a \nzigzag course that this Nation is taking in one of the most serious \nsituations in my lifetime--this situation in the Middle East. It is \nessential to our security that area of the world not implode.\n  I yield the floor to the other Senators who are scheduled to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, I thank the Chair, and this is a historic night. \nThe Senate will stay in session all night to debate the war in Iraq, \nsomething we should be doing. Frankly, Mr. President, we should have \ndone it a while ago.\n  The bottom line is we need debate and to focus attention on Iraq. We \nneed to change the course in Iraq. We need to bring an end to having \nAmerican soldiers police, patrol, be wounded, maimed, and killed, as \nthey are in the midst of this civil war not of our country's making.\n  The bottom line is this. We are here to debate the one true \nresolution that will force the President to change course in Iraq. Many \nof us, sadly, and with some degree of frustration, believe the \nPresident will not change course. Many of us believe the facts on the \nground are not apparent to him or, if they are, do not enter into his \ndecision. The view that military strength, and military strength alone, \ncan prevail in Iraq is wrong. The facts do not measure up. The Shia, \nthe Sunni, the Kurds have had age-old enmity. If I had to sum up the \nproblem with the President's policy in a sentence, I would say this: \nThe Shias, the Sunnis, the Kurds dislike each other far more than they \nmight like any central government of Iraq.\n  In a certain sense, what we are trying to do here is to take two \n``norths'' on a magnet and try to push them together. The minute we \nrelease our hands they will push apart. Those are the facts on the \nground that cannot be avoided.\n  We can add another 20,000 troops or another 40,000 troops and might \nget some degree of pacification for a period of time. As soon as we \nleave, whether it is in 3 months or 3 years, the Sunnis, the Shiites, \nthe Kurds, and the various factions will be fighting with one another \nonce again.\n  There is indeed--and I will elaborate--there is indeed a need to \nprotect ourselves from terrorism that might generate from the chaos in \nIraq. That does not require 160,000 troops patrolling the streets of \nBaghdad. Most of what our soldiers do--bravely, gallantly, with great \ndedication to their country, but unfortunately--most of what our \nsoldiers do has absolutely nothing to do with fighting terrorism. Yet \nwe continue to send them back and then back again and then back again.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, particularly \nthose who have stated that the present policy is misguided, and even \nthose who probably think it is misguided but don't want to say it out \nof loyalty to the leader of their party, will take a bold step and join \nus in supporting the Levin-Reed amendment. All of the other amendments \nare flawed, in my judgment, because they are advisory. This President \nwill not take advice unless forced to change course. If it doesn't \nhappen now, it will happen in September or October. It will happen. We \nall know that at some point there will be a group of Republican \nSenators who will quietly go to the White House and say: Mr. President, \nunless you change direction in Iraq we will change it for you.\n  If that is going to happen in 2 or 3 months--and the whispers on the \nother side of the aisle indicate that is what will happen--why wait? \nWhy sacrifice more life and see so many more soldiers coming home \nwounded? Why sacrifice the billions of dollars that we are spending at \nthe same time our schools need so much help and our health care system \nneeds so much help? Our energy policy needs redirection.\n  We live in a changing world. Technology has changed everything about \nour world. It has created terrorism. Terrorism is a real force. I \ndisagree with those who say we can ignore the fact that terrorism is \nreal. Technology has empowered small groups of bad people and given \nthem the ability to strike at us in our heartland. That is brand new. \nThere have always been small groups of bad people. There have even been \nlarge groups of bad people. But they didn't have the ability to hurt \nus.\n  The Japanese war machine in 1941, while America slept, could only get \nas far as Pearl Harbor, and that was a long reach. Yet the several \nthousand in al-Qaida, far less wealthy and far less strong, were able \nto strike at the World Trade Center in my city. So terrorism is real. \nTerrorism is something that we have to fight against.\n  The problem in the equation that the President speaks about and \nbelieves in, that so many on the other side of the aisle speak about \nand believe in, is that what we are doing in Iraq, it is almost \nimpossible to prove has much to do with terror.\n  They say al-Qaida might set up camps in Iraq and use those camps as \nthey use the camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan to try and hurt us. That \nmay be true. But what does having our soldiers patrol the streets of \nBaghdad, or Diyala, or Ramadi or any of the other cities to prevent \nvarious tribes and ethnic groups from fighting one another, have to do \nwith that? What does trying--futilely, in my opinion--to buttress the \nMaliki government have to do with that, when the Maliki government is \nincapable of doing elementary things, let alone containing al-Qaida?\n  This war in Iraq has just veered out of control, and a great leader \nwould say that and change course. Without casting aspersions on what \nbrought us there--although we can debate that all day long; whatever \nhappened in the past happened. But the facts on the ground are real. To \njust about anyone who looks at this with an unbiased eye, what we are \ndoing in Iraq has very little to do with protecting us and, in fact, a \ngood argument can be made it makes things worse every day we stay. \nCertainly the argument can be made it delays the inevitable, which will \nhappen, which is that the Iraqis are going to have to work out for \nthemselves how they are going to live or not live together, given the \nage-old enmities.\n  Yet this President persists. It is not good for the Iraqi people. It \nis not good for the American people. It is not good for the country \nthat he does. Our job is to require the President to change because he \nwill not do it on his own.\n  That is why, while I have great respect for my colleague from \nColorado and for my colleague from Virginia and\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\nmy colleague from Indiana, I don't think their resolutions are what is \nneeded because the President will not change. He knows what our opinion \nis. He knows what the American people's view of this war is. He doesn't \nneed a resolution to suggest to him to change course. No. He needs to \nbe required to do it. He needs to be forced to do it.\n  That is the stark choice we face tonight. That is where we are \ntonight. If you believe that we must change course in Iraq, the only \nresolution that does that is Levin-Reed.\n  One other thing: This country needs to do so much. The very \ntechnology I talked about, which effects terrorism and creates \nterrorism, creates other challenges for America. Our schools--when the \nOEDC ranks the 21 developed countries in terms of their K-12 \neducation--now come out 12th, the bottom half. In math we come out \n15th. We are doing virtually nothing to improve our schools, which to \nme is the ultimate answer to preserve the American economy and American \njobs.\n  Our health care system is broken. There are 45 million people \nuncovered and many more who are not covered very well. We have a system \nthat doesn't do the basic preventive things that would save lives and \nsave dollars.\n\n  On energy we send $1 billion a day overseas to many people we don't \nlike, and we can't get hold of it and change it. Our foreign policy \nitself needs a new direction where we are able to take on terrorists \nwho might hurt us in a way that develops world consensus. The rest of \nthe world is learning what terrorism is like and why it is evil. We \nneed to change our military to be able to do that. We need to change \nour foreign policy arrangements to do it.\n  All of these things and so many more--our infrastructure and our \nculture are lost because everything in this administration is focused \non the misguided policy in Iraq.\n  The damage and danger of what is done hurts Iraq and it hurts \nAmerica's reputation in the world. It also hurts us at home because we \nare spending time and energy and resources on something that just \ncannot work the way it is. What the Levin-Reed resolution recommends is \nthat we withdraw the vast majority of our troops. We don't abandon Iraq \naltogether because we know al-Qaida might set up camps, and we know \nthere is a need for some troops--mainly out of harm's way--to protect \nus from al-Qaida camps that might help train those who might strike at \nus. But the Levin-Reed resolution would not entail 160,000 troops in \nharm's way, because they are not needed. There might be 10,000 or \n20,000 or 30,000 troops, mostly out of harm's way, that could protect \nus from terrorism.\n  The view that we can train the Iraqis to take over--many of us have \nlost faith in that. We have heard promise after promise that we should \nlet the Iraqis take over. They don't really want to fight this war \nbecause when there is very little loyalty to a central government, it \nis very hard to build an army in a divided nation.\n  Many of the other amendments that are before us, in my judgment, are \nwishful thinking. They believe they will get the President to see the \nlight. I wish that were the case. The President seems adamant. I don't \nthink he will change unless he is forced to change. I don't think he \nwill change unless this body meets its responsibilities and stands up \nand requires a change.\n  The President in February said we should wait until the summer. In \nApril he said September. Now we are hearing from some of the \ncommanders: Oh, no, we will have to wait until January.\n  It is just not working. We pacify one area and violence erupts in \nanother. If we go to that area, then the area that was pacified creates \nthe violence. Temporarily dealing with that violence doesn't solve the \nfundamental facts on the ground. Therefore, we need change. I do not \nbelieve this is an issue of hawks or doves. I think whichever you are, \nthe simple facts on the ground dictate that we should change, and only \nLevin-Reed has us do that.\n  I salute my colleagues, the Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, for putting together this resolution. I urge my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle in particular to join with \nus. You will be joining with us later if you don't join with us today. \nThat is the simple fact of the matter. I hope the Levin-Reed amendment \nis given its due. I hope it will pass for the sake of Iraq, the sake of \nour soldiers, the sake of America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBunning be allowed to speak until 8:35 and that the majority leader be \nrecognized immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my colleague, does that mean we will be voting \nafter the recognition of the majority leader?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Probably, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, could we add that the next \nDemocratic speaker will be Senator Feinstein?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, could we have the next \nRepublican speaker be Senator Alexander?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition? Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise tonight to play my small part in \nthis pointless political play put on by the Senate majority leader. It \nis an insult to the brave men and women in our Armed Forces and to the \nAmerican taxpayer that we are here tonight for no other reason than for \na publicity stunt. Instead of following the script written by MoveOn, \nlike my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I want to be honest \nand frank with the American people.\n  I hear Democrats every day talk about public opinion polls on Iraq \nand on the President's approval rating. To some extent they are right. \nThe American people are not satisfied with the war in Iraq and the \nPresident is at an all-time low in his approval rating.\n  But I rarely hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout public opinion polls of Congress. It is obvious why. President \nBush has a higher approval rating than the current democratically led \nCongress. I have never been accused of being a political strategist, \nbut I have been around this town long enough--over 21 years--to know \nthat the American people resent their leaders for so often taking the \npolitically expedient path instead of doing what they think is right.\n  The American people see right through this charade going on tonight. \nIt is more political theater: phony images of cots, toothpaste, and \nsleepy politicians, meant to convince people that what goes on here at \n3 in the morning may actually do some good. But it doesn't do any good.\n  In fact, it does a lot of bad. Because this debate is more about a \npolitical show and placating the ``MoveOn'' folks, than it is about \ntalking about the real issue at hand. It is appalling that we use a \nbill that provides vital funding of our Nation's military as a \npolitical smokescreen for Democrats to gain points in the polls.\n  The safety and security of the brave men and women in our Armed \nForces is not a game to me. Our troops should never be used as a basis \nto stage a cheap political stunt. If the Senate truly supported our \ntroops, we would be here debating the nuts and bolts of the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. Instead, we find ourselves back debating \nwhether to cut and run from Iraq, as we have done countless times \nbefore tonight.\n  Democrats would like for you to believe that Republicans will not \nvote on the Reed-Levin amendment. Give me a break. I am happy to vote \non the amendment right now. I plan to oppose it, as I have opposed a \nsimilar version Senator Levin offered 2 months ago.\n  It is a bad amendment. It calls for a premature withdrawal of \nAmerican troops from Iraq before we have even had a chance to see the \nresults of the surge. I wish to know how some of my colleagues know \nthat the surge has already failed when it has only been in place for a \nmonth?\n  I wish to know how they know the situation in Iraq better than our \ncommanders on the ground? The ink is not even dry on the President's \nplan and\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\nDemocrats are already declaring it a failure. This type of defeatist \nstrategy is irrational and unfair.\n  It is important to remember the dangerous effect our debate in \nWashington can have on the message we are sending our enemies. Make no \nmistake about it, our enemies are watching us. They are watching us and \nusing our debate on the war in Iraq to strengthen themselves. This \nmorning, the new National Intelligence Estimate declared the United \nStates is at an elevated threat level. It said our biggest threat is \nal-Qaida, specifically al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  This group is working to mobilize other extremist organizations in \nthe region to mount a new attack against the United States. The report \nalso found that al-Qaida will continue to acquire chemical, biological \nor nuclear materials for attacks; it will not hesitate to use them.\n  While al-Qaida is working to plan this attack, U.S. forces are \nworking hand in hand with Iraqi security forces to break up this \norganization and root it out and root this terrorist network out.\n  This work is vital to our national security. We cannot forget the \nimportant lessons we learned from the tragedies of 9/11. There are \nstill those out there who wish to do us harm. Wake up America. If we \nwithdrew from Iraq, the terrorists will likely follow us home.\n  Democrats would like for us to believe we can responsibly leave Iraq \nand the conflict will end. This is delusional. Make no mistake, if we \nleave Iraq prematurely, there will be widespread chaos in the Middle \nEast. Iran will work with Syria to dominate the region, while Sunni \nStates scramble to oppose them. They will use any means possible to \nacquire the resources to bolster their nuclear weapons program in an \neffort to combat and conquer the United States.\n  The Kurds in Iran will form their own country, possibly with the \nKurds in Turkey, Syria, and Iran. This could lead to an armed conflict \nbetween the Kurds and the Turkish Government. There will be widespread \nattacks to wipe out Israel and to topple the democratic Government of \nLebanon. These pillars of democracy in the Middle East that once stood \nas an example for freedom within the region will crumble.\n  The Government of Iraq will fail, and there will be civil war within \nthe country. This will result in massive civilian casualties and \ndisplacement. Most importantly, our national security will be in \njeopardy. This afternoon, we passed, by a large majority, Senator \nCornyn's amendment that said we should not leave a failed state in \nIraq. It also said we should not pass any legislation that will \nundermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues: What are we doing right now? We are debating \nSenator Levin's amendment that will, without a doubt, result in a \nfailed state in Iraq. Let me be clear to my colleagues that believe \nthey can support both amendments. The strategy of cut and run will lead \nto a failed Iraq and will undermine our military's mission.\n  But Democrats have already decided the surge has failed before it has \na chance to work. These are the same people who voted to overwhelmingly \nconfirm General Petraeus and are now refusing to wait to hear his \nreport in September. This is exactly the type of message our enemy \nwants to hear.\n  Well, I, for one, am working hard to send our enemies a different \nmessage: The United States will not back down from this fight. I stand \nbehind our troops and General Petraeus. I promised in person, in my \noffice, to General Petraeus, that I would wait to hear his report this \nfall. I intend to keep my promise. I urge my colleagues to do the same. \nThe safety and security of all Americans depends on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the surge has now been going for 6 months. \nMore than 600 Americans have been killed, thousands have been wounded, \ncosting our country $60 billion.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate which was issued today--was leaked \nby someone last week--is very clear: There are two al-Qaidas now; there \nused to be one. There is al-Qaida in Iraq, totally separate and apart \nfrom the other al-Qaida that bin Laden led.\n  Where did it come from? It came from the worst foreign policy blunder \nin the history of our country, the invasion of Iraq.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from Kentucky, should understand, as a \nresult of that invasion we now have a civil war raging in the \nPalestinian areas of Lebanon, the country of Israel has been basically \nignored during this administration, and we have Iran thumbing their \nnose at us.\n  For the information of my friend from Kentucky, there would not be a \ncivil war in Iraq, there already is one. It is an intractable civil \nwar. We Americans are there in spite of the fact that the Iraqis, by an \nalmost 70 percent margin, 69 percent to be exact, say we are doing more \nharm than good; they want us out of there.\n  The Prime Minister of Iraq said 3 days ago that he could do fine \nwithout us. Anytime we want to leave, his security would take over.\n  Now, wake up America? America is awake. They understand very clearly \nwe have a situation where we have a President that will be in office \nonly another 17 months, and they want the war to end before he leaves \noffice. They want to change the course in Iraq which has caused the \ndeaths of almost 3,700 Americans, the wounding of tens of thousands of \nAmericans, cost us over half a trillion dollars.\n  That is what Americans want. They are awake.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 4 Leg.]\n\n     Alexander\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Sessions\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to direct the Sergeant at Arms to \nrequest the attendance of absent Senators. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our Democratic friends thought they \nwere going to teach Republicans a lesson today on how to proceed in \nIraq. Instead, Americans got an object lesson on why Democrats have \nfailed to accomplish any of their goals over the last 7 months.\n  As to this fanciful notion that we have never had 60-vote thresholds \non votes, Democrats agreed just this year to 60-vote thresholds on at \nleast five Iraq-related votes: the Reid sense of the Congress on Iraq, \nthe Murray sense of the Congress on Iraq, the Gregg sense of the \nCongress on Iraq, the Hagel amendment to H.R. 1585 relating to \ndeployment time, and the Graham amendment to H.R. 1585 relating to \ndeployment time--at least five Iraq votes that have been subject to 60 \nvotes.\n  Now, Republicans have repeatedly offered Democrats an opportunity to \nhave a vote on the Levin amendment according to the traditional 60-vote \nthreshold. Democrats themselves have insisted on 60-vote thresholds for \njudges, for example. We could have had the vote this morning and moved \non to other business, like finishing this very important underlying \nbill and getting the men and women in the military what they need and \ndeserve.\n  What is at stake, Mr. President? Iraq's Foreign Minister, Hoshyar \nZebari, recently told reporters:\n\n       The dangers could be a civil war, dividing the country, \n     regional wars, and the collapse of the state.\n\n  The same sentiment has been echoed recently by political figures from \nthe Sunni Arab community, which had been the least supportive of the \nU.S. presence after the collapse of Saddam's Sunni-dominated \ngovernment.\n  Foreign Minister Zebari has also credited multinational forces for \nkeeping Turkey from occupying northern Iraq. This is what he recently \nhad to say:\n\n       Tomorrow, another country will set its sights on Iraq--\n     Iran, Syria, and others have certain interests, ambitions, \n     and interferences. Ironically, it is this presence that is \n     preserving Iraq's unity; this deterrent is preventing the \n     outbreak of an all-out sectarian civil war, and perhaps \n     regional wars as well.\n\n  Now, the National Intelligence Estimate released today said al-Qaida \nwill ``leverage the contacts and capabilities of al-Qaida in Iraq, its \nmost visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have \nexpressed a desire to attack us here in the United States.''\n  Yesterday, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Kimoon, warned that an \nabrupt withdrawal may, ``lead to a further deterioration of the \nsituation in Iraq.''\n  Now, what do the terrorists themselves say? What do they say, the \nterrorists themselves?\n  The Islamic State of Iraq announced during our last debate in April \nthat certain members of Congress had declared the War in Iraq hopeless.\n  Those are the words of the terrorists themselves. And here is Osama \nbin Laden himself, quoted from an Al Jazeera broadcast last April. This \nis what Osama bin Laden said:\n\n       The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad, the seat of the \n     caliphate rule. They keep reiterating success in Baghdad will \n     be success for the U.S., failure in Iraq the failure of the \n     U.S. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all of their \n     wars and the beginning to the receding of their Zionist-\n     Crusader tide against us.\n\n  That is from the lips of Osama bin Laden.\n  Now, our Democratic friends have tried to have it both ways on Iraq \nfor too long. They voted to send General Petraeus to Iraq by a \nunanimous vote, even as many of them undercut his mission and the \nmorale of our troops by declaring it a failure. They voted to fund that \nmission even after working for more than 3 months to undercut it \nthrough legislation that would render it impossible to carry out. And \nnow they have taken the unprecedented step of hijacking a Defense \nauthorization bill to undercut the framework they agreed to when they \nfunded the mission back in May.\n  So let's take a look, my friends and colleagues, at what we agreed to \nback in May. The conference report that 80 Senators voted for in May \nrequired a benchmarks report in July and a report from General Petraeus \nand Ambassador Crocker in September.\n  We chose July for the benchmarks report because the Baghdad Security \nPlan would be fully manned, and we wanted the Iraqi Government to know \nwe expected their cooperation and sacrifice in exchange for ours. We \nchose September because that is when General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker planned to give the President an update on the \ncounterinsurgency plan currently underway. We thought it reasonable \nthat we get the same assessment to form an appropriate legislative \nresponse.\n  The Congress decided in May that 1 month of a fully manned surge was \ninsufficient to call the Petraeus plan a failure. We wrote that \ndecision into law. Since May, we have learned that progress is mixed. \nMany of the military tasks assigned have been achieved, and we have not \nseen sufficient progress on the political benchmarks. Some of our \ncolleagues have refrained from calling for a change in strategy until \nthey hear what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say in \nSeptember. Actually, there is really no good argument that Ambassador \nCrocker and General Petraeus deserve an opportunity to be heard when \nthese significant reports come out in September.\n  So I would ask our colleagues on the other side to think of the \ntangle we are in. Republicans have asked repeatedly to move up the \ncloture vote on the Levin troop withdrawal amendment. They have blocked \nus every time because they prefer the theater of the all-nighter. We \nwere elected to legislate, not to strut across a stage. This isn't \nHollywood. This is real life here in the Senate. Much depends on how we \nconduct ourselves right here and how we conduct ourselves in this \ndebate.\n  We have heard the warnings from people who know the dangers that lurk \nin Iraq, and now I have a warning of my own to my colleagues on the \nother side. Our commanders, our troops, and the millions of brave men \nand women who have stood with us in Iraq and who live in danger of the \ncreeping prospect of precipitous withdrawal, deserve a lot better than \nthey are getting in this debate. They deserve our resolve and, at the \nvery least, they deserve us to keep the pledge we made as recently as \nlast May.\n  It is time to put an end to this charade. The stakes are entirely too \nhigh.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I sat here for the last hour or so and \nlistened to the discussion, and what one concludes is that, once again, \nwe are locked in a debate about the future of Iraq. I think many people \nwatching this debate listen and think: Does this solve anything?\n  But in many ways, thanks to the courage of a few Senators on the \nother side of the aisle, the debate has undergone a major shift in the \npast few weeks. We are no longer simply asking whether we should change \ncourse, it is clear today that a majority in this body believe we must \nchange course. Today, a majority of the Senate sees that the surge is \nnot working, and a majority believes there has been no progress on \npolitical reconciliation.\n  The question I hear repeated is: Do we change course now or do we \nwait until September? I have heard distinguished Members of this body \nsay: Why not wait until September? I believe the answer is clear. When \nyou know things are moving in the wrong direction, why wait to act? And \na growing majority in the Senate agrees.\n  While there are over 50-plus votes to support this view, there \ndoesn't appear to be the 60 votes needed to bring the debate to a \nclose, and there still are not the 67 votes needed to overcome a \nPresidential veto. So those of us who believe we need to change course, \nand\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\nneed to change course now, have no option other than to press for a \nvote until we prevail.\n  The good news is that this debate may slowly be moving away from the \npartisan bickering and toward a bipartisan way out of Iraq. A growing \nnumber of well-respected Republicans have made it clear that they \nbelieve the President's current strategy is not sustainable. This \nincludes Senators Warner and Lugar, two of the most distinguished \nSenators in this body, who have introduced an amendment calling on the \nPresident to develop a plan to transition the mission, and \npotentially--potentially--draw down our troops.\n  This includes Senators Hagel, Smith, and Snowe, who have cosponsored \nthe Levin-Reed amendment calling for a binding timetable to redeploy \nour troops.\n  This includes Senator Voinovich, who, according to reports, has \ninformed the White House that the only way to salvage the President's \nlegacy is to begin moving out of Iraq.\n  And this includes Senators Domenici, Collins, Alexander, Bennett, \nGregg, and Sununu, who have embraced legislation to implement the Iraq \nStudy Group's recommendations.\n  These Senators are to be commended for their courage, and I believe \nthe ranks will only continue to grow as time goes by. Why? Because \ndespite repeated predictions that security and stability in Iraq are \njust around the corner, this has proved illusory. The security \nsituation has not improved. There has been no progress toward political \nreconciliation. None.\n  Simply put: Violence in Iraq continues unabated, and we have heard it \nsaid on the floor over and over again, just in the past few days: 25 \npeople killed Sunday, attacks across Baghdad, 10 killed in a car bomb \nblast in a busy commercial area, a triple bombing attack in Kirkuk \nkilling 85 yesterday, wounding 183. And within hours of that attack, \nseveral men in Iraqi military uniforms attacked a Shia village in \nDiyala fatally shooting 28 men, women, and children.\n  This is why we need a change in course. And these are not isolated \nincidents. They are not the exception. They are the norm, day in, day \nout. Every day there is more--more bombings, more shootings, more IEDs, \nmore kidnappings, more death squads.\n  Has the surge led to a reduction in violence? No. The news continues. \nWe also heard last week of a firefight between U.S. forces and Iraqi \npolice.\n  This cannot be the right direction. The surge wasn't supposed to be a \nsilver bullet, but it was supposed to give the Iraqi Government the \nspace and stability needed to come to a political accommodation. But \nhas this happened? The answer has to be no. Is this likely to happen in \nthe next 55 days? The answer is no.\n  In fact, the Iraqi Parliament will be taking a month-long vacation \nduring this critical period. That is 30 out of the 55 days.\n  But of greatest concern is the fact that there has been little, if \nany, progress in the political arena. Even by the administration's \naccount, the Iraqi Government hasn't made progress in meeting the \nbenchmarks. You have heard this, and there are two more reports due on \nbenchmarks, so we will hear more of the same.\n  If you talk about benchmarks, to me the most critical has always been \ndebaathification--a terrible mistake made by us and now supported to \ncontinue by Ahmed Chalabi to prevent former Baathists from working. You \ncan never have a united Iraq as long as you have debaathification on a \nlevel that even today still exists. The absence of holding provincial \nelections, passing an oil revenue sharing law, ensuring that \nauthorities are not undermining members of the Iraqi security forces, \nensuring that the Iraqi security forces provide evenhanded enforcement \nof the law--simple things not done.\n  There is a misbegotten belief that we can turn Iraq into a \ndemocracy--a country with little infrastructure for democracy, a \ngovernment where ministers don't show up, where parliamentarians don't \narrive, where long vacations are taken in the middle of war and strife. \nAt the same time, the Pentagon reported last week that there has been a \nslight reduction in the number of Iraqi security force units capable of \nindependent operations. So there is even deterioration on that front.\n  Yet we are told to wait. Something good might happen. So what should \nwe do? Rather than wait another 8 weeks, I think we should act now. I \nthink the Senate should approve the Levin-Reed amendment, which, to \ndate, is the only amendment, as the majority leader has stated so \noften, with teeth--in 120 days redeployment begins, and out by April \n30th of next year. It is clear, it is definitive, and it has the \nsupport of a majority of this body.\n  No State has suffered more than California from this war. We have \nnearly 400 dead and 3,000 wounded; 400 dead, 400 young men and women \ndead from the State. I hear some States say they have had five or six. \nWe have had 400 people killed in this war. It is clear we must change \ncourse, but the President and some in this body say, again, we should \nwait.\n  Let me tell you why we should not wait. Here is what we will lose in \n8 weeks, if current trends continue. Hundreds more U.S. troops dead. At \nthis present rate, that is 200 more dead. More than 1,000 U.S. troops \ninjured. Actually, if the present rate continues, 1,200 to 1,500 more. \nSeveral thousand more Iraqi civilians killed. At the present rate, \n4,000 to 6,000 by waiting. Nearly 100,000 more Iraqi civilians \ndisplaced and another $20 billion spent.\n  I ask you, is this an acceptable cost of waiting? It is not to me. \nSecretary Gates and other administration officials made it clear in \nJanuary we should know in a matter of months if the surge was working. \nHere it is July. It is very clear the surge is not working. Every day \nthere are more bombings. If you measure things in real terms, that kill \npeople--there are more bombings, more killings, more IEDs, more \nviolence. Casualties have jumped since the surge began. As I said, we \nare now losing 100 of our people every month. The 331 troops killed \nduring April, May, and June is the highest 3-month total since the war \nbegan 4\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  How is this a sign of progress? Tell me how is it a sign of progress, \nwhen more people are killed, more displaced, Iraqis turn up in the \nmorgue by the dozens every day? Because if this trend continues, 2007 \nwill be the deadliest for our troops since this war began. Why wait to \nact?\n  Waiting is not going to change the political situation either. Will \nwe see the Iraqi Government pass an oil revenue-sharing law by \nSeptember? Does anyone believe that? I don't think so.\n  Will we see reform of the debaathification system by September? I \ndon't think so.\n  Will we see provincial elections or an Iraqi security force that is \nfree from sectarian influence? I don't think so. As a matter of fact, \nthe answer to all these questions is no. We haven't seen movement on \nthe political front in the past 7 months, so why do we believe it will \nhappen in the next 2 months? This is especially true, given that the \nIraqi Parliament is taking a month off in August.\n  The surge was not supposed to be this silver bullet. It was supposed \nto give the Iraqi Government the space, the stability needed to come to \na political solution. But as I say, this has not happened. As \nimportant, moving out of Iraq would open the door to a reevaluation of \nour national security interests in the region.\n  I happened to listen to Senator Lugar on the floor in what I think \nwas one of the most eloquent speeches I have heard. Let me quote from \nhim.\n\n       Our course in Iraq has lost contact with our vital national \n     security interests in the Middle East and beyond. Our \n     continuing absorption with military activities in Iraq is \n     limiting our diplomatic assertiveness there and elsewhere in \n     the world.\n\n  We know our Nation faces major challenges and the primary focus on \nIraq has allowed these problems to fester. It has sapped our ability to \nact elsewhere, both by crippling our military's readiness and by \ndraining our soft power around the world. Our challenges today, our \nreal national interests, include: preventing terrorists from gaining \nsafe haven in Pakistan and Afghanistan; preventing the violence in Iraq \nfrom spreading throughout the Middle East, Afghanistan, and the cities \nof Europe; stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons \ntechnologies and strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. \nThis is the national interest of this country.\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n  Containing Iran and compelling it to abandon its uranium enrichment \nprogram and pursuing a sustained and robust diplomacy aimed at \nachieving Israeli-Palestinian peace--I am delighted the President has \ntaken on this as a major initiative with priority and that the \nSecretary of State will be in charge of this effort.\n  Finally, improving the image of the United States and repairing the \ndamage done to our credibility around the world.\n  Does anyone believe, truly, this war has gained us respect in the \ncouncil of world nations? Does anyone believe that? Because if they do, \nthey are smoking something. Because it has not. There has never been a \ntime when America has less credibility abroad than today.\n  Does anybody believe this war is quelling a new generation of \nterrorists? It is doing exactly opposite.\n  Peter Bergen, whose books I have read, whose statements I follow, \nsaid the other day on CNN that he estimates terrorists have increased \nsevenfold, that is 700 percent, since the war in Iraq began. Is this \nour interest? Is our interest to encourage every madrasah all \nthroughout the Arab and Islamic world to essentially preach to create a \nnew generation of terrorists? That is what is happening right now and \nwe are not addressing it. We are not spending the money, the $10 \nbillion a month to see that there are normal schools in these countries \nthat teach youngsters how to become educated, to accept a place of \neconomic upward mobility in what is a modern world. No. Instead, the \nsores fester and the terrorists grow. That is the reason that, as far \nas air traffic is concerned, we are in orange alert today.\n  The simple truth is that none of these initiatives can be pursued \nadequately so long as we are bogged down in Iraq. Iraq dominates our \nNation's psyche, it dominates our Nation's pocketbook, and it dominates \nin the loss of our men and women.\n  I think each deserves the continuous attention of this \nadministration, and the longer we wait to begin a redeployment of our \ntroops, the longer we delay the day of reckoning, the longer we refuse \nto take the diplomatic steps that are necessary to engage with Syria, \nto engage with Iran, the harder it is going to be to achieve a \nsuccessful outcome. I believe this.\n\n  I believe the time has come to change course. Waiting is not going to \nchange the facts on the ground. Oh, I wished I believed that. I wish I \ncould say, in 2 months, we are not going to lose 200 men and women; in \n2 months, 4,000 or 5,000 additional Iraqis will not be killed; 100,000 \nadditional Iraqis are not going to be displaced, and we are not going \nto spend another $20 billion of our treasure. But I cannot.\n  In total, we have lost more than 3,600 of our brave men and women, \nalmost 500 since this surge began 5 months ago. Nearly 27,000 have \nsuffered injuries, and many of these injuries are more serious than \nanything we have ever seen in the history of veterans' care, people who \nwill require care for the rest of their lives.\n  We lose 100 of our people every month. So why wait to act? The most \nrecent Pentagon quarterly report on Iraq concluded that the ``aggregate \nlevel of violence'' in Iraq has remained ``unchanged''--unchanged. Five \nmonths into the surge, the level of violence in Iraq, according to the \nrecent Pentagon report, is unchanged, and CIA analyst Tim Fingar \ntestified to Congress last week the violence in Iraq has not yet been \nreduced significantly.\n  At the same time, even as we have appropriated $450 billion for this \nwar, spending has increased to $10 billion a month; Armed Forces are \nstretched thin, equipment is worn, recruiting is down, and nobody knows \nwhat happens to the military come April when deployments cannot be met. \nSo why wait to act?\n  We are going to be paying the costs of this war for decades. Yet this \nPresident has asked for more time. Waiting another 2 months will not \nchange anything. It will be more of the same. As has been said on this \nfloor tonight a myriad of times, but I must echo it: The President \nshows no inclination to listen to a majority of the Senate, to the \nAmerican people or to the House of Representatives. He has provided no \nexit strategy, no plan to begin redeploying our troops. Come September, \nthere is no reason to believe anything will have changed. Why wait to \nact?\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will refrain. It is not \nappropriate to express approval or disapproval in the galleries.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, with this political stunt tonight, the \nSenate has reached the approximate level of the Iraqi Parliament in \ndealing with the war on Iraq. There will be no more votes for a fixed \ndeadline for withdrawal from Iraq at 3 a.m. than there would be at 3 \np.m. This demeans and trivializes the foremost issue facing our \ncountry. It does not show the proper respect for the men and women who \nhave been fighting there and their families.\n  Here we are, issuing milestones, talking about benchmarks to an \ninfant democracy on the other side of the world, issuing reports and \nreport cards about how well they are doing on what we have told them to \ndo, talking to them about why they haven't passed oil sharing and \ndebaathification and why they have not had more elections, and we \ncannot come up, ourselves, with a consensus about what we are doing in \nIraq.\n  Here we are, the oldest democracy in the world, alleging ourselves--\nthe Senate--to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, and we \nare lecturing Iraq, a new democracy, an infant democracy. We are \nlecturing them for not coming up with a consensus when we can't come up \nwith one ourselves.\n  I think it is important for the American people to know it is not \nnecessarily that way in the Senate. I began this day at 8 a.m. at a \nbreakfast, as I did last week, as I did the week before, which we call \nour bipartisan breakfast. This morning we had about a dozen Republicans \nand Democrats around the table--only Senators. Last week, we had two \ndozen around a table. Our subject was Iraq and the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I will not say any more about what was discussed because one of the \nbenefits of this breakfast is it is the only time during the week, \nexcept for our prayer breakfast on Wednesday, when we are not in team \nmeetings, when there is not a group somewhere plotting what this side \nwill do to that side or what that side will do to this side. It is \namazing what sort of discussion we can have when we sit down around \nthat sort of table. We have many of the same principles who have talked \ntonight on the Senate floor, people who have strongly held views and \nthey are different views and they were stated clearly and explicitly \nand each of us respected those views. We heard them.\n  But at least as strong as the difference of opinion in that \nbipartisan breakfast--as it is each week when we talk--was the feeling \nthat our main job was, as soon as we could, to come to some sort of \nconsensus about where we go from here. Because the single most \nimportant thing we can do as a government, other than fund our troops, \nis to send them a clear signal that we agree on why we sent them there \nto fight and perhaps be wounded and perhaps to die and we failed in \nthat responsibility. To compound it, we are in the midst of a political \nstunt which does not do anything to encourage us toward a consensus.\n  In my remarks tonight, rather than heap oil on the fire, what I would \nlike to do is talk for a moment about how we could come to that \nconsensus and about both Democrats and Republicans in this body who are \nworking that way. Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from California, \nmentioned a number of Senators who do that. My experience with Members \nof this body began when I came to work here for the first time 40 years \nago this year as a very junior aide. I have only been a Member of the \nbody for 4 years. My experience is that most of us prefer to conduct \nourselves like grownups, to not engage in petty kindergarten games, to \nnot have partisan efforts where we taunt one another and try to put one \nanother at a disadvantage but actually recognize we are here to look at \nbig, difficult issues and to see if we can come up with a solution for \none.\n  If there is such an issue that demands such a solution, it is \nAmerica's role in Iraq. How would the Senate--if I am right that most \nof us would like\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nto have that kind of result--how would we go about working toward \nconsensus, when we obviously have strongly held different views? For \nexample, Senator Levin and Senator Reed, two of the most senior Members \nof our body--one a distinguished graduate of West Point, one who has \nserved as chairman or ranking member of the Armed Services Committee \nfor a long time--they strongly believe, as the Senator from California \nbelieves, that unless the Congress imposes upon the President a fixed \ndeadline for withdrawal, that we will not have any motion in that \ndirection.\n\n  I respect that. I disagree with that. I believe that interferes with \nthe constitutional prerogatives of the President. I do not believe it \nis practical in a time of war to say that a group of legislators, 100 \ngenerals here in this body, can guess a year out, even if that is the \ndirection we want to go, exactly how to do it and exactly when to do \nthat. That is why we have a Commander in Chief.\n  The Founders didn't pick this particular President, but they picked a \nPresident, a Chief Executive, with that responsibility. I respect that. \nThat is of a difference of opinion. So we have profound and real and \nhonest differences of opinion and they are reflected all the way across \nour country.\n  I hear them in Tennessee. The Presiding Officer hears them in his \nState. We hear them everywhere, and we feel them especially strongly \nbecause so many of our men and women have been there. In my State, \n10,000 members of the National Guard and the Reserves have been to Iraq \nand Afghanistan; almost all of them more than once.\n  We think of General Petraeus as almost a hometown boy because he \ncommanded the 101st Airborne Division. When he was there as its \ncommander, he was accidentally shot through the heart in a training \nexercise. His life was saved, when he went to Vanderbilt Hospital, by \nnone other than Bill Frist, our former majority leader, who was then a \nheart surgeon at Vanderbilt University. So we have unusual respect for \nGeneral Petraeus.\n  We are the ``Volunteer State.'' We have sent more men and women to \nfight, we think, than almost any State, and we instinctively have great \nrespect for the President of the United States.\n  That is where we start in our State. But, still, there are a great \nmany Tennesseans who say to me it is time for a new strategy in Iraq. \nIt is time for a change. We have helped depose Saddam Hussein. We have \nhelped Iraq have an opportunity to have a democratic government. We \nhave stayed a long time to help build their security. But now it is \ntime for us to agree on a different strategy.\n  How would a country and how would a body such as the Senate go about \nthat? One way to do it might be to pick 10 people from outside the \nSenate, 10 of the most distinguished Americans, and say to them: We are \nstuck here. We have a problem. The country has a problem. We need a \nshift of direction. We have a Senate that is divided, a President who \nis insisting on his constitutional prerogatives, and we have men and \nwomen fighting and dying in Iraq--what do we do? Ten Americans, let's \npick five Democrats and five Republicans, to give it a little bit more \nprestige.\n  That happened last year. Frank Wolf, a Representative from Virginia; \nJohn Warner, Senator from this body, was a part of this as well--they \ncreated something called the Iraq Study Group. The Iraq Study Group was \ncochaired by Jim Baker, the former Secretary of State for President \nBush, and by Lee Hamilton, the former Democratic chairman of the House \nForeign Affairs Committee. There were 10 prestigious Americans who \nserved on the Iraq Study Group--if all of us were to put in a hat the \nnames of Americans who might be good members of such a commission to \nhelp us unravel this problem, the 10 who were picked would come out of \nthat hat pretty fast, in pretty good order, with a lot of Members on \nboth sides of the aisle suggesting them.\n\n  For example, Larry Eagleburger, the former Secretary of State for the \nfirst President Bush; Vernon Jordan, the former president of the \nNational Urban League and a very close associate of former President \nClinton; Ed Meese, President Reagan's Attorney General; Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, who was the first woman to be appointed to the United \nStates Supreme Court by President Reagan; Leon Panetta, who was \nPresident Clinton's Chief of Staff and who now in California has his \nown institute, the Leon & Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy in \nMonterey, CA; Chuck Robb, our former colleague, married to Lynda Bird \nJohnson. We have been thinking about that family these past 2 weeks \nwith Lady Bird's death; Chuck Robb, a former marine, former Senator, a \nmember of that panel; Allen Simpson, who had the No. 2 position right \nover here, a whip in the Senate from Wyoming; and, at one point, Robert \nGates, the current Secretary of Defense, was a member of this panel \nbefore he had to step aside when he went to the administration.\n  So those 10 people--five Democrats, five Republicans. It would be \nhard to improve on that.\n  Then, let's say you said to this group of 10: This is an especially \ndifficult problem. The Senate is fractured, the President is insisting \non his prerogative, and the country is divided and tired, and we need a \nsolution. So what we need for you to do, commissioners, is not come \nback with a majority vote, not come back with a filibuster, not come \nback with an all-night political stunt, but come back with a unanimous \nset of recommendations of where we go from here in Iraq, you five \nDemocrats, you five Republicans with years of experience.\n  That is precisely what they did in December of last year, after 9 or \n10 meetings all over America, and meetings in Iraq, with a \ndistinguished staff that consisted of an honor roll list of generals \nand experts. They visited with former President Clinton, former Vice \nPresident Mondale, former Secretary of State Albright, former Secretary \nof State Henry Kissinger, Warren Christopher, they visited with Colin \nPowell and George Shultz, Tony Lake, General Scowcroft, to ask about \neverybody whose judgment one would hope they would ask, and they came \nup with 79 recommendations in December, and they released it to the \npublic.\n  They unanimously agreed in 9 months about what to do in Iraq. They \nalso did not pull any punches. They said in December, even though this \nwas chaired by Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton, they said: The situation in \nIraq is ``grave and deteriorating.'' They said there is no magic \nbullet. But they did unanimously agree, unlike the Levin-Reed \namendment, that we did not need a fixed deadline. They unanimously \nagreed that troop deployments should be subject to conditions on the \nground.\n  So what did they recommend? Well, in a few minutes I cannot summarize \n79 recommendations, but I can boil it down to three points. First, we \nshould move our troops from a combat mission to a support, equipping, \nand training mission as soon as we honorably can. They said, as a goal, \nthat should happen in about a year, which then would have been the \nfirst quarter of 2008. Now, some time has gone past since then. But \nthey said in about a year. The practical effect of that would have been \nto remove about half our combat forces--to reduce the number of \nAmerican forces in Iraq by about half.\n  And, rather than subject that goal of reducing troops to a fixed \ndeadline, as the Levin-Reed amendment says, they said it should be \nsubject to developments on the ground, which is practical in a time of \nwar, and respects the Commander in Chief's constitutional prerogative.\n  They said, No. 2: We should have a long-term interest in Iraq. It \nshould be a limited interest, but there should be sufficient troops to \nhelp make certain that in that new mission we deal with that interest. \nThey listed some of the things the troops would be expected to do who \nstayed: guard the Embassy, search and rescue, intelligence, special \nforces to go after al-Qaida--the point being, even though our troops \nhave a different mission, out of a combat role into a support, \nequipping, and training mission, there would be enough of them there to \nsend a message to the Middle East and the rest of the world: Stay out \nof Iraq. Give Iraq a chance to succeed, while also protecting U.S. \nforces that remained there. That was the second point.\n  The third point was step up. Step up the political and diplomatic \nefforts in the region by a significant amount, including talking with \neverybody in the region, to try to bring a result in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n  So those are the three points. One, move out of the combat mission to \nthe support, equipping, and training mission over about a year, without \na deadline; two, a long-term but limited interest in Iraq, with some \nspecifics; and, three, step up political and diplomatic efforts. Plus, \nthe Iraq Study Group emphasized that we would still have a considerable \npresence in the region in Qatar and Kuwait and in Bahrain. So that is \nwhat the Iraq Study Group said.\n  What happened with the Iraq Study Group report? Well, I was very \ndisappointed by the reaction to the report, especially when I saw that \nthe recommendations were unanimous. When I first saw who were the \ndistinguished members of that panel, I was convinced that at the State \nof the Union Address, President Bush would seat them in the gallery, \nand at the appropriate time, as Presidents often do, he would say: \nThere they are, from the Reagan administration, from the Clinton \nadministration, from my father's administration, and they have \nunanimously agreed on where we go from here in Iraq. And it is not \nexactly my proposal, it is their proposal, but because it is important \nto our troops and to our country and to the world that we move forward \nin a unified way, I accept their recommendations. I will develop a plan \nbased upon their report. I ask you and the Congress to accept it.\n\n  I think there is a good chance that the Congress would accept such a \nplan, and an important part of that reason is because even the \nPresident needed someone else to help him develop support for whatever \nproposal he came up with. So that would be the first thing I think we \nwould do if we were trying to solve this problem: go ask 10 of the most \ndistinguished Americans of both parties to tell us what to do in \nspecific recommendations, and do it unanimously.\n  Now, what is the second thing we would do? Well, I think we would \ncome to this body and say: Every time we turn around there is a \npolitical stunt going on. Someone has had an early morning meeting and \ndecided we are going to do this to the Republicans, and then some \nRepublicans get excited, and they have an early morning meeting and \nsay: We are going to do this to the Democrats. And you do not have the \nkind of discussion that these 10 Americans had or the kind we have in \nour bipartisan breakfasts.\n  But the second thing that needs to be done to move us in a consensus \non where we go from here in Iraq would be to find some Senator in this \nbody who would say: We are going to accept this Iraq Study Group \nreport, and we are going to ask that the President agree to it and \ndevelop a plan based upon it and report to us on it in 90 days.\n  That is precisely what Senator Salazar did with his legislation. \nAfter saying in January that I was disappointed the President did not \nadopt the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, I made a speech on \nthe floor in March. I find that sometimes you have to say things more \nthan once in order to have anybody pay attention.\n  I said: Why didn't the President, in March, take the Iraq Study Group \ndown off the shelf and use it for something other than a book end? And \nthen I made another speech to that effect, and Senator Pryor of \nArkansas came by to see me and said: We need to do something about \nthis. We need to find a way to work together rather than to continue to \nhave Democratic and Republican votes on Iraq.\n  Then Senator Salazar called me and said: I have been working with \nSecretary Baker, and with Lee Hamilton and their staffs. I put together \nlegislation that accurately reflects the recommendations of the Iraq \nStudy Group. And it simply adopts those recommendations as our law. If \nthe President agrees to it, he is asked to develop a comprehensive plan \nbased on those recommendations.\n  Since that time, there are now 14 of us in the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle who are cosponsors of that idea. Senator Salazar is the \nleader. He has done a terrific job on that. He is a Democrat from \nColorado. In addition to my cosponsorship, we have been joined by Mark \nPryor, a Democrat from Arkansas; Bob Bennett, a Republican from Utah; \nRobert Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania; Judd Gregg, a Republican \nfrom New Hampshire; Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Arkansas; John \nSununu, a Republican from New Hampshire; Susan Collins, a Republican \nfrom Maine; Pete Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico; Bill Nelson, a \nDemocrat from Florida; Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana; Claire \nMcCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri; and Kent Conrad, a Democrat from \nNorth Dakota.\n  My guess is that if the Democratic Senate leadership would back off a \nlittle bit, if the President would be more flexible, there are probably \n60 votes coming from both sides of the aisle for the Baker-Hamilton \nreport, and if that should be adopted by the Congress, we can move \nforward, which brings me to my final point.\n  What would be the third step in having a bipartisan consensus for our \ncountry that would say to our troops and the world: We agree on why you \nare there, and we support that mission? It would be for the President \nto embrace the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. The President \nof the United States does not want to do that. I respect that. He has \nan absolute constitutional right to say: Our Framers created the \nExecutive, I am the Commander in Chief, we cannot have 100 generals, I \nwill develop the plan, and I will command the troops. That is my job.\n  He is right about that, except he has another part to his job. George \nReedy, who was the Press Secretary to former President Lyndon Johnson, \nwrote a book called, ``Twilight of the Presidency.'' In it he defined \nthe President of the United States. He said, No. 1, his job is to see \nan urgent need; No. 2, to develop a strategy to meet the need; and No. \n3 is to persuade at least half of the people that he is right.\n  I do not believe that President Bush, even if he is right in \nSeptember, is likely to be able to persuade enough people to support \nhis strategy to be able to sustain the strategy. Let me say that again. \nEven if he is right in September, even if he takes many parts of the \nBaker-Hamilton group and announces it as his strategy, at this stage in \nour history, I do not believe he can persuade enough Americans to \nsupport his strategy to sustain the strategy.\n  I believe this strategy should be sustained. So how does he do that? \nThe way he does that is to embrace those who wrote this and those who \nsupport this so that it is not just his strategy, so that it is our \nstrategy, so that he can say to the troops in the Middle East, and to \nthe rest of the Middle East, and to the world: The Congress and I have \ncome together around a set of principles. I am developing a plan on \nthose principles. And not everyone agrees, but a consensus of us agree, \nwhich is why I would say to the Democratic leader, with respect, I do \nnot mind requiring 60 votes on the Iraq issues. We need a consensus. We \ndo not want to have an Iraq policy that passes by 51 to 49. We need a \nconsensus. I believe we can have it.\n  There are some who say adopting the Iraq Study Group principles, the \nSalazar-Alexander legislation, is toothless. I respectfully disagree. \nMy grandfather was a railroad engineer, a Santa Fe railroad engineer. \nHe lived in Newton, KS, and his job was to drive the big locomotives \nonto the roundtable it was called. And that was how you turned a \nlocomotive around. A locomotive might be about as hard to turn around \nas a country in the middle of a war. But that is what my grandfather \ndid. He turned that locomotive around. And it was turned around. They \nput it on a different track and off it went in a different direction.\n\n  If we and the President were to agree on the recommendations of the \nIraq Study Group, it would be just like my grandfather putting that big \nlocomotive on the roundtable in Newton, KS. It would be turned around \nand sent down a different track. And, for now, at least, those on the \nother side would pick another engineer. But the engineer cannot do much \nabout that track once he is on it. It would be headed down the track, \nthe world would know it, and in good faith we could work together.\n  When I was an impatient young man working in the White House 40 years \nago, a wise man named Bruce Harlow said to me: Lamar, just remember \nthat here--he meant the White House--just a little tilt makes big waves \nout there.\n  If this Congress and this President adopted together the Iraq Study \nGroup recommendations this week, that\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\nwould make big waves out there, and that would be a new consensus for \nour country.\n  Some said: Well, the Iraq Study Group is a little stale. It is out of \ndate. It was done in December.\n  Lee Hamilton, the Democratic cochairman said: No. He said: We said in \nDecember the situation was grave and deteriorating. It still is. We \nsaid in December we need to move from a combat mission to support, \nequipping, and training. We still do. This week he said: In addition, \nwe need to have a long-term limited role in Iraq. And we still do. And \nfinally he said: We need to step up our diplomatic and political \nefforts in Iraq, and we still do.\n  To the President, I would say with the greatest respect, because he \nis a member of my own party, and I have talked with him about this \nbefore, I would say: Mr. President, I do respect your prerogative. I \nknow you can draw the plan up. I know you want to sit down first with \nGeneral Petraeus, whom we all respect and whom I especially do, as a \nfriend, because he spent so much time in Tennessee. But the Salazar-\nAlexander legislation has no chance of taking effect until September. \nAnd all it asks you to do is to draw up a comprehensive plan based upon \nthe recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. The first person you sit \ndown with can be General Petraeus.\n  And I would ask the President whether it be better for him to ignore \nthe Iraq Study Group and come up with his own plan, or would it be \nbetter for him to come to the Congress and say: Congress, I will adopt \nthese. Why don't you adopt these and let's send our troops a message \nthat we are united in what they are fighting for?\n  So there are 14 of us, 8 Democrats, 6 Republicans at this point, who \nsupport and cosponsor the Iraq Study Group. But I believe there are \nmany more of us who could be comfortable with it, who could vote for \nit, even if it is not our first choice.\n  So I regret this all-night political stunt, but I respect this body. \nI see it every week in those bipartisan breakfasts, talking like the \npeople of this country wish we always would when confronted by a major \nissue. I salute Senators Salazar and Pryor and those on that side, and \nSenator Gregg, Senator Bennett, Senator Collins, and those on this side \nwho are working together to fix that. I hope more of our colleagues \nwill join us soon.\n  The President and the Congress could agree on the Baker-Hamilton \nrecommendations, and we would say to our troops: We not only will fund \nyou, but we can now also say to you and to the Middle East that we \nagree on your mission, on why you are fighting, and why you are being \nwounded, and why you are dying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see that many of my colleagues have \ncome to the floor, so I will try to be brief in my remarks. But I would \nlike to assure my good friend from Tennessee that this is not a stunt. \nThis is a very strong and clear and unwavering statement tonight that \nthe President and the Republican leadership are leading this country in \nthe wrong direction, and now is the time to change it.\n  I have not been to Hollywood too many times, but I have been there \nenough to know that there is a lot of glitter, fountains, big lights. I \ndo not see any fountains or glitter on the floor of the Senate. I see \nhard-working Senators who are here to debate the most important issue.\n  And for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to question our \nintentions is beneath the dignity of this body. Let me repeat again for \nthe Senator from Tennessee, to the Senator from Kentucky, and all of my \nfriends: This is not a stunt. This is an exercise in reality. And this \nis not Hollywood, this is the Senate, and this is exactly what people \nin the Senate do, debate.\n  And what we also like to do is vote. But we are not allowed to vote \nbecause the minority leader has decided that we are not going to have a \nvote. We have a majority of votes to change direction. I would argue \nwith the other side that we are never going to get 80 percent or 90 \npercent of the Senate to move in one direction or another in a \nsituation such as this. It is an impossible barrier to achieve.\n  But we may get a growing number, a majority of Senators who represent \nthe majority of the population in America to say to the President that \nwe want to go in another direction. So tonight is not a stunt. It is a \nstatement saying it is time to allow us to vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the President yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not.\n  I also say to the Senator, I am a cosponsor of the Iraq Study Group \nlegislation by Senator Salazar, on which he worked so hard and so \nhonestly to build bipartisan support. But what happened when the \nPresident gave his State of the Union Address 2 years ago when things \nlooked as though they were not going very well in Iraq? We had more \ndeaths, more violence, and a bipartisan group did come together, some \nof the great minds on this issue. What did the President do? He \ndismissed the document.\n  I am not sure what the Senator from Tennessee thinks, maybe the \nPresident will wake up tomorrow morning and decide to read the report. \nBut he hasn't read it for 2 years. It is not being implemented. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  I don't know how many more commissions we could commission. I don't \nknow how many more experts we could gather. I don't know how many more \nRepublicans and Democrats could come together to explain to this \nPresident it is not working. So I am not sure about creating another \ncommission. We have already had many. He doesn't even read the \nrecommendations. They are right here. Here they are, not implemented \ninto law. But can we vote on this? No, because the minority leader says \nthey don't want to have a vote on these recommendations.\n  I wish to say another thing about the role of the Congress and the \nPresident. I am so tired of hearing the other side say: Why does \nCongress have anything to say about this matter? Maybe because our \nConstitution says we should, maybe because the intelligence reports \nthat are done are not just presented to the President and his military \ngenerals and leaders and war fighters. The intelligence reports are \ngiven to us. There was one delivered this morning I would like to read.\n  Before I read what it says, I wish to read the way it says it.\n\n       Since its formation in 1973, the National Intelligence \n     Council has served as a bridge between the intelligence and \n     policy communities, a source of deep, substantive expertise \n     on critical national security issues, and as a focal point \n     for Intelligence Community collaboration. . . . [It] provides \n     a focal point for policymakers . . .\n\n  That would be me, I am a policymaker. I ran for the job. I am \nelected. I am here to make policy, and I intend to make it.\n\n       . . . Warfighters, and Congressional leaders to task the \n     Intelligence Community for answers--\n\n  We sure need some important questions, such as how to win the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  They don't send this to the President and say: After you finish \nreading it, let us know what you want us to do. They send it to us, and \ntoday they sent us another one.\n  What it said in this report is:\n\n       Al-qa'ida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the Homeland, as its central leadership continues \n     to plan high-impact plots, while pushing others in extremist \n     Sunni communities to mimic its efforts and to supplement its \n     capabilities.\n\n  It is clearly saying, yes, there are some threats and activities in \nSunni areas in Iraq, but there are also Sunni areas around the world. \nAnd so Osama bin Laden is still loose.\n  I brought his picture tonight so I could remind the President what he \nlooks like. He is still on the loose, the leader of al-Qaida. This is \nhis description. He is 6 foot 4 inches to 6 foot 6 inches, \napproximately 160 pounds. He is thin. Occupation unknown. We know now \nwhat he does. His hair is brown. His eyes are brown. His complexion is \nolive. And there is a reward--and thank goodness they let us have a \nvote on Byron Dorgan's amendment because now the reward is $50 million \ninstead of $25 million. Maybe the President will veto that provision. I \ndon't know. But I, frankly, think that was a good idea. Maybe we should \nraise it a little higher. I don't know what Congress is doing \ndiscussing what the reward should be for Osama bin Laden. Clearly, we \nhave nothing to say about this issue. I am glad we voted to increase \nthe reward. I would like to see if we can find him and\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\nkill him. If we would stop spending $500 million a day, $35 million \nbefore breakfast every day in Iraq, maybe we could find him because he \nis not in Baghdad.\n  We, obviously, have disagreements about the way to proceed, but I can \nassure my colleagues this is not a stunt. This is a real debate that is \ntaking place in a real place that is the real Senate of the United \nStates. It is not Hollywood.\n  The President and the Republican leadership have made many mistakes. \nNobody is perfect, and we all make them. But we have to change course. \nWhat we are doing is not working. He is still loose. The estimate today \nsays that al-Qaida is as strong as it was on 9/11. If we are winning \nthe war, I am not sure that 4 years after you engage, if your enemy is \nstronger than it was when you started, that is winning under any \ndefinition. But that is what the Republican leadership continues to \ntell people: despite the mounting casualties, the increased funerals, \nand the tremendous strains on our soldiers and their families coming \nhome, that we are most certainly winning. The American people don't \nbelieve it.\n  Some people are asking to pull out. I am not asking that, but I am \nasking for a change of direction. I brought this picture to the floor \ntoday to remind everybody how we got here in the first place. Saddam \nHussein did not attack the United States, Osama bin Laden did, and he \nis still alive, and now terrorism is around the world in places it was \nnot before we started down this road. If we are not careful, we are \ngoing to spend all our money there, all the American people's patience \nthere, and all their will there and still not find the guy we are \nlooking for and the central intelligence of al-Qaida. I know he is not \nthe only part of al-Qaida, but he is the leader, and we need to find \nhim.\n  So however one feels about the issue, I don't think spending one \nnight on the floor of the Senate, which is not a Hollywood set but the \nreal deal, is too much to ask, since our soldiers have spent every \nnight for 5 years on the battlefield around the world.\n  I will make one more point. I hope that nobody comes to my State or \non the floor and accuses me of not supporting our troops in uniform \nbecause I will have several words for them. Every time we disagree \nabout procedures, the ones who don't agree with the President are \naccused of not supporting our troops. We couldn't support them more.\n\n  So I hope we can get past that reasoning and perhaps we can find a \nbetter consensus. But the place we are going, the direction we are \ngoing is not right. We need to change course, and we need to fight \nsmart, we need to fight tough, we need to go where the enemy is, and we \nneed to protect America.\n  According to this intelligence report that was issued this morning, \nit doesn't look like we are doing that. That is what this debate is \nabout. I look forward to continuing many nights into the future and \ndays ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut begins, can we see about getting a unanimous consent \nagreement relative to some order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will yield to the Senator for the purpose of \npropounding a unanimous consent request but without yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I propose that the Senator from Connecticut go for as \nlong as he might take; that the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, follow \nhim. Does the Senator know who wants to go next on his side? The \nSenator from New Jersey?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from Georgia, \nI understand the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, wishes to speak next in \norder.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Brown would follow Senator Collins and Senator \nIsakson would follow Senator Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. I object. The informal order established was Senator \nAlexander, Senator Landrieu, Senator Lieberman, myself, then a \nRepublican, and then Senator Menendez. I ask unanimous consent that be \nthe order.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I think that is what I said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am sorry, I put Senator Collins ahead \nof Senator Brown and I was wrong. Senator Brown would follow Senator \nLieberman, Senator Collins follows Senator Brown.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Then if my friend from Georgia will allow, I gather \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, will be next.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Following Senator Collins, that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We will figure out where we are at the end of that \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment offered \nby Senator Levin and Senator Reed and to explain why I will vote \nagainst cloture on the amendment tomorrow morning.\n  I think it is important to explain that because my friend from \nLouisiana who spoke before me had behind her a sign that said: Let us \nvote. We may see that sign again. I wish to indicate that we are going \nto have a vote. We are going to have a vote tomorrow morning. And the \nquestion is: Will we sustain what has been a bedrock policy of the \nSenate to require 60 votes for a matter of great importance that comes \nbefore this body, particularly a matter where there is a lot at stake?\n  This amendment offered by my colleagues from Michigan and Rhode \nIsland is a very serious amendment. Some of us believe it would have \ndisastrous consequences for the security of the United States of \nAmerica, for the safety of our troops in Iraq, for the stability of the \nregion, for any hope for democracy in the Middle East, and a better \nfuture for the people of that part of the world than the suicidal death \nand hatred al-Qaida offers them.\n  But you know, I have recollection of times in the Senate hearing the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. He has made, over \nthe years, some compelling arguments for why the Senate has this \nunusual procedure of requiring 60 votes on matters of great importance. \nI am not quoting him directly, but this is consistent with the vision \nof one of the Framers--I believe it was Madison, I am not sure--who \nsaid, if you will, that the Senate is the saucer in which the Congress \nwill cool the coffee. As Senator Byrd said much more to the point, we \nin this Chamber have had for a long time this ability to request 60 \nvotes to pass a matter when there are Members of the Senate--and I am \none in this case--who believe the passage of this matter would have a \nprofoundly negative effect on our country and its security.\n  I know some of my colleagues disagree with me, of course. But I am \nexercising my right within the tradition of the Senate to do what \nsenior colleagues have advised over the years: to stop the passions, \nthe political passions of a moment from sweeping across Congress into \nlaw and altering our future permanently. I have done it on other \nmatters. I have done it on environmental matters, where I think \nsomething proposed will have so adverse an effect on some of the \nnatural wonders that God has given the United States of America that I \nhave said: No, I am going to be part of a group to demand 60 votes \nbecause if I allow this to pass by less, there will be an irreversible \nchange that will occur.\n  With respect to my colleagues who are saying let us vote, we will \nvote. But the question on that vote is will we ask for 60 votes to \nadopt this very significant amendment? I say it is in the best \ntraditions of the Senate to require 60 votes before this amendment is \nadopted.\n  Second, before I get to the merits of the amendment or my opinion \nabout it, I wish to respond to something my friend from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, said about the bipartisan meeting we had this \nmorning, people of different opinions on this issue discussing in a \nclosed room across a table looking for common ground. I wish to express \nmy own sense of disappointment, sadness, though unfortunately in these\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\nvery partisan times not surprise, that this debate we are having which \nreaches a kind of pitch, a moment of confrontation on the Levin-Reed \namendment which would mandate a withdrawal from Iraq, that this debate \nis so partisan. I have a point of view about the war in Iraq and what I \nthink is best for our security and future policy in Iraq.\n  I know people have different points of view. I respect that. This is \na difficult, a very difficult matter on which to reach judgment. So \npeople, of course, can have different points of view, but why do we \ndivide in those different points of view on party lines? There is no \ninherent reason why that should happen. It is a sign of what ails our \npolitical system, what afflicts our Federal Government and hamstrings \nit, what frustrates and ultimately angers the American people about \nwhat they see here because what they see is that too often we seem to \nbe playing partisan politics, we seem to be in a kind of partisan tug \nof war. The net result of that is that nothing gets done.\n  Wars are always controversial. Wars have been controversial \nthroughout our history. But rarely have the divisions between those who \nsupport a war and oppose it or support particular policies associated \nwith it and oppose it been as partisan as they are at this moment. It \nhas to stop. If it doesn't stop on Iraq, I believe our Nation will be \nweakened seriously.\n  We have to find ways, no matter what the partisan pressures are, to \ncome together as Americans to defend our Nation against those who hate \nus all--al-Qaida, Iran, the fanatics running around who exhort the tens \nof thousands to shout ``Death to America.'' They have been doing it \nsince the revolution of 1979. They do it weekly throughout Iran: \n``Death to America.'' Surely we understand they don't distinguish \nbetween Republicans and Democrats when they shout ``Death to America. \nWe should have the common sense, let alone a sense of responsibility to \nour country, to come together and defend our Nation against those who \nwant to destroy us, as al-Qaida began to do on 9/11.\n  I regret the partisanship that characterizes this debate.\n  I wish to talk very briefly about how we got here, not going over it \nin any detail. This Congress authorized the President to take action to \noverthrow Saddam Hussein after the administration had attempted, \nthrough the United Nations Security Council, to get Saddam to take \ncertain steps, including proving to us he had destroyed the weapons of \nmass destruction, he had filed an inventory with the United Nations \nSecurity Council as a condition of the truce and end to the gulf war of \n1991.\n  I don't wish to revisit that. I know people look back at him and \nthink they were deceived in why we went to war. I think the world is \nbetter off without Saddam Hussein in power. But this takes me to this \npoint. For 3 years afterward, this country followed a strategy in Iraq \nthat didn't work. We followed a strategy in Iraq for too long that \ndidn't work. I strongly supported the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein \nand deeply desired that we do everything we could not just to overthrow \nhim but to try to create within Iraq a new Iraq, a free Iraq, a self-\ngoverning Iraq that would give hope to people throughout the Arab \nworld, the Muslim world, of a better future than the one that al-Qaida \noffers them, which is a return to a millennium ago, away from the \nmodern world, but we erred for 3 years. Many of us cried out that we \ndid not have enough troops there, we were following a strategy that did \nnot work, too few troops and not focusing on al-Qaida training, an \ninsufficient ability to do that, and letting the terrorists essentially \ntake hold of the country.\n\n  Finally, last year, the President of the United States, as Commander \nin Chief, changed the course in Iraq. He changed the leadership of the \nPentagon, which was critically necessary. He brought in a new Secretary \nof Defense, consulted with experts on all sides about what to do, how \nto improve what was happening in Iraq, and adopted a totally new \nstrategy. That is why when I hear people in this debate saying we need \na change of course in Iraq, well, we got a change of course, finally. \nIt was later than I hoped for, but, finally, at the end of last year, \nbeginning in February, the counteroffensive, called a surge, and a new \ngeneral, a great general--a general in the tradition of Maxwell Taylor, \nGeneral Abrams, a general who was called on in a very difficult \nsituation, probably the single most informed leader on \ncounterinsurgency in our military, GEN David Petraeus, to take charge \nof these troops--and he gave him 30,000 additional troops.\n  The evidence thus far is incomplete, because as has been said, and \nwill be said again, the surge was just fully staffed about a month ago. \nBut you have to look at the statistics. I know the benchmark that came \nin, the interim one last week, was mixed. But on the security side, \nwhich is what the surge was first aimed at, deaths from sectarian \nviolence are way down in Baghdad, more than half the city is now under \nthe control of American and Iraqi forces, and normalcy is returning to \nmany parts of the capital city, and Anbar Province, the story is well \nknown now. Basically, the additional troops and the new strategy \nenabled us to convince the Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar, which al-\nQaida was going to make the capital of its Islamist extremist \ncaliphate, We convinced the tribal leaders we were there to stay, so \nthey came to our side, and al-Qaida is on the run--and for the first \ntime. Always before we had the strategy where we would chase the \nterrorists out of a community, a city, in Baghdad, and we would leave \nand then they would come back. This time, in Anbar Province, we left \nsome of our marines and some of the Iraqi security forces, working with \nthe Sunni indigenous tribal leaders, and what did we do? We followed \nal-Qaida on the run to Diyala Province, to Baquba city, the major city \nthere, and we have them on the run there as well. As a result, the \ntribal leaders there are beginning to come over to our side. So this \nsurge, interim as the reports are, is, on the ground, working.\n  Now comes the Levin-Reed amendment. I wish to say to my colleagues \nthis is not the Levin-Reed amendment we voted on earlier this year. \nThat amendment did require the beginning of a withdrawal of troops \nwithin 120 days of passage, as this amendment does. But that amendment \nset a goal--G-O-A-L--a goal for our troops to be substantially \nwithdrawn from Iraq by the end of March of next year. It is no longer a \ngoal in this Levin-Reed amendment. It is a mandate, a rigid deadline \nthat by the end of April of next year most of our troops are out of \nIraq. A core group is left, presumably with the stated purpose to train \nthe Iraqis and to fight al-Qaida, which is exactly what the previous \npolicy that failed was aimed at doing.\n  Some have said this is the only amendment with teeth. It does have \nteeth. But I think we have to ask: Who does it bite? I think it bites \nour hope for success in Iraq. It bites our troops, as they proceed day \nin and day out, courageously, compassionately, effectively. It bites \nour hope for keeping al-Qaida and Iran out of controlling Iraq. This \namendment mandates a retreat to begin in 4 months, 120 days, regardless \nof what is happening on the ground.\n  This is not a debate about whether to change course in Iraq, it is a \ndebate about whether to accept and embrace defeat in Iraq. We have \nchanged course, as I said before. This is a debate about whether we are \ngoing to give our generals and our troops the chance that they say they \nneed to succeed, and succeed they know they can, or if we are going to \norder them to retreat--we order them to retreat--as they on the ground \nare risking their lives every day and succeeding.\n  We are going to, if this amendment passes, impose a deadline that is \nas inflexible as it is arbitrary. I say this with respect, but I say it \nfrom the bottom of my heart. This is a deadline for an American defeat, \none that we will pay for, I fear, for a generation to come.\n  Let us be absolutely clear again about what the amendment we are \ndebating now would do. If adopted, this amendment would literally put \nthis Congress between the Commander in Chief, our generals, and our \nsoldiers in the field. So just as our troops are on the offensive \nagainst al-Qaida in Iraq, just as our troops have the enemy on the run, \nthis amendment would reach 5,000 miles across the ocean and put our \ntroops on the run in retreat and defeat.\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\n  I will tell you this, the American military, the best in the world--\ncourageous, resourceful, fighting a tough fight but adjusting to it, \nresilient, finding ways to succeed--the American military will never \nlose the war in Iraq. The war in Iraq, if it is to be lost, will be \nlost as a result of a loss of political will here at home, and you have \nto judge the consequences of that. Each one of us has to.\n  In the midst of an unpredictable war, this amendment would strip our \nmilitary commanders not only of the troops they say they need to \nsucceed--this amendment would remove the troops from our commanding \ngenerals--it would strip them of the authority and the ability to adapt \nto changing conditions, which, after all, is what success in war is all \nabout, putting America's military in a legislative straitjacket.\n  I am going to do everything I can to stop that from happening, and \nthat is why I am going to vote against cloture. This amendment is \nwrong. I truly believe it is dangerous. In fact, this amendment should \nnot even be considered now. I welcome the debate, but I believe, when \nwe passed the supplemental appropriations bill in which we authorized \nthe surge to go forward, in which we appropriated funds for the surge, \nin which we established the requirement for the benchmark, for which we \ngot the study last week and then the next one coming in September, to \nme we made an institutional pledge in that to General Petraeus and the \ntroops. Because in that bill we required General Petraeus, along with \nour Ambassador to Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, to come back in September and \nreport to us. We wanted to give them, at the request of General \nPetraeus, time from the middle of June, when the surge troops would \nhave arrived, to September to see whether he could make it work and \nreport back to us.\n\n  I don't think there is a person in this Chamber, no matter what our \nposition on Iraq, that doesn't trust General Petraeus to tell us the \ntruth, what he believes, when he comes back in September. I think we \nmade an institutional pledge to him. But I know this: I made a personal \npledge to him. I am going to give him and the troops a fair chance, \nwhich this amendment would deprive him of, and I am going to give him \nuntil September to come back and tell me how it is going.\n  All of us would like to believe, I certainly would, that there is a \nquick and easy solution to the challenges we face in Iraq. All of us, I \ncertainly would, would like to go back and do over a lot of what \nhappened after Saddam Hussein was overthrown. All of us want our brave \nmen and women in uniform to come home safely and as soon as possible. \nAll of us are keenly aware of the frustration and fatigue the American \npeople are feeling about this war. But we, who have been honored by our \nconstituents to be elected to serve in the Senate, have a \nresponsibility to lead, not to follow. We have a responsibility--it is \nthe oath we took when we were sworn in--to do what we believe is right \nfor our country, even if it is unpopular.\n  I speak for myself, but I firmly believe what is right is that we \ncannot allow our Nation to be defeated in Iraq by the same Islamist \nextremists who attacked us on 9/11, with whom we are engaged now in a \nworldwide war that stretches from Baghdad to London, from Madrid to \nRiyadh, from Bali to Jerusalem, and from Fort Dix to JFK Airport.\n  The sponsors of this resolution insist what is happening in Iraq is a \ncivil war, and they want us to not be part of it. But this argument \nflies in the face of the statements of al-Qaida's own top leaders who \nhave repeatedly told us they consider Iraq to be, today, the central \nbattlefield of their world war against us. We didn't start this world \nwar, they did, by attacking us.\n  I wish to take a moment to read some comments, direct quotes, from \nleaders of al-Qaida that make this clear. I am not making it up. I am \nnot quoting somebody in the administration.\n  December 2004. Osama bin Laden.\n\n       I now address my speech to the whole of the Islamic nation. \n     Listen and understand. The most important and serious issue \n     today for the whole world is this Third World war. It is \n     raging in the lands of the two rivers--Iraq. The world's \n     millstone and pillar is Baghdad, the capital of the \n     caliphate.\n\n  July 2005, Ayman al-Zawahiri, second to bin Laden, as we know, in al-\nQaida. A letter to Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, the head of Iraq, \nsubsequently killed by coalition forces. Quote from Zawahiri to \nZarqawi:\n\n       I want to be the first to congratulate you for what God has \n     blessed you with in terms of fighting a battle in the heart \n     of the Islamic world, what is now the place for the greatest \n     battle of Islam in this era.\n\n  Zawahiri, in that same letter:\n\n       The Mujahadeen must not have their mission end with the \n     expulsion of the Americans from Iraq. No, the first stage is \n     to expel the Americans from Iraq; the second stage is to \n     establish an Islamic authority, or emirate, over as much of \n     the territory as you can, to spread its power in Iraq.\n\n  And then there is a third stage Zawahiri says.\n\n       The third stage is to extend the jihad to the secular \n     countries neighboring Iraq.\n\n  This is not me. This is not some administration spokesperson, this is \nZawahiri, No. 2 in al-Qaida.\n  December of 2006, Zawahiri says:\n\n       The backing of the jihad in Afghanistan and Iraq today is \n     to back the most important battlefields in which the crusade \n     against Islam is in progress, and the defeat of the crusaders \n     will have a far-reaching effect on the future of the Muslim \n     Umah.\n\n  I could go on. I will read one final one. May 2007, 2 months ago, and \nthis is Zawahiri again in a tape.\n\n       The critical importance of the jihad in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan becomes clear, because the defeat of the \n     crusaders there soon, Allah permitted, lead to the setting up \n     of two mujahedin emirates, which will be launch pads for the \n     liberation of the Islamic lands and the establishment of the \n     caliphate. That is why I call on the Muslim Umah not to lag \n     behind or tarry in supporting jihad in general and jihad in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan in particular, in view of the pivotal \n     importance of these two arenas.\n\n  I started this because I said that some of my colleagues offering \nthis amendment say we are in a civil war in Iraq and we ought not to be \nthere. There is sectarian violence. That is why we have the \ncounterinsurgency plan, which is to try to stop the sectarian violence, \nand it is working so far. Surely we don't know whether it will work \nfinally, but sectarian violence has been significantly reduced in \nBaghdad and now Anbar and Diyala Provinces. But the argument that this \nis simply a civil war is totally rejected, denied by these statements \nof al-Qaida's own leaders.\n  We are fighting al-Qaida in Iraq. You can't withdraw from Iraq and \nfight al-Qaida. That is whom we are fighting. Who is going to win if we \npull out? Al-Qaida will and Iran will. Listen to what Zawahiri and bin \nLaden said they are going to do: They are going to establish the \ncapital of the caliphate, the empire, and they are going to go out into \nthe neighboring countries.\n  Incidentally, the notion that somehow we are not fighting al-Qaida in \nIraq and that this is just a civil war also flies in the face of the \nNational Intelligence Estimate on al-Qaida that was released today, \nwhich describes al-Qaida in Iraq as the most visible and capable \naffiliate of al-Qaida worldwide. Of note, and I quote in full:\n\n       We assess that al-Qaeda will probably seek to leverage the \n     context and capabilities of al-Qaeda in Iraq, its most \n     visible and capable affiliate, and the only one that is \n     beyond bin Laden and Zawahiri, the only local affiliate known \n     to have expressed a desire to attack the American homeland.\n\n  So I know people laugh or jest when people say if we don't defeat \nthem there we will be fighting them here, but this is what the National \nIntelligence Estimate says. We are fighting al-Qaida in Iraq, the only \nlocal affiliate of al-Qaida that has also talked about, and some have \nreason to believe may be acting upon, their desire to attack America \nhere in our homeland. That is the National Intelligence Estimate.\n  It seems to me that it is perverse that on the same day we receive \nthis National Intelligence Estimate about the threat posed by al-Qaida \nand about its direct linkage to Iraq, Zawahiri to Zarqawi, bin Laden \ntalking about the centrality of what is happening in Iraq, that the \nSenate would consider voting for an amendment mandating our retreat in \nthe face of al-Qaida from Iraq.\n  I ask, why is this amendment before us? One of the most commonly \nheard explanations for the amendment mandating the beginning of a \nwithdrawal of American troops in 120 days, and most of them out by next \nApril, is that an American military retreat is necessary--and I quote \nhere one of the\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nsponsors of the amendment--``to prod the Iraqi Government to reach a \npolitical settlement.''\n  So we are going to force a retreat, probably threaten the viability \nof the Iraqi Government, yield the country to al-Qaida and Iranian-\nbacked terrorists, and we are doing it to send a message to the Iraqi \npolitical leadership that they better get their act together. But the \nargument that our forcing a retreat of our military, our troops, will \nprod the Iraqi Government to reach a political settlement is pure \nspeculation. It is amateur psychology without any evidence that I can \nsee to support it. In fact, the expert evidence goes in the other \ndirection. From people who follow what is happening in Iraq closely, \nwho say that as soon--and maybe some of this is psychology, too, but to \nme it seems more sensible than the other argument--as soon as we begin \nto set a deadline date, the Iraqi political leadership is not going to \nsuddenly come together and settle their differences, they are going to \nhunker down in camps and get ready for the battle of all battles, which \nwill be a total civil war, huge ethnic slaughter I fear, probably a \nkind of genocide.\n  One of our military leaders in Iraq when I was there 5 weeks ago said \nto me: Senator, if your colleagues don't like what they see in Darfur \ntoday, and they should not like it, they are going to hate what they \nsee in Iraq if the American military pulls out before the Iraqis can \nmaintain security.\n  Here, too, we have a National Intelligence Estimate that directly \nrejects the contention that we need to force a retreat of our troops, \nopen the country to a takeover by al-Qaida in Iraq, to convince the \nIraqi Government to reach a political settlement.\n  There was a recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. In it, the \nconclusion was presented that the rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops \nrequired by this amendment would, ``almost certainly have adverse \neffects on national reconciliation'' in Iraq.\n  So rather than promoting political progress, this amendment would \nhave the exact opposite effect than its sponsors intend, and actually \nundermine it.\n  I know that cots have been brought in tonight to allow Senators to \nsleep during parts of the night when they are not required on the \nfloor. I think, really, what I hope this does is wake up the Senators \nand wake up the American people to the threat we face; to wake them up \nto what our intelligence agencies are saying about Iraq, to what the \nstakes for us are in Iraq, for what the consequences are for us of a \ndefeat in Iraq, for the strength of the Petraeus counteroffensive surge \nand how much it is achieving.\n  It is time for all of us to wake up to what is actually happening in \nIraq before it is too late. It is time to stop dreaming that a mandated \nwithdrawal, or whatever you call it--a redeployment is really nothing \nother than a mandated defeat. I suppose if you don't think that defeat \nin Iraq will have consequences for our future security, then I can \nunderstand that. But I, of course, profoundly disagree.\n  We face vicious enemies in Iraq today. We know who they are. They are \nal-Qaida and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Al-Qaida is fighting in Iraq \nbecause they want to bring down the Iraqi Government and they want to \nstop any progress toward self-government until a modern Iraq. They want \nthe state to fail so they can establish what bin Laden, Zawahiri, and \nZarqawi said clearly, a caliphate, an empire with the capital of the \nempire there.\n  What about Iran? Iran is training, funding, and arming terrorists to \nkill Americans in Iraq. This Senate spoke unanimously against that, \npresenting evidence of it last week, 97 to 0. Why does Iran do that? It \nwants America out of Iraq so it can dominate that country and the \nregion.\n  These are enemies that cannot be negotiated with or reasoned out of \nexistence. I am all for diplomacy with Iran. I am glad our ambassador \nmet with their ambassador in Baghdad in May, but ultimately \nnegotiations that have gone on with Iran, conducted by the European \nGovernments for more than 2 years to try to convince them to stop the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, produced nothing but giving them 2 more \nyears to go ahead with that development. These are not enemies who are \ninterested in the political reconciliation of which the sponsors of \nthis amendment speak.\n  In other words, al-Qaida and Iran are not fighting in Iraq to \nencourage or bring about a political reconciliation. These enemies must \nbe confronted and defeated through force of arms. That is precisely \nwhat our brave men and women in uniform are doing today under this new \ncounterinsurgency strategy, and they are succeeding. I ask my \ncolleagues in this Chamber finally to listen carefully to the words of \na great American soldier, Rick Lynch, commander of the Third Infantry \nDivision now serving in Iraq. His soldiers are, today, leading the \nfight south of Baghdad. General Lynch reported just this past weekend \nthat his forces were making significant gains in reclaiming areas that \njust a few weeks ago in Baghdad were terrorist safe havens. These are \ntowns on the outskirts of Baghdad where al-Qaida in Iraq had terrorized \nthe local population into submission and then set up shop, assembling \nthe car bombs that then were used to kill hundreds of innocent people \nearlier this year. That is the way to try to stop these suicidal \nmaniacs from blowing themselves up and killing a lot of Iraqis and \nAmericans with them--which is their attempt to respond to our \ncounteroffensive surge policy and their attempt to do something else: \nto influence the American public opinion to get out of Iraq.\n  General Lynch also stated that in his professional military \njudgment--this is a soldier, not a politician--the current troop surge \nmust be maintained through early next year in order to achieve success. \nIn his words:\n\n       It's going to take us through the summer and fall to deny \n     the enemy his sanctuaries and then it's going to take us \n     through the first of the year into the spring to consolidate \n     these gains.\n\n  Incidentally, it may be that those gains will be consolidated by next \nspring, and we will be able to begin to draw down some of the American \nforces there. But do we have the confidence to know that today, to \nmandate that to happen? I hope we are in a position--and I am sure \nGeneral Petraeus does, and I am sure the President does--to begin to \norder that kind of beginning of withdrawal because the surge has \nsucceeded, not order a withdrawal as an alternative policy to the \nsurge.\n  I return to General Lynch. He warned that pulling back before the job \nwas completed would ``create an environment where the enemy would come \nback in and fill the void.'' General Lynch also reported that he was \n``amazed at the cooperation his troops were encountering in previously \nhostile areas.'' In his words:\n\n       When we go out there the first question the Iraqis ask us \n     is, are you staying? And the second question is, how can we \n     help?\n\n  In other words, what General Lynch said is what they are worried \nabout is our leaving. And our answer is: We are staying. And when we \ngive that answer they say: How can we help?\n  They want a better future than al-Qaida and Iran controlling their \ncountry. General Lynch has given us a clear and compelling explanation \nin the direct words of a soldier about the nature of this war. In his \nview, the U.S. military needs the additional troops that are now in \ntheater to prevail, and they are, as we speak, prevailing. In this \nregard, the choice before this Senate is a direct one. Either General \nLynch is badly mistaken about the reality of this war or this amendment \nis badly mistaken about the reality of this war. They cannot both be \nright.\n  I go with General Lynch. He is on the ground. He has no motives other \nthan to do what is right for his country. He has every motive to want \nto protect his troops. But he believes in our cause.\n  We have a choice to make. We can ignore the recommendations of our \ngeneral in the field and withdraw in defeat. We can rationalize our \naction with reassuring but falsely hopeful words such as \n``redeployment,'' but no matter what we say our enemy will know that \nAmerica's will has been broken by the barbarity of their blood lust, \nthe very barbarity we declare we are fighting, but from which, if this \namendment ever passed, we would actually be running.\n  There is, of course, no guarantee that the path we are on will lead \nto success. There never is in war. But what General Petraeus is \noffering is a strong, smart, and practical strategy, informed by his \nexperience and expertise, that carries a reasonable hope of victory\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nfrom whose jaws this amendment would snatch defeat. This amendment is a \nsurrender to terrorism. It is a victory to al-Qaida and Iran. It is an \ninvitation to a disaster for Iraq, the Middle East, and most directly \nthe United States of America.\n  Iraq is not lost. It can be won, and if it is won we will have \nsecured a better, brighter future for the people of that country, the \nhope of greater stability and opportunity and peace for the people of \nthe region, and the hope and promise of greater security for the \nAmerican people. Iraq is not lost. But if we adopt this amendment it \nwill be; so, I fear, will so much of our hope for democracy and \nstability in the Middle East and for our own safety from terrorism here \nat home. That is why I will vote against cloture and against the Levin-\nReed amendment tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the American people's opposition to this \nwar is not the political passion of a moment, as some have suggested. \nIt is a majority, a growing majority, a thoughtful growing majority \nreflecting the will of the people of this country. We need 60 votes \nbecause of recalcitrance, because of political game playing, because \ntoo many of our colleagues are more interested in protecting the \nPresident than they are in protecting our troops. We know to get 60 \nvotes we need 11 Republicans.\n  Many Republicans, a growing number of Republicans in this body, have \nspoken out against this war. They have decided that we need to change \ncourse in Iraq. The problem is simply this. It seems like almost every \nTuesday Vice President Cheney comes and speaks to the Republican lunch. \nThe Republicans meeting in conference, having lunch, Vice President \nCheney pulls up, his limousine drops him off at the door of the Senate, \nhe comes in and speaks to them or other administration officials. The \narm twisting, the lobbying by the administration, is making it that \nmuch harder to change direction in this war. That is why it is so \ndifficult to get to 60. That is why we want a vote, we want an up-or-\ndown vote, we want a majority vote, because a majority vote reflects \npublic sentiment, reflects what the voters said last fall, reflects the \npolicy that the Iraq Study Group has suggested, that the military has \nadvised the President, but the President simply dug in and did not \nlisten.\n  Last November voters in my State of Ohio, from Galion to Gallipolis, \nand across this Nation shouted from the ballot boxes that we needed a \nnew direction, that the Iraq war must end. They demanded that we \nrefocus our efforts on securing our homeland so that the darkest day in \nour Nation's history, 9/11, is never repeated.\n\n  With Democrats in control of Congress this session we immediately, in \nJanuary, began working to end the war. We immediately began to work \nimplementing the full recommendations of the 9/11 Commission in order \nto make us safer, recommendations that will go a long way toward making \nthis country safer. By working to end the war in Iraq and by passing \nthe Commission's recommendation, we are executing a strategy to combat \nterrorism and to make our country safer.\n  Make no mistake, ending the war in Iraq itself is a counterterrorism \nstrategy. Global terrorist attacks have increased sevenfold since we \ninvaded Iraq--seven times, more than 700 percent. Our continued \nengagement in Iraq, frankly, is the best thing that ever happened to \njihadist recruitment. We know America is a less safe country because of \nthe war in Iraq. We know global terrorist attacks have increased \nsevenfold, seven times worldwide since the war in Iraq began.\n  Democrats brought to this Chamber not one piece of legislation to \nredeploy our troops out of Iraq in the safest, most orderly way \npossible, but many resolutions, many pieces of legislation. Each and \nevery time either Republicans defeated the measure in Congress by \nthreatening a filibuster or the President vetoed it in the White \nHouse--each and every time.\n  This week we find ourselves at the same impasse, the same struggle in \nthis Chamber between a new direction and more of the same failed \npolicies. Again, too many of my colleagues would rather protect the \nPresident of the United States than protect our soldiers and marines in \nIraq and Afghanistan. More of the same means supporting the President, \nbut it means something very different to Ohio families. It means more \nloved ones wounded, more loved ones killed. Mr. President, 156 people \nin my State have been killed in Iraq, 156 people. More than 1,100 \nOhioans have been wounded. Ohio cannot afford more of the same.\n  Again, too many of my colleagues care more about protecting the \nPresident than they do about protecting our troops. Ohio families have \nhad it with hollow promises by the President. From first declaring \n``mission accomplished'' in 2003 to his visit last week in my home \nState of Ohio, in Cleveland, the President used grand pronouncements of \nsuccess in an effort to buy more time, stay the course and buy more \ntime; continue our involvement in this civil war and buy more time. \nTime and again those pronouncements were followed by increased violence \nand expanding chaos in Iraq. Time and again those pronouncements mean \nmore names being added to the list of dead and wounded Americans. Mr. \nPresident, 3,617 Americans have died in the war in Iraq. At least \n35,000 Americans have suffered serious injuries that will be with them \nand with us for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.\n  Every year I see Iraq slip further and further into a civil war with \nour Nation's military caught in the middle. The President sent our \nNation's military into a war of choice on failed intelligence and, as \nwe know, without proper body armor. Adding insult to injury, literally \njust today, a USA Today article revealed that nearly 4 years later our \ntroops are still without the lifesaving equipment they need.\n  I remember before the attack, before we invaded Iraq, I was a Member \nof the House of Representatives. I voted against this war in October of \n2002. We began questioning Paul Bremer during the beginning of 2003, \nbefore the attack. Mr. Bremer was the administrator in Iraq for the \nU.S. Government, the Provisional Government. We continued to focus on \nproviding the kind of body armor for our troops and Mr. Bremer said we \nare doing the best we can, but we have not done very well. We have a \nlot to do. We still attacked that country, we still sent our troops \ninto harm's way without that body armor.\n  As we discuss this issue, tonight in Baghdad it is early morning. The \nforecast calls for a high of 104 degrees. While our solders have some \nprotection from the extreme heat, like water, shade, and the mini air-\nconditioning units, they are not protected from a far deadlier force in \nIraq, the improvised explosive devices or IED bombs. The USA Today \narticle highlighted the lack of planning to protect our soldiers riding \nin Humvees from the impact of IED bombs. Humvees have a very low ground \nclearance, a little less than a foot and a half. The bottom of a humvee \nis flat so when it is hit by an IED blast from the bottom, troops \nsuffer the brunt of the explosion.\n  The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, or MRAP--the Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, on the other hand, has a 3-foot \nclearance, and its body is V-shaped so when the explosion happens, the \nexplosion, if you will, is dissipated and more often than not the \ntroops are not nearly as badly injured. The soldiers are much better \nprotected.\n  The few MRAPS in theater have proven their effectiveness and clearly \nsaved lives and clearly saved many of our soldiers and marines from \ninjury. What infuriates me and should infuriate everyone across this \nNation is that the Pentagon and the administration, similarly to back \nin 2002 and 2003 when they failed to work hard to provide the body \narmor to prepare for this war, the Pentagon and the administration \nagain did not immediately work to fix the problem of the humvee's \nsusceptibility to IEDs; the needless loss of life from this willful \nignorance to correct the glaring problem of the unprotected humvees \ncould have been prevented, but arrogance and stubbornness from the \nadministration kept the administration from doing the right thing.\n  The President, in some sense, is proud of his stubbornness. Instead \nhe should be ashamed of it. His stubbornness has led to a failed policy \nin Iraq and to a failed policy on the war on\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nterror. The President has yet to define victory. He has yet to tell us \nhow many years it will take to achieve whatever his definition of \nvictory is. Will we be in Iraq for 5 more years, 10 more years, 15 \nyears? Will hundreds more Americans die? Will thousands more of our \nservice men and women die? Will tens of thousands die?\n  The President has yet to hold himself and his administration \naccountable for fomenting a civil war, in breeding more global \nterrorism. Remember, we have seen an increase in attacks of sevenfold \nsince the time of the attack and the beginning of this war.\n  The path he is wed to has simultaneously increased the threat of \nterrorism, reduced our nation's capability to protect against it, and \nmade us less safe. That stubbornness is not leadership. That \ndefensiveness is not leadership. That finger-pointing from the White \nHouse, from some of my colleagues, is not leadership. And supporting \nthe President's strategy in Iraq, rather than supporting the troops \nbecause you support the President, is not leadership.\n  Blocking another vote to bring our troops home, and that is exactly \nwhat they are doing tonight by their partisan antics, by their petty \npolitical games, blocking an up-or-down vote so the American people's \nwill can be expressed, by blocking another vote to bring our troops \nhome, is not leadership.\n  Lives are at stake. Our homeland security is at stake. Global \nsecurity is at stake. Last week, we learned that al-Qaida is at pre-9/\n11 strength. That is frightening news. Of course, it is a cause for \noutrage because it did not have to be that way. We also learned last \nweek that the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is fostering the \nnext generation of al-Qaida at an alarming rate.\n  What kind of signal exactly do the President and his supporters think \nwe send by failing to secure the region where we know al-Qaida lives \nand trains and plans with--according to military analysts--relative \nfreedom, the same region that served as the breeding ground for global \nterrorism through al-Qaida before 9/11, the same region we now know \nthat al-Qaida trained in before the deadliest attack on our Nation's \nsoil, the same region where Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9/\n11, not Iraq, Osama bin Laden, the same region where he is believed to \nbe hiding, free to plot the next attack on our beloved homeland?\n  Over the objection of military advisers, the 9/11 Commission, and the \nvoice of a nation, the President, again that word ``stubbornly,'' \ninsists on staying the course with the failed policy in Iraq. Staying \nthe course with the President's failed policy has not just forced our \nGovernment to take our eye off the ball of terrorism, it has caused us \nto drop it.\n  Again, global terrorist attacks have increased seven times since we \ninvaded Iraq, sevenfold since we invaded Iraq. Prior to World War II, \nthe French built the Maginot Line. Same thought the line would prevent \nGermany from attacking France. History proved the French wrong. The \nPresident's strategy in Iraq is the Maginot Line of the 21st century. \nIt imperils our Nation by mistakenly focusing our attention in the \nwrong direction. We have dropped the ball on capturing Osama bin Laden. \nWe have dropped the ball on securing Afghanistan. We have dropped the \nball on implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and anyone \nwho thinks those are not signals that al-Qaida is paying attention to \nis surely mistaken.\n\n       Supporting the President's policy does not just fail to \n     effectively target terrorism, it puts the bull's-eye squarely \n     on our Nation. Ending the war in Iraq is not just about \n     bringing our troops home. Ending the war in Iraq is not just \n     about ensuring veterans get the health care and the benefits \n     they have been denied, and the Presiding Officer tonight has \n     done perhaps more than anybody in this institution about \n     that.\n\n  Ending the war is not just about a new direction in our foreign \npolicy. Ending the war is not about returning our focus to where it \nmight be if our Nation and our community, our families are to remain \nsafe. Ending the war is about reengaging full force on the war on \nterror to make us safer.\n  I applaud my Republican friends who chose to stand up to the \nPresident. More and more of them have taken steps of bravery with every \nvote we bring to the floor. But it is not enough. With every lost vote, \nwe add more lines to the list of men and women lost in Iraq.\n  Every lost vote we add more names to the list of wounded. With every \nlost vote, we empower al-Qaida. We keep hearing the same rhetoric: If \nwe do not fight the terrorists in Iraq, we will have to fight them \nhere. Good line but bad logic. The real truth is: If we do not fight \nthe terrorists where they are in cells around the world, in \nAfghanistan, and where they really are, then we will fight them here.\n  In the Senate, those of us committed to ending the war of choice and \nsecuring our Nation will keep fighting. I appreciate the leadership of \nso many of my colleagues who have shown courageous leadership on this \ncrisis of our generation. Our fight to end the war and refocus our \nefforts has just begun. We want to vote, we want a majority vote to \nreflect the growing, thoughtful opposition to this war. A huge majority \nof the American people are trying to overcome the furious lobbying \neffort of the President and the Vice President. Our fight to end this \nwar has just begun. We are going to change this policy. The safety of \nevery American depends upon it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest \nchallenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the political debate in \nWashington has not been conducive to finding a solution, as political \ndivisions have hardened during the past year.\n  Vitriolic rhetoric and veto threats do not help us pursue a new \ndirection. I believe the way forward must be a bipartisan approach that \nputs the interests of our country ahead of political gain. Our Nation \nneeds to forge a new bipartisan strategy that will redefine the mission \nand set the stage for a significant but responsible withdrawal of our \ntroops over the next year.\n  Fortunately, we do not have to search far and wide to find this new \npolicy. It is already mapped out for us in the unanimous \nrecommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. This group was \nchaired by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Democratic \nCongressman Lee Hamilton. It has distinguished Americans from both \nparties who worked hard to forge a unanimous, bipartisan consensus on \nthe road ahead in Iraq.\n  The Commission's recommendations chart the path forward and remain as \nviable today as when they were first released last December. The Iraq \nStudy Group report lays out three core principles. First, the report \ncalls for a fundamental change in the mission of our military forces in \nIraq, away from combat operations, and instead limited to training and \nequipping the Iraq security forces, conducting counterterrorism \noperations against al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations, and \nsecuring Iraq's borders.\n  The Iraq Study Group set a goal of March 2008 for withdrawing those \ncombat forces not needed for this newly defined mission and for force \nprotection.\n  Shifting the mission of our troops would require the Iraqi military \nand police to take responsibility for security for their country. It \nwould allow tens of thousands of our troops to start coming home, and \nit would demonstrate our military commitment to Iraq is neither open-\nended nor unconditional.\n  Second, the Iraq Study Group report recommends that American support \nfor the Iraqi Government should be conditioned on its leaders making \nprogress in meeting specific benchmarks, including the political \nreforms necessary to quell sectarian violence.\n  I last visited Iraq in December. After I came home, I told my \nconstituents I had concluded a new direction in Iraq was needed and it \nwould be a mistake to send additional troops to Baghdad, to place them \nin the midst of a sectarian struggle. The solution was political, not \nmilitary.\n  I told my constituents I thought we should be moving our troops out \nof Baghdad and instead concentrating their effort in Anbar Province, \nwhere the local population was starting to support our efforts and \njoining in the fight against al-Qaida. In Anbar, the violence was not, \nin December and is not now, primarily sectarian, as it is in\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nBaghdad and the belt surrounding Baghdad; instead, in Anbar Province \nthe fight is against al-Qaida.\n  The newly defined mission set forth by the Iraq Study Group in \nDecember would call for us to concentrate our efforts on \ncounterterrorism operations, securing Iraq's borders and training the \nIraqi security forces. We should not be in the midst of what is indeed \na civil war in Baghdad.\n  Last week, the President released a progress report, a report called \nfor by legislation that I coauthored with Senators John Warner and Ben \nNelson. This report verified that the Iraqis have made, unfortunately, \nvery little progress in achieving the most important political \nbenchmarks. This is at a time when the Iraqis have failed to adopt the \nessential reforms to distribute oil revenues more equitably, to reverse \ndebaathification, and to more fully integrate the Sunni minority into \ngovernmental power structures.\n  It has been our troops that have paid such a heavy price. In fact, \nAmerican troops suffered more casualties during the past 3 months than \nat any time since this war has begun. Requiring the Iraqis to make more \nprogress on the political reforms that were part of the strategy, as \nthe Baker-Hamilton Commission recommended, is absolutely essential, and \nit is in keeping with the Warner-Collins-Nelson benchmark language \nincorporated into the funding bill.\n  Third, the Iraq Study Group urges our Government to launch a new \ndiplomatic offensive in the region. Both the international community \nand Iraq's neighbors are clearly not doing enough to foster its \nstability, and this must change. Thus, the ISG recommendations \nrecognize that the United States has placed too much emphasis on \nmilitary actions at the expense of diplomacy. Fourteen of us, eight \nDemocrats and six Republicans, have joined together to offer the Iraq \nStudy Group's sound and well thought out unanimous recommendations as \nan amendment to the pending legislation, the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Our amendment lays the groundwork for responsible, realistic \nredeployment of American combat troops and emphasizes the need for more \ndemocracy. By adopting the Iraq Study Group recommendations, the Senate \ncan finally chart a new course and move past politics to address the \nmost critical issue facing our country.\n  I have to tell you I think the debate tonight in many ways has been \ndisheartening. To see signs put up on the Senate floor saying ``Let us \nvote,'' when our side has not blocked a vote on the cloture motion, we \nhave offered to do it at any point this evening. We have offered to do \nit earlier today. We have offered to do it tomorrow. It has been \ndisappointing to hear rhetoric that is clearly intended to score \npolitical points, as it is disappointing to hear the President be so \ninflexible in his approach.\n  I think the Senator from Tennessee put it well earlier this evening \nwhen he called for more flexibility on the President's part and more \nflexibility on the part of the Democrats, particularly the leader of \nthe Senate.\n  Having vote after vote, where we fail to get to the threshold of 60 \nvotes or even 67 votes, if necessary, to override the President's veto \nis not getting us anywhere. We are not moving forward. We have got to \nput aside such a fractious political approach to such a grave crisis.\n  We need to work together in a bipartisan way. By adopting the Iraq \nStudy Group recommendations, the Senate can chart a new course and move \npast politics. Despite the heroic efforts of our troops, who make us \nall so proud, the war in Iraq has been characterized by lost \nopportunity after lost opportunity due to the misjudgments of this \nadministration. I hope the Senate will not lose this opportunity to \nchange direction in a responsible bipartisan way.\n  In addition to the Iraq Study Group recommendation amendment, which I \nam proud to cosponsor, and I salute the leadership of Senator Salazar \nand Senator Alexander in bringing together a new Gang of 14, to work on \nthis proposal, there is also another bipartisan approach that Senator \nBen Nelson and I have offered as an amendment to this bill.\n  Let me briefly explain our proposal to our colleagues. Now, some of \nour colleagues are looking for a middle ground. Again, in addition to \nthe Iraq Study Group amendment, Senator Nelson and I are proposing \nanother attempt to find a middle ground. Our proposal would require the \nPresident to immediately transition to a new strategy. This strategy is \nvery similar to the one laid out by the Iraq Study Group. It would move \nus away from combat operations and instead focus our efforts on \ncounterterrorism operations, border security, and training of Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  But it requires, and here is how it differs from the Salazar-\nAlexander approach, which I also support, it requires the President to \nimmediately begin transitioning to that new strategy. Not in 120 days, \nnot next year, not after September, but immediately. Then it sets a \ngoal that the transition period should be completed by the first \nquarter of next year, by March 31, 2008.\n\n  So it sets forth a mandatory requirement for the President to \nimmediately transition to a new strategy. I think this makes a lot of \nsense. There are so many people in the Senate who support a new \nstrategy. We ought to be able to get that done, and I respectfully \nsuggest to my colleagues that the Nelson-Collins amendment would move \nus quickly, the most quickly toward that new strategy.\n  I sincerely hope tomorrow we will see the dawn of a new approach to \nour strategy in Iraq. I hope very much that we will see a strong vote \nfor the proposal offered by 14 of us, led by Senator Salazar and \nSenator Alexander, to adopt the unanimous bipartisan recommendations of \nthe Iraq Study Group. Surely, if as diverse a group as James Baker, Lee \nHamilton, Larry Eagleburger, Vernon Jordan, Ed Meese, Sandra Day \nO'Connor, Leon Panetta, William Perry, Chuck Robb, and Alan Simpson can \ncome together in the interest of this country, study our dilemma, study \nthe war in Iraq, and produce a report unanimously, surely we in the \nSenate ought to be able to put aside our partisan concerns, our \npolitical divisions, and act together in the best interests of this \ncountry.\n  I hope we will do so tomorrow. I also hope we might adopt the Nelson-\nCollins amendment which would add a little more force to the \nrecommendations of the changed mission put forth by the Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  This is our opportunity. Let us not lose this opportunity to forge a \nnew path, a new strategy in Iraq.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Levin-\nReed amendment. That is the amendment that, unlike the Iraq Study \nGroup, has a date certain for changing and transitioning our mission \nand bringing our troops home. Maybe if the Senate had listened to the \nIraq Study Group last year when it presented its report and had adopted \nit and moved in that direction, we would not be where we are today. I \npersonally believe it is well past time to now suggest that it is \nappropriate to adopt their recommendations when what we need is a date \ncertain.\n  We are here tonight to ask for a vote, not just any vote. We are here \nto ask for a fundamental American principle: a majority vote for \nmajority rule. Not a supermajority vote of 60 votes. A majority vote \nfor majority rule, the same principle that has stood our country over \nthe test of time, the same principle that average Americans fully \nunderstand, the same principle that would reflect the reality of where \nthe American public is as it relates to this critical issue. A majority \nvote for a majority rule. Not just any vote.\n  We are here tonight because the American people deserve an up-or-down \nvote on this important amendment that will finally bring an end to this \nmismanaged war.\n  The war in Iraq, in my mind, is the most pressing issue of our day, \nand the fact that the Republican leadership and those who join them \nwill not allow the Senate to have a straight up-or-down vote, a simple \nmajority vote, speaks of obstructionism and of hiding behind procedural \nroadblocks in order to avoid facing the American people who have called \nfor a change of course in Iraq.\n  Those of us who voted against the war, as I did in the first place, \nagainst popular opinion of the time, have been vindicated by history. I \nsay to my colleagues, history will judge the votes we\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\ncast tomorrow, and I believe those who vote against a simple majority \nrule and changing the course will be judged harshly.\n  The President has lost the support of the American public and the \nconfidence of the global community. The only support for his misguided \npolicy in Iraq is a minority, a minority, in the Senate. That is why \nthey are afraid of a simple up-or-down vote on this issue because given \nin this body a simple majority vote proposition, a majority of the \nSenate would vote to transition us out of Iraq and bring our men and \nwomen home. That is why they are afraid of the vote that we ask for.\n  Unfortunately, some--and I say ``some'' because I know some of our \nRepublican colleagues have joined us in the past and will again--some \nof my Republican colleagues seem more interested in protecting the \nPresident than doing right, in my mind, by our troops. To the \nRepublican leadership and those who support them, I say it is time to \nstop filibustering and time to start a vote, a simple majority vote for \nmajority rule.\n  Maybe if more of the sons and daughters, husbands and wives, or \nsisters and brothers of Members of the Senate were in Iraq, some of my \ncolleagues would not be so cavalier about filibustering an up-or-down, \nsimple majority vote. If our loved ones were in Iraq, who among us \nwould be content with the counsels of patience and delay? Who among us \nwould be satisfied with another mission accomplished? Who among us \nwould be satisfied with ``victory is around the next corner''? Who \namong us would be satisfied with benchmarks of which not one--not one--\nhas been accomplished, and yet we somehow suggest that is progress \nyears later?\n  After 4 years of a failed policy, it is time to stop hiding behind \nprocedural hurdles and allow the Senate to cast a definitive vote about \nour future course in Iraq. A majority vote for majority rule.\n  The American people are waiting impatiently for the Senate to heed \ntheir calls and face the facts on the ground. It is time for a \nresponsible change of course in Iraq. And that is exactly what the \namendment on which we want a simple majority vote--let's see how people \nvote, a simple majority vote--does.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment says our forces should be out of Iraq by \nApril 30 of next year, except those needed to protect U.S. personnel, \nto train Iraqi security forces and for counterterrorism activities.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives passed very similar \nlegislation, sending a clear message that the time for change has come. \nThe only obstacle left is for this body to act with a simple majority \nvote.\n  Now the Senate, once again, faces a critical vote on Iraq, and I \npoint out, as I did a few days ago when we debated an amendment to take \ncare of our troops--we hear all the time about ``support the troops.'' \nYet we had to have a supermajority vote to simply permit the rotation \nof our troops to be able to have a year back at home for every year \nthey served abroad, a proposition that even the Defense Department has \nas its goal. No, we couldn't have a simple majority vote on that issue; \nwe had to have a 60-vote threshold. Support the troops?\n\n  The only way we could have done that was with bipartisan support, and \nwe didn't get it. The only way we can stop this war is with bipartisan \nsupport. But so long as we keep having these 60-vote thresholds, \nDemocrats have 51 votes in this body and that leaves us 9 votes short. \nThe American people know that. That is why we want a simple majority \nvote for majority rule.\n  Despite overwhelming public support, the public is way ahead of this \ninstitution, the American people are way ahead of this institution, and \ngrowing support from some of our Republican colleagues, which I \nrespect--Democrats do not have the 60 votes needed to stop a filibuster \nin the Senate.\n  I know that many more of our Republican colleagues have serious \nconcerns about the war in Iraq. I have been reading about it. I have \nbeen reading in the local and national papers of so many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle saying: We have grave \nreservations about where the President is continuing to take us. We \nbelieve we have to have some type of change. I urge them to listen to \ntheir inner voice. I urge them to find their moral compass. I urge them \nto back their strong words with meaningful votes.\n  A vote for Levin-Reed, a simple up-or-down vote, is a vote to \ntransition out of Iraq, a vote to change the course, a vote to end the \nwar.\n  Robert Kennedy said about the war in Vietnam:\n\n       Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation. Tragedy \n     is a tool for the living to gain wisdom, not a guide by which \n     to live.\n\n  ``Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       All men make mistakes, but a good man--\n\n  And I would paraphrase in today's terms, a good woman--\n\n     yields when [they] know [their] cost is wrong, and repairs \n     the evil. The only sin--\n\n  The only sin--\n\n     is pride.\n\n  This is not an issue where we can afford the sin of pride to deviate \nus, to take us into the appropriate course, to change the course in \nIraq.\n  The lessons of history are poignant and instructive about today's \nquagmire. Rather than hiding behind a shrinking minority and procedural \nposturing, Republicans should listen to the American people and change \nthe course of this failed war policy. They should stand with the \nAmerican people and tell the President, even though we have given him \nopportunities, even though previous efforts of the Senate have given \nhim flexibility, he has outright rejected it and, so, yes, there must \nbe a date certain, and the message to the President by this body is if \nyou are not going to bring our troops home, then we will.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues claim that what is happening now \non the Senate floor is nothing more than political theater. The war in \nIraq is the single greatest issue before the country and before this \nSenate. How many lives, how much money, how much risk to our security \nby being bogged down in Iraq, when we have real challenges in the world \nsuch as Iran, when we have a reconstituted al-Qaida in Afghanistan, \nthat is the real challenge. That is the real challenge, I say to my \nfriends. This is not about political theater. If there is political \ntheater here, it is the sad, sad plot that the Republican leadership \nhas weaved in creating this procedural hurdle to not permit a simple \nmajority vote for majority rule.\n  I heard my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, for whom I have \nenormous respect, lament the proceedings as partisan. I have the \ndeepest respect for him, but I couldn't more passionately disagree with \nhim. This isn't about partisanship. These are deeply held views of \nprinciple--principle that moves us to take these extraordinary measures \nso we can get a simple majority vote for majority rule. That is what we \nare simply seeking tonight.\n  So to the Republican leadership and those who support them, I say it \nis time to stop filibustering and time to permit a simple majority vote \nto allow us to change the course in Iraq.\n  Today we are living with the consequences of the administration's \nfailed policy, and only a minority of the Senate wants to stay that \nfailed course. Over 3,600 troops have been killed in Iraq since the \nbeginning of the war, including 87 servicemembers with ties to my home \nState of New Jersey. April and May was the deadliest 2-month period of \nthe war for U.S. troops, with 230 servicemembers killed.\n  We have now spent over $450 billion on the war in Iraq, with a burn \nrate of $10 billion a month. Frankly, I never believed the \nadministration's estimates that the so-called surge would only cost \n$5.6 billion. We have been misled time and time again, and these new \nnumbers only prove once again we have been misled.\n  Each day we read horrific stories about the violence and tragedy on \nthe streets of Iraq. This week officials report that dozens of Shiites \nwere massacred by Sunni extremists during an overnight raid in Diyala \nProvince. Yesterday, suicide car bombs in Kirkuk killed more than 80 \npeople and injured some 150 others. It was the deadliest attack the \ncity had seen since the beginning of the war. In fact, suicide attacks \nhave more than doubled across Iraq from 26 in January to 58 in April.\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n  In terms of reconstruction, measurements we all previously swore \nourselves to be listening to, oil production in Iraq is still lower \nthan it was before the war, and Baghdad is getting less than 6 hours of \nelectricity a day, significantly less than before the war.\n  That is why we must proceed with a vote on the Levin-Reed amendment \nand bring an end to our military involvement in Iraq which has cost our \ncountry so dearly in human lives and national treasure.\n  Even all of the military personnel tell us we cannot have a military \nvictory in Iraq. When I listen to General Pace say we need the Iraqis \nto love their children more than they hate their neighbors, that is \nprobably a powerful truism, but it does not come through the power of \nmilitary might. That is about reconciliation, confidence-building \nmeasures, revenue sharing, and participation of all Iraqi society in \nthe Government. It does not come through the barrel of a gun to have \nthe Iraqis love their children more than they hate their enemies.\n  So to the Republican leadership and those who support them, it is \ntime to stop filibustering and time to permit us a simple majority vote \nfor majority rule.\n  Let me take a minute to discuss the administration's recent report on \nbenchmarks in Iraq which President Bush is using as a justification for \nthe United States to stay in Iraq.\n  Just as some were misled into the war, I think this report is \nmisleading. I wish to make sure everyone understands exactly what it \nsays because I have listened to the debate and, boy, has it been \nmischaracterized, as far as I am concerned. I am sure not intentionally \nbecause people read the document different ways. Let me tell what it \nclearly says to me.\n  The report did not say that eight of the benchmarks had been met. \nInstead, the report said that satisfactory progress, a very significant \ndistinction, has been made on only 8 of 18 benchmarks in Iraq, while \nthe rest have not even seen--not even seen--satisfactory progress. In \nsimple terms, none of the benchmarks were met.\n\n  Let's make it clear: None of the benchmarks were met. And when this \nreport came out, President Bush said:\n\n       Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will \n     likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the \n     political benchmarks. Those of us who believe that the battle \n     in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance \n     on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for \n     optimism.\n\n  I want to reiterate to the President the fact that none of the \nbenchmarks were actually met. None.\n  Now, let me be clear. The absolute best version of the story is that \nthe Iraqis made some progress on some of the benchmarks. That is it. \nBut the fact is, zero out of 18 benchmarks were met, and this is after \nyears, and this is after changing the goalposts so that we can continue \nto suggest that we are making progress. If we kept the goalposts where \nthey were supposed to be, we would have an even greater rate of \nfailure.\n  So I don't see any cause for optimism for this failed strategy of \nescalation. Frankly, I think the President's comments represent yet \nanother example of the administration's delusion and denial.\n  For years, this administration has refused to face the truth about \nIraq. Let's take a look at some of the benchmarks the Bush \nadministration told us would be met.\n  We were told by the end of 2006 that a provincial election law would \nbe approved and new election laws would be put in place. But that \nbenchmark has not been met.\n  We were told the Iraqis would approve a law for debaathification. But \nthat benchmark has not been met. In fact, the Iraqi Parliament is \nbarely functioning. It is stuck in gridlock. Even worse, one of the \nBush administration's best Iraqi allies, Ahmed Chalabi, has been \nleading the charge--this is one of the administration's best allies who \nhas been leading the charge--to block the debaathification legislation.\n  We were told the Iraqis would create a law to help restrain sectarian \nmilitias. But that benchmark has not been met. In fact, the Iraqi \nGovernment hasn't disarmed the Shia militias, and the security \nsituation on the ground continues to rage out of control. The surge \nhasn't staunched the violence, and civilian casualties were actually \nhigher in June than in February when the surge began.\n  We were told that the Iraqis would establish a law to regulate the \noil industry and share revenues in Iraqi society. But that benchmark \nhas not been met. In fact, the oil law is stuck in parliamentary \ngridlock, and it is unclear whether it actually addresses even the core \nissues.\n  We were told that by March, this past March, that the Iraqi \nGovernment was supposed to hold a referendum on constitutional \namendments necessary for a government of national unity to possibly \nexist. But that benchmark has not been met. In fact, 3 years after the \nUnited States turned over power to the Iraqi Government, the Iraqis \nstill don't have the constitution finished.\n  The Bush administration seems to think that ``satisfactory progress'' \nhas been made on performing a constitutional review committee. But in \nfact this committee has had to keep extending deadlines to get their \nwork done, and it is unclear whether they will even meet the next \ndeadline at the end of this month.\n  As I said before, it is time that the administration and the \nPresident finally face the real facts. And the fact is, by invading \nIraq, the President took our focus away from the war in Afghanistan--\nthe birthplace of the Taliban, the home to al-Qaida, the land of Osama \nbin Laden, and the place where the attacks of September 11 were \nplanned.\n  Now, nearly 6 years after those terrible attacks on the United \nStates, the most recent National Intelligence Estimate tells us that \nal-Qaida is operating where? In a safe zone along the Afghanistan-\nPakistan border. Let me repeat that. Al-Qaida is operating, according \nto the National Intelligence Estimate, in a safe zone along the \nAfghanistan-Pakistan border.\n  In fact, according to the New York Times:\n\n       U.S. officials have warned publicly that a deal between the \n     Pakistani government and tribal leaders allowed al-Qaida to \n     plot and train more freely in parts of western Pakistan for \n     the last 10 months.\n\n  It is clear that by shifting our efforts to Iraq, we have taken our \neye off the original threat in Afghanistan. We cannot forget that our \nfight against terrorism started where it should have, in Afghanistan--\nan engagement that I supported--where it should have remained. But we \nhave not yet been able to end the fight in Afghanistan.\n  Now, as I listened to the debate here today, some of our Republican \ncolleagues are back to the same parroting of the same old refrains--it \nwon't work--criticizing Democrats as being weak on defense. It is we \nwho have consistently called for finishing the job we started in \nAfghanistan, and bringing Osama bin Laden and his followers to justice, \nand as far as I am concerned, to have him meet his maker. It was a \nDemocratic Senator who offered a higher ransom on Osama bin Laden's \nhead. It is Democrats, through the supplemental appropriations bill, \nwho funded the resources for those men and women whom we supposedly are \ngoing to stand by so that they would have the plated jackets that they \nneeded, and whom we sent into war without having the resources they \nneeded, the vehicles to protect their lives as they seek to pursue \ntheir mission, the opportunity to make sure that a grateful nation says \nwe are grateful not just on Memorial Day, marching in a parade, or on \nVeterans Day, going to an observance, which we should, but in how we \ntreat those men and women in their injuries, in their disabilities, and \nfor those who commit the ultimate sacrifice, in how we take care of \ntheir survivors. That is what Democrats did when they achieved the \nmajority in this institution.\n\n  So that old refrain, my friends, that Democrats are weak on defense, \nthat dog won't hunt.\n  I joined a rally earlier tonight outside the Capitol with Iraqi war \nveterans. In my mind, no one--no one--has a greater right to question \ntheir Government and to say, as they did, that it is time to change the \ncourse in Iraq and bring their fellow soldiers home, and that is what \nthey said tonight. They hold the high ground in any debate.\n  Afghanistan was the right place to pursue the national security of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nUnited States. It was in Afghanistan that the murderers of September 11 \nwere located. We had Osama bin Laden pinned down in the mountains of \nTora Bora. But instead of having a large contingent of the best \ntrained, most equipped, most technologically advanced military in the \nworld go after him, we outsourced the job to the warlords. We gave them \nmoney, and they put the money in their pockets and they let bin Laden \nget away.\n  Many of us have been horrified as we have watched the resurgence of \nthe Taliban, the new threats of al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and the \nincreasing poppy cultivation. A few years ago, I talked about the \npossibility of the Iraqitization of Afghanistan, and now we see some of \nthose fears coming true.\n  Just last month, Afghan security forces found a new type of \nsophisticated roadside bomb, one that is very similar to that being \nused in Iraq. Afghans, and our troops in Afghanistan, face the daily \nhorror of roadside bombs targeting civilians or coalition forces.\n  The Taliban continues its battle to terrorize the Afghan people. As \nthe New York Times article said last week:\n\n       Shootings, beheadings, burnings, and bombings: These are \n     the tools of intimidation used by the Taliban and others to \n     shut down hundreds of Afghanistan's public schools. To take \n     aim at education is to make war on the government.\n\n  Afghanistan now produces 92 percent of the world's poppy, and it has \na record crop again this year. Again, according to the New York Times:\n\n       Not so long ago, we trumpeted Afghanistan as a success, a \n     country freed from tyranny and al-Qaeda. But as the Taliban's \n     grip continues to tighten, threatening Afghanistan's future \n     and the fight against terrorism, Americans and Afghans are \n     frequently asking what went wrong.\n\n  My friends, what went wrong is that instead of finishing the mission \nin Afghanistan, the President took us to Iraq. Of course, we remember \nall the reasons why: weapons of mass destruction, uranium from Niger--\nthis in a State of the Union speech before the entire Congress, none of \nit true. The battle in Afghanistan, the battle against al-Qaida, the \nTaliban, against terrorism is far from over. Yet the United States is \nstill held hostage by the President's war in Iraq--a war that we were \nled into based on a false premise, with false promises, with no plan to \nwin the peace and no plan to succeed.\n  The President is fond of evoking Franklin Roosevelt and our noble \nmission in World War II when he talks about Iraq. But he must have \nforgotten that when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt didn't run \noff and invade China. That would have made no sense. Just like our \ngoing to Iraq made no sense because we dropped the ball in Afghanistan. \nThe failures in Iraq, coupled with the reinvigoration of al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan, underscore the fiasco of the Bush administration's \ndecision to take its focus off Afghanistan, its disastrous war policy, \nand the consequences of its ``stay the course'' mentality. They took \ntheir eye off the ball and created a quagmire in Iraq.\n  We didn't have al-Qaida in Iraq. We now have elements of al-Qaida in \nIraq, but we did not have al-Qaida in Iraq before we invaded. Now we \nare paying the price in the form of less security and a beefed-up \nterrorist network. Maybe Secretary Chertoff's infamous gut feeling \nabout an increased terror threat was caused by knowing that Osama bin \nLaden and his terrorist allies are still out there plotting and \nplanning thousands of miles away from Iraq--thousands of miles away \nfrom Iraq.\n  Madam President, let me conclude by saying that the President says \nthat the only role for Congress is to provide a blank check for his \nfailed war policy. He is so wrong. He is so wrong. Time to reread the \nConstitution. This body's responsibility is not to blindly sign a blank \ncheck to the President for a failed policy. We have a responsibility to \nthe American people as fiduciaries both in terms of national treasure \nand lives. Most importantly, we have a responsibility to the men and \nwomen in uniform to do the right thing and stand up to the President's \nfailed policy so that we may give them a mission worthy--worthy--of \ntheir sacrifice. We should honor the troops who continue to sacrifice \nand shed blood not by being silent, not by being hoarded like sheep, \nnot by signing on to a blank check, and not by being complicit in the \nPresident's failed war.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues on the other side cry that we are \nfighting for freedom in Iraq, but here in America, here tonight, we \nhave a tyranny of a minority in the Senate who want to use the \nprocedures of the Senate, in my mind in a way that is totally \nunacceptable, to thwart the will of the majority of the Senate, and, \nmore importantly, the majority of the American people.\n  We want a vote--not just any vote, a simple majority vote for \nmajority rule. The amendment before us reflects the reality on the \nground and the will of the American people. It changes the course in \nIraq by setting a responsible timetable for our troops to leave. How \nmany more lives--how many--I hope we all go home before tomorrow's vote \nand say to ourselves, how many more lives, how many more tens of \nbillions of dollars, how much more chaos? We have heard about chaos. \nWhat will happen, how much more chaos can unfold than that which we see \nunfolding as we have 160,000 troops there?\n  Years from now, we will come to the same conclusion. Or we can act \nwith courage tomorrow in a vote, a simple majority vote, and by doing \nso we will be in a position to meet our national security challenges \nand our national interests. Our brave troops have answered the call of \nduty. Let's now answer the call to do what is right by them.\n  It is clear to me that the President continues to live in a world \nwhere the reality in Iraq never collides with his fantasy of what is \nhappening there. It is time for the President, and a minority in the \nSenate who support him, to give the American people a chance for a \nmajority vote, for a majority rule. The American people have awoken way \nbefore the Senate, and they want the nightmare to end. The American \npeople know it is time to responsibly withdraw from Iraq. The House of \nRepresentatives voted to do so, and it is time for the Senate to \nfinally vote for a responsible withdrawal from Iraq.\n  And so we close again. It is time for a simple majority vote for \nmajority rule.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9366-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9366-S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Executive nominations received by the Senate July 17, 2007:\n\n\n           UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n       SEAN R.

A quorum is now present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the Levin amendment occur at 11 a.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object for a moment.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield in 1 second.\n  Mr. President, I would further say that we are going to have another \nvote sometime later this morning. I have talked to both majority and \nminority, and there is no time that is appropriate. So I arbitrarily am \ngoing to state at this time that we are going to have another vote. It \nwill not occur before 5 a.m. It could be a little before, a little \nafter that, depending on what is happening on the floor. We will have \nanother vote, but it won't be before 5 this morning.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I understand the majority leader, \nthe unanimous-consent request is that we have a cloture vote on the \nLevin amendment at 11, and there will be not another procedural \nrollcall vote prior to 5 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. I would further state, and I should have cleared this with \nthe minority leader, and I did not, I would ask that the last 20 \nminutes prior to the 11 o'clock vote be left for Senator McConnell, 20 \nto the hour would be the minority leader, 10 to the hour would be me. \nWe each would get 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do I further understand the majority leader that there \nwould not then be additional votes between the procedural vote at 5 \na.m. or later and the 11 o'clock vote?\n  Mr. REID. I think that is true. We have the Senate Prayer Breakfast, \nwe have a steering committee meeting at 9. I think people have other \nthings scheduled. I think we have done the votes tonight, so that \nshould work out fine.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding that there will be two more \nvotes on this matter--a procedural vote not to occur earlier than 5 \na.m., and then one additional vote at 11 o'clock on the cloture on the \nLevin amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is true. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \nat 11, that Senator McConnell and I be recognized as I have indicated, \nand that we will proceed with the debate on this issue during the \nmorning hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators on our side be recognized in the following order: \nSenator Isakson from Georgia, Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, Senator \nThune of South Dakota, and Senator Snowe of Maine, alternating with the \ndesignees of the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue before the \nSenate. I have stayed all night and listened to remarks from my \ncolleagues on both sides. I have tremendous respect for each and every \none of them.\n  I do have some issues, however, with some rhetorical questions that \nhave been asked and not responded to and I think are some voices that \nhave been referred to that have not been really answered that I would \nlike to address in my few minutes.\n  First of all, the Levin-Reed amendment specifically calls for a \nwithdrawal beginning 120 days from now and completed by the spring of \nnext year. Unconditional, notwithstanding whatever action may be taking \nplace on the ground, what progress may or may not have been made, a \nprecipitous and a final withdrawal.\n  What I would like to talk about is something that no one has \nmentioned; that is, the consequences if that actually takes place. I \nwould like to do it in the context of the rhetorical question that was \nasked by the Senator from New Jersey, who asked the question: How many \nmore lives?\n  His reference, I know, was to the soldiers in the American and the \nallied forces in Iraq. But the question is meritorious as a response to \nthe consequences of a Levin-Reed amendment passing.\n  I joined the Foreign Relations Committee this year, as the Presiding \nOfficer has as well. I noted that he did what I did. He sat through \nalmost all of the hearings we had in January and February on the \nquestion of the surge and the question of withdrawal and redeployment. \nWe all heard the same thing. Expert after expert argued over whether \nthe surge would or would not work, or the degree to which it would \nwork.\n  But no one, no one--from former Secretary Madeline Albright or former \nSecretary Colin Powell to John Murtha, the representative in the \nCongress, to Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker, all of whom testified, \nand 20 others, everyone said the result of a withdrawal or redeployment \nat that period in January would mean countless untold loss of life in \nIraq. And most of them said it would cause a great loss of life in the \nentire Middle East.\n  I have had visits from representatives of other Middle Eastern \ncountries who have said: Please do not have a precipitous withdrawal \nbecause we will not be able to contain the sectarian violence that will \ncertainly follow.\n  Now, does that mean we should remain as an occupying peacekeeper? No. \nBut it means if we have objectives and benchmarks for victory, we \nshould give ourselves the chance for that to take place.\n  In May of this year, we had the debate we are having again today. In \nMay of this year, on the Iraqi supplemental--which was to fund the war \nin Iraq for our soldiers--we had this debate on whether we should \nwithdraw. We decided not to do it. And that was the right decision. We \nfurther decided to put some benchmarks, that we should judge the merits \nof our progress in part by July 15, and then later on September 15. The \nPresident reported 3 days early on July 15 the progress that has been \nmade.\n  Some has been made, some has not been made. But we all determined \nthat it would be September, and the report of General Petraeus, the man \nwe unanimously put in charge of the battle, as to whether we went \nforward, proceeded the way we were or changed our strategy.\n  I do not know what the results of the September 15 report are going \nto be, but I know I agree with the lady by the name of Lucy Harris. \nLucy is the kind of person to whom we ought to all listen. Her son, \nNoah, 1LT Noah Harris, died in Iraq 2 years ago. He was an e-mail buddy \nwith me during his tour, so I knew a little bit about why he was there \nand what he believed.\n  Noah Harris was a young man who, on September 11, 2001, was at the \nUniversity of Georgia and a cheerleader. The day the incident, terrible \nincident took place in New York City, Noah Harris went straight to Army \nROTC as a junior ROTC, applied for ROTC, studied to become a \ncommissioned officer, solely because of the inspiration he had gotten \nfrom seeing that tragedy and knowing that he wanted to represent his \ncountry and do something to pursue terrorism.\n  He went in the Army in 2004, was on the ground in Iraq, became known \nas the Beanie Baby Soldier because in the one pocket he carried \nbullets, in the other he carried Beanie Babies. He befriended the Iraqi \nchildren.\n  Noah died tragically. I went to his funeral. I paid respect to his \nparents. I have listened to Lucy, and I have followed her comments in \nthe 2 years that have passed since his tragic loss.\n  This week, on July 15, in the Columbus newspaper in Georgia and other \nnewspapers in a syndicated article, Ms. Harris was interviewed \nregarding the current debate that we are having on the floor of the \nSenate. I would like to quote two quotes from that article. First quote \nfrom Lucy Harris:\n\n       ``They should just defer to Petraeus,'' Lucy Harris said of \n     GEN David Petraeus, the commander of forces in Iraq. ``It's a \n     political game.''\n\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this entire article.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Then, secondly, at the end of the article, I think a \nparagraph that all of us should hear: Lucy said the following:\n\n       We're talking about boots on the ground, real people. When \n     I think about my son who could have done anything with his \n     life, but he fought because he believed in his country and \n     what we are doing in Iraq. . . . I just don't want it to have \n     been in vain.\n\n  Well, I want to say to Lucy Harris and the parents of every soldier \nand the loved ones of every soldier who has been deployed, and \nespecially those whose lives have been lost, we don't want them to be \nin vain, nor do we want them to be deployed in an endless occupation. \nWe have a benchmark going to September 15, a general who had the \nunanimous support of this body, and operating under a funding mechanism \nthat received an 80-vote margin in May.\n  Let's end the quibbling at this moment on what we do and give the \nplan a chance to have its final merits judged and weighed by the man \nwho is on the ground.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, I can completely respect the \nstatements everybody made and the opinions of everybody here. But this \nis a very serious question. And we should vote, and will vote, tomorrow \nat 11. When we do, I will not vote for cloture because I want to \ncontinue the commitment that was made by this body in the middle of May \non the funding of the Iraq supplemental, the timetable for reports to \ncome back, and the conditions upon which we would change, a new way \nforward, if and only if, those benchmarks were not met and progress was \nnot being weighed.\n  I think we owe it to Lucy Harris. We owe it to the legacy of the \nsacrifice her son made and the sacrifice made by the countless men and \nwomen who are in Iraq and those who have served before them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           [From the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, July 15, 2007]\n\n                   Senators Grapple With Iraq Policy\n\n                         (By Halimah Abdullah)\n\n       For Rick and Lucy Harris and the small town of Ellijay, \n     Ga., the Iraq war isn't just some policy debate raging on the \n     floor of the U.S. Senate. It's about the frailty of life and\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n     the power of one young man's sacrifice to spur others into \n     action.\n       First Lt. Noah Harris's death two years ago while serving \n     in Iraq brought the conflict home to that community. Now, the \n     Iraq war dominates conversations.\n       ``It's the discussion in classes. It's the discussion in \n     town. Everyone is very interested in what is going on,'' said \n     Noah's mother, Lucy Harris.\n       So it's with no small degree of annoyance that the Harris \n     family has watched the back and forth in the Senate over \n     changing Iraq war policy.\n       ``They should just defer to Petraeus,'' Lucy Harris said of \n     Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of forces in Iraq. ``It's \n     a political game.''\n       Republicans leaders such as Georgia Sens. Saxby Chambliss \n     and Johnny Isakson are in a tough position as they try to \n     assuage the concerns of people at home, like the Harris \n     family, while helping the GOP navigate the debate on funding \n     an increasingly unpopular war backed by a president whose \n     support is also on the wane.\n       A recent Gallup poll showed President Bush's approval \n     rating at 29 percent, and 71 percent of Americans favoring a \n     proposal to remove almost all U.S. troops from Iraq by April \n     2008. The president's job approval rating in a recent AP-\n     Ipsos was 33 percent.\n       As Chambliss and Isakson consider changes to the Iraq war \n     policy they do so amid a climate of several high ranking \n     Senate Republican defections, Including that of Sen. Richard \n     lugar, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee. The departures have included Sen. John \n     Warner, R-Va., and the moderate-leaning Sen. Olympia Snowe, \n     R-Maine.\n       For Republicans, the signs of strain are starting to show.\n       ``It is Important for us to continue to pursue the goals of \n     the surge, and have a debate not in advance of the facts but \n     after we know the facts as they stand,'' Isakson said on the \n     Senate floor Wednesday.\n       The White House has urged Republican lawmakers to wait \n     until Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, \n     gives a report on the war's progress in September before \n     voting on any major policy changes.\n       While most Republican leaders have agreed to do this, \n     they've also acknowledged that congressional and public \n     patience for the war effort is growing thin.\n       ``I think what's happening is that we've come to a critical \n     point,'' Isakson said,\n       Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst and managing editor \n     with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, put it bluntly.\n       ``There's just so many bullets for a lame duck president--\n     especially an unpopular one, that (Republican leaders) can be \n     expected to take,'' she said.\n       ``Georgia, like most of the South is still more supportive \n     of the war in Iraq than the rest of the nation,'' said \n     Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the \n     University of Georgia and author of the book ``The New \n     Politics of the Old South.''\n       The Harris family and the folks in Ellijay could not care \n     less about the politics behind the war, or how Senate votes \n     and defections will impact politicians. As a community that \n     has watched their young people go off to war, they are \n     intensely interested in seeing just how military leaders will \n     define victory In Iraq.\n       ``We're talking about boots on the ground, real people,'' \n     Harris said. ``When I think about my son who could have done \n     anything with his life, but he fought because he believed in \n     his country. In what we were doing in Iraq . . . I just don't \n     want it to be in vain.''\n       That range of emotions surrounding military sacrifice isn't \n     lost on Chambliss and Isakson.\n       Recently, Chambliss made sure a measure to provide wounded \n     soldiers better medical care was included in the defense \n     authorization bill currently being debated by Senate.\n       Such efforts are welcome news to Harris, who often speaks \n     at public events about her son.\n       ``My son's mantra was `I do what I can,' '' she said, her \n     voice trailing off.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nDemocratic speaker be Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my very deep concern \nabout the administration's ongoing policy in Iraq. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on \nReadiness, I have had the privilege to hear the testimony of our troop \ncommanders, to hear our soldiers, to hear their families, and now--now \nmore than ever--I insist we bring an end to this conflict.\n  Already too many lives have been lost, too many men and women have \nbeen wounded and permanently injured, and too many spouses, parents, \nand children have suffered the pain of separation and too often \npermanent loss of a loved one.\n  Yet according to the new National Intelligence Estimate, al-Qaida is \ngrowing stronger, and we are no closer to achieving a sustainable \nsecurity in Iraq. We must make it clear to the Iraqi political leaders \nthat the future of Iraq is in their hands, and they must learn to reach \nthe political compromises necessary for a functioning democracy.\n  Once again, we are at a crossroads. We can either continue to pursue \na policy that is no longer working or we can move forward and implement \na strategy that will set us on a new course. The time is now to \nreevaluate the costs of this war.\n  We must understand that the long-term responsibility for caring for \nthose injured during their service and for the families of those who \ndied is a true cost of war. Over 3,600 members of the Armed Forces have \ngiven their lives in the service of this Nation. Thousands more will \ncome home with injuries, both physical and psychological, that will \nrequire treatment and rehabilitation, processes that can take, as we \nknow now, many years. Invisible wounds that are difficult to detect, \nsuch as PTSD and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, will affect a \ngreat many servicemembers. In addition, it will make it difficult for \nthem to adjust to civilian life as they deal with long-lasting visions \nand experiences they encountered in combat.\n  While we can help the brave troops by passing critical legislation \nthat will provide much needed counseling, these invisible wounds will \ntake a long time to heal. Clearly, the total cost of the current \nconflicts includes both the loss of lives and resources needed to help \na new generation of young combat veterans heal.\n  The American people also believe that now is the time to begin the \nprocess of bringing our troops home. According to a recent poll, 63 \npercent of Americans believe that we should no longer continue on the \npresent course of action set by the administration. They believe, as I \nbelieve, that the present surge has not been a success, and waiting \nuntil September to reconsider our approach is simply prolonging a war \nthat is no longer our fight.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Levin-Reed amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill, which will send a clear message to the \ncitizens of this country that we hear their concerns and we agree it is \ntime to bring our loved ones home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I do not speak very often on the floor \non issues such as that we are talking about today. We have a wonderful \nheritage in this country, and somehow we find ourselves in the midst of \na mess. We find ourselves in a position where we have made decisions, \nsome of them poor, some of them good, but we find ourselves--and I \nagree--at a crossroads.\n  The question in front of us is threefold: One is we have a plan which \nwe instituted less than a month ago and that we set up early this year, \nwhich we are now wanting to change with the Reed-Levin amendment before \nwe have data to tell us one way or another, and that is debatable. We \nhave a large number of Americans who have given the ultimate sacrifice \nin the war in Iraq. But the question before us is what is the world \nlike today? What is it that is going to change if we leave Iraq? What \nare the consequences?\n  Senator Lieberman spoke very eloquently about what the plans of al-\nQaida are and what they have told us, but what happens to the Middle \nEast when we leave?\n  I am reminded of the history of this country that we do not walk away \nif we have a mess and allow millions of people to die and millions of \nother people to be displaced without having a strategy that will solve \nthat situation. And I do not see that in the Reed-Levin amendment.\n  I know the contention is that because we are there, we incite more \nviolence; because we are there, al-Qaida has focused there. But the \nvery thing we attempted to do in Afghanistan, we will recreate the \nsituation prior to our going into Afghanistan if we leave Iraq. But the \nmore important question for me is: Do we as a nation have a moral \nobligation, regardless of the past?\n  The fact is we are in Iraq today and some situations are improving \nand some are not improving nearly as fast as any and all of us want. \nBut is there a moral obligation for this country not\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nto allow this to lead to 2 to 3 million deaths, not to allow for sure \nthe 450,000 people who have been successful helping us who will come \nunder the threat of death, not to allow the displacement of another 2 \nto 5 million Iraqis out of Iraq? Do we have a moral obligation not to \nallow Iran to be in control and use Iraq as a basis for their dominance \nof the Persian Empire again in the Middle East? Is there any obligation \nfor us in that regard? I think there is.\n  I look at the situation in Iraq as a cancer, as a physician and also \nas a cancer survivor. There is lots wrong in Iraq right now. We are at \nthe point where we have to make very hard choices about whether the \npatient can be saved. My concern is that because the treatment is \ntough, because the risk of the treatment is high, we are to the point \nwhere we are going to let the patient die. The fact is the patient does \nnot have to die.\n  I do not dispute my colleagues who have a different opinion on where \nwe should go in Iraq. What I do dispute is whether we recognize fully \nthe obligations we have for the future.\n  What is going to happen as we withdraw? Can anybody in this body \nguarantee to me 2 or 3 or 4 years later down the road that we are not \ngoing to put a whole lot of American lives at risk because of the \ndecision we made to turn off the chemotherapy, to turn off the \nradiation for the patient? What we are saying is, we are going to \nration this; we started down the road, but we are not going to finish \nit.\n\n  There has not ever been a time in my life, being alive during the \nKorean war, the Vietnam war, and this war, that I have not seen \ncontroversy about any war we have been in. Anybody who has been around \nthose three wars knows that is the truth. The question for me is what \nis the best long-term--long-term, not short-term--policy for our \ncountry in terms of stabilizing the Middle East? What is the moral \nobligation for us as a nation? Having invaded Iraq and set in motion \nmany of these situations, how do we measure it and how do we live up to \nthe heritage we have as a country that stands to fulfill moral \nobligations?\n  I have to answer a couple of statements that were made earlier. Any \ninnuendo that members of the Republican conference are having their \narms twisted to support the President in this war is a bold face \nmisrepresentation of the facts. On issues such as this, all my \ncolleagues know nobody is twisting their arm to be against it and no \none is twisting my arm to support the policy. As a matter of fact, the \nstatement by the Senator from Ohio that Vice President Cheney comes in \nevery week and gives us a pep talk on the issue--I have been attending \nthe conference for 2\\1/2\\ years, and I heard him speak once in 2\\1/2\\ \nyears on Iraq. So the politics of negative comments taken out of \ncontext should be labeled what they are.\n  The other fact I know, the Senator from New Jersey talked about maybe \nmore of the Members of the Senate should have our children in Iraq. I \nknow the Presiding Officer had a son recently return, but I know there \nare people in this body who have children in Iraq--one of Senator \nMcCain's sons is due to ship out this month--who have an opinion, a \ndifferent opinion than what the Reed-Levin amendment would consider.\n  So I think it is highly unfair to speculate as to what I think is \ndivided with those who have had children with this experience.\n  There are some facts I do know about our country. I do know the war \nis tearing at the fabric of our Nation. I do know that we as a nation \nare war weary. I think we ought to talk about what is great about our \ncountry, what is good about the military.\n  My impression from being in Iraq and here is I do not know of finer \nindividuals in our country than those who are serving in the military. \nI can also tell you I do not know of more informed citizens of all the \nissues that face our country than the military.\n  We have made a lot of mistakes in the policy in the Middle East, \nthere is no question. I think we can agree with that point, and I think \nwe can all admit to it. But it does not change where we are and what \nthe consequences are if we leave.\n  I served as a medical missionary in Iraq after the first gulf war. I \ndeveloped friendships with Kurds and Shia and Sunni. We talk in the \nabstract over here about the Iraqi people and their leadership. But I \nwish to tell my colleagues, I didn't see a whole lot of difference in \nwhat those people wanted and what we want for our families. For us to \nspeak in a sterile way that there will be no impact whatsoever on all \nthose Iraqis, no matter what their faith or their heritage, belies the \nfact that millions will die. That is not my estimate, that is the \nestimate of many very learned scholars on the Middle East.\n  We heard this week a mention from the Secretary General of the United \nNations advising against a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq in terms of \nhow that would play out in the Middle East.\n  I think of the children that I did skin grafts on in Iraq who are now \nin their middle twenties, and the hope that they have for a safe and \nsecure freedom, to actually have a Government that is a function of the \nbeliefs of the multitudes who live in Iraq. Despite all our mistakes, \nshould their hopes be dashed?\n  We look at the sacrifices, we look at the moneys we have spent, but \nwe never look at it in terms of the lives of the Iraqis. The contention \nis we cause more violence because we are there than what will happen \nwhen we withdraw. If I could know for sure that what the experts tell \nus is wrong and millions of Iraqis will not die, I could probably be in \nagreement with some of the positions of those who want to change our \ncourse right now. But I don't know that and, as a matter of fact, the \nexperts say the exact opposite will happen and millions will die. So we \ndo have a moral obligation.\n  The other question we ought to bring forward is the contention we \nwant to change the rules of the Senate on a vote tonight when everybody \nknows that a cloture vote and a requirement of 60 votes on major issues \nhas been the rule of the Senate for years. It is a precedent \nlongstanding that we have found on both sides of the aisle, no matter \nwho is in charge, works well on contentious issues.\n  The vast majority of Republicans are ready to vote on cloture \ntonight. We didn't have that opportunity. We are going to vote on \ncloture tomorrow morning at 11. But we also know that if cloture fails, \nwe probably will not be on the Defense bill.\n  The question I have for my colleagues is, they control the Armed \nServices Committee. They wrote the Defense authorization bill. Why in \nthe world, when our troops need guidance, when we need new \nreauthorizations, when we need items for the military that are highly \nimportant to the success now, not just in Iraq but throughout the \nworld, would we pull a bill and not continue to work on it?\n  As a matter of fact, this debate, which we had 2 months ago and now \nare having again, is keeping us from doing some of the business we need \nto be doing in terms of observing and doing oversight of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This Defense authorization bill has $13 billion worth of earmarks, \nearmarks that the Pentagon does not want, but we want, we want for \nconstituencies, we want for campaign supporters, we want because we \nknow better--the very type of thing that is going to hurt in the long \nrun the confidence of the people in this Chamber. So instead of \ncontinuing to work on the Defense authorization bill, it is going to \nget pulled in the morning and we are going to go to higher education \nreconciliation.\n  The question we ought to be asking and what the American people ought \nto ask is, because one vote fails on cloture, do we not have an \nobligation to go on and authorize defense expenditures? I believe we \ndo. One vote should not make or break that bill. It was not part of the \noriginal Defense authorization bill that came out of committee. Why \nwould we not continue to work on it and give our military the \nauthorization to do what they need to do in the future?\n  Someone asked me earlier today if this was a political stunt? No, I \ndon't think so. I think we need to have this debate. I think the more \nthe American people learn about what the consequences are when we leave \nIraq, the more likely they are to have a second thought about the \npressure and tension they feel on this terrible situation. And as they \nlearn what the consequences will be and also see a perspective about\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nat least giving General Petraeus until September 15, as they hear that \ndebate, I think minds will be changed or at least attention will be \nturned to it.\n  A couple of things that I think also ought to be asked on the Reed-\nLevin amendment are, How does the Reed-Levin amendment address Iranian \ninfluence in Iraq in the future? How does the Reed-Levin amendment \naddress increasing Iranian influence in the region, including Iran's \nadverse influence on the Arab-Israeli peace process? How does the Reed-\nLevin amendment guard against a regional conflict? If the policy of the \nReed-Levin amendment became law, would the United States stay out of \nthe humanitarian catastrophe and ethnic cleansing that will surely \nfollow with a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces? If the policy of \nthe Reed-Levin amendment became law, would the United States offer \nfinancial assistance to neighboring countries forced to absorb the \nmassive number of refugees fleeing such a conflict? If the policy of \nthe Reed-Levin amendment became law, what would the cost be to the U.S. \nTreasury in lives if the United States eventually had to return to the \nMiddle East, in terms of forces?\n  I don't think those questions can go unanswered in this debate, and \nyet they have not been addressed. What we do know is we have a \ntinderbox. What we don't know, but some are suggesting, is the \ntinderbox will quiet down if we leave. If we leave, I hope they are \nright. I don't think they are right.\n  I think this is a time that will really test the mettle of this \ncountry. I think the conflict we see over the debate in this body is \nnot bad for our country; I think it is good for our country. It is one \nof the attributes that make us strong.\n  Leaving Iraq, losing in Iraq will be terrible for our country in the \nlong run--not in the short run but in the long run. It will limit our \ninfluence in the Middle East. It will limit the trust and viability of \nour Nation with every other nation under which we have any type of \nsecurity arrangement. But most importantly, it will put us back 10 to \n15 years in terms of doing what we need to do in the world.\n  Senator Durbin and I are working hard on the Darfur situation. Darfur \nis going to seem like a blip on a screen compared to what is going to \nhappen in Iraq when we leave.\n  What we do know is what is happening in Iraq today, the concentration \nof the violence, especially the suicide bombers. Two things are \nhappening. One is they are moving away from the areas in which the \nsurge is employed. That is why you see Kirkuk the first time hit. But \nwe also know that 85 percent of the suicide bombers aren't Iraqis; they \nare al-Qaida, from outside of Iraq. I suspect they are going to \noverplay their hand like they did in Anbar Province, which is why those \nSunnis now are allied with coalition forces.\n  So I would ask the Members of this body, No. 1, to not assume that \nany of us who support the present course until September in Iraq have \nhad our arms twisted. We have not. We actually believe it is the best \npolicy. I don't believe we need to have our moral compass checked, as \nsuggested by the Senator from New Jersey. We just happen to have a \ndifference of opinion. And the difference really doesn't stem on any \nfactual basis, but it stems on long-range versus short-range thinking.\n  When I took the oath for this office, my oath was to uphold the \nConstitution and to do what was best for the country--not for my \npolitical career, not what will win the next election, not what will \nget me more seats in the Senate, but what I truly thought in my heart \nand mind would be great and best for this country.\n  The Iraq war is a perplexing situation for all of us. I believe it is \nwrong for us to stop in the middle of a surge that is having some \nprogress. Not what we would like, maybe, not to the degree we would \nlike, but for the first time, in approximately 2 years, it is making \npositive things out of things that were very negative.\n  It is my hope that as we continue this debate, we will recognize that \nthe most important question is, Then what? What happens if the Reed-\nLevin amendment becomes law? What happens to our military? What happens \nin the Middle East? What happens in Iran, which is now known to be \ntraining a vast number of people to influence the outcome? What happens \nto the morale of our military? What happens to our relationship with \nallies around the world when we can no longer be counted on as a \nreliable partner? What next?\n  That is the question we should be debating--what next? What are the \nconsequences of not fulfilling a moral obligation to clean up a mess we \nhelped create? You can say we don't have that obligation, but we do. \nHistory will judge this Nation on how it handles this situation. We \nmay, in fact, walk away, but if we did, and if we do, I believe we \nbelie the heritage of the sacrifice that has been made by so many \npeople for so many years in our history that predates us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have listened to most of the comments \nmade by my friend from Oklahoma, and I think he asked some good \nquestions, things we all have to consider about what will happen when \nwe leave.\n  The Senator talked about the moral obligations, what moral \nobligations we have. I wonder what moral obligation we had back in the \n1980s when Donald Rumsfeld went to visit with Saddam Hussein? What \nmoral responsibility did we have in the Reagan administration when we \nsupported Saddam Hussein, gave him weapons, and gave him information in \nhis war against Iran? What was our moral obligation at that time?\n  We hear about what will happen when we leave, all this talk about a \nbloodbath and everything. Well, Madam President, I can remember \nVietnam. I can remember the same things: Oh, if we leave Vietnam--we \neither fight them there or we fight them here. We have to stop the \nCommunists in Vietnam or it will be the Philippines next and then \nJapan. We have to stop them there. And if we leave, there will be a \nbloodbath in Vietnam. All of the people who supported us will be \nslaughtered in the streets.\n  Well, it didn't happen. Here today, with Vietnam, we have diplomatic \nrelations. I think we just had the new Ambassador or President come \nover and meet with President Bush in the White House. Cruise ships, \nthese big cruise ships now dock over in Saigon and people get off and \ngo into Saigon. Americans take cruise ships over there in Vietnam and \ngo to the beaches. You look back and you think about those 50,000-plus \nAmericans who died over there, and you wonder, what was that all about? \nWhat was that moral obligation all about?\n\n  So, again, we haven't learned from the past. The specter is always \nraised that calamities will happen if we don't follow what the \nPresident wants. Well, the President is not always right. This \nPresident and his colleagues here couldn't be more wrong about our \ncourse in Iraq.\n  So I have come to the floor this evening on behalf of many Iowans who \nhave been calling and e-mailing my office. The overwhelming majority of \npeople in my State have turned against the war in Iraq, as have the \noverwhelming majority of Americans elsewhere. According to a USA Today/\nGallup poll released last week, 71 percent of Americans favor removing \nall U.S. troops from Iraq by April 1 of next year.\n  The American people are sick of seeing our brave men and women killed \nand maimed in what has become a vicious civil war in Iraq. They want to \nchart a new course in Iraq, a course out of that civil war. They simply \ncan't believe President Bush and his allies in this body have responded \nto their wishes with a strategy of obstruction, filibuster, and veto \nthreats. They can't believe Republican Senators here are blocking votes \non the No. 1 issue before our Nation, the No. 1 issue on the minds of \nthe American people.\n  All we are asking of our Republican colleagues is let us vote. Let us \nvote up or down on whether we want to extricate ourselves from Iraq and \nbring the troops home. In a nutshell, people have been calling my \noffice saying that Republican Senators certainly have a right to \nsupport President Bush's war in Iraq, they have a right to advocate \nthat we stay the course, but our Republican colleagues should not claim \na right to block simple up-or-down votes on amendments calling for a \nnew course in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n  The President and his allies are demanding we wait until September \nbefore we act, but this is the same game of obstruction and delay they \nhave been playing for years now. Time and again, the President has \nannounced a new plan, a new strategy for victory in Iraq. Time and \nagain, the President has asked for patience. Time and again, he has \ncited progress and suggested that success is just around the corner. \nSounds just like Vietnam. Meanwhile, with each new plan, with every new \nstrategy, the United States gets dragged deeper and deeper into the \nquagmire in Iraq. More Americans get killed and maimed, more innocent \nIraqi men, women, and children are killed and wounded, and Iraq spirals \ndeeper into chaos and sectarian division. Sounds just like Vietnam.\n  The President's spokesmen insult our intelligence, saying that the \nsurge is only a couple weeks old, that we should give it a chance. As \nwe all know, it was announced in January, more than 6 months ago. I \nremember very well because 1 day after the President announced his \nsurge, 640 soldiers from the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard \nwere told they would not be coming home from Anbar Province as planned. \nInstead, their combat tour would be extended to 16 months--nearly a \nyear and a half in the middle of the most deadly combat in Iraq.\n  Since the surge began back in January, 615 more U.S. troops have died \nin Iraq. Many thousands more have been injured. Since the surge was \nannounced, eight more soldiers from Iowa have been killed in Iraq, \nincluding a second soldier from the small town of Tipton, IA. Think \nabout that, a small community of 3,100 people in rural Iowa has lost \ntwo of its sons in Iraq.\n  On Sunday, the Washington Post published a story about Tipton, IA, \nand its growing disillusionment with the war in Iraq. The story noted \nthat in the first 6 months of this year--since the surge began--125 \ntroops from 10 Midwestern States have died in Iraq, the bloodiest \nstretch of the war so far.\n  Mr. President, as more and more Iowans and other Americans turn \nagainst this war, as more and more of our young men and women are \nkilled and wounded, the administration asks us to be patient. But \npatience is not a virtue in the face of a manifestly failed policy, and \nthere is no virtue in staying the course when the course you are on is \ndragging you deeper and deeper into a geopolitical disaster.\n  Just last week, the administration issued the required progress \nreport on benchmarks for Iraq. As expected, the report shows that the \nGovernment in Baghdad has failed to meet any of the benchmarks for \npolitical and economic reform. The Iraqis have failed to make progress \nin passing a law governing the sharing of oil revenues. They have \nfailed to make progress in allowing former Baath party members to \nreturn to their jobs. They have failed to make progress in disarming \nmilitias. They have failed to make progress in organizing new \nprovincial elections. Failure after failure after failure. Indeed, the \nonly thing the Sunni, Shiites and the Kurds in Parliament have agreed \non is that they will go on vacation in the month of August.\n  The American people refuse to be patient in the face of this \nmonumental failure. And I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Lugar's \nremarks on this floor to the effect that we cannot and should not wait \nuntil September to begin to chart a new course. The war has been \nspiraling downward for 52 months. What possible difference could 2 \nmonths make?\n  Indeed, I can predict right now what will happen when we get General \nPetraeus's report in mid-September. Against all evidence to the \ncontrary, the President will cherry-pick the report to claim positive \nmilitary results from the surge, and he will say those results justify \nstaying the course until the end of the year or into next spring or for \nanother year. Indeed, yesterday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff said the surge could well be followed by a request for even more \ntroops. I was told today that about 50 percent of our troops in Iraq \nare now National Guard and reservists.\n  Well, it is abundantly clear to me that this President has no \nintention whatsoever of changing course or reducing the number of \ntroops in Iraq through the end of his term on January 20, 2009. He will \nonly change course when and if he is compelled to do so by the \nCongress, and that is exactly what a clear majority of the Senate is \nattempting to do with amendments to this Defense authorization bill.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment was basically passed by the House. But now, \nRepublican Senators here will not allow us to vote on it. All we are \nasking is to let us vote up or down on the Levin-Reed amendment. The \nPresident and his allies are responding with a furious campaign of \nobstruction, filibuster, and veto threats. They refuse to listen. They \nrefuse to learn. They refuse to consider a new direction. All we are \nasking is, let us vote. Let us vote.\n  I personally know many Iowans serving in our Armed Forces. Whether \nActive Duty or the Guard or Reserve, they are disciplined professionals \nwho love their country. Even those who profoundly disagree with the war \nand the surge will continue to do their duty. They deserve our profound \nrespect and admiration. But we need to listen to them. We need to \nlisten to their families.\n  So I have come to the floor tonight to read just a few of the e-mails \nand letters I have received in recent days. One of them is from Peggy--\nI won't use her last name--from Council Bluffs, IA, whose son is \nserving in Iraq, and here is what she writes:\n\n       My 19-year-old son is in Iraq with the United States Army. \n     Please, please get us out of this horrific nightmare and \n     bring them all home. I can't go a day without crying, as I \n     worry about him. Every single member of our brave military \n     that dies in this quagmire is a waste, a tragic waste of \n     life. If my son were to be killed over there, I could never \n     reconcile to it due to the fact that we should not be over \n     there in the first place. We invaded a country based on lies \n     and have caused the death and suffering of untold thousands \n     of Iraqi people. Please vote to withdraw the troops.\n\n  Peggy, all I can tell you is that is what we are trying to do. We are \ntrying to get a vote up or down to get your son and the troops out of \nIraq and bring them home. But our Republican colleagues will not allow \nus to have that vote.\n  I received the following letter from Regina--again, I will not use \nher last name--from Bloomfield, IA. She writes:\n\n       While reading some articles yesterday, I ran across several \n     stating the possibility of extending even more the tours of \n     duty of our soldiers in Iraq. Is there anybody thinking about \n     these soldiers other than how many live in a day and how many \n     die? Do they understand how hard this is on these soldiers, \n     and costly to our Government? And more important, the \n     tremendous pain and agony on the families of these troops? \n     Have you ever been in a war zone for an extended time, or \n     members of your family--in Vietnam, Kuwait or Iraq? . . . If \n     you sense frustration here, it is. [I feel it] every time we \n     lose a soldier over there for something we can never win. . . \n     . I have never taken as much to heart, and fear for my \n     grandchildren. . . . Where is the common sense of our \n     country?\n\n  Regina, we are here, pleading with our Republican colleagues for \ncommon sense. Let us vote up or down on the Levin-Reed amendment, that \nis all we ask. That is what all these letters are asking, basically.\n  Let me read portions of a letter from Barbara of Waverly.\n\n       I sit here to write this letter, not knowing why, since I'm \n     feeling like no one cares anymore or will be able to do \n     anything about it. I am a 41-year-old woman, a military wife \n     of 23 years and a mother of 3. My husband's unit is currently \n     serving in Iraq and has been gone for 16 months so far on \n     this mission. The soldiers and the families were finally \n     feeling like we were seeing the light at the end of the \n     tunnel. As the new year began, we started our countdown for \n     our reunions expected in April. Our worlds came crashing down \n     once again as we learned that our loved ones would not be \n     coming home in April but were being extended until August, \n     thus being deployed for almost 2 years by the time they \n     return. I am angry, I am devastated. How could this happen? I \n     have lost all hope and faith in our Government. I don't \n     understand politics, so my biggest question is, if so many \n     people are against this war and the increase in troops being \n     sent over, then why is the President not listening? Doesn't \n     he care? I voted for him and believed in him and he has let \n     me down. . . .Please think about the effects this is having \n     on our soldiers and their families. We have all given so much \n     and though we are proud to have been part of serving our \n     country, it is time for our soldiers to come home. Please, \n     bring them home.\n\n  Barbara, all I can say is that is what we are trying to do. All we \nare asking is that we be allowed to vote up or down on the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n  Let me read excerpts from one more letter. That is why I am reading \nthese.\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nThere are probably a lot of things I can say about this issue, but I \nthink it is more poignant to read the letters from Iowans, people who \nhave been tragically touched by this war. This one is from a mother in \nDows, IA.\n\n       I have a 19-year-old son, my only child, who is fighting in \n     Iraq. He is a smart, strong and brave infantry soldier. He \n     has always wanted to be a soldier and is proud to serve in \n     the United States Army. He is our pride and joy. Heaven \n     forbid if anything happens to him in Iraq, my husband and I \n     will be crushed beyond measure. . . . My point in telling you \n     all this is that we are talking about young lives that have a \n     bright future. This is not some political game. Why should \n     our Government put our soldiers' lives at risk for a civil \n     war in Iraq? Like it or not, that's what it is, a civil war, \n     and our precious soldiers are smack dab in the middle of it. \n     . . . Why should our soldiers be losing limbs and even dying \n     for a group of people who can't get along and will probably \n     never get along? Iraq did not attack us. . . . Things are \n     going from bad to worse in Iraq. . . . Unless you have a \n     loved one fighting in Iraq, you can't begin to understand how \n     difficult it is. It is time to get the troops back home and \n     back to their families. Every one of these soldiers who have \n     died meant ``everything'' to someone. They were a husband, \n     wife, son, daughter, grandchild or close friend to someone. . \n     . .I am neither a Republican nor Democrat, I am just an \n     American mother who wants this violent war stopped and to get \n     our soldiers home safe.\n\n  I can say to this mother, that is what we are trying to do. We are \ntrying to get a vote. Let us vote. Let us vote up or down on a deadline \nfor getting our troops out of Iraq. What are the Republicans so afraid \nof? Why are they so afraid to let the Senate express its will?\n  I want all of our colleagues to listen especially closely to the \nfinal words from this soldier's mother. This is from Dows, IA. She \nwrites:\n\n       With the overwhelming majority of the American people \n     wanting to bring our soldiers home and stop the war, don't \n     you think, since you actually work for the American people \n     and are elected by the American people, that you should \n     seriously consider our views and hear our voices? Someone \n     told me I was wasting my time writing this letter, but I \n     believe otherwise. I want my voice heard and isn't this what \n     democracy and freedom are all about? I plead with you with \n     all my heart that you will consider this and do what is best \n     for our troops, their families, and the United States.\n\n  That is the end of that letter. Yes, you are right, we actually work \nfor the American people. Your voices should be heard. That is what \ndemocracy and freedom is all about. Yet we are not being allowed to \nhave your voices heard here on the Senate floor in terms of a vote. \nBecause of the Republican filibuster, we can't. Once again, all we are \nasking is a very simple request from our Republican colleagues: Let us \nvote up or down. Why are you so afraid of that?\n  The letters and e-mails coming to my office are heartbreaking. They \ntell the story of lives disrupted, lives put at risk, lives in a war \nthat the overwhelming majority of Americans believe was a tragic \nmistake. Now 6 months into a surge that has failed to significantly \nreduce the violence in Iraq, 6 months into a surge that has utterly \nfailed to bring about any progress or reconciliation within the Iraqi \nGovernment, Republicans in the Senate are pulling out the stops to \nblock a simple up-or-down vote on charting a new course in Iraq.\n  Once again, I plead, I ask, let us vote. Let us vote. All we are \nasking is just that opportunity, a simple up-or-down vote. Let us have \nthe vote.\n  Frankly, I was shocked last week when Republicans on the other side \nof the aisle filibustered Senator Webb's amendment which was even \nsupported by the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner. The amendment would only have required that \nactive-duty troops receive as much time at home recuperating and \ntraining as they spend deployed in combat. The amendment even allowed \nfor a Presidential waiver if the troops were needed for an emergency. \nThis ought to have been an amendment to have drawn strong bipartisan \nsupport. After all, many troops in Iraq are now in their third or even \nfourth deployment. The Army Chief of Staff has warned Congress that the \ncurrent pace of combat deployment threatens to ``break'' the Army.\n  The Webb amendment would have passed if we had been allowed a simple \nup-or-down vote, a majority vote. Isn't that what we believe in? We \nbelieve in a majority vote. Majority votes elect the President. \nMajority votes here pass bills. There was a majority here to pass the \nWebb amendment, but because the Republicans filibustered it, we needed \n60 votes. We couldn't get an up-or-down vote on that amendment.\n  The wives and mothers and family members who have written to me and \nwhose words I placed here in the Record tonight have their own idea of \nwhat it means to support the troops. They believe it means allowing the \nSenate to have a straight up-or-down vote on these amendments to ensure \ndecent treatment of our troops. They believe it means allowing a \nstraight up-or-down vote on whether we need to have a new direction in \nIraq. But they are being denied this by a willful, obstructionist \nminority here in the Senate, a minority that believes, frankly, they \nknow better than the American people; a minority that insists on \nendlessly prolonging a war that the American people want to bring to a \nclose.\n  The American people are not only angry about this war, they are angry \nthe way our brave men and women in uniform have been misused and \nmistreated. The President rushed our troops into combat without proper \nequipment and in insufficient numbers. He has insisted on staying the \ncourse of that failed policy for more than 4 miserable years. He has \nsent troops back to Iraq for a third and even fourth rotation, with \ninsufficient time to retrain and regroup.\n  In January he decided to roll the dice one more time by throwing \nanother 30,000 troops into the middle of this sectarian civil war in \nBaghdad. Now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is suggesting \nthat come September the President may decide to send even more troops \nto Iraq. At this point, the single best way to support the troops is to \ntell President Bush more than 4 years of bungling, bad judgment, and \nbullheadedness is enough. We have complete and total confidence in our \ntroops, but we have no confidence in your leadership or in pursuing \nthis war any further.\n  This evening we have reached an extraordinary juncture. We have a \nsurge in Iraq now 6 months old which was designed to give the Iraqi \nGovernment breathing space for reconciliation.\n  As I said, the only thing the Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds in \nParliament have agreed on is that they will go on vacation in August. \nMeanwhile, here in Washington we have a President refusing to listen to \nthe American people, supported by a Republican minority in Congress \nthat is determined to obstruct any legislation charting a new course. \nIf they prevail, if the President and his Republican obstructionists in \nthe Senate prevail, our military units will be deployed again and again \nand again until they finally break and the United States will stay \nbogged down and bleeding in Iraq, creating terrorists around the world \nfaster than we could ever hope to kill them.\n  It has reached the point, frankly, where you are either on the side \nof the President and his failed policies or you side with the American \npeople and our military commanders who have concluded there is no \nmilitary solution to the mess in Iraq. You either support this endless, \npointless war or you support a smarter, more focused campaign against \nthe terrorists who truly threaten us. It is unconscionable that the \nRepublican leader, at the behest of President Bush, is refusing to \nallow the Senate to vote on changing our course in Iraq. At long last \nit is time for them to listen to the American people, to the families \nof our troops in the field. The Senate should be allowed to vote on the \nNo. 1 issue facing this country.\n  It is time the Republicans stop their obstruction to allow the Senate \nto work its will. It is time for Republicans to let us vote, up or \ndown, simply up or down on the Levin-Reed amendment to chart a new \ncourse in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthis very important issue. We are here in this wee hour of the morning. \nThere have been a lot of accusations flying back and forth today, this \nevening, about why we are here and what this is about. But I do want to \nremind my colleagues of what this is about. The underlying legislation, \nthe Defense authorization bill, H.R. 1585, says it very clearly here. \nIt is:\n\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\n\n       To authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \n     strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n\n  That is what we are here for. We are here to do something we do every \nyear, or that we have done every year for the past 45 years, and that \nis pass the Defense authorization bill. What that Defense authorization \nbill does is it authorizes a 3.5-percent across-the-board pay raise for \nall military personnel. It increases Army and Marine end strength to \n525,400 and 189,000, respectively. It also approves $2.7 billion for \nitems on the Army Chief of Staff's unfunded requirement list, including \n$775 million for reactive armor and other Stryker requirements, $207 \nmillion for aviation survivability equipment, $102 million for combat \ntraining centers and funding for explosive ordnance disposal equipment, \nnight vision devices, and machineguns.\n  The bill also authorizes $4.1 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected Vehicles, known as MRAP vehicles, for all of the services' \nknown requirements.\n\n  That is what the underlying bill would do. That is what this debate \nshould be about. It ought to be about taking care of the needs of our \nmen and women in uniform who we have asked, day in and day out, to do a \nvery difficult task, and that is to protect America's freedoms around \nthe world. We have lots of them deployed in different places around the \nworld.\n  What is interesting to me, as I have listened to the debate about \nthis particular amendment, the Levin-Reed amendment, throughout the \ncourse of the day, is I keep hearing this distinction between \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and how somehow Afghanistan is a good war and \nIraq is a bad war. The reason is in Afghanistan we aren't having as \nmany casualties as we are in Iraq. We are taking on a lot of casualties \nin Iraq. That is where they are killing our soldiers, and the reason we \nare taking on casualties in Iraq is because that is where our soldiers \nare. If we move troops to Afghanistan, they will starting killing our \ntroops there because that is what they are and that is what they do; \nthey are killers whose goal is to kill Americans and they are going to \nkeep coming at us.\n  I do not think sometimes our colleagues on the other side see this \nfor what it is, a titanic struggle between good and evil, between \nradical Islam and nations that cherish freedom.\n  I have to say I believe the men and women in uniform understand that \nwhen they are fighting al-Qaida, it doesn't matter where they are \nfighting them. They are our enemy, they are our adversary, they are the \npeople who are out to kill and destroy us, whether that is in \nAfghanistan or in Iraq. They are a global terrorist network intent on \ndestroying us and our allies.\n  Our young men and women in uniform deserve to have this Defense \nauthorization bill passed so they have the funding and the equipment \nand the weapons and the training and everything that is necessary for \nthem to succeed and to achieve their mission, which is to protect us \nfrom terrorist organizations and terrorist threats, such as al-Qaida.\n  I have also heard it said that al-Qaida is--there were a lot of \nquotes today from the National Intelligence Estimate about where the \nreal threats are around the world, but I have to read for you what some \nof the judgements and findings were of the National Intelligence \nEstimate. It says:\n\n       We assess the greatly increased worldwide counterterrorism \n     efforts over the past 5 years have constrained the ability of \n     al-Qaida to attack the U.S. homeland again and have led \n     terrorist groups to perceive the homeland as a harder target \n     to strike than before 9/11. These measures have helped \n     disrupt known plots against the United States since 9/11.\n\n  That is the good news.\n  But it goes on to say:\n\n       We assess that al-Qaida will continue to advance its \n     capabilities to attack the homeland through greater \n     cooperation with regional terrorist groups. Of note: We \n     assess that al-Qaida will probably seek to leverage the \n     contacts and capabilities of al-Qaida in Iraq, its most \n     visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have \n     expressed a desire to attack the homeland.\n       In addition, we assess that its association with al-Qaida \n     in Iraq helps al-Qaida to energize the broader Sunni \n     extremist community, raise resources, and to recruit and \n     indoctrinate operatives, including for homeland attacks.\n       We assess that al-Qaida will continue to try to acquire and \n     employ chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear \n     material in attacks and would not hesitate to use them if it \n     develops what it deems to be sufficient capability.\n\n  That is what the National Intelligence Estimate has to say about our \nenemy and what their capabilities are. And again, I have to reiterate \nthat I think, as I have listened to this debate throughout the course \nof the day, that people continue to make a discrepancy between \nAfghanistan, the good war, and Iraq, the bad war. The problem is, it is \nthe same enemy, it is the same al-Qaida, intent on the same objective \nto kill and destroy Americans. We have to fight al-Qaida every place we \ncan to make sure they do not take that war right here and those attacks \nof the United States to our homeland.\n  Debating a change in policy in Iraq, particularly given what we just \ndid last May, is premature, and that is why I am going to oppose the \nLevin-Reed amendment.\n  This past May, the Senate passed the 2007 Iraq supplemental which \nrequired two reports by the President. The first was released just days \nago, and the second will be released in September. These reports will \nassess whether the Iraqi Government is making sufficient progress with \nrespect to the 18 benchmarks. The interim July report stated that we \nare making satisfactory progress toward meeting 8 of the 18 benchmarks. \nWhile there is much work that remains to be done, the new strategy is \nstill in its early stages.\n  We need to make sure our forces can set the conditions for that \nprogress to continue and to succeed. There have been some encouraging \nsigns, but we will not see the full effect of this new strategy until \nGeneral Petraeus's September report. This assessment will provide a \nclearer picture of how the new strategy is unfolding and what, if any, \nadjustments should be made.\n  But I reiterate, that was in May. This Senate acted on an Iraq \nsupplemental in May requiring those two reports. We just received the \nfirst report. The final report we will get in September, and yet here \nwe are today once again debating withdrawal resolutions before we have \neven given our commanders and our troops an opportunity to succeed in \nthis new strategy.\n  The surge operation is intended to clear insurgent opposition so that \nwe can protect the Iraqi population and provide the Iraqi Government a \nstable environment in which to conduct their business. I have said on \nseveral occasions that my support for this war is not open-ended. But \nwe have to give General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker a chance.\n  We have a viable plan in place to gauge the surge operation, success \nof the Iraqi Government, and I cannot support a plan such as this, the \nLevin-Reed amendment, to abandon the legislative provisions we have \nalready enacted. Congress cannot legislate the war strategy, nor do we \nhave the expertise, the staff, or the constitutional authority to \nmicromanage the war. American generals in Iraq, not politicians in \nWashington, should decide how to fight wars. What we are doing as \nlegislators right now is trying to get into the middle of that very \nimportant chain of command.\n  As legislators, our actions on this war have not been consistent. On \nthe one hand, we unanimously confirmed General Petraeus with the hopes \nthat he could bring stability to Iraq; then, on the other hand, we at \nevery turn consider Iraq withdrawal language here on the floor of the \nSenate. So we keep sending conflicting signals.\n  I would remind my colleagues that back in March, the vote to confirm \nGeneral Petraeus was 81 to 0. Eighty-one Senators--no Senators \nobjecting--voted to give him this new responsibility, to entrust him \nwith this very difficult task. Then, in May, we said we would give him \nat least until September, when he would report back to us about the \nprogress he has made. No one said the progress was going to take place \nquickly. We have to be realistic about the pace and scope of change in \nIraq. But mandating timelines for withdrawal or other amendments like \nreauthorizations of the war are not the answer. We are too eager to \ndeclare the surge a failure before it has even been fully implemented.\n  This debate should not be about how quickly we can withdraw but how\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nquickly we can succeed in Iraq so that our troops can come home. Now, \nsadly, many of the provisions we have been discussing here on the floor \nof the Senate are politically motivated by legislators thousands of \nmiles away from the battlefield.\n  During the course of the endless Iraq policy debate, there have been \nstatements from the Democratic leadership such as:\n\n       We are going to pick up Senate seats because of this war.\n\n  And:\n\n       We will break them, the Republicans, because they are \n     looking extinction in the eye.\n\n  Those are direct quotes. These are not legitimate policy statements \nbut the sad politicization of the war on terror.\n  I would add to those some other statements that have been made more \nrecently. Someone said today, earlier this evening, that this has been \ncharacterized as a publicity stunt, keeping the Senate in all night. \nMembers on the other side have gotten up and reacted to this and said \nthis is not a publicity stunt. Well, you have a senior Democratic aide \non FOX News who said: Is this a publicity stunt? Yes. You have the \nmajority leader saying: I do not know if we will get 60 votes, but I \nwill tell you, there are 21 Republicans up for reelection this time. \nYou have other statements by the majority leader saying: We are going \nto pick up Senate seats as a result of this war. Senator Schumer has \nshown me numbers that are compelling and astounding.\n  I do not condemn my colleagues for their legitimate Iraq policy \npositions. As Senators, we have a right to offer amendments. But I \nwould again stress that I believe this is not the time to debate this \nquestion. We have made it very clear in previous legislation that the \ntime for that debate will be in September of this year. I fear that the \ncurrent Iraq policy debate taking place on the Defense authorization \nbill will endanger its passage. This is a bill which, as I said \nearlier, specifically is designed to increase the size of the Army and \nthe Marine Corps, provide increased authorization to purchase more MRAP \nvehicles, provide a 3.5-percent pay increase across the board for our \ntroops, and further empower the Army and Air Force National Guard. We \nshould not endanger this bill when we can have a full and comprehensive \ndebate on Iraq in September, which is what this body, this Congress \nspecifically directed as recently as May.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am committed to seeing \nthis bill pass on the floor of the Senate. I believe it would be a \ncomplete failure of leadership on our part if we failed to pass this \nvery vital measure, while our men and women are engaged in a difficult \nconflict.\n  I will not support amendments to mandate a strategic military shift \nby force of law. As I have said multiple times, Congress should not, \nCongress must not get into the habit of interjecting itself into the \nmilitary chain of command. To do so invites disaster and moves our \ncountry through the premise of conducting wars and military operations \nwith one commander in chief to fighting wars by committee. And history \nhas proven and shown that fighting wars by committee does not work.\n  Last week, I attended the funeral of SSG Robb Rolfing. Sergeant \nRolfing was an Army green beret killed in action by insurgents in \nBaghdad. And I have to say that, again, he was a young man who was \nincredibly skilled and gifted, someone who had tremendous success in \nacademics, in athletics, was an inventor, was a very gifted young man, \nsomeone who had demonstrated great leadership abilities, someone with a \nbig heart, someone who always gave all to everything he had no matter \nwhat he did.\n  After September 11, he was compelled to the service of his country. \nAs he did with everything, he wanted to do the best, and he became the \nbest, he was the best of the best. He was a green beret. Before his \ntragic death, Sergeant Rolfing expressed to his family that he believed \nin what he was doing and there were good things happening in Iraq, that \nthe whole story was not being told.\n  Well, Sergeant Rolfing's voice may be silent, but his message is not. \nI will honor Sergeant Rolfing's sacrifice in my own way--by allowing \nour troops, led by General Petraeus, to continue the work they believe \nin and work that I believe in.\n  Our obligation to the troops and our efforts in Iraq extend far \nbeyond these benchmarks. We all want our troops to begin coming home, \nbut we must first set the conditions for that to happen, without \nrisking a humanitarian disaster in Iraq, sanctuaries for terrorists, or \na broader regional conflict. If you do not believe what I say, there \nare a lot of people who know a lot more about this subject than I do \nwho have come to the very same conclusion.\n  You can look at the comments of GEN Anthony Zinni, who has said:\n\n       We cannot simply pull out of Iraq, as much as we may want \n     to. The consequences of a destabilized and chaotic Iraq, \n     sitting in the center of a critical region of the world, \n     could have catastrophic implications. There is no short-term \n     solution. It will take years to stabilize Iraq. How many? I \n     believe at least 5 to 7.\n\n  Well, I hope he is wrong. I hope it does not take 5 to 7 years. It is \nvery clear from the experts in this region of the world who have \nrepeatedly stated the great risk and danger we put our troops and we \nput the region and we put the United States in if we abandon this \nimportant mission without finishing it.\n  The Iraq Study Group--the Baker-Hamilton report--has been quoted a \nlot on the floor during the course of this debate, sometimes \nselectively. But I also wish to quote for you what that particular \nreport said.\n  It said:\n\n       Because of the importance of Iraq, the potential for \n     catastrophe in the role and the commitments of the United \n     States in initiating events that have led to the current \n     situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States \n     to abandon the country through a precipitous withdrawal of \n     troops and support.\n       A premature American departure from Iraq would almost \n     certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further \n     deterioration of conditions leading to a number of adverse \n     consequences outlined above. The near-term result would be a \n     significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional \n     destabilization and a threat to the global economy.\n       Al-Qaida would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. \n     If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range \n     consequences could eventually require the United States to \n     return.\n\n  That is the Iraq Study Group Baker-Hamilton report, which I think \nalso points out the very serious and disastrous risks we face, the \nconsequences we face of quitting before this job is done.\n\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said:\n\n       Precipitous withdrawal would produce a disaster, one that \n     would not end the war but shift it to other areas like \n     Lebanon, or Jordan or Saudi Arabia, produce greater violence \n     among Iraqi factions and embolden radical Islamists around \n     the world.\n\n  Those are people who, as I said, are incredibly knowledgeable, people \nwho have great experience in this region of the world.\n  But I would like to share with you too, if I might, a letter or an e-\nmail I received from a soldier who has spent a good amount of time in \nIraq. Here is what he said:\n\n       I hope that you do not defect from the current policy on \n     Iraq.\n\n  And this came into my office in the last couple of days.\n\n       Having served there for over 7 months, I know first-hand \n     that this is a fight that is worth fighting and winning. To \n     admit defeat and pull out now would be dishonorable to those \n     that have served. Please allow the military to conduct the \n     war in Iraq and not the politicians. The military commanders \n     are professional soldiers. How many of the members of the \n     Senate have ever served in the military or even know the \n     sacrifices that are endured each and every day? Watching the \n     news, listening to briefings, or going and visiting for a \n     couple of days to the war-torn nation is not ``experience.'' \n     When the commanders say it is time to leave, it is time to \n     leave. Please respect the input of one Marine who has seen \n     the sacrifice and lived the sacrifice and knows what is at \n     stake if we abandon our post.\n\n  I think his sentiments capture very effectively the way a lot of our \nsoldiers view these events.\n  I cannot speak from personal experience as this soldier can. I have \nvisited Iraq on three different occasions. I will tell you that having \nbeen there basically three different times a year apart, there has been \nsignificant progress in some areas of the country. When I went the last \ntime, I went to Ramadi, Fallujah, and Al Anbar Province.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n  In the Washington Post, one of the headlines the week before we went \nover there said, ``Armed and Ready in Ramadi.'' Well, if you look at \nwhat has happened in Al Anbar Province--and John Burns from the New \nYork times recently characterized that the capital city of Anbar, \nRamadi, has ``gone from being one of the most dangerous places in Iraq \nto being one of the least dangerous places.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator and I also went together and saw at that time \nhow Ramadi and Fallujah were basically battlegrounds of enormous \nproportions. Isn't it true that recently both Ramadi--particularly \nRamadi, but also Fallujah is a basically secure area. The last time \nthere has been an attack at Ramadi--they have gone many days. Yet \nsomehow that escapes the notice of some of our colleagues.\n  In fact, I don't know if my friend from South Dakota is, is aware of \nwhat Lieutenant General Lamb, the British lieutenant general, the \ndeputy commander of Multi-National Force, said the other day when the \ngrowing sentiment in our Congress to bring U.S. troops home sooner \naffected the mood of troops deployed in Iraq.\n  He said: I find it a touch difficult because it was so clear to them \nthat we are making progress. It is not reflected by those who are not \nin the fight but are sitting back and making judgment upon what they, \nthe troops, can see with absolute clarity.\n  I guess my question for the Senator from South Dakota is, Is there a \ndisconnect between the rhetoric we hear and all of this stuff about how \nwe are losing--and the majority leader of the Senate said we had lost--\nand the realities on the ground as reflected by the men and who are \nfighting?\n  Mr. THUNE. My colleague from Arizona, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect--and I have had the opportunity to travel a couple of different \ntimes to Iraq with you. I know you have been back since then and have \nseen the marked improvement in that region.\n  I know from having traveled there on several different occasions and \nhaving seen the progress that has taken place and talked with the \ntroops on the ground, those who are there now and those who have been \nthere, as I visit with them, both in my State and different places \naround the country, it is very clear that they view this to be a \ndisconnect. They are very frustrated at the fact, as I said--the \nsoldier whose funeral I attended, the green beret who was killed \nkicking down a door and was shot by an al-Qaida insurgent, before that \nhappened expressed to his family the incredible progress he had noted \nand the fact that does not get adequately covered back here.\n  I think that is a fair statement. The letter, the e-mail I read from \nthe marine here that I just received in the last couple of days said \nthe very same thing. Watching the news, listening to the briefings, or \ngoing and visiting for a couple of days to the war-torn nation is not \nan experience. He believes that we--as do I--that we ought to let our \ncommanders make decisions with regard to our effort there.\n  I would also add that I believe General Petraeus, in whom I have \ngreat confidence, will be very candid when he comes before the Congress \nin September, and I think we ought to give him and our troops an \nopportunity to succeed. The strategy has just been fully implemented as \nthe troops have arrived there just recently. In my view it would be \npremature to do something which would undermine their efforts, and I \nthink the debate we are having here on this particular amendment would \ndo just that, if it is successful.\n  So I hope my colleagues will see their way to do the right thing for \nour troops, listen to the judgment of our commanders, listen to what \nour troops are saying, listen to what our enemies are saying, because I \nthink that is a very relevant point as well. Look at what Zawahari and \nbin Ladin are saying about Iraq and its importance. They realize full \nwell that this is where the battle line is drawn.\n  So I will, as we get to the final vote tomorrow at 11 clock on \ncloture, I will be voting against cloture.\n  Mr. WEBB. Would the Senator from South Dakota agree that the United \nStates military is made up of people with the same diversity of \npolitical views as the country at large?\n  Mr. THUNE. I don't profess to know the answer to what political \npersuasion the members of our military are.\n  Reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order.\n  Mr. THUNE. Reclaiming my time, if I could answer the question of the \nSenator from Virginia, I talk to military personnel all the time. I \nhave heard, as I have heard you express, a poll that the military \ndoesn't like what we are doing in Iraq. That has certainly not been my \nexperience in any conversation I have had with any member of the \nmilitary. I would question any poll result that would conclude what you \nhave stated, as I have heard you state, with regard to the views of our \nmilitary about our work in Iraq.\n  Mr. WEBB. If I may clarify the polls for the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. Go ahead.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order, Madam President.\n  Mr. WEBB. Excuse me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can only yield for a question.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will continue. I appreciate the comments of my friend \nfrom Virginia. I have to say----\n  Mr. WEBB. If I may say, it is more than one poll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, reclaiming my time----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we have to observe the regular order \nhere in the Senate. The Senator from Virginia is clearly not observing \nthe regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me say, as someone who has been to the area--my understanding is \nthat the Senator from Virginia has not traveled to Iraq; perhaps his \nexperience in visiting with members of the military is different from \nmine--I have talked regularly with members of the military. As I have \nnoted from the communication I received from this marine, it was \nreflective of the general response I get whenever I talk about what is \nhappening in Iraq with members who are there currently. I think that is \nvery reflective of the general overall view of those who wear the \nuniform of the United States. They believe in our mission, what we are \ndoing. They want to give the strategy a chance to succeed. I believe we \nneed to do that. I hope we will be able to defeat the Levin-Reed \namendment when it comes up for a vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise because I believe we need to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Levin-Reed amendment. I \nbelieve it is time to change course in Iraq. I believe a majority of \nthe Senate believes we need to change course in Iraq and change the \ncombat role the United States is playing to a role of support. We have \nlost more than 3,600 U.S. soldiers, and my State of Washington has been \ndeeply involved from the very beginning, from the deployment of the USS \nAbraham Lincoln to the service of the Stryker brigade from Fort Lewis \nand the continued service of that brigade on the front lines in Iraq \ntoday. The Stryker brigade has suffered severe casualties, and they \ncontinue to serve us well.\n  The cost of this war has been great, over $450 billion. The United \nStates is now spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. What we are asking \nis the ability to find out whether a majority of the Senate supports \nchanging the course in Iraq. By filibustering, the other side is \npreventing us from finding that out. I am not saying I don't support \nthe rights of the minority to filibuster. I do. But I also respect the \nstrong desire by the American people to see where every Senator stands \non this proposal to change the course in Iraq being proposed today. \nThat is what the debate is about, whether we are going to see how each \nSenator votes on this issue. If the filibuster continues, we won't see \nthat vote.\n  Some people have talked about the surge. I respect those who believe \nand advocate for the surge. I do not support the surge as a strategy. \nThis Senator bought into the milestones that this body approved in the \nWarner-Frist amendment. I believed in a bipartisan effort of 79 \nSenators, in legislation that was a part of the Defense authorization\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nact that was then signed by the President of the United States in \nJanuary 2006.\n  The Warner-Frist amendment said, in a bipartisan fashion, what this \nbody wanted to see happen in Iraq. It said that 2006 should be the year \nof significant transition. We said that 2006 is when Iraqi Security \nForces should take the lead. That is when they should create conditions \nfor a phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq. That was \nthe goal at the end 2006. I took those goals seriously.\n  The Warner-Frist amendment said we should be telling the leaders of \nall groups and all political parties in Iraq that in 2006 they needed \nto make the political compromises necessary to achieve the broad, \nsustainable political settlements that were essential for bringing Iraq \ntogether and defeating the insurgents. Even during that time period, \nPresident Talabani of Iraq said that by the end of 2006 they would be \nable to take over all 18 provinces under their security. So, yes, this \nSenator was greatly disappointed when those goals were not met. Again, \nI did not support the surge because the 2006 milestones were not met. \nIt showed that we were not making sufficient progress in Iraq and \nneeded a change of course.\n  And by any measure today, the Iraqis have not and are not making \nprogress on the political and security benchmarks that need to be \nachieved. Debaathification reform, amendments to the Iraqi \nConstitution, the passage of an oil law--all of these things are being \nstymied. Only seven of the 18 provinces have acquired full \nresponsibility for their own security, even though there are 349,000 \nIraqi security forces that have been trained and equipped.\n  The violence continues in Iraq, everywhere from Kirkuk to Basra. This \nSenator wants to see a change in how we are approaching this situation. \nI want to see more of an aggressive effort on diplomacy and \ninternational engagement to press for political solutions to stabilize \nIraq.\n  This is what the Iraq Study Group called for. It said:\n\n       The United States should immediately launch a new \n     diplomatic offensive to build international consensus for \n     stability in Iraq and the region.\n\n  That is what the Iraq Study Group recommended. It saw that at the \nheart of the violence in Iraq were political disagreements causing a \nlot of turmoil within the country. Those disputes require a diplomatic \nand political solution.\n  I believe this is what is at the core of the Levin-Reed amendment--a \nstrategy to press for a political solution. I know my colleagues \ndisagree on dates and guidelines in the amendment. However, I believe \nin the Levin-Reed amendment, which calls for a comprehensive \ndiplomatic, political, and economic strategy that includes sustained \nengagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international community for \nthe purposes of collectively bringing stability to that region. I \napplaud Senator Hagel for including language in this amendment \nrequiring the United States to work with the United Nations to appoint \nan international mediator for Iraq.\n  I know people believe the United States should continue to play a \nprimary role in Iraqi disputes, but the United Nations and United \nNations Security Council must have a significant role. The \ninternational community should engage in these political and ethnic \nissues that are stymying us. I believe it is time for the international \ncommunity and the United States not to be for the long, hard slog of \ndeployment but for the long, hard slog of diplomacy. The Levin-Reed \namendment creates a framework for international engagement that has \nbeen missing.\n  Why do I believe this is so important? I believe this is important \nbecause I think one of the key benchmarks we are missing that has \ncaused great consternation is the issue of equitable distribution of \nIraqi oil revenue. I wish the Iraqis had successfully passed an oil law \nand it had stabilized the region. It is no surprise that three \ndifferent regions of the country are concerned about the distribution \nof oil revenue. There is a lot of concern about exactly who will have \ncontrol over the oil in those areas, how much oil revenue will be \ndistributed by the federal government, and what role the new Iraqi \nnational oil company will play. But also at the heart of this dispute \nare Iraqi fears that, in the draft oil law, there is a great deal of \nbenefit for foreign oil companies. In fact, the Bush administration has \npushed the current draft of an oil law that allows for the \nprivatization of Iraqi oil.\n  I know that there is a dangerous perception that somehow we went to \nIraq for oil. That was not something this Senator believed. However, \nthere have been many statements that concern me. In fact, Ahmed Chalabi \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil.\n\n  Another European oil executive said:\n\n       For any oil company being in Iraq is like being a kid in \n     FAO Schwarz.\n\n  This Senator did not pay much attention to that, but I am paying \nattention now to the fact that this current draft of an oil law says \nthe Iraqi National Oil Company would have exclusive control--that is \nthe federal entity--of just 17 of Iraq's 80 known oil fields.\n  All the rest, along with all the undiscovered oil, would be open to \nforeign control. So the majority of oil in Iraq would be open to \nforeign control. Why is this such a big deal? It is important because \nat one time Iraqi oil reserves were seen as the second largest in the \nworld. Today they are probably somewhere between the third and fourth \nlargest oil reserves.\n  In fact, the Heritage Foundation, in 2003, released a paper \nadvocating for the privatization of Iraq's oil and arguing that Iraq's \nreconstruction and privatization of its oil and gas sector could become \na model for oil industry privatization in other OPEC states as well.\n  I know that may be attractive to people who think we should stay \nthere and somehow glom on to Iraqi oil. This Senator does not believe \nthat is what we should be doing.\n  I know that many people have mentioned former Secretary of State \nKissinger's recent policy op-ed piece. He said we cannot allow the \nIraqi energy supply to be controlled by a country with Iran's \nrevolutionary and taunting foreign policy. He suggested that, if we \nleave and Iran takes over, they will have control of the Iraqi oil. But \nI would refer those who agree with Kissinger to the Iraq Study Group's \nconclusion:\n\n       The United States can begin to shape a positive climate for \n     diplomatic efforts internationally with Iraq through public \n     statements that reject the notion that the United States \n     seeks to control Iraq's oil or seeks to have permanent bases \n     within Iraq.\n\n  We are sending the wrong message in Iraq if we continue to support a \npolicy that gives the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government the notion \nthat we are there to try to control the oil.\n  Like the Iraq Study Group, I believe the international community and \ninternational energy companies should invest in Iraqi oil. Foreign \nexpertise in investment is important to upgrading the infrastructure \nand boosting production. But that international involvement must come \nat Iraq's initiative, and the Iraqi people must decide what level of \nforeign participation is best for their country.\n  We need to send the Iraqi people, the people of the Middle East, and \nthe world a message that is loud and clear--we do not intend to stay in \nIraq for their oil. To that end, I am happy to cosponsor with my \ncolleague Senator Biden a resolution that calls on us to clearly \narticulate that we have no intention of keeping permanent U.S. bases in \nIraq or any intentions of exercising control over Iraqi oil.\n  Before we went into Iraq, there were a lot of people, including the \nVice President, who said we would get X million barrels a day from \nIraq. Former Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz estimated at one point \nin time the oil revenues of that country would bring us between $50 and \n$100 billion over the next 2 to 3 years. One State Department \nspokesperson said oil would be the ``engine of Iraq's reconstruction. \nNo one is talking about a Marshall plan for Iraq because the oil will \ntake care of that.''\n  That did not happen. Today we see a bogged-down political process in \nIraq because they are fighting over oil. We can move ahead, and this \namendment by my colleagues Senators Levin and Reed gives us the \nframework to do that. Our efforts here in the Senate are moving forward \non a diversified plan to\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nget off our overdependence on Middle East oil. They are also critically \nimportant.\n  I know some would say: Well, it is important that we make sure that \nterrorists don't get their hands on Iraqi oil money. I would remind my \ncolleagues that a U.S. Government report that was obtained by the New \nYork Times said many insurgents involved in terrorist attacks in Iraq \nare already raising $25 to $100 million a year from oil smuggling and \ncriminal activities.\n  It is important to secure Iraqi oil infrastructure and for the Iraqis \nto resolve their disputes over oil rights.\n  I believe we should move ahead on a framework that has more \ninternational involvement. The United States and the international \ncommunity should be trying to bring Iraqis together to reach \ncompromises on these important issues. I believe this is something the \nUnited States can achieve.\n  Some people may look at the problems in Iraq, the ongoing ethnic \nviolence, the division between the Sunnis and Shiites and the Kurds, \nand think it is impossible to stabilize the country. But the United \nStates has stepped up to serious international challenges in the past \nand stabilized new governments that have also been plagued by ethnic \nviolence and long histories of dispute.\n  How did we do it? All we have to do is look at the former Yugoslavia \nwhere the international community got together with various parties, \nfrom the European Union to Russia to NATO to countries in the region, \nand built a framework that ended serious ethnic violence. The civil war \nin Bosnia resulted in 100,000 to 110,000 deaths. While it is not on the \nsame scale as the challenges we face in Iraq, the peace the United \nStates was able to help achieve was nonetheless remarkable.\n  We must do the same thing in Iraq. We need the help of the United \nNations, the Arab League, and the rest of Iraq's neighbors, and we need \nthe framework in the amendment my colleagues Senators Levin and Reed \nhave authored. It would put us on a path toward a real comprehensive \ndiplomatic and political solution for Iraq.\n  We deserve the chance to have an up or down vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment. It is now an important time for us to realize that the \nbenchmarks we set have not, and are not, being met. We need a change of \ncourse in Iraq. We need to have more involvement by the international \ncommunity in solving the political problems on the ground. The Levin-\nReed amendment would make a strong statement about what the U.S. hopes \nto achieve in stabilizing the Iraqi government. And we need to put to \nrest the notion that the United States will stay in Iraq for oil or for \npermanent U.S. bases. We cannot continue in an endless combat role in \nIraq.\n  We need to change the course, and we can have a policy that allows us \nto do that by holding an up or down vote on this amendment today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all, I express my profound \ngratitude to my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, for his unsurpassed and \nexemplary leadership on so many defense and national security issues \nthroughout his distinguished career.\n  I rise to speak to the monumental, consequential matter before us \nwith regard to the future course of the United States and our \ncourageous men and women in Iraq, and specifically to express my \nsupport and cosponsorship of the amendment that is presently before the \nSenate that has been authored by the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. I thank \nthem for their hard work and outstanding leadership on this historic \nmatter.\n  I recognize that none of us arrives at this debate lightly. In my 28-\nyear tenure in Congress, I have witnessed and participated in debates \non such vital matters as Lebanon, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, \nBosnia, and Kosovo. Indisputably, a myriad of deeply held beliefs were \nexpressed on those pivotal matters--some in concert, some \ncomplimentary, some in conflict. Yet, without question, all were rooted \nin mutual concern for and love of our great Nation. Without question, \nthat remains so today with the various proposals that are before us.\n  I remind my colleagues in the Senate that the framework that has been \nembraced in the amendment authored by Senator Levin and Senator Reed is \none that is not without precedent throughout our history in the actions \ntaken by this institution in previous conflicts. So it is not a \ndeparture from precedent but very consistent with precedent in the \npast. Where we make decisions to impose our imprint on a longstanding \nconflict is obviously of critical consequence to this Nation.\n  In my view, 4\\1/2\\ years following the commencement of our military \noperations in Iraq, and 6 months after the troop surge was announced \nand was initiated, we now stand at the crossroads between help and \nreality with respect to the Iraqi Government's ability or even \nwillingness to achieve national reconciliation for its own country and \nits own people.\n  The time has come to address that reality. The time has come to \ndetermine if our military and our strategy should continue on the basis \nof perpetually hoping the Iraqis will succeed or whether they actually \npossess the desire and the drive to place their national interest above \ntheir sectarian ambitions.\n  In my considered examination and analysis, taking into account my \nvisits to Iraq--most recently in May--the facts and information we \nalready have had at hand, the record of serial intransigence on the \npart of the Iraqi Government regarding its inability to forge the \npolitical underpinnings essential for national reconciliation, and the \nfact there is universal agreement that a military solution alone is not \npossible, I believe a dramatic and fundamental change in our strategy \nin Iraq is essential and that Congress must require it based on that \nreality.\n  Because while the hands of time have now advanced in what has been \ndescribed as sort of the 11th hour for Iraqi political reconciliation, \nin fact, in many ways, I see progress has moved in a regressive \nfashion. We can no longer afford to place more American service men and \nwomen in harm's way to instill a peace that the Iraqis seem unwilling \nto seek for themselves.\n  I do not come to this conclusion casually or abruptly. Far from it. \nIndeed, following the President's address to the Nation in January, in \nwhich he unveiled a ``New Way Forward in Iraq'' through primarily \nincreasing troop levels, I was among the first to publicly oppose that \nplan. In my view, it addressed neither the root cause of the violence \nin Iraq that was fueled by longstanding and deep-seated sectarian \nconflicts, nor the failure of the Iraqi Government to either \ndemonstrate the will or capacity to quell that sectarian violence.\n  It is incumbent upon the Iraqi people and their Government to work \ntoward their own national unity. At that juncture, when we were about \nto assume even greater risk on behalf of the future of Iraq, there was, \nfrankly, no compelling evidence that the Iraqis were willing to assume \nsimilar risks for a united future that only they can truly secure.\n  Therefore, I then joined my colleagues Senators Biden, Levin, and \nHagel, in introducing a Senate resolution that opposed the surge and \ninstead would have urged the President to increase our counterterrorism \nefforts, maintain the territorial integrity of Iraq, promote regional \nstability through a renewed diplomatic offensive, and continue the \ntraining of the Iraqi security forces--all without withdrawing \nprecipitously.\n  I said at the time that it was essential for the Congress to make our \nvoices heard in a policy that has significant implications not only for \nour Nation and the Middle East but, indeed, the world community. I \nbelieve our bipartisan proposal would have offered a clear expression \nfor a new strategy that would have compelled, in the words of the \nresolution itself, ``the Iraqi political leaders to make the political \ncompromises necessary to end the violence.'' Unfortunately, the measure \ndid not generate sufficient support at the time, and now we find \nourselves confronting a similar situation only 6 months later.\n\n  In May, I traveled again to Iraq, where the good news was mixed and \nthe bad news was deeply disturbing. First and foremost, I want to say \nour troops\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\nwere performing superbly and courageously and in an extremely complex \nand challenging environment. I am certain every Member of this body \nwould agree when I say the men and women fighting for this great Nation \nare integral members of the most professional and dedicated military \nthe world has ever witnessed. So there is no question--no question--of \nour troops' heroic commitment.\n  Indeed, I witnessed the improved security situation, as has been \nmentioned many times on the floor, in Ramadi. I was part of the first \ncongressional group to travel into downtown Ramadi and visit a joint \nsecurity post. In that city, the tribal sheiks and the Iraqi forces \nhave begun to work in conjunction with our own forces to fight a common \nenemy, and that common enemy is al-Qaida. We know the success, and \nclearly it was a model of success and cooperation. However, we also \nwere told that what worked in Anbar might not necessarily work in the \nother provinces, that the threat varies from province to province, as \nwe have already discovered. The threat varies from city to city, and \nthe threat is multidimensional. What we have witnessed in Anbar where \nthe ``enemy of my enemy is also my enemy'' does not necessarily suggest \nthat it can apply across the board and may not be a model that can be \nreplicated in other provinces and in other cities. Certainly, we should \nuse it where it can work and can be applied, but certainly it may not \nbe possible in all of the other areas within Iraq, because the common \nenemy within al-Anbar was, of course, al-Qaida.\n  So I happen to believe it is abundantly apparent that we must send a \nstrong message to the Iraqi Government that by linking our continued \nstrategy in Iraq to the level of progress they made in attaining the \npolitical benchmarks they themselves had agreed to were so central to \nsecuring an Iraqi Nation. After all, by the President's own account, \nthe Baghdad Security Plan, the surge, was designed to be the final \nwindow of opportunity for the Iraqis to institute those benchmarks. \nThey had to know it was a window we would close if they did not act \nwith commensurate urgency.\n  That is why, upon my return from Iraq, I, along with my colleague, \nSenator Bayh from Indiana, introduced bipartisan legislation that would \nhave required the Iraqi Government to meet the benchmarks outlined by \nthe Iraq Study Group and the administration. If the Iraqi Government \nfailed to do so, our bill directed that the surge forces would redeploy \nand the remaining forces would transition to a far more limited mission \nthat included the training and equipping of the Iraqi forces, assisting \nthe deployed Iraqi brigades with intelligence, transportation, air \nsupport, and logistics, protecting U.S. and coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, and maintaining rapid reaction teams to undertake \ncounterterrorism missions against al-Qaida.\n  I argued in May that we are at a critical juncture and that we were \nat a point where we must be pivoting toward a policy that responsibly \nbrings us to a resolution on the future course of America's involvement \nin Iraq. I believed at the time the bipartisan legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Bayh would place the onus and the burden \nrightfully where it belongs--on the Iraqi Government and its political \nleaders to enact and to implement the benchmarks that, again, they \nthemselves had pledged to achieve.\n  Our legislation would have required General Petraeus to come before \nthe Congress and testify 14 days following his September report and, if \nthe political benchmarks had not been met, to submit a plan on phased \nredeployment of the surge troops associated with the Baghdad security \nplan and a change in mission for all of the troops, consistent, again, \nwith the recommendations set forth by the Iraq Study Group report.\n  Senator Bayh and I crafted the bill with the intent of garnering \nbipartisan support and called for not a mandate but, rather, an \nobjective of completing the transition and redeployment 6 months \nlater--which would have been approximately the end of March 2008.\n  As I said at the time, we cannot further countenance political \nintransigence on the part of the Iraqi Government, while our men and \nwomen are on the front lines confronting sacrifices and making \nsacrifices each and every day. I am pleased that many elements of the \nSnowe-Bayh bill were included in the measure that was drafted by our \nesteemed colleague Senator Warner, which was incorporated into the \nsupplemental legislation which the Senate passed on May 24 and that \nbecame law, which established the 18 benchmarks to evaluate the \nperformance of the Iraqi Government.\n  Yet here we are now, nearly 2 months from the passage of that \nsupplemental, and coming off the bloodiest 3-month period for American \ntroops since the war began, with 331 deaths in that period, and more \nthan 600 since the surge began. And yet, as last week's White House \ninterim report only underscored, there still has been no significant \nprogress on any of the political benchmarks whatsoever.\n  Among other failures, they have not passed an oil law which fairly \ndivides oil revenue among Iraq's ethnicities and religious sects. Last \nmonth, the largest Sunni political grouping announced its four Cabinet \nministers were boycotting the Government and were withdrawing its 44 \nmembers from the Parliament, and there was a ``no confidence'' vote \nscheduled to take place even against Prime Minister Maliki. Perhaps \nmost incredible, given this stunning lack of progress, is the fact that \nthe Iraqi Parliament will not be in session for the entire month of \nAugust.\n  That effectively means that the Iraq Parliament--even assuming--even \nassuming--they can attain the required quorum to conduct their affairs \ngiven that in the past 2 months, the Parliament has had considerable \ndifficulty obtaining a quorum and has rarely had enough members in the \nchamber to vote--has another 3 weeks remaining in session before the \nmonth of September arrives; all the while, our soldiers continue the \nbattle, while the Iraqi Government will take a recess, having failed to \nmake significant progress on any of the benchmarks included in \nthe supplemental bill we passed 2 months ago.\n\n  These stark facts have led our top military, diplomatic, and \nintelligence officials in Iraq to the conclusion that the political \nreconciliation which the surge was meant to facilitate is not being \nundertaken. Last month, General Petraeus stated that conditions in Iraq \nwill not improve sufficiently by September to justify a drawdown of \nU.S. military forces.\n  Thomas Fingar, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence and chief \nof the National Intelligence Council, testifying before the House Armed \nServices Committee last week, stated that while the government of Prime \nMinister Nouri al-Maliki has made ``limited progress on key \nlegislation,'' that ``scant common ground between Shias, Sunnis and \nKurds continues to polarize politics.'' Mr. Fingar even stated that the \nmajority Shiite bloc that Maliki heads ``does not present a unified \nfront.''\n  Let us also consider the words of key Iraqi leaders themselves, which \nare even more disturbing and telling. Indeed, Iraq's foreign minister \nsaid recently that ``These are not your benchmarks, these are our \ngoals. Why do you make it yours?'' This, despite the fact that American \ntroops are selflessly risking and giving their lives to make it \npossible for such officials to achieve the political, economic, and \nsecurity benchmarks which were agreed to in September of last year by \nIraq's Political Committee on National Security and reaffirmed by the \nPresidency Council on October 16.\n  So, frankly, given statements such as these, it is not a surprise \nthat, last week, the administration issued a report--the interim \nreport--that found that the Iraqi Government had failed to accomplish \nany of these political objectives the Iraqis themselves set.\n  Let's look at those deadlines and those goals and the track record.\n  In October 2006, provincial elections law, a date for provincial \nelections, and a new hydrocarbon law--the new oil revenue-sharing law--\nwere supposed to be approved. But that deadline came and went.\n  A debaathification law and a provincial council authorities law were \nto be enacted in November. But that deadline came and went.\n  In December they were to approve a law demobilizing and disarming the\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nmilitias. But that deadline came and went.\n  The Constitutional Review Committee was to complete its work in \nJanuary, independent commissions were to be formed in February, and a \nconstitutional amendments referendum was to be held, if required, in \nMarch. But those deadlines also came and went.\n  What does it suggest when a U.S. official--and actually it is \nincorporated in the interim report--recently observed that political \nreconciliation is largely trailing any advances in security--calling it \na ``lagging indicator''? But if the Iraqi Government were truly \nserious, shouldn't concrete steps toward reconciliation be the \npredictor--shouldn't it be a leading indicator--of an inner fortitude \nand intention to accomplish those benchmarks that are supposed to be \nhappening in tandem with the surge--if the surge was designed to be \nthat window of opportunity, to give the breathing space to the Iraqi \nGovernment to create the conditions on the ground that will allow them \nto make the political compromises so essential to unifying their \ncountry?\n  Security will only come through a belief by the Iraqis that they will \nhave a political and economic future. That is why Iraq's fate is in the \nhands of the Iraqi leadership and its Government. The only way they \nwill be able to secure their future is to be able to quell the \nsectarian violence, to integrate the minority population, to create \npower-sharing arrangements to diffuse the sectarian conflicts. In that \nway only can Iraq maintain its integrity as a unitary state.\n  So I ask, if the intelligence community assessed in February that \n``with the current winner-take-all attitude and sectarian animosities \naffecting the political scene the prospects for reconciliation are \nbleak''--that is the intelligence community's assessment--and General \nPetraeus stated in March, ``there is no military solution'' and that \n``a political resolution . . . is crucial,'' and the general is quoted \nin the Air Force Times last month saying ``counterinsurgency is roughly \n. . . 80 percent political,'' as codified in his own counterinsurgency \nmanual--and the interesting part about that is in that manual General \nPetraeus states that the host nation has to win it on its own, and that \nis exactly what the surge was all about; it was to allow them to \naccomplish those key political goals that would demonstrate to the \nIraqi people they had a government that was representative of all the \npeople and not just a few--and the Iraqi Government has failed to \naccomplish these political benchmarks that were established by their \nown leadership and the Government of Iraq, then doesn't it make sense \nto begin to choose an alternative course? Because it is difficult to \nsee the wisdom of this current strategy without holding the Iraqis \naccountable, the time has come to stand up and to speak out on behalf \nof the American people to say that the current strategy is unacceptable \nand the moment has arrived to change that direction.\n  That is why I have joined with Senators Levin and Reed on a \nbipartisan basis because in my view, given the record of demonstrated \ninaction on the part of the Iraqi Government, we are now beyond \nnonbinding measures. That is what we have accomplished in the last 6 \nmonths. We considered nonbinding measures. But now we are a mere 2 \nmonths from General Petraeus's September report, with no demonstrable \nevidence to suggest political progress. What time is more important \nthan now, as we consider the pending Defense authorization bill, to \nmaximize our voice and opportunity to send an unequivocal message that \nif the Iraqis fail to chart a different course politically, then we \nwill chart a different course militarily?\n  The fact is, America requires more than Iraq's commitment to \naccomplishing the benchmarks that will lead to a true national \nreconciliation. We must see demonstrable results. That is why we are at \nthis critical juncture. That is the answer to why now and why wait \nuntil September. Because given all we know, I happen to believe we \ncannot lose precious time in delivering an unmistakable message that \nthe Iraqi Government must take the consensus-building measures \nnecessary for reconciliation.\n\n  For those who characterize this bill as tantamount to a precipitous \nwithdrawal, let me say it is neither precipitous nor a withdrawal. I \nurge my colleagues to read the legislation, to read the amendment that \nhas been drafted, to actually look at the language. I think it would be \nworthwhile, because I have heard mischaracterizations of what this \nlegislation would accomplish. This legislation would result in \nredeployment, a change in mission, and reduced forces, but it does not \nsuggest--it does not require--a precipitous withdrawal. In fact, it \ndoes not do that. It would reduce our troops and change our mission, \nbeginning 120 days after passage, while specifically allowing the \ntroops to remain for critical missions such as counterinsurgency and \nattacking al-Qaida, providing force protection, as well as training the \nIraqis--again, goals that are very consistent with the Iraq Study \nGroup.\n  I think it is very important for Members of the Senate to read--to \nactually read--the language which has been incorporated in the \namendment that is pending before the Senate, because it requires a very \ndifferent mandate than has been described here on the floor of the \nSenate. It is not a precipitous withdrawal. In fact, it allows the \ndiscretion to maintain troops by the commanders in order to complete \nthose missions as described in the amendment that would allow us to \ncontinue to train the Iraqis and to fight al-Qaida.\n  Some of my colleagues have also opined that this proposal will limit \nthe President's ability to conduct the war on terror. Last week we \nheard the President state that we are working to defeat al-Qaida and \nother extremists and aid the rise of an Iraqi Government that can \nprotect its people. Well, again, this amendment rightly does nothing to \ndetract from that objective. In fact, as I said, the amendment defers \nto the commanders on the group to determine the number of troops and \nforces necessary to fight al-Qaida.\n  Specifically, the amendment empowers the Secretary of Defense to \ndeploy and maintain members of the Armed Forces in Iraq to engage in \ntargeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, al-Qaida-\naffiliated groups, and other international terrorist organizations, \nwhich encompasses maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity against \nterrorist groups, including those backed by foreign countries. So that \nis the reality of the language which has been included in this \namendment that is pending before the Senate--not as some have \ndescribed.\n  Furthermore, this measure would not take effect until 120 days after \nthe passage of this legislation--after the passage of the Defense \nauthorization. Let me note that in the last 4 years, the earliest \napproval of the National Defense Authorization Act occurred on October \n17. That was the earliest date in which it became law in each of the \nlast 4 years. So this isn't rash. This is reasoned, and this is \nresponsible. Indeed, the language crafted by Senator Hagel in the \namendment also seeks to internationalize our effort by calling on the \nU.N. to appoint an international mediator in Iraq and that the auspices \nof the United Nations Security Council, which has the authority of the \ninternational community to engage political, religious, ethnic, and \ntribal leaders in Iraq, and include them in the political process. This \nmediator will seek to bridge the divide between the competing sects to \nbring stability to Iraq and prevent a spillover into a civil war.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment specifically states it shall be implemented \nas part of a comprehensive, diplomatic, political, and economic \nstrategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and \nthe international community for the purposes of working collectively to \nbring stability to Iraq. As the Baker-Hamilton report concluded, Iraqi \npolitical accommodations can be achieved only within a constructive \nregional framework supported by the international community, a \nstatement that I believe highlights the necessity now in the United \nStates to refocus its policy, its leadership, and its resources on \ndirectly helping the Iraqis to establish an inclusive political \nframework to begin to diffuse the violence.\n  Finally, to those with concerns about the April conclusion date \nincluded in the Levin-Reed amendment, let me also point out this is not \nan arbitrary date the Congress imposed but, rather,\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nit reflects the reality on the ground. The ability to maintain this \nlarge force in Iraq becomes virtually impossible because of the overall \nsize of the Army. We cannot sustain current troop levels in Iraq \nindefinitely. General Peter Shoomaker, the prior Army Chief of Staff, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that \nsustaining the troop increase in Iraq beyond August would be a \nchallenge, he said. In fact, Andrew Krepinevich of the Center for \nStrategic and Budgetary Assessments, told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in April that our ground forces, the Army in particular, are \n``broken'' or in danger of ``breaking.'' The reality is that without \nsignificantly changing the force structure or employing a ``different \nforce mix,'' we must begin to redeploy.\n  The bottom line is this is a defining moment. It is a defining moment \nfor America's policy in Iraq and it is a defining moment for the \nSenate--indeed, the entire Congress--as to whether we are now prepared \nto assert our legislative prerogatives and authorities that are not \nwithout precedent, as I said earlier, to direct a different course and \nto alter our strategy--a strategy that reality warrants and demands. \nThe decision before us is one of grave consequence because it is a \nmatter of war. It demands that we look past the rhetoric and the \npartisanship which often enshrouds and clouds many of the most \nsignificant issues of our time, and that is certainly true with respect \nto this war.\n  We expect passion to run high, but I hope it doesn't create the \ninability on the part of our collective wisdom and desire to do what is \nright and what is best for our country and for the men and women in \nuniform who are on the front lines each and every day performing \nmagnificent sacrifices, as we all well know, with the loss of lives we \nhave experienced in each of our States across this country. Frankly, if \nit weren't for those men and women, you know, we wouldn't be the \ngreatest Nation on Earth, because they have woven the fabric for \ngreatness for this country throughout the generations.\n  So I would hope that at this moment in time, we can rise to the \noccasion and that in spite of the spirited debate, we can come together \nto try to resolve this major question, because that is what the \nAmerican people want. That is what my constituents want in the State of \nMaine. They are hoping and praying we can come together and unite and \nto do what is right for this country at this most challenging and \nvexing and consequential moment in our Nation's history. I hope we can \nlive up to the moniker of the Senate as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, because certainly that moment is upon us.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine. I know she \nhas thought long and hard about this issue, and I appreciate her \nthoughtful remarks. We are respectfully in disagreement.\n  I wish to make a few points, and then I know the Senator from \nMichigan and others are waiting. I intend to, I tell my colleagues, \nexercise my right of recognition as we go from speaker to speaker, as \nwe are at 10 minutes of 3 in the morning.\n  The Senator from Maine and others have described this amendment in \nways I don't quite agree with, including, among other things, some \nconfidence in the United States permanent representative to use the \nvoice vote and influence the United States and the United Nations to \nseek the appointment of an international mediator in Iraq under the \nauspices of the United Nations Security Council. I am not prepared to \nput the future of Iraq under an international mediator of the United \nNations Security Council. The United Nations Security Council's record \nhas not been very good, whether it be Iran, North Korea, or other \ncrises, including Bosnia where we had to go in basically and bail them \nout.\n  In this resolution, I would call to the attention of my colleagues \nthat it says: After the conclusion of reduction in transition, the \nUnited States forces to a limited presence as required by this section, \nthe Secretary of Defense may deploy or maintain members of the Armed \nForces in Iraq only for the following missions, and the third one is \nengaging in targeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, al-\nQaida-affiliated groups, and other international terrorist \norganizations.\n  How do you do that? How do you do that? There are some people \nplanting IEDs who are going to kill our troops, and you say: Excuse me, \nsir. Are you al-Qaida or are you a Shiite militia? Oh, you are a Shiite \nmilitia? Excuse me.\n  What is that all about? That is one of the most unrealistic scenarios \nI have encountered in warfare. There is a degree of naivete associated \nwith this resolution which is a disconnect between the reality of how \nwarfare is conducted and the utopian United Nations Security Council \ninternational mediator. Our troops can be there in Iraq in diminished \nnumbers, but they can only engage in targeted counterterrorism \noperations against al-Qaida. So I guess al-Qaida would be required to \nwear T-shirts that say ``al-Qaida.'' In that way, we would know, and it \nwould be OK--it would be OK: You are al-Qaida? OK. A Shiite militia? Do \nwhatever you think.\n  It was al-Qaida that blew up the Golden Dome mosque in Samara. \nFollowing that was horrendous sectarian strife. We are finally getting \naround--finally, belatedly--to asking those who want this withdrawal \nand who support this resolution to tell us what happens if this \nstrategy fails, if the pullout fails. I quote from today's Los Angeles \nTimes. It says:\n\n       Many lawmakers who have pushed President Bush to bring \n     troops home from Iraq have not developed plans to deal with \n     the violence that could follow a pullout, interviews with \n     more than two dozen Democrats and Republicans show. Many of \n     them acknowledge that Iraq might plunge into vicious \n     sectarian fighting, much like the ethnic cleansing that \n     consumed Bosnia a decade ago.\n\n  They acknowledge that Iraq might plunge into sectarian violence that \nconsumed Bosnia, which was so offensive that we went into Bosnia to \nstop it, but if it is in another part of the world, then we won't go \nin. In fact, the article goes on to say:\n\n       ``I wouldn't be surprised if it is horrendous,'' said House \n     Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, Democrat, \n     Wisconsin, who has helped lead the drive against the war. \n     'The only hope for the Iraqis is their own damned government, \n     and there is slim hope for that.''\n\n  More incredibly, the article goes on to say:\n\n       Some proponents of a withdrawal decline to discuss what the \n     United States should do if the violence increases. ``That's a \n     hypothetical. I'm not going to get into it,'' said Senate \n     majority leader Harry Reid.\n\n  Senator Reid is the one who announced on the floor of the Senate that \nthe war was lost. If the war is lost and we are going to pull out, what \nis hypothetical? What is hypothetical about assessing the consequences \nof this withdrawal?\n\n       Many Democrats, however, believe that any increase in \n     violence would be short-term and argue that a troop drawdown \n     eventually would lead to a more stable Iraq and Middle East.\n\n  I know of no expert who agrees with that statement. I know of no one. \nIn fact, the Secretary General of the United Nations, not exactly known \nas a strong supporter of the war in Iraq, said:\n\n       I would like to tell you that great caution should be taken \n     for the sake of the Iraqi people. The international community \n     cannot and should not abandon them. Any abrupt withdrawal or \n     decision may lead to a further deterioration of the situation \n     in Iraq.\n\n  That is a statement by the Secretary General of the United Nations.\n  I know my colleagues are waiting, but I wish to point out again \nanother fact. General Petraeus came before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on January 23, 2007. General Petraeus at that time \narticulated the strategy which would be employed and needed to be \nemployed and needed to be given time to succeed. In fact, General \nPetraeus was asked at his confirmation hearings, which was later \nratified by this body by a vote--without a dissenting vote:\n\n       General Petraeus, in your view, since you have been \n     intimately involved in Iraq from the beginning, suppose we \n     announced tomorrow that we would withdraw within 4 months to \n     6 months. That happens to coincide with the 120 day \n     withdrawal that we are talking about here. What are the \n     results there in Iraq and in the region?\n       GEN Petraeus: Well, sir, I think that sectarian groups \n     would obviously begin to stake out their turf, try to expand \n     their turf. They\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\n     would do that by greatly increased ethnic cleansing. There is \n     a very real possibility of involvement of countries from \n     elsewhere in the region entering Iraq to take sides with one \n     or the other groups. There is a possibility certainly of an \n     international terrorist organization truly getting a grip on \n     some substantial piece of Iraq. There is the possibility of \n     problems in the global economy should in fact this cause a \n     disruption in the flow of oil and a number of other potential \n     outcomes, none of which are positive.\n\n  That is what General Petraeus said at his confirmation hearings. \nEverybody confirmed him. Everybody knew in this body what the mission \nwas, what they intended to do, what the strategy was, and here we are a \nfew months later pulling the plug, or attempting to pull the plug, on \nwhat General Petraeus wants to do.\n  I am proud of the United States of America that we went to Bosnia and \nstopped the ethnic cleansing. I am proud the United States of America \nwent to Kosovo and stopped ethnic cleansing. I am ashamed we haven't \ngone to Darfur in some way and effected the stop of ethnic cleansing \nthere. I am ashamed we didn't stop the slaughter of hundreds of \nthousands of people in Rwanda, and so are all of us. That is a majority \nopinion in this country and in this body. But now--but now, in the case \nof Iraq:\n\n       I wouldn't be surprised if it is horrendous.\n\n  ``I wouldn't be surprised if it is horrendous.'' That is what we are \ncondemning the people of Iraq to. And on the other side, the majority \nleader of the Senate--and I apologize, because I will ask him about it \nagain on this floor:\n\n       That's a hypothetical. I'm not going to get into it.\n\n  Now, I don't know of anybody who believes that is a hypothetical. The \nfact is, when we leave there is going to be a vacuum, there is going to \nbe chaos, and there is going to be genocide. I can quote on the floor \nHenry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, General Lynch, General Petraeus, \nliterally--General Zinni, those who oppose our presence in Iraq opposed \nthe initial invasion, and yet believe that at least we should face up \nto and begin to address the consequences of withdrawal. It is not \nhypothetical. It is not hypothetical.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  At this 3 o'clock hour in the morning, I think it is important to \nrefocus on exactly what the vote will be in the morning as it relates \nto the issue in front of us, the Levin-Reed amendment. First, let me do \nthis. Let me thank Senator Snowe, who was here a moment ago, for her \neloquence and her courage in laying out the facts, and for her \nthoughtfulness. I wish to thank our Senate majority leader, Senator \nReid, who has been laser focused on what, in fact, we need to be doing \nto change the course in Iraq based on the facts, based on the iron will \nof the American people.\n  I appreciate all he has done to keep us focused on this critical \nissue of our time.\n  I also thank Senator Carl Levin, my senior Senator from Michigan. We \nare very proud of him in Michigan for all he does, advocating for our \ntroops and for a foreign policy and an armed services policy that makes \nsense for our country, for all of us. I thank Senators Levin and Jack \nReed for introducing an amendment that is currently being filibustered.\n  What we have in front of us and what we are doing is demonstrating \nthrough this all-night debate--which is very important, regardless of \nwhere someone comes from on this issue; it is very important that we \nhave this debate and discussion. I appreciate all of my colleagues \nexpressing themselves. What we have in front of us is the question of \nwhether we are going to end a filibuster tomorrow, and whether we are \ngoing to have an opportunity to have a simple majority vote--a yes-or-\nno vote--on a change in direction in Iraq, which would in fact change \nthe mission by next year, by April 30 of next year. I find it amazing \nthat our men and women right now who are fighting for democracy, \nfighting for majority rule--to put together a coalition to create a \nworking majority and that the majority should rule. Yet here we are not \nallowed to have the majority make the decision--a majority being 51, or \nin this case 50 at the moment, being able to vote and determine what \nthe policy is.\n  Last week, we had a very significant debate and issue in front of us \nthat Senator Webb from Virginia brought forward in terms of supporting \nour troops, supporting them as it relates to the deployment and \nredeployment policies right now for our National Guard and our full-\ntime military. There were 56 members--a clear majority of this body--\nwho voted for that policy, that change in policy. So if you are \ndeployed for 12 months, you would be home on dwell time for 12 months \nwith your family and with an opportunity to be retrained, to regroup, \nin order to be able to go back. Fifty-six members, a clear majority, \nsaid yes. Yet we were stopped. Why? Because our Republican colleagues \ninsist on filibustering and not allowing a vote.\n  We are saying to the other side of the aisle, let us vote. Let us do \nwhat we assume everybody in the American public assumes in a democracy \nwith a majority, that the majority would have their say, that whoever \nis in the majority has an opportunity to win a vote. But that is not \nthe case anymore in the Senate. We are not talking about 50 or 51 but \n60. So we have in front of us a filibuster that is going on as to \nwhether we will even vote on a policy that has a majority of this \nSenate, and it is clearly supported by a majority of the American \npeople.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, there are no good wars or bad wars; \nthere are only necessary wars or unnecessary wars. Five years ago, I \nwas proud to stand along with the distinguished Presiding Officer on \nthe floor of this body and argue that going into war with Iraq was \nunnecessary. It wasn't an easy day for any of us. No burden weighs \nheavier on the shoulders of any one of us than questions of war and \npeace. We deliberate countless and important issues in this Chamber, \nbut none are as serious as sending America's sons and daughters into \nharm's way. I stood here that day in October and said this is a vote of \nconscience, also a vote of historic consequence, because what we debate \nand decide here will not only significantly affect this great Nation, \nbut will immediately influence global events for years to come. No \nmatter how difficult the decision may be, it is one each of us must \nmake for the sake of our country. We have an obligation and a duty to \ncarefully weigh the consequences of a preemptive attack. I went on to \nsay that before we engage in war, we must understand that the results \nof war are irrevocable and a peaceful solution should always be our \nfirst choice.\n  Today, we are living with the consequences of this war. We will \ncontinue to live with those consequences in our communities, in terms \nof young lives lost and shattered, and families who will never be whole \nagain, and the emptiness left by neighbors who gave their last full \nmeasure in this fight. As a nation, we will live with these \nconsequences for years to come as we face a world we shaped by this \nunnecessary war--a world in which we must now deal with a reinvigorated \nal-Qaida and a less stable Middle East today than when the first \nAmerican tanks rolled into Baghdad.\n  We cannot go back and change the mistakes and missteps that have \nbrought us here, but we can and we must begin to dig ourselves out of \nthe hole that we have dug in Iraq. We can and we must embrace a \nstrategy that brings our troops home safely and responsibly. We can and \nwe must make the tough choices to end this war.\n  Twenty-three of us stood up against the war on that October \nafternoon. Today, there are more of us. We have all watched the events \nof the last half decade play out in front of us. We have watched the \nviolence and the horror of modern war play out on our television sets. \nWe have listened over and over again as the administration's rhetoric \nhas become more and more detached from the reality of what is going on \nin Iraq. What were merely predictions and concerns in 2002 have today \nbecome reality. Militarily, we are paying the price every day for the \nadministration's neglect in planning for the aftermath of initial \ncombat operations in Iraq.\n  Our troops are fighting and working in extreme conditions. They face \nan\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\nenemy they often cannot identify, one that has shown a total disregard \nfor human life and a willingness to sacrifice themselves, their \nfamilies, and innocent bystanders merely to inflict damage on American \nforces and innocent Iraqi citizens. Every day, they face an environment \nto test their physical limits, in 100-plus degree heat. We know it is \nvery hot now. Those of us who have been to Iraq understand the kind of \nconditions with the heat and the sand and the conditions that are \nhappening there that are, in many cases, unimaginable. They face an \nIraqi Government that refuses to take responsibility for the future of \nthe people of Iraq, one that leans on American forces instead of \neffectively partnering with them to allow our forces to step back and \nIraqi security forces to step into the front line.\n  Our fighting forces are stretched to their limit. They are getting \nthe job done and they are bravely doing that. We are proud of them. But \nby forcing multiple redeployments without proper rest, this \nadministration has let them down. We have alienated countless foreign \nallies, squandered the international good will that was at our \nfingertips after the attacks of 9/11. We turned Iraq into a breeding \nground and training school for terrorists, providing \ninternational rallying points for extremists. There was not an \norganized presence of al-Qaida in Iraq until this administration chose \nto invade.\n\n  The administration's own National Intelligence Estimate, released \ntoday--yesterday at this point--specifically notes that ``al-Qaida will \nprobably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of al-Qaida in \nIraq, its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to \nhave expressed a desire to attack the homeland.''\n  This NIE reveals the sobering truth. Not only has this unnecessary \nwar not increased the safety of the American people, but al-Qaida's \nrecovery is a direct result of this administration's decision to invade \nIraq. Meanwhile, conditions in Iraq have spiraled. The daily headlines \nof our newspapers seem to be ripped from the pages of a Greek tragedy: \nSuicide bombers; civil war; American soldiers unable to tell friends \nfrom foes; units serving second and third and now even fourth \nredeployments; American troops returning home physically mangled, \nemotionally drained, and psychologically injured; lives and families \nchanged forever.\n  Five years ago, Americans had never heard of an IED or a traumatic \nbrain injury. They are now part of our everyday news. We have paid the \nprice in American lives--3,613 dead and 26,806 wounded. We have paid \nthe price in misdirected resources. The billions we have spent in Iraq \nrepresent countless missed opportunities here at home, opportunities to \nstrengthen our communities, schools, and hospitals, to create jobs and \nsupport our families. When I think of the fact that the latest numbers \nare now $12 billion a month being spent, and we will debate next week a \nchildren's health care plan that we want to fund at $10 billion a \nyear--$12 billion a month versus $10 billion a year to cover every \nchild of a working low-income family who doesn't have insurance in \nAmerica--this is wrong.\n  We have also paid the price with our international reputation. \nAmerica, the world's moral leader, has lost the faith of too many. The \nhearts and minds we needed to win have too often turned their backs on \nthis administration's arrogance. For too long now, I have watched the \nRepublican leadership engage in legislative games and political \nposturing to avoid taking an up-or-down vote on this war.\n  That is what we are asking for. Let us vote. Stop the filibuster and \nlet us vote. They have turned their backs on their responsibilities to \nthe people who elected them and to our troops--most important--and \ntheir families because they don't like that they may lose a vote. I \nhave stood on the floor of the Senate time and again to voice my \nopposition to the war.\n  Sending more Americans into combat without a strategy for success \nwill not improve the situation on the ground, and it will not bring our \nmen and women in uniform home any sooner. Only the Iraqis can secure \nIraq, and American troops cannot be seen as a substitute for Iraqi \nresolve.\n  The so-called surge has done nothing but reinforce this reality. We \nare rushing more American troops into combat every day and not seeing \nthe increase in security that is needed. Why would we go farther down \nthe path that has led us to this point? Why? Why would we repeat \nprevious mistakes and call it a new strategy?\n  This administration failed our troops by committing them to this war \nwithout a clear reason or goal. This administration failed our troops \nby not having a clear mission for our armed services in Iraq. This \nadministration has failed our troops by not providing the proper \nequipment, body armor, and logistical support for our forces. They \nfailed our troops with poor planning for the invasion of Iraq and their \ntotal lack of planning for how to secure the country. They have failed \nour troops by sending them back into harm's way over and over and over \nagain, without the proper rest between redeployments.\n  Our armed services have traveled a tough road since we invaded Iraq. \nThey have shouldered a heavy burden with pride, patriotism, confidence, \nand honor. We have asked extraordinary things from them at every turn, \nand at every turn they have delivered magnificently. They have made us \nall proud. They have faced tough situations. They have made tough \nchoices and done their duty. Now we need to do what is right for them.\n  Unlike the President, all of us go home and face our constituents--\nour neighbors. We see them at church, at the grocery store, at the \nkids' schools, and at events all over our States. They sent us here to \nbe their voice. As we know, this is not Washington, DC's war. We may \nset policy here, we make speeches here, we take votes here, but this is \nAmerica's war. The men and women putting their lives on the line in \nIraq every day are from every size town and city--from farms and \nfactory towns. There is no red or blue America when it comes to the war \nin Iraq. War knows no political party. Americans do not watch their \nnightly news or read about the troops that didn't make it home in their \nlocal papers and think, well, I am a Republican or a Democrat. They \nthink I am an American, I want a change, I have had enough. Enough is \nenough.\n  We sit here in this historic Capitol while Republican colleagues \nfilibuster and stop the Senate from voting yes or no on a proposal to \nchange course and end this war. While we do that, communities across \nthe country bury their loved ones, schools hold vigils for alumni laid \nto rest too young, churches comfort parishioners who have lost sons, \ndaughters, husbands, wives, mothers, and fathers.\n  We are the voices of these communities, of these towns and cities and \ncounties. We were elected with their sacred trust to come to Washington \nand speak out for them, to make our mark for them on the issues that \nface them and face our country.\n  By continuing to stonewall a vote on this Levin-Reed amendment, the \nRepublican minority has stripped all Americans of their voice in this \ndebate. They have said to the people who elected us that this issue of \nwar is not important enough to have their elected representatives vote \nyes or no on the substance.\n  Too often in the white noise of politics, we lose sight of the \nresponsibilities we bear. We get bogged down in the politics of \npartisanship and lose sight of why we were elected.\n  I believe we owe it to the American people to take this vote--take \nthe vote--not to just stop the filibuster but to have the vote on the \npolicy. There is nothing more important or more pressing to the people \nof this country right now than this war. It is the responsibility of \nthe Congress to engage in shaping the policy concerning the war on \nbehalf of all of the American people.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment is as simple as it is necessary. It sets a \nfirm start and end date to transition the mission and begin the \nreduction of U.S. forces, beginning 120 days after its enactment and \ncompleted April 30 of next year, 2008.\n  The amendment limits the U.S. military mission after April 30 to \ncounterterrorism, training of Iraqi security forces, and protection of \nU.S. personnel and assets.\n  Finally, it requires that the reduction in forces be part of a \ncomprehensive, diplomatic, regional, political and economic effort, and \nit appoints an international mediator to bring together the warring \nfactions.\n  The President's strategy in Iraq has not worked. This war was started \non a\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\nfalse rationale. It was executed based on false assumptions. It has led \nto heartbreaking consequences.\n  Supporters of the war in Iraq have claimed that one of their goals is \nto spread democracy throughout the region--an ironic statement \nconsidering they are stifling the democratic process right here on the \nfloor of the Senate. This issue is too serious not to take an up-or-\ndown vote on changing policy. The American people want to bring our \nsons and daughters home. It is our job to vote yes or no and let them \nknow where we stand, not to use parliamentary procedural votes to stand \nin the way of the people's will.\n  I have said it before and it remains true tonight: History will judge \nthis administration on how they have waged this war. History will judge \nus on how we end it. We have all walked different paths to get to this \npoint. Many of us were here when the war began. Some have joined this \nbody in the intervening years. Many who today stand with us were once \nfor the war. None of that matters at this point. What matters is the \nfacts and what we are prepared to do about them. Are we prepared to \nstand up to the White House and say enough is enough? Enough is enough.\n  It is morning in Baghdad right now, and our troops are waking up or \nare on duty, another day on the front lines. The unpleasant truth is \nthat too many American men and women will be wounded today while doing \ntheir jobs. Odds are that some will lose their lives in service to \ntheir country. But they are there, focused on their job. They are \nfocused on their duty. They assume we are back here focusing on the \nmission and the strategy and making sure we get it right. They are \ncounting on us to get it right, as they are focused on their jobs every \nday. They are getting the job done. Everybody who woke up in Iraq this \nmorning and put on the uniform is a hero. Every day we let this war \ndrag on is another day they are fighting without a strategy that works \nfor them. We should all be able to agree that is simply unacceptable.\n  I would like to close with the same words I closed with in October of \n2002. We have witnessed a lot in the last 5 years, but these words are \nas true tonight as they were then:\n\n       We are a strong and powerful nation, made that way by our \n     willingness to go that extra mile in the name of liberty and \n     peace. The time is now for us to work together in the name of \n     the American people and get it right.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to end the filibuster and support the \nLevin-Reed amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are indeed dealing with a serious \nsubject that gives us all great pause and concern. I know my colleagues \nhave had a sign that they have put up: Let us vote. I think it is \nimportant to recall that 53 days ago, we voted. We voted in this \nCongress to authorize and appropriate the funds to execute the surge \nthat General Petraeus is right now executing in Iraq. That is what we \ndid. It was a vote of 80 to 14. Less than 2 months ago, we voted to do \nthat. Many of the speakers tonight saying we must withdraw right now, \nwe must have a new strategy, have forgotten that when we cast those \nvotes 53 days ago, we were executing a new strategy then. Are we now \ngoing to have another one?\n  Virtually all of the individuals who spoke voted for that funding, \nvoted knowing that General Petraeus would lead this surge and voted \nknowing that we would be having a report in September and we could work \nthrough that report to decide how we would conduct this war in the \nfuture.\n  The Levin amendment is, indeed, a very important amendment. There is \nnothing small about this. It is critical. It requires our full \nattention. We must recognize that. I do believe it is inescapable that \nthe Levin amendment calls for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. Those \ntroops not withdrawn will be directed by this Congress today by this \nvote on how they will conduct operations in Iraq. As our distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Arizona, said, we will be telling our \nsoldiers what they can and cannot do, whom they can and cannot wage war \nagainst, and how they will be conducting it. A group of politicians in \nan air-conditioned room sitting in Washington developing a political \ncompromise is going to tell commanders how to deploy our soldiers in \nthe field. So the issues have special urgency because right now \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are in harm's way.\n  No one is afraid to stand up to the President. Our challenge is to do \nthe right thing, the right thing for America, the right thing for our \nsoldiers, the right thing for history. I believe my colleague from \nMichigan said we will be judged on how we leave. I was thinking the \nother day about that phrase someone said: Nothing so became them save \ntheir manner of leaving. I would alter it somewhat and suggest that \nsomeone might say: Nothing so ill became them save their manner of \nleaving. If we do it wrong, if we do it in a way that leads to mass \nslaughter or disorder, death, instability in the entire region, it is a \nthreat to the peace of the region.\n\n  It is this Congress, not just the President, which authorized the use \nof force in Iraq in the beginning. We have confirmed the commander of \nthose military personnel that are there now. We have provided the money \nand resources to maintain and to carry out that military operation. \nThose wonderful military personnel of ours have worked and fought and \nbled and died as a result of the policies we have authorized. It is our \nresponsibility. We can't just blame it on the President. They have \nperformed nobly and served this country well.\n  While I have never felt that I have had enough time in Iraq and that \nI have been able to learn everything I would like, I have visited that \ncountry six times. I talked to our soldiers there, our Guard, Reserve, \nActive Duty, those from Alabama and from other States. I talk to them \nin airports and their families in my State. They have done a great job. \nThe biggest complaint I have heard consistently is: Why don't people \ntell the good things that we do and that occur? All we hear is the bad. \nI hear that a great deal.\n  But the truth is, for reasons unconnected to the fine work of our \nsoldiers, things have not gone as well as we had hoped in Iraq. The \nIraq mission has been very difficult in terms of lives lost, wounded, \nand the cost. While the initial military action went far better than \nmany of us expected, the aftermath has been marked by errors, violence, \nand frustration. Particularly at this point, we are disappointed that \nthe Iraqi Government has been unable to produce the kind of political \nleadership that would be beneficial to reducing the violence. It is a \nreal frustration for us. There is no easy solution to it. They say we \ndon't understand their difficulties. I suspect some people can't \nunderstand why Congress can't do things as they would like to have them \ndo also.\n  Perhaps our biggest error as we went into this war was to \nunderestimate the difficulty of creating a functioning government in an \narea of the world that has not had one before. This is not an easy \nthing. It is a very difficult thing. We have to be realistic about that \nin the future. For those in Congress, for the American people and our \ngenerals, there is certainly no one easy solution, and there is no \ncertain outcome. But we do know the outcome is very important to the \nIraqi people, to the people of the region, and to us. We need to get it \nright.\n  I earnestly hope we can draw down our troop levels in Iraq soon. \nNothing would make me happier than to see that happen. But we must do \nit correctly, smartly. We can't do it precipitously. We can't do it \nhere, without even listening to our general in Iraq whom we just sent \nthere to command those troops, without even getting his opinion. This \nis his third year, third tour in Iraq. He was there when the initial \ninvasion occurred. I visited with him when he commanded the 101st \nAirborne in Mosul. He came back and trained the Iraqi military. He came \nback home for the second time and wrote the manual on how to defeat an \ninsurgency. Now he is back over there executing that, and we knew all \nthat when we sent him. How can we write a policy of withdrawal and to \ndirect the limited purposes for which our troops can be used and then \nset forth three purposes for which they can be used and the people that \nthey can take military action against and we haven't even heard from \nour commander? What kind of sense is that? What kind of responsibility \nis that?\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n  They say: If we don't threaten to withdraw, they won't reconcile and \ndo all the things we want them to do in the Government. If we have to \ndo more than threaten to withdraw if they don't do those things, we are \ngoing to have to just withdraw because they haven't satisfied our \nambitions and goals for their successful political development.\n  Proponents of the Reed-Levin amendment claim that we must withdraw \nU.S. troops from Iraq because it is the only way to bring a responsible \nend to the war and to force the Iraqi Government to act. Actually, such \na withdrawal required by the amendment is far more likely to consign \nthe Iraqi people to mass slaughter.\n  The Iraq Study Group specifically--that is the group which has been \nso often cited, the independent group--concluded:\n\n       A premature American departure from Iraq would almost \n     certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further \n     deterioration of conditions.\n\n  The study further concluded:\n\n       The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, \n     great human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat \n     to the global economy.\n\n  Similarly, the intelligence community concluded in the NIE, the \nNational Intelligence Estimate, earlier this year that the consequences \nof withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq prior to Iraq being able to \nprovide for its own security would be sectarian violence, that \nsectarian violence would significantly increase, accompanied by massive \ncivilian casualties and displacement. Get that? Sectarian violence \nwould significantly increase, accompanied by massive civilian \ncasualties and displacement.\n  The intelligence community pointed out how this mass chaos in Iraq \nwould directly threaten the security of the U.S. homeland as it \nconcluded al- Qaida would attempt to use Anbar Province to further \nattacks outside Iraq. General Hayden, Director of the CIA, succinctly \ntestified to the Senate Intelligence Committee, in response to the \nquestion what would happen if we pulled out now from Iraq--that was the \nquestion to the Director of the CIA--he said succinctly three quick \nareas: more Iraqis die from the disorder inside Iraq; Iraq becomes a \nsafe haven, perhaps more dangerous than the one al-Qaida had in \nAfghanistan; and the conflict in Iraq bleeds over into the neighborhood \nand threatens serious regional instability.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group concluded al-Qaida would depict our withdrawal \nas a historic victory. They have already claimed historic victory over \nthe Soviet Union.\n  I ask: Is this a responsible way to leave? Is this a way to see what \nwe have done in Iraq end?\n  Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, said we need to pull out of Iraq \nso we can ``drive the terrorists back to the darkest caves and corners \nof the Earth.'' Well, that is a good goal, I suggest. But tell me how \nthat goal would be furthered if we pulled out and gave a safe haven in \nIraq to al-Qaida and provided them with a victory of historic \nproportions. Wouldn't that embolden them? Wouldn't that enable them to \nrecruit more people? Do you think they are then just going to be \nsatisfied there? Wouldn't they then have the initiative? Would not they \nthen be looking where they would hit next?\n  Our Democratic colleagues argue that it is somehow wrong for those \nwho oppose the Levin amendment to utilize the full procedural \nprotections available to a minority in the Senate. It wasn't wrong when \nthey were using those manners on a regular basis, trust me. I think we \nset a record last year or the year before on these filibusters and the \nnumber of times it took 60 votes to do something or not succeed in \ngetting 60 votes. But they suggest that somehow it is inappropriate to \nuse our well-established, commonly used procedure, routinely done, to \nrequire 60 votes on a matter of great importance such as this. Of \ncourse, I would suggest that is when, in matters of great importance, \nthe 60-vote rule is most needed and most appropriate.\n  To press the point further, I strongly believe that whatever the \ninclinations of Senators on the conduct of the war in Iraq, to change \nour strategy now before we even hear from General Petraeus in September \nwould be a colossal blunder for a host of reasons. To do so would be \nunthinkable. It must not and I believe will not happen. This Senator \nwould be derelict in his duty if he did not make use of every \ntraditional proper rule of procedure in this Senate to see that it does \nnot happen, and that I will do. We agreed to execute this surge and to \ntake a report in September. That is what we should do. We already have \na new strategy.\n  We debated it at length in April and in May. Bipartisan meetings \noccurred. The Democratic leader and the Republican leader went to the \nWhite House, and they talked and they talked, and we finally agreed and \npassed, 80 to 14, the bill that funds this surge. That is our new \nstrategy.\n  We knew exactly what we were voting for. There was no dispute about \nit. We were voting for an increase in American soldiers in Iraq and a \nnew emphasis on General Petraeus's strategy of counterinsurgency and \nincreasing security in Baghdad particularly. That is the strategy \nGeneral Petraeus is now executing. Are we now to change it again? Are \nwe now to have a strategy de jure or a new one every week based on \ncoffee shop talk or some poll that just came in?\n  Senator Reid earlier today quoted polls that said people agree with \nhim. He said someone talked to his brother. Let's get real here. The \nestablished bipartisan policy that we passed 80 to 14, 53 days ago, \nmust not be lightly changed on polls and anecdotes--change without even \nlistening to the general who is in Iraq, seeking his opinion. It would \nembarrass the United States before our allies and the world. Indeed, \nU.N. Security General Ban Ki-moon yesterday urged us to exercise \n``great caution'' in considering a rapid withdrawal from Iraq. He said:\n\n       It is not my place to inject myself into this discussion \n     taking place between the American people, government and \n     Congress. But I'd like to tell you that a great caution \n     should be taken for the sake of the Iraqi people. Any abrupt \n     withdrawal or decision may lead to a further deterioration.\n\n  Well, is that a product of President Bush's pressure or some \nhardheadedness? No. The Secretary General is very worried that we may \nabruptly alter our commitments and policies without any rational plan \nfor what would happen next.\n  A rushed withdrawal, I think, could even signal political panic. It \ncould signal a lack of seriousness and thoughtfulness. It is \nunthinkable that the Senate would vote to flip-flop our strategy while \nour soldiers at this very moment work to execute the congressional \npolicy we assigned them 54 days ago.\n  Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi will have in effect taken over, I \nsuppose, as Commander in Chief in conducting this military action and \nbegun to direct the very deployment of our soldiers on the battlefield, \ntelling them what they can and cannot do, without any advice from the \nmilitary and, indeed, contrary to our Commander's wishes and opinions. \nThey do not even want to hear his report, the one we asked him to give \njust a few days ago.\n  Well, maybe somebody, if they are going to take over that, would have \nto tell him what we voted on if this bill were to pass. Hopefully, it \nwill not. A phone call might go like this: General Petraeus, this is \nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid. I know we confirmed you to lead the \nnew surge, and after much debate we voted on May 24, 80 to 14, to \napprove and to fully fund your new surge strategy. I voted ``yes'' for \nit, too. But that was then. That was 54 days ago. Since then we have \nheard from antiwar activists--some of them come in cute pink suits and \nwear crowns--from many concerned citizens, and somebody talked to my \nbrother, and maybe a few pollsters and political consultants have been \nconsulted. So just forget that old strategy. We now have voted for a \nnew one. It will be very popular here. Prepare for rapid withdrawal of \nyour forces. Your work is a failure. You will not succeed. We do not \nwant to listen to your report. Just make sure you comply with our \nmandates and pull out of there.\n  Well, he might go on--the majority leader might--well, yes, we did \nsay you would have until your report in September, but that promise was \na long time ago. It was 54 days ago. Much has changed here at home. \nJust follow our new strategy. Well, General Petraeus, I know you feel \nsomething is owed to our soldiers out there who are at risk working to \nexecute the surge strategy\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nwe supported just 54 days ago. Just tell them we changed our minds. You \nsay they will be let down if they are stopped before they have an \nopportunity to achieve success? I do not think so. They will get over \nit.\n  Well, maybe that is a bit unfair. Maybe that is not a fair way to \ndeal with it. But with a little senatorial poetic license, I think it \nmakes a sort of point. Many have said that President Bush lied to get \nus into this war. I reject that. But what is the integrity in voting on \na policy in May that puts 30,000 more soldiers in harm's way and then \nwe pull the plug on them before they have half a chance to be \nsuccessful?\n  Our military will go where we ask them to go. They will go into \nharm's way. They are willing to put their lives on the line. They do \nnot want to be put on the line if we are not going to follow through to \nsuccess in the end. Among the other adverse ramifications of a \nprecipitous withdrawal, a failure of will by the Congress that denies \nour military a fair chance to be successful, I think could be damaging \nto the morale of the finest military we have ever had. I think it is an \nimportant matter.\n  There are a lot of things we need to be thinking about. I do not know \nhow this war will come out. I am anxious to hear General Petraeus's \nreport. He finished at the top of his class at West Point or near the \ntop. He was No. 1 in his class at the Command and General Staff \nCollege. He has his Ph.D from Princeton. He is a Ranger combat \ncommander of the 101st Airborne, and he has written the manual on how \nto defeat an insurgency. He has only had his full complement of the \nsurge troops about 3 weeks.\n  I believe it is premature and immature for us to react in this way \nand vote to bring those soldiers home, to reorder how they will be \ndeployed without even seeking his opinion or giving it sufficient \nthought.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has been \nwaiting patiently for, I believe, an hour or so. I note the Senator \nfrom New York is on the floor. So I will speak for a few minutes and \nthen yield the floor.\n  I want to point out that again, yesterday, British Army Lieutenant \nGeneral Graeme Lamb, Deputy Commander of Multinational Force, Iraq, and \nsenior British military representative in Iraq, was asked by Jamie \nMcIntyre of CNN about how ``the growing sentiment in our Congress to \nbring U.S. troops home sooner affected the mood of troops deployed in \nIraq.''\n  Lieutenant General Lamb responded that those troops find it ``a touch \ndifficult because while it is so clear to them that we are making \nprogress, it is not reflected by those who are not in the fight but are \nsitting back and making judgment upon what they, the troops, can see \nwith absolute clarity.''\n  Lieutenant General Lamb noted that those making such judgments and \nnot taking note of the progress ``are not going out every day in a \nhumvee.'' Moreover, he further noted that the progress the troops see \nis ``seldom reported.'' They see provincial councils. They see water \ngoing to people who did not have it before. They see electricity coming \non line. They see stability to the networks. They see all the stuff \nthat no one portrays.\n  That is the view of our deputy to General Petraeus over in Iraq. Yet \nI hear on the floor here--I hear again there has been no progress made, \nthat the status quo remains, that there has been no progress. And as we \nget into the debate, we find that those who are supportive of this \nparticular amendment, which requires after 120 days a departure from \nthe conflict, have no plan B themselves. I have been asked continuously \nwhat plan B is. And plan B, after the surge, I believe details a set of \ndifficult options. But I think it is important that we point out what \nhas been happening in Iraq as a result of the surge, even though it has \nbeen a very short period of time.\n  In Anbar Province--which we all know is over here, as shown on the \nmap. Here is Fallujah. Here is Ramadi. The fact is that last year Anbar \nProvince we believed was lost to al-Qaida. The U.S. and Iraqi troops \ncleaned al-Qaida fighters out of Ramadi, which I visited last week, and \nother areas of western Anbar Province. Tribal sheiks broke with the \nterrorists and joined the coalition side. Ramadi, months ago, was \nIraq's most dangerous city. It is now one of its safest. Attacks are \ndown from 30 to 35 a day in February to zero on most days now.\n  Fallujah. The Iraqi police center established numerous stations and \ndivided the city into gated districts. Violence has declined. Local \nintelligence tips have proliferated.\n  Throughout Anbar Province--this area shown right here on the map--\nthousands of men are signing up for the police and army, and the locals \nare taking the fight to al-Qaida. All 18 major tribes in that province \nare now on board with the security plan. A year from now, the Iraqi \nArmy and police could have total control of security in Ramadi, \nallowing American forces to safely draw down.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was in that area, also, in the spring and was there \nlast fall. Last fall, I thought it was one of the worst briefings, the \nmost troubling briefings I had about the condition in the al-Anbar \nregion. I say to the Senator, you have been there, I guess, within the \nlast week. It was a dramatic turnaround. One of the thoughts that went \nin my mind was: Why would I ever want to bet against the U.S. Marines. \nThey were out there having a tough challenge, but this thing has turned \naround, has it not? I ask the Senator, is that his view, from talking \nto the people on the ground, as they explained it to us?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator's question, I \nwould say a couple things have happened. One is obviously, as the \nSenator has pointed out, the bravery and courage of our Marines and \nArmy personnel who are there. But in addition to that, al-Qaida has \nbeen so cruel, so disruptive, and causing so many difficulties that the \nsheiks, the Sunni sheiks have come over on our side.\n  About a year ago, they were recruiting about 20 to 25 people a month \nto join the local police. The last time they had a recruitment drive, \nsome 1,200 young Sunnis showed up.\n  Now, I will freely admit to my friend from Alabama, you will never \nsee this probably in much of the media reporting today. That is why you \nhave to go over there and get feet on the ground, as I know the Senator \nfrom Alabama has, the Senator from Minnesota and others, as well as the \nSenator from New York. But you have to see it, and you have to talk to \nthese people.\n  It brings up another point. These soldiers, marines, airmen, others, \nmen and women, pay attention to what is going on here on the floor of \nthe Senate. They pay attention when the majority leader of the Senate \nsays the war is ``lost.'' They pay attention when people, previous \nspeakers have said nothing has changed, no improvement. They pay \nattention to that.\n\n  General Petraeus said in response to a question I asked him a long \ntime ago--I said:\n\n       Suppose we send you additional troops, and we tell those \n     troops we support you, but we are convinced you cannot \n     accomplish your mission, and we do not support the mission we \n     are sending you on. What effect does that have on the morale \n     of your troops?\n\n  That is a question I asked General Petraeus back in January. General \nPetraeus said:\n\n       Well, it would not be a beneficial effect, sir. Obviously, \n     a commander would like to go forward with as much flexibility \n     as he can achieve. I was assured yesterday by the Secretary \n     of Defense, if we need additional assets, my job is to ask \n     for them.\n\n  Of course, Lieutenant General, British Army General Lamb was much \nmore frank in his response, where he said:\n\n       While it is clear to them that we're making progress, it is \n     not reflected by those who are not in the fight but are \n     sitting back and making judgment upon what they, the troops, \n     can see with absolute clarity.\n\n  So my answer to the Senator from Alabama is--and I will go through \nsome more areas where we made progress--it is very unfortunate that \nmore Americans do not know not only about the success but of the \nincredible difficulty of this kind of combat, and yet these young \npeople are doing such a magnificent job.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my experience is much like the Senator \nfrom Alabama. When I was there in the fall, it was described to me as \nthe ``Wild West'' and it was not very uplifting. When I was there in \nApril, we had Minnesota National Guard soldiers who were serving in \nAnbar Province, and they told me of an incident in a town called \nHabbaniya, where a suicide bomber drove into a crowd coming out of a \nmosque, killing or wounding 70 Iraqis. It was the American soldiers and \nNational Guardsmen giving blood, even though not a single American had \nbeen hurt or injured.\n  Then they told me, the next day, or shortly thereafter, the local \nmayor and the local sheik came in with a list of al-Qaida operatives \nand said: These are the enemy. We want to work with you side by side to \nroot them out.\n  I ask the Senator, in your experience there, have you also seen \nincidents or heard of incidents where the brutality of al-Qaida against \nSunnis has evoked a response from local sheiks and local elected \nofficials to work side by side with the Americans--be they the Marines, \nArmy, or National Guard?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Minnesota, he is \nexactly right. The fact is the people there are sick of al-Qaida, as he \nwell points out. The sheiks are on our side. Al-Qaida has reacted, \npredictably, very violently. They have assassinated some of these \nsheiks. They have assassinated their families. Their lives are \nthreatened every day.\n  But the fact is, they are sick and tired of al-Qaida. They are \nturning out in large numbers to join the local police. And they are \ndoing, frankly, a job that surprises many of us.\n  I wish also to comment in my remarks that this is a long way--a long \nway--from the security situation we want. But somehow to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and say we have not had some signs of success I \nthink flies in the face of the assessment of the generals and those we \nplaced in charge and the facts on the ground.\n  South of Baghdad, as I was saying, in this area, as shown on the map, \nOperation Phantom Thunder is intended to stop insurgents present in the \nBaghdad belts from originating attacks in the capital itself.\n  A brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, which I visited, is \noperating in Baghdad belts that have been havens for al-Qaida. And the \nslog is tough. It is very tough in that part, south of Baghdad, since \nmany of the al-Qaida and other insurgents have migrated out of Baghdad \ninto that area. But the soldiers of the 10th Mountain Division are \nmoving forward, all of them. Commanders report that the local sheiks \nthere are increasingly siding with the coalition against al-Qaida. \nSoutheast of Baghdad, the military is targeting al-Qaida in safe havens \nthat they maintain along the Tigris River. In Baghdad itself--the key \nto all of this--the military, in cooperation with Iraqi security \nforces, continues to establish joint security stations and deploy \nthroughout the city. These efforts have produced positive results, \naccording to General Petraeus and others. Sectarian violence has fallen \nsince January. The total number of car bombings and suicide attacks \ndeclined in May and June. The number of locals coming forward with \nintelligence tips has risen.\n\n  Make no mistake, violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high \nlevels. Suicide bombers and other threats pose formidable challenges, \nand other difficulties abound. Nevertheless, there appears to be \noverall movement in the right direction.\n  North of Baghdad, the Diyala area--up here--Iraqi and American troops \nhave surged and are fighting to deny al-Qaida sanctuary in the city of \nBakuba. For the first time since the war began, America showed up in \nforce and did not quickly withdraw from the area as had been the case \nin the previous failed strategy. In response, locals have formed a new \nalliance with the coalition to counter al-Qaida. Diyala, which was the \ncenter of Abu Mus'ab al Zarqawi's proposed Islamic caliphate, finally \nhas a chance to turn aside the forces of extremism.\n  I offer these observations not in order to present a rosy scenario of \nthe challenges we continue to face in Iraq. As last week's horrific \nbombing in Salah ad Din Province illustrates so graphically, the \nthreats to Iraq's stability have not gone away, nor are they likely to \ngo away in the near future, and our brave men and women in Iraq will \ncontinue to face great challenges. What I do believe is that while the \nmission to bring a degree of security to Iraq, into Baghdad and its \nenvirons in particular, in order to establish the necessary \nprecondition for political and economic progress, while that mission is \nstill in its early stages, the progress our military has made should \nencourage all of us.\n  It is also clear that the overall strategy General Petraeus has put \ninto place, a traditional counterinsurgency strategy which emphasizes \nprotecting the population and which gets our troops off the bases and \ninto the areas they are trying to protect, is the correct one.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that we should return troops to the \nforward operating bases--that is basically what would happen if we \npassed the Levin-Reed amendment--and confine their activities to \ntraining and targeted counterterrorism operations. That is basically \nwhat this resolution says. That is precisely what we did for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, and the situation in Iraq got worse--precisely. I am surprised \nmy colleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld-Casey \nstrategy. No one can be certain whether this new strategy, which \nremains in the early stages, can bring about greater stability. We can \nbe sure that should the United States seek to legislate an end to this \nstrategy as it is just beginning, then we will fail for certain.\n  Mr. President, I read this earlier, this resolution. This resolution \nincredibly says that we can only--the mission is restricted to only \nfighting al-Qaida. I guess al-Qaida will have to wear T-shirts that say \nthey are al-Qaida. I guess our troops are expected, if someone is \nplanting an IED, to say: Excuse me, sir. Are you al-Qaida or Shiite? If \nyou are Shiite, go ahead and plant it. Please.\n  Now that the military effort is showing some signs of progress, the \nspace is opening for political progress. Yet, rather than seize the \nopportunity, the Government, under Prime Minister Maliki, is not \nfunctioning as it must. We see little evidence of reconciliation and \nlittle progress toward meeting the benchmarks laid out by the \nPresident. The Iraqi Government can function; the question is whether \nit will.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to take a look at one more chart. \nI appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues, but I think we ought to \nlook at the region. I think we ought to have a look at this region \ntoday. With Iraq obviously in the center of an area of the world from \nwhich comes the world's supply of oil, from which comes the recruits \nfor al-Qaida, from which comes the primary source--not the only source, \nas we have found, but the primary source--of suicide bombers and people \nwho would rather commit suicide and take others' lives along with their \nown, what happens when Iraq evolves into chaos and genocide?\n  Iranians are already exporting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq, IEDs \nthat are capable of even penetrating the armor of our tanks. They are \nexporting into Iraq not only terrorists and those who have orchestrated \nattacks, including the kidnapping of American soldiers--there is very \ncompelling evidence that they were paid to do that--but they are also \nincreasing their influence in all of southern Iraq. Religious leaders \nhave gone into southern Iraq, into the small towns as well as Basra. \nBasra has become, unfortunately, a very dangerous city, thanks to \nIranian influence. In the meantime, the Iranians, emboldened by our \nfailure in Iraq, continue to do other things as well, including \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, including providing support for Hezbollah \nand Hamas.\n  We see the Saudis now becoming more and more concerned about the fate \nof the Sunnis. In fact, a few weeks ago, the King of Saudi Arabia made \ncomments very critical about the United States of America for the first \ntime in anyone's recorded memory. Why would he do such a thing? One, \nour failure; two, they live in the neighborhood and they can't leave. \nWhen we talk about telling them we are leaving, then they have to \nadjust to it. There is very little doubt that the Saudis, with their \nsupport of madrasas and other extremist training grounds, are \nresponsible for many of the problems.\n  Jordan now has--see how small Jordan is--Jordan now has 750,000 Iraqi\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\nrefugees. How many more do you think will pour into Jordan if this \ninstability and chaos ensues, which the majority leader of the Senate \nhas stated, as short a time ago as yesterday, as hypothetical. I think \nthere is very little doubt that the destabilization of Jordan would be \nat least increased.\n  What about our friends the Syrians who continue to export people who \nare suicide bombers into Iraq? The majority of suicide bombers, \naccording to experts, aren't Iraqis; they come from other parts of the \nMiddle East, from Saudi Arabia, from Pakistan, from Afghanistan, and \nother places. What about the Syrians? If you might remember, after our \ninitial victory in Iraq and the assassination of the former Prime \nMinister of Lebanon, Hariri, Mr. Assad, Bashar Assad, a former \noptometrist in London, when his father died, was on his heels. There \nwas supposed to be an investigation going on of the Syrian involvement \nin the assassination of Hariri, and there have been other \nassassinations as well.\n\n  Meanwhile, in southern Lebanon, despite a U.N. Security Council \nresolution calling for the disarmament of Hezbollah, Hezbollah is now \nbeing rearmed by the Syrians, and their rockets are being resupplied--\nKatyusha rockets and other weapons are being supplied to the Hezbollah \nin southern Lebanon. Some believe it is a matter of time before there \nis a reignition of rocket attacks and conflicts in southern Lebanon.\n  What about on the other side? What about the Palestinian area? We now \nsee a situation in the Palestinian areas where Gaza is now controlled \nby Hamas, an organization dedicated to the extinction of the State of \nIsrael. My friends, here is a stark fact: We pull out of Iraq, Iraq \ndevolves into chaos, and the pressures and the danger to the State of \nIsrael is greater than at any time in its history. I don't say that is \nmy opinion; that is the opinion of the military and political leaders \nof Israel today.\n  One other aspect that I wish to point out. We know the Kurdish area \nis probably the most stable part of Iraq for a variety of reasons, \nincluding their experience in self-governance. But the Turks have made \nit very clear that if the Kurds attempt to establish an independent \nstate, they will not stand for it; they will take action militarily. I \nam not saying that; they have said it. So we have a deterioration in \nBaghdad, in Iraq, the Kurds declare their independence, and the Turks \nthen feel they are required to take military action because of the \ninsurgency of Kurds who have launched attacks out of the Kurdish areas \ninto Turkey.\n  So I think it is important for us to recognize there is a lot at \nstake here. It isn't just Iraq. Certainly, Iraq is part of it, but it \nis not just Iraq; it is certainly other parts of the region as well.\n  I hope when my colleagues say, as the majority leader said, ``It is \nonly a hypothetical'' if chaos evolves in the region, that we are \nrequired to consider the situation in the entire region and what \nhappens right here where the world's supply of oil--the majority of the \nworld's supply of oil--comes from as well, that we consider the \nconsequences of our actions.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, the description of the problems that \nare currently existing in Iraq and in the region by my friend and \ncolleague is not only accurate but, unfortunately, an indictment of the \npolicies of this administration. What has been described in terms of \nthe instability in Iraq and the consequences for further conflict are \nones I take very seriously.\n  The issue before us now is what is the best approach we as a nation \ncan take which will fulfill our obligations to our men and women in \nuniform, which will make clear to the Iraqi Government and people that \ntheir lives and futures are at stake, and which will strengthen the \nhand of the United States diplomatically to deal with the consequences \nof the misguided policies that have brought us to this point.\n  There are no good answers. Anyone who stands here and believes that \nhe or she has the truth, the facts, understands both what is going on \nand what is likely to flow from whatever decision we take, is most \nprobably to be proven wrong by reality as it unfolds. Many of us have \nbeen searching for the best approach to take with respect to our \ninvolvement in Iraq for a number of years, but we don't do it with any \nsense that we know everything that will happen, no matter what \ndecisions are taken. But what we do have is a history of miscalculation \nand mistakes we are now attempting to deal with.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment attempts to put into law a new direction for \nIraq, one that I and others believe is long overdue. The reason I have \ncome to support this amendment is because if one looks at the actions \nof our military in Iraq, based on the authority under which they are \noperating, they have achieved the missions they were given. They were \nasked to remove Saddam Hussein from power and bring him to justice, and \nthey did so. They were asked to provide the Iraqi people with the \nopportunity for free and fair elections, and they did that as well. \nThey were asked to give the Iraqi Government the space and time to make \nthe difficult political decisions that are required in order to have \nany hope of stabilizing Iraq over the longer term, and they did that as \nwell. Our military has performed not only heroically but successfully, \nwith courage and determination, against odds and enemies from all \nsides.\n  What we know is that when the people of Iraq turn against violence, \nthere is a chance for success. That is the basis of the \ncounterinsurgency strategy. It cannot succeed unless the people on the \nground are part of the winning strategy. What has happened in Al Anbar \nProvince is an example of that. The tribal sheiks and the people turned \nagainst the violence and extremism of the al-Qaida factions, many of \nwhom were led by foreign fighters who violated not just the human \nrights but the cultural norms that existed in the area. So there became \nthe opportunity for an alliance--an alliance between our military and \nlocal people against al-Qaida. That is why the Levin-Reed amendment \nincludes the continuing efforts against al-Qaida as a remaining mission \nand a vital national security interest of the United States.\n  If one looks, though, at the map that was just on the easel, that \ndoes not describe the situation in the rest of Iraq. In the south, I \nthink it is clear that Iran is the political occupier, that Iranian \nagents are largely calling the shots, and that there is an internecine \nstruggle for power among a variety of Shiite militias.\n  The lawlessness inside Basra and in the surrounding region cannot be \nquelled by any external force. The British have not only drawn down \ntheir troops, but they have withdrawn to their bases. They know they \ncan't go out and calm the waters because the various factions are vying \nfor power. They are going to continue to do so until someone emerges, \nand Iran is largely influential in determining who that might be.\n  In Baghdad, we have gone from neighborhood to neighborhood, and yes, \nwhere we are, we secure the area, the violence recedes, only to pop up \nsomewhere else, either in Baghdad or maybe in Diyala or Bakuba or \nsomewhere else.\n  Madam President, the problem is that Iraq is not al-Anbar Province. \nAl-Qaida is not the major source of the instability in Iraq. It \nconducts the most violent and spectacular mission. It provides the \nsuicidal killers, who blow themselves up and blow up the cars and \ntrucks in which they live at the moment. But they are not the primary \ncause of the violence and instability in Iraq. Therefore, the \ncounterinsurgency cannot succeed unless there is a dramatic change in \nthe attitude of both the Government and the people of Iraq. I do not \nsee that happening.\n  The Iraqi Government has not been willing to make the hard decisions. \nThe debate as to whether they are incapable or unwilling is beside the \npoint. They have not done it. We keep hearing every year, every month, \nevery week that things will be different. How many times have we heard \nthat as the Iraqis stand up, our troops will stand down? How many times \nhave we heard that in 6 months, 8 months, or 12 months our troops may \nstart coming home? Meanwhile, there are more American troops in Iraq \ntoday than ever before. The Iraqi Government is more fractured and less \neffective. The right strategy before the surge and the right strategy\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\nnow, postescalation, is the same: Start bringing our troops out of this \nmultisided sectarian civil war.\n  I believe since our troops have accomplished the mission that was \noriginally set forth, withdrawing them from urban combat, from patrol \nduty, from the kind of hand-to-hand engagement they are currently \nconfronted with, is the right military and political strategy. It is \nclear that as we look at where we are today in Iraq, we are asking our \nyoung men and women to police a civil war. There is no argument about \nthe very basic premise that there is no military solution. Yet the \npolitical front has been neglected.\n  If there had been a political surge and a diplomatic surge, we might \nbe looking at a different situation. We also know that the training and \nperformance of the Iraqi Army and police forces has not been sufficient \nto relieve our troops of the primary responsibility for the fight. In \nfact, because of setbacks and other problems, the numbers of Iraqi \ntroops that are actually available to fight alongside or to take \nresponsibility for the fight has diminished. As our troops serve \nalongside Iraqi Army officers and soldiers, they find that, yes, some \ndo have loyalty to Iraq. Others, however, are loyal to sectarian \nmilitias. Others have looked the other way when the insurgents have \nplanted bombs. Some have even taken up arms against Americans while \nwearing the uniforms that we help provide.\n  The catalog of miscalculations, misjudgments, and mistakes in Iraq \nshocks the conscience, from the unilateral decision to rush to a \npreemptive war without allowing the inspectors to finish their work, or \nwaiting for diplomacy to run its course, to the failure to send enough \ntroops or provide proper equipment for them, to the denial of a rising \ninsurgency, and the failure to adjust the military strategy, to \ncontinue support for a government unwilling to make the necessary \npolitical compromises, to the adherence to a broken policy more than 4 \nyears after the invasion began.\n  Many of us believe it is time for us to move our troops out of harm's \nway in the middle of the Iraqi civil war. We believe that is an \nappropriate military decision that will be made sooner or later. The \nrecent report, which was an interim report, did not have very much good \nnews in it. In September, we will get another report, which I predict \nwill be also mixed, which will put the best face on whatever the facts \nare. But the bottom line will remain the same: Our troops and their \nfamilies are paying the price for this administration's policies.\n  Since the Bush administration announced this escalation, 14 brave New \nYorkers have been killed in Iraq, and hundreds more wounded. Two \nsoldiers from the 10th Mountain Division, based in Fort Drum, are \nlisted as captured or missing. Since the war began, 3,619 young \nAmericans have been killed, 26,000 have been wounded, many with very \nvisible wounds, such as loss of limbs and loss of eyes, others with \nthose wounds that are invisible but no less injurious, such as \ndepression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic \nbrain injury.\n  We have spent more than $450 billion so far, $10 billion each month. \nWe are straining our budget. The President's two major initiatives \nsince he was sworn into office in January 2001 have been tax cuts for \nthe rich and the war in Iraq, neither of which is paid for. They have \nbeen put on the American credit card. They have been funded by \nborrowing money from foreign countries, further undermining our \nstanding and our leverage in the world. Our involvement in Iraq \ncontinues to erode our position. It has damaged our alliances and it \nhas limited our ability to respond to real threats. The unclassified \nkey judgments of the recent National Intelligence Estimate, called \n``The Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland,'' says the threat of al-\nQaida is persistent and evolving. The report states that al-Qaida will \nprobably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of al-Qaida in \nIraq, its most visible and capable affiliate, and the only one known to \nhave expressed a desire to attack the homeland.\n  This reality is a sobering one and I believe one that demands a new \ndirection. I continue to press for a basic three-step approach. First, \nstart bringing our troops out of harm's way now.\n  Second, demand--and back up those demands--that the Iraqis take \nresponsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them. \nEveryone knows the Iraqi Government is as much a client of Iran as it \nis an ally of the United States. Our presence in this multisided \nsectarian civil war, without a diplomatic or political strategy, makes \nit unlikely that the Iraqi Government will seek the resolution of the \ndisputes that lie at the heart of this ongoing civil war.\n  Thirdly, we should begin long overdue intensive regional and \ninternational diplomacy on a sustained basis. Diplomacy in and of \nitself does not promise any great solution, but we have neglected it at \nour peril. Others have rushed to fill the vacuum. In fact, the problems \nthat were pointed out on the map of the region have also been impacted \nby the administration's failure to pursue smart diplomacy. As we look \nat the deteriorating situation in the Middle East, the pressures on the \nIsraeli Government because of the rise of Hamas and the strength of \nHezbollah, we can see the consequences of both our failed diplomatic \nstrategy and our problems in Iraq today.\n  I have called for the strategic redeployment of U.S. forces out of \nIraq for several years. I have introduced legislation to end the war \nbut to remain committed to vital national security interests that can \nbe enumerated and more carefully defined. I voted against funding the \nwar without any plan for ending it, or without any companion effort to \nengage in realistic political and diplomatic initiatives. That is why I \nhave joined a bipartisan majority in supporting the Levin-Reed \namendment.\n\n  It has been very difficult to get the President's attention. I hear \nthat from both sides of the aisle. The Congress has both a duty and an \nopportunity to try to do that. We have one Commander in Chief at a time \nand we have seen repeatedly this administration's failure to deal with \nthe realities we confront in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. When \nthey do change course, as long as it takes them to make that decision, \nas we have seen in North Korea, the results can be very positive. I can \nonly hope that in the remaining 18 months of this administration, \nsimilar actions are undertaken to deal with the problems we confront in \nthe larger region, including Iraq and the Middle East.\n  I believe, too, it is imperative that the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Joint Chiefs inform the Congress of the plans they have for \nredeployment and withdrawal. Withdrawing troops is dangerous and \ndifficult. We must not redeploy out of Iraq with the same failure of \nplanning with which our troops were deployed into Iraq. Yet I wrote \nseveral weeks ago to Secretary Gates and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, General Pace, asking whether there is planning--very specific \nplanning, not the usual response that, yes, we plan for everything, for \nevery contingency--and what is the planning that will protect our \ntroops when they do withdraw, which will happen, whether it happens in \n120 days, or next year, or whether it happens the year after; what have \nwe done to make sure that we do it in as careful and orderly a way as \npossible.\n  I believe our troops, as well as the American people, deserve a vote, \nyes or no, on this bill. If you believe in giving the President the \ncontinued power to pursue a failed strategy, without checks or balances \nby this Congress, make your case and cast your vote. If not, then put \npartisanship aside and stand with the bipartisan majority working to \nend this war.\n  Our message to the President is clear: It is time to start thinking \nof our troops and our broader position in Iraq and beyond--not next \nyear, not next month, but today. I hope we will be able to vote on the \nLevin-Reed amendment. I fear we will not, in the face of concerns and \nobjections on the other side. But we are postponing the inevitable. \nCome September, we will have another inconclusive report. We will have \nmore casualties. We will have more who are injured. We will still have \nthe same Iraqi Government waiting us out. We will continue to empower \nIran and to destabilize Jordan and to give a free hand to Syria and \nHezbollah. We will face an even more dangerous set of choices then. \nThere is no reason to wait.\n  Madam President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Coleman now be recognized for\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\nup to 15 minutes, to be followed by Senator Casey for 15 minutes, \nSenator Barrasso for 5 minutes, and following the remarks of Senator \nBarrasso, Senator Reid be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I note that if we adopt the Levin-Reed \namendment, we would be doing what the Senator from New York said we \nshould not do. We must not redeploy out of Iraq with the same failure \nof planning there was going in.\n  This amendment before us today is a directive from the Senate to \nredeploy out of Iraq without any planning. Simply sitting here in this \nair-conditioned Chamber, making a statement that this is what we are \ngoing to do, without talking to the commanders on the ground would be a \ntragic mistake.\n  Earlier this year, when the President talked about the surge, I \nraised an objection. In my travels to Iraq, it was clear to me that we \nwere facing a battle in Anbar Province against al-Qaida in Iraq, the \nSunni insurgency; and that battle, by the way, we were winning, and we \nsee the results of that today. But in Baghdad we faced sectarian \nviolence and faced American soldiers being in the midst of a civil war, \nand that troubled me. I raised concerns.\n  But then 54 days ago we had a discussion in this Chamber. We took a \nrollcall vote on a bill, and the bill passed 80 to 14, with over four-\nfifths of the Senate agreeing that day, with rare bipartisanship that \nwe achieved in this Chamber. That wasn't about naming a post office or \na courthouse. We got an agreement to address the future of our \ninvolvement in Iraq. In that bipartisan effort on the floor of the \nSenate, we gave support to General Petraeus, who was confirmed \nunanimously in the Senate, who would provide a report to this body on \nthe surge that I had concerns about no later than September 15. General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Corker, our Ambassador to Iraq, who served in \nPakistan right before being selected as Ambassador to Iraq, would come \nback and deliver a report to this body and the President, with the \nPresident delivering a report no later than September 15. We required \nthis report because we decided as a body that regardless of our \nconcerns about the new strategy, we should allow General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Corker to execute the new strategy and to report on their \nprogress.\n  We recently came to broad bipartisan agreement that we should give \nthe strategy a chance to work. How did we end up here tonight picking a \ndate for withdrawal before the report and testimony that we mandated? I \ndon't have the answer. I am afraid that question itself causes me to \noppose the Levin-Reed amendment. I have the utmost respect for the \nSenator from Michigan. We have served together on the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations for years, working as a team to defend \nAmerica and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Recently, we dealt with \nthe possibility of dirty bombs being developed in this country. So I \nknow he is a good man. I believe the amendment is well intentioned and \nI believe the transition is a goal that I share. The bottom line is we \nneed a mission in Iraq in the sense that we cannot be fighting the \nIraqis' war for them. They have to step forward and achieve power and \nreconciliation--things they have not done to date. We cannot, however, \nhave a precipitous withdrawal.\n  I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have had hour \nafter hour of testimony on the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal \nand the impact it would have on the ethnic cleansing in Iraq. I will \ntalk more about the region.\n  Ultimately, our safety is my concern. Precipitous withdrawal would \nset in place a series of events, none of which are positive. I didn't \nhear anyone come before the Foreign Relations Committee to talk about \nthat. The Iraq Study Group, which so many have looked at and pointed \nto, made it clear--no precipitous withdrawal.\n  Right now, we have an amendment that sets a withdrawal, that doesn't \nconsult the commanders on the ground, that flies in the face of action \nwe took 54 days ago. I can't answer the question, why now? In part, I \nhear from the majority leader and others. Are there polls? Do we lift \nour finger to the wind and say: Well, 54 days ago, we told General \nPetraeus to move forward. We have our troops on the ground who are \ncarrying out their mission. Yet we are debating today to say we are \ngoing to move forward with a plan for withdrawal which has not been \nthought out, which has not been planned, which has not been processed \nin a way that you would think one should do that. We are concerned \nabout the consequences, in spite of the fact that 54 days ago we sent a \nmessage to General Petraeus: Go forth with the surge, and then come \nback and report to us.\n  There are consequences to precipitous withdrawal. If you look at \nIraq--and the Senator from Arizona talked about this a little earlier--\nin the northern region, Turkey has troops on the Iraqi border and \ninside Iraq. If we were to withdraw and if there were to be that \ndivision, you would have a Kurdistan. There are deep concerns that the \nTurks would move forward. There are concerns about terrorism, a group \ncalled the PKK. You have that issue of instability. You have Anbar \nProvince in which there has been much discussion about the successes we \nhave achieved in Anbar Province with the local sheiks joining our side. \nBut you have foreign fighters coming in, without anyone stepping in \nbetween, from Syria, the Syrian border there, landing at Damascus \nAirport and coming through and then destabilizing that region and \nperhaps setting back the gains we have made.\n  In the south, we have Iran. Iran clearly, as my colleagues on both \nsides have noted, is playing a major part in what is happening, not \njust in the south but in the region. The fact is, in Lebanon, Hezbollah \nis a proxy of Iran. The weapons Hezbollah has have come through Iran \nthrough Syria. In the Gaza Strip in Israel, Hamas is a tool of Iran. So \nif we were to simply withdraw without planning, if we were to put in \nplace a series of events that caused disruption and conflict in the \nregion, we would give Iranians a chance to strengthen their hand. If \nthey do that, then what do the Saudis do?\n  I have had conversations with Saudi leaders. I am ranking member of \nthe Near East Subcommittee. I have had conversations with Egyptian \nleaders, the Jordanians. They don't want to see Iran go forward. They \ndon't want to see Iran expand its power.\n  It is fascinating, because the Senator from New York talked about our \nposition in the world and long overdue international diplomacy. The \nmoderate Iraqi States in the region see the threat of Islamic extremism \nas fostering the support of Moqtada al-Sadr, the support of Hezbollah, \nthe support of Hamas. They understand that is a greater threat to them \nthan Israel. So they don't want to see us precipitously withdraw.\n  Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, has been quoted \nrepeatedly on the floor, saying to us that we need to understand the \nserious consequences if we were to simply withdraw. There are \nconsequences not just for the region but, ultimately, for us in terms \nof the threat of terrorism being expanded with an al-Qaida victory, if \nAmerica is out. They drove the Russians out of Afghanistan. America is \ndriven out of Iraq. That represents a threat to us. That represents \ngreater recruitment. It represents the battle being brought from there \nto here. That is a real concern.\n  We have a situation where 54 days ago we said to General Petraeus in \nSeptember: Come forward with a report. Then, from that, we will go \nforth with a plan of action.\n  I would hope that right away the administration now is looking at a \nseries of choices. Senators Lugar and Warner have put that on the \ntable. I hope that is going on now, that we understand that the Iraqi \nGovernment has not done the things that have to be done to move forward \nwith power sharing and reconciliation. They have not met the \nbenchmarks. I have grave concerns about their ability to do so. We have \nto be looking at alternatives. We have to be looking at a range of \noptions. But why now? Why at this point in time, other than there are, \nI presume, interest groups on the left who are concerned that the \nDemocratic majority hasn't done what MoveOn.Org wants them to do, which \nis to get us out of Iraq?\n  We had a bipartisan agreement in this body to have a reasoned course \nof\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\naction, that we need to be out of the central sectarian violence. The \nIraqis need to be fighting their battle. We need to maintain the gains \nwe have had in places such as Anbar and not step back and allow that \nground and that blood that has been shed to be shed for naught. But why \nnow? Why now? What is the event that has somehow triggered the \nnecessity to move forward today, to be here all night? If anything, \nfrom what we heard from General Petraeus on the military side, we are \nmoving forward. On the benchmarks for things the Iraqis haven't done, \nwe have until September.\n  I presume one of the good things that will come out of this debate \nwill be that we put continued pressure on the Iraqis to do what they \nhave to do. I don't know whether Maliki has the ability to do that. I \nhave my doubts. But I think it is really important.\n  The Senator from Michigan said we are going to be measured by how we \nleave. Ultimately, we are not going to be in Iraq fighting their battle \nforever. We may be in Iraq a long time. If you look at this region, we \nmay be there a long time. We have been in Germany a long time, Korea a \nlong time. We have been in Kosovo a long time. But we need to be there, \nnot being in the center of a sectarian battle, not being in the center \nof a civil war, but to make sure the Iranians don't sweep through and \nexpand their influence. We have to make sure the Turks don't step down \nand destabilize the one stable region, to make sure foreign fighters \ndon't move forward and come into Damascus Airport and come across the \nborder near Anbar Province.\n  We need to do that in a way in which it doesn't happen because of \npolitical pressure, it doesn't happen because of a poll, it doesn't \nhappen because we picked a date out of thin air that says: We are doing \na Defense authorization, so now we are going to get a plan for \nwithdrawal on the floor of the Senate without listening to General \nPetraeus, after 54 days ago telling him he could go forward and \ncome back in September.\n\n  It is our responsibility to act in the best interest of our Nation's \nArmed Forces who have sacrificed so much. It is our responsibility to \navoid, as Madison and Hamilton described in Federalist 62, the impulse \nand passion of what might seem like the easiest path--simply ending our \ninvolvement in Iraq and hoping for the best. We cannot do that. We must \ngive the strategy the time we said we would give to it work, while at \nthe same time preparing for our next step, something Senators Warner \nand Lugar have articulated so well. We need to continue to plan for the \nfuture and continue to evolve as we address new challenges and a \nchanging environment.\n  We need to remember that Iraq is not just a war; it is a country that \nis in the center of a very critical region. We have invested blood and \ntreasure in a way we never anticipated, something I remember every time \nI visit Walter Reed. While our commitment is not open-ended, it is a \ncommitment whose new strategy requires us to live up to the obligations \nwe made when we said to our general: Move forward; when we put our \ntroops there and said: Be in harm's way; and then to come back in \nSeptember.\n  We need to change the mission. We shouldn't have a precipitous date \nfor withdrawal. We are going to be there long term, but we have to do \nit thoughtfully, strategically. We cannot have it poll driven. We \ncannot have it special interest driven. We should not be doing it here \nin the Levin-Reed amendment, which I will oppose tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 15 minutes, and if I could have a 2-minute warning so I don't go \nover time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, we are gathered here at this early \nmorning hour, as we have now for hour after hour, to talk about the \nsituation in Iraq. We are here in particular to focus on one amendment, \nthe Levin-Reed amendment. I rise this morning to support that amendment \nfor a variety of reasons. One of the reasons I think it should be \npassed is not just because of the policy contained within it but also \nbecause it is a bipartisan amendment. It is the product of a lot of \nwork over a long period of time. Many months of work have gone into \nthis important amendment.\n  The question we face is very basic. It is the same question we have \nfaced for a long time when it comes to the policy in Iraq. The question \nis, Where do you stand? Do you stand for a new direction in Iraq, a new \npolicy, or do you stand for the other side of the coin, more of the \nsame, stay the course, supporting the President's policy?\n  I argue to a large extent what has happened in the Congress the last \ncouple of years, including this year by some Members of the House and \nSenate, is rubberstamping of the Bush policy in Iraq. That is what we \nare here to talk about: Where do you stand? You are either on one side \nor the other. I argue that we should all stand for a new direction for \na variety of reasons.\n  We know the numbers pretty well: 3,600 Americans--more than that \nnow--have lost their lives. From my home State of Pennsylvania, 69 \nlives have been lost. They gave, as Abraham Lincoln said, the last full \nmeasure of devotion to their country. The number we don't talk enough \nabout is the number of wounded. Nationally, over 25,000 have been \nwounded. Again, in Pennsylvania, the number is very high as well. Over \n1,100 Pennsylvanians have been wounded. Even that doesn't give the full \nsense of what we are talking about. Many of these soldiers have been \ngrievously, permanently, irreparably wounded in this conflict. So we \nare thinking about them today. We are thinking about those who perished \nalready. We are thinking about their families who have had to endure \nthis suffering and trauma and heartache for a long time now.\n  The troops have done their job. There was a lot of talk in the last \ncouple of hours, last night and this morning, and I am sure it will go \non into tomorrow, about defeat, that if this amendment is adopted, that \nsomehow there will be a defeat. I don't believe that. I don't believe \nthat for a moment. Our troops have done their job. They took down a \ndictator. They allowed a government to take shape in a country. They \nhave done their job.\n  It is about time that, as the troops have done their job, this \nCongress and this President do our jobs. One of the jobs we should \nnever ask our troops to do is what we have asked them to do at least in \nthe last couple of months, if not for more than a year. Unlike any \nAmerican fighting men and women in the history of the country, this \nGovernment has asked our troops to referee a civil war. We should never \nask Americans to referee a civil war, not in this war and not in any \nwar.\n  All this talk about defeat not only misses the point, it is \nmisleading. I am afraid it is deliberately misleading. To adopt this \namendment is not adopting defeat. Adopting this amendment is about \ntalking about a light at the end of the tunnel and to make sure we make \nthe right decision on this policy.\n  We hear a lot about Levin-Reed. Let me spend 30 seconds on who Levin \nand Reed are. Senator Carl Levin and Senator Jack Reed are both members \nof the Armed Services Committee. They bring to bear decades of \nexperience in this body combined when they talk about the war in Iraq \nand when they talk about armed services and defense matters. They both \nbring distinguished references even beyond their service on that \ncommittee. Some people in this body remember that Senator Jack Reed was \nan Army Ranger and paratrooper, served in the 82nd Airborne Division. \nSenator Carl Levin, long a supporter of a strong national defense, was \ngiven in 2003 the Distinguished Public Service Award, the highest honor \ngiven to a civilian. So these are not two rookies talking about our \npolicy in Iraq; these are people of broad experience who have already \nproven their credentials in supporting the armed services. They are \nalso people who have worked very hard with the other Members of the \nSenate over many years to get this right.\n\n  I mentioned before that several Senators on the Republican side are \ncosponsors. I won't do biographical sketches of each of them, but \nsuffice it to say, there is an awful lot of military and U.S. Senate \nexperience with the cosponsors of this amendment.\n  What is this amendment? What does it say? It says a number of things. \nI\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nwon't read all of it, of course, but it does talk about, in the opening \nlines of this amendment, a deadline for commencement of a reduction of \nforces. It says that the Secretary of Defense shall commence the \nreduction of the number of U.S. forces in Iraq not later than 120 days \nafter the date of the enactment of the act. It talks in subpart (b) \nabout a comprehensive strategy, diplomatic, political, and economic \nstrategy. It talks about sustained engagement with a focus on stability \nin Iraq. It also speaks to an international mediator in Iraq to help \nour Government get this policy right. Finally, the amendment speaks of \na limited presence of our troops in Iraq and to focus the mission on \nprotecting the United States and coalition personnel, infrastructure, \ntraining and equipping, providing support for Iraqi security forces \nand, thirdly, engaging in targeted counterterrorism.\n  It talks about a limited presence and a limited mission. But it \ndoesn't talk about, as some have mischaracterized it, a precipitous \nwithdrawal. Just because you say that 100 times, as the other side has \nsaid it hour after hour, doesn't mean it is true. That is not what we \nare talking about here.\n  A couple of months ago, almost more than 6 months ago now, the \nPresident justified his surge policy by arguing that additional U.S. \nforces would provide security in Baghdad and other areas, providing so-\ncalled breathing space. Remember what the President said at that time, \nway back in January:\n\n       I have made it clear to the prime minister and Iraq's other \n     leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the \n     Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it \n     will lose the support of the American people, and it will \n     lose the support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act.\n\n  So said the President back in January. Six months later, any fair and \nobjective evaluation of the situation in Iraq would conclude that the \nsurge strategy has not succeeded and the Iraqi Government has failed to \nfollow through on its promises. It should come as no surprise the \nAmerican people no longer support an open-ended involvement of our \ncombat forces in this growing civil war. We know it from the numbers on \nsectarian violence. We know the violence that has moved from one part \nof the country to another. We also know that despite the President's \npledges, there is no substantive evidence Iraqi security forces are \nsuccessfully holding territory that has been cleared of insurgents and \nmilitia fighting forces by U.S. troops. When it comes to the clear and \nhold strategy, there is a lot of clearing, but the holding remains \nwoefully inadequate.\n  We know the problems with the Iraqi Government: Cabinet members \nboycotting meetings, the Iraqi Government talking about taking a break \nfor 30 days, on and on. The evidence is clear that they have not made \nthe kinds of commitments they should be making to meet the benchmarks \nand to inspire confidence in our country that this is the kind of \npolitical commitment we are going to need to bring stability.\n  I have to say when it comes to what the President says, and who pays \nthe price, it is very clear what happens. Every time the President asks \nfor more time, every time the President says we need to stay the \ncourse, every time the President says: Ratify my policy yet again, \nevery time the President says: Just give us a little more time, we will \nget this right this time--every time he promises, and it does not come \ntrue, and every time he asks for more support, who pays the price for \nthat?\n  It is not a Senator or a Congressman or the President. It is no one \nin his civilian leadership. In fact, it is not a lot of Americans. \nEvery time the President asks for more time on his policy in Iraq, \nthere is only one group of Americans that pays the price for that: the \ntroops and their families. Over and over and over again, they pay with \ntheir sacrifice. They do all the dying, all the bleeding for this \npolicy. Yet the President talks about this policy as if it is a \nDemocratic and Republican fight. No, this is about the troops in the \nfield. They are paying the price over and over again.\n  I will make one more point because I am short on time.\n  When it comes to who is doing the fighting in Iraq against us, the \nPresident said the other day: ``The same folks that are bombing \ninnocent people in Iraq are the ones who attacked us in America on \nSeptember the 11th.'' Actually, he is not accurate when he says that. \nThere is a group in Iraq consisting primarily of Sunni extremists and \nrelying on the assistance of foreign fighters seeking to intensify \nsectarian conflict and create unacceptable levels of violence. They \nwere founded in 2003, after the invasion, and this group goes by the \nname of al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  While this group draws inspiration from the al-Qaida that attacked \nthe United States on September 11, the two groups are distinct enemies. \nOur intelligence community has reported that the group is \noverwhelmingly Iraqi and draws its financing from kidnapping and other \nlocal crimes, and seeks largely to incite ethnic cleansing and \nmassacres against Shiite militias. But there is absolutely no \nevidence--no evidence--that this group is responsible for various \nterrorist plots in Western Europe or the United States.\n  We saw in the last couple of hours the report that al-Qaida around \nthe world is as strong as they were on September 11, 2001. So how can \nit be--if the President is telling us the truth, and if the President's \npolicy is right--how can it be that we made this commitment in Iraq, \nwith all the mistakes of our civilian leadership, all the incompetence \nof our civilian leadership--despite the brave and noble service of our \ntroops--how can that be with this commitment in Iraq at the same time \nthat al-Qaida is as strong as it was on September 11, 2001?\n  No, I think it is very clear that this vote and this choice is very \nsimple. We can either stay the course or we can chart a new course. \nThat is what this is about.\n  I say in conclusion, this is also about whether this Congress will do \nwhat it must to prove ourselves worthy of the valor of our troops. That \nis part of what we have to do. I am not saying one amendment or one \nvote or one debate will do that. We have a long way to go to prove \nourselves worthy of their valor. But I think this amendment is one way \nto move in that direction, one way to show our troops and their \nfamilies that we will do everything possible to get this policy right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This is the first time I am addressing this body. I am filling the \nseat of former U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, a marine, a warrior, and an \nAmerican hero. He was a gentleman from Wyoming who has left large boots \nto fill.\n  Now, some people have suggested that when I give my first speech, I \ndo it at a time during the day when many people back home in Wyoming \nwould be watching television.\n  Mr. President, you are also from the Rocky Mountain Time Zone, and \nyou know people get up early. But at home it is now 3 a.m., and I doubt \nwe have many viewers at home.\n  I was sworn in a little over 3 weeks ago, but it is like I have never \nleft home. As a physician, an orthopedic surgeon, trauma surgeon, I am \nused to getting up at this hour and working at all unusual hours. \nPeople of Wyoming know that, and they call on me day and night. That is \nwhy I am here at this hour.\n  About 21 hours ago, we had a bipartisan breakfast to discuss this \nvery issue. At that body, I told the whole group I was the most \nprepared to be up at this hour working. I am delighted to be with you. \nBut we are here debating a very serious issue.\n  I spent a lot of time with Senator Thomas in the last year, driving \nhim around the State of Wyoming, discussing the war, visiting about the \nwar, about his trip to Baghdad, talking about the fact that we are \nthreatened in a global war on terror, and that this is a threat to our \nway of life.\n  As a background, as a trauma surgeon and also as a Wyoming State \nSenator in the State Senate, I chaired the Transportation, Highways, \nand Military Affairs Committee. In that position, I asked to go and \nmake sure that the Wyoming troops were getting everything they needed \nin Afghanistan and Baghdad. I was unable to make that trip. The \narrangements could not be made. But I was able to go to Walter Reed. At \nWalter Reed, I was able to visit the troops, the wounded warriors,\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\nbecause I wanted to make sure that both as a State senator and as an \northopedic surgeon those folks were getting the kind of care they \ndeserved.\n\n  What I saw were hero warriors, people who lost a limb or two limbs, \nand they wanted to return to combat. They wanted to do anything they \ncould to get back with their buddies and fight for freedom.\n  Wyoming has paid the price, as has every State. I have been to \nservices for young people who have lost their lives. I have held and \ntried to comfort family members. A little over a month ago, I got a \ncall from my physician assistant. Her son is in Iraq. Her nephew was \nalso in Iraq, and she had just gotten the news that her nephew had been \nkilled. I went to visit the family.\n  These are brave warriors. These are people doing everything they can \nfor freedom and for our Nation. They did not die in vain.\n  This past weekend, I was home in Wyoming. I had a town meeting in \nDouglas. I was also home over the Fourth of July. I had town meetings \nin Jackson and in Lander. I went to a couple rodeos, as I am sure you \ndo as well. I talked to hundreds of folks traveling around the State. \nWhen I went to the rodeos--whether in Casper, or on the Fourth of July \nin Cody, where I attended it with a former U.S. Senator from Wyoming \nwho has served on the Iraq Study Group--when they ride into the arena \nholding the American flag, people stand, take off their hat, and put \ntheir hand over their heart. The announcer does not have to tell them \nto do that. They just do it.\n  At both of those rodeos, in Casper and in Cody, they dedicated the \n``Star Spangled Banner'' with a salute to Craig Thomas, former marine. \nSusan Thomas was there at both events and received the love of the \ncrowd. Then, at both events, the announcer asked for prayers for the \nbravest men and women in the world, those who are fighting to keep us \nfree.\n  What I heard from people all around Wyoming was: Do not quit. Do not \npull out. Support the troops.\n  What are the consequences of withdrawal? Well, we heard it today with \nthe Cornyn amendment. It passed today 94 to 3. The purpose: ``To \nexpress the sense of the Senate that it is in the national security \ninterest of the United States that Iraq not become a failed state and a \nsafe haven for terrorists.''\n  We can go through the findings.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       A failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for \n     Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, who are \n     determined to attack the United States and United States \n     allies.\n       The Iraq Study Group report found that ``[a] chaotic Iraq \n     could provide a still stronger base of operations for \n     terrorists who seek to act regionally or even globally.''\n       The Iraq Study Group noted that ``Al Qaeda will portray any \n     failure by the United States in Iraq as a significant victory \n     that will be featured prominently as they recruit for their \n     cause in the region and around the world.''\n\n  We can go on and on, but to me, the Iraq Study Group's final report, \npage 67, says it best:\n\n       The point is not for the United States to set timetables or \n     deadlines for withdrawal, an approach that we oppose.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 6 Leg.]\n\n     Barrasso\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Gregg\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     McCaskill\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Smith\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A quorum is present.\n\n\n                    Congratulating Senator Barrasso\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just wanted to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Wyoming on the speech he gave this morning. It is his first speech \non the floor since he arrived. It is not necessarily his official first \nspeech, but it is his first speech. I wish to congratulate him on doing \na very admirable job. He accurately reflected the feelings of Wyoming \nwhich he has collected from his extensive travels in the 3 weeks since \nhe has been in office. He has held a lot of town meetings; he has been \nto a lot of places; he has listened to a lot of people. I also \nappreciate very much the comments he made about Senator Thomas and also \nthe tribute that has been paid to Susan Thomas at the events he has \nattended.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I thank my fellow \nSenator for his excellence comments.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join with the senior Senator from Wyoming \nin congratulating the new Senator, the junior Senator, for his \ncomments. All of us miss Senator Thomas. I had the occasion to work \nwith him on committee. He was a very fair, decent person and really \nlooked for the center ground here and tried to make things happen. I \ncertainly hope his successor will follow in that good tradition. We \nthank him for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I listened, as we all have, to portions of the debate \nup until now, and it struck me--particularly, I listened to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota who was speaking prior to the vote we just had. He made \na lot of points that I think most of us would agree with, which is one \nof the problems with this debate--that Senators on the other side are \nsetting up a lot of straw men and then knocking them down, talking \nabout the strategic interests we have in the region, but then drawing a \nquick, and in my judgment, inappropriate conclusion that the change in \nstrategy being proposed in the amendment we are debating is somehow \ngoing to play into the negative side of those particular strategic \ninterests.\n\n  For instance, we have heard again and again how al-Qaida is the \ncentral focus, and how if we were to start withdrawing our troops, Iraq \nis going to be taken over by al-Qaida and America's interests will be \nhurt. Well, that conclusion is, first, speculative and, secondly, \nerroneous even in speculation. Why do I say that? Because al-Qaida was \nnot in Iraq until we invaded it. Al-Qaida was not the threat it is \ntoday in Iraq until we made a series of errors, which are compounding \nnow with the strategy we are pursuing.\n  The fact is our presence has been used by al-Qaida as an organizing \ntool, a recruitment tool, and it has been easier for al-Qaida to play \nSunni and Shia off against each other because of our presence than it \nwould be absent it. The experience in al-Anbar Province recently \nunderscores the point we are making on our side of the aisle, which is \nthat once the sheiks, the chiefs, in al-Anbar made the political \ndecision that they were going to take on al-Qaida and actually stand up \nfor their independence, they began to drive al-Qaida out of al-Anbar. \nMost of the Iraqis I have talked to in the course of the visits I have \nmade there have indicated to me--I haven't met one Iraqi, Sunni, Shia, \nor Kurd, or various factions within Shia or Sunni, who believes that \nal-Qaida is a long-term threat in Iraq. Why? Because they don't want \nal-Qaida in Iraq and because, ultimately, if we are not there acting as \nthe magnet and cohesive glue of al-Qaida's organizational efforts, and \nif we don't make al-Qaida in fact important to the ability of the \nmilitias or insurgents, Sunni and Shia, to use al-Qaida as a convenient \ntool to target American forces, or even to target civilians of the \nother sect, the minute that dynamic changes, then their need for al-\nQaida changes. That is a fundamental sort of reality that has escaped a \nlarge part of this debate.\n  Al-Qaida is not able to survive, in my judgment, in the long run \nbecause of this nationalism, as well as fundamental commitment by each \nof those people to their own regions and interests that are indigenous \nto Iraq itself. I think foreign jihadists are going to have a hard time \nin the long run under those circumstances. Moreover, to talk about the \nstrength of al-Qaida right now as the threat to the United States in \nIraq is to ignore the National Intelligence Estimate that has recently \nbeen read--some of the public accounts--in the news media. Those of us \nwho have had briefings, and some of us who have spent time pursuing \nthis issue, understand that al-Qaida is reconstituting. They are as \nstrong today as they were on 9/11. That is the latest estimate.\n  That fact totally contradicts the main message of the President and \nhis administration--that we have to be over there to fight them over \nthere so we don't have to fight them here. The ``here'' is broadening \nall around the world. If that were true, then what is going on with the \nSecretary of Homeland Security when he tells us that his gut is telling \nhim that we are likely to have another attack now. It seems to me the \nchatter we are hearing reflected in the reports from the intelligence \nbriefings we are getting is the same kind of chatter I heard from \nGeorge Tenet in July of 2001, when he told us in room 407 that he was \nabsolutely confident there was going to be an attack, they just could \nnot tell us where. I might add that in the face of that confidence \nabout the attack and the lack of ability to tell us where, the \nPresident took the longest vacation in history, and there were no \nbriefings and nothing happened until September, when the attack of 9/11 \ntook place. It is a matter of record, when we measure what the \nadministration is saying today, what will happen and the challenge to \nus; you have to measure it against the record. This is not an \nadministration that has been correct, conceivably, about anything, but \ncertainly about almost everything with respect to Iraq.\n  So with each step that has been made, whether it was the early steps \nmade by Paul Bremer, or subsequent steps made with respect to the \ndisbursement of funds, or the promises of a transition to democracy, \nand so forth, not one expectation has been met. Not one basic political \ntransformation that is essential to resolving this has taken place. We \nare in the fifth year, 5 years into it, and the administration says \nwait another 6 weeks until September before you do this because then we \nwill know what we don't know after 5 years; we will know what we don't \nknow after Senator after Senator has made trips to Iraq and spoken \nprivately with generals, colonels, majors, all the way down the ranks \ninto the noncommissioned officers and those going out on patrols; we \nhave heard from them.\n  Let me say one thing quickly about what is not happening there. This \nis also profoundly about those troops. There is no question on either \nside of the aisle about the respect we have for the quality of the \nservice that American troops are providing our country--no question at \nall. These are the best trained, most capable and dedicated people I \nhave ever seen. One of my interns is serving over there now. He was an \nintern a couple years ago. We get regular e-mails from him. He writes \nus about the losses in his unit. He writes us about the patrols he is \ngoing out on. He sends us photographs. We sort of feel in our office \nlike family with his unit. He is First Cavalry, and we are proud of his \nservice and of the service of all of those men and women. They are--\nmost of them--dedicated to the mission. There is not a lot of griping \nthat we hear, and there is a tremendous pride of service. It is \nwonderful to see.\n  The bottom line is they deserve missions that make sense. They \ndeserve an overall policy that is equal to the sacrifice and the \ncommitment they show on a daily basis.\n  I am not a Vietnam veteran who believes everything that happened or \ncomes out of that particular period is governing for what happens now, \nobviously. But there are certain lessons. If you don't learn lessons of \nhistory, as we have read and know, you are doomed to repeat the \nmistakes you make. Secretary Colin Powell, who was very influential in \nmy own decision to give the President authority to have this big stick \nof the potential use of force, told me at length in a conversation that \nI had prior to voting how he thought it was important to apply the \nlessons of Vietnam to what we may or may not do in Iraq. That was part \nof the Powell doctrine about the use of overwhelming force and the \ncommitment to know that you are going to do for the troops what the \ntroops have been willing to do for you and their country, and that you \nare going to go through the diplomatic process and build up the kind of \nsupport we never had in the course of the war he served in and I and \nothers served in.\n\n  I particularly remember the difficulties we faced on the ground in \nVietnam, trying to distinguish between friend and foe, going into a \nvillage in the night and seeing people with ID cards that looked the \nsame as everybody else's, and names that were misspelled, and our lists \ndidn't work and they were misspelled. You tried to figure out who was \nwho. It was chaotic. So it is in Iraq, where they go out and they have \nan interpreter, and you try to interpret, which is difficult anyway, \nand there is a huge cultural gulf, an enormous difficulty within the \ntribal\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\ncontext and cultural context to try to penetrate and figure things out. \nOur troops are doing an amazing job with the mission itself, but we are \nstruggling with that.\n  This mission is as flawed as the mission was years ago. You send \ntroops out to find IEDs--the hard way. You are driving down a road and \nyou go through a community and, kaboom, there is an explosion. You get \nyour wounded out and you turn around and you look at each other and say \nwhat did we accomplish? What did we get out of that? Did we secure any \nterritory? Did we in fact make the community more secure? The greater \nlikelihood is that the people who were hiding in some house, or the \npeople who blew up that IED are sitting there congratulating \nthemselves, saying we took out another 6 or 10 soldiers, and the \nheadlines are there and that is what they want. Every time we go out \nand do that, we add to the fragility of the community and the chaos, in \nthe sense of the entire stake. We all know that military mission is not \ngoing to reduce the long-term violence, which is being driven by the \npolitical stakes that both sides--or all sides, as there are a bunch of \nentities vying for power here--but all of them are playing us off \nagainst those interests. That is what is going on here.\n  So how many times do we have to listen to generals, particularly, but \nalso to even the President, or the Vice President, or the Secretary of \nState, or our colleagues say to us there is no military solution? If \nthere is no military solution, then what are the troops accomplishing \nin these proactive forays out into the community where they ``show the \nflag'' and show a presence? For a moment, the insurgents may melt into \nthe background but, believe me, the minute those guys have \ndisappeared--and there are not enough of them in Iraq, and there won't \nbe, because we understand the dynamics, to secure all of the \ncommunities--the minute they disappear, the currency of daily life in \nthe indigenous community takes over. That is the nature of the beast. \nThat is what an insurgent guerilla-type effort is about, which is why \nthe initial flaw of never committing enough troops to guarantee you can \ndo the job remains so critical to where we are today.\n  Now, the fact is that the young men and women who are being sent out \non those missions have no more hope today than they did yesterday, or \nthe week before, or a year ago. They won't have any more hope in \nSeptember than they do right now when we are here on the floor with the \npotential of this vote. They have no more potential of resolving the \nfundamentals of what is causing those IEDs to be exploded. The fact is \nthat IEDs are being exploded for one most significant reason, which we \nneed to focus on in the context of this debate: because there are \nfactions within the Sunni and Shia who are vying for power. As long as \nyou have this open-ended presence of Americans, we remain the target \nand they remain committed to use us to foster the insecurity and fear \nthat allows them to continue to maneuver among each other. Unless you \nchange that dynamic, what happens here by continuing this policy, which \nis what our colleagues on the other side are prepared to do--at least \nthrough September, which raises a significant issue that in a moment I \nwill come back to--but if you continue it, you are guaranteeing that \nthose young men and women will continue to go out in the same posture \nthey are going out today, without any resolution whatsoever of the \nfundamental political issues.\n  Now, I don't think that is very smart. It is plain not smart. Most \nAmericans today get that. I heard the Senator from Minnesota and others \ncome to the floor and say: What is driving this? Why now? Why are we \ndoing this now, having this debate when we know that in September \nsomeone is going to make a report?\n  Well, I think the reverse is the question: Why are you waiting until \nSeptember when you know what is happening today and you know the \ndynamic hasn't changed? Why do you send those troops out day after day \non a mission you know cannot accomplish the goal and put them at risk \nwithout a mission that is achievable? Why do you sit here and say that \nsomehow in September there is going to be a report that will change the \ndynamic, when we know not one benchmark has yet been met and you are \ntalking about 6 weeks from now and we are losing 100 troops a month? \nWhat do you say to those families of the 100 who may be lost over the \ncourse of the next month: Gee, we were waiting for a report, even \nthough we knew basically what the report would say. I don't think there \nis a colleague on the other side who doesn't hope the White House is \ngoing to start trying to pull back some troops in September. We have \ntalked to generals and we have had Senators over there in the last \nweeks, and they have been told in certain regions they believe some \ntroops can come home. So we are going to sit here and wait for a policy \nthat will continue to put young soldiers at risk for a mission that is \nnot going to change the fundamental dynamics.\n  Let me speak to that for a moment, the question of changing the \nfundamental dynamics in this mission. The escalation of troops in Iraq \nwas supposed to be the precursor to the willingness of the Iraqi \npoliticians to have the ``cover of security'' to be able to make \ncertain kinds of decisions. I have to tell you that I think that \nthinking is fundamentally flawed. I think it is the other way around. I \nthink if you want the people in your country to believe there is going \nto be some security, the political leadership has to stand up and make \ndecisions that indicate there is a willingness to put the fundamental \nstakes in place that help create that security.\n  When we know we don't have enough troops there to secure every \ncommunity, and you know there is this power struggle going on between \nthese factions, you are not going to change those fundamentals by \nputting in a few troops here and a few there, melting down certain \npockets of resistance that move, as they have, from Baghdad to Diyala, \nor Kirkuk, or to some other community, and you simply move the violence \nand the terror continues.\n  The politics has to change. There has been no indication whatsoever \nof the ability or willingness of Prime Minister Maliki, or the others \nwho make up this Government, to make those fundamental decisions. What \nare we talking about? We are talking about an oil law. Is it that hard \nto sit down and decide how the revenues of the oil will be divided--by \npopulation, by community, by presence, by need? It hasn't happened. We \nhave been promised month after month, oh, it is just around the corner, \njust about to happen. And it doesn't happen.\n  I have sat with some folks over there who have indicated to me that \nit is, in fact, the open-endedness of the presence of the United States \nthat relieves the pressure. I have even heard that from some of our top \nU.S. diplomats who have been charged with the effort to negotiate, and \nthey happily and gladly use the pressure of the Congress as a stick to \ntry to leverage some of the transition we want.\n  But frankly, I have also heard them say that when the President and \nthe administration stand up and say: We are there, don't worry about \nus, we are going to keep on doing this, they just back off because they \ndon't think they have to listen to the Congress and they know they have \nthis open-ended ability to play their game. It is that simple. That is \nwhat we are trying to change.\n  When I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle run through \nthis list of red herrings, of straw men, it disappoints me, frankly, \nbecause we ought to have the real debate.\n  I have heard colleagues over there come with a map and say: You have \nSaudi Arabia here and Lebanon here, Israel here, and you have all of \nthese interests and Iran. Iran is growing in its influence. Well, Iran \nhas loved our presence in Iraq. Iran has grown in its influence because \nof what we have been doing in Iraq. We have empowered Iran. In fact, \nIran doesn't want an Iraq that is completely disintegrated for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. There are fundamental and profound differences \nbetween Iran and Iraq in the end, not the least of which is that Iran \nis Persian and Iraq is Arab. That Arab/Persian line existed long before \nthe United States went there. Believe me, when we are not there, it \nwill continue to exist and play out in influence with respect to the \nregion.\n  You hear people say: This precipitous withdrawal. ``Precipitous'' is \nthe favorite word of the other side. First, it is not a withdrawal; it \nis a redeployment.\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nYes, some troops come home, absolutely, as they ought to, because there \nare limits to what American troops are able to do in the middle of a \ncivil war. I ask my colleagues, go read the authorization we sent those \ntroops to Iraq with. There isn't one mention of what is going on there \ntoday. There isn't even one mention that is active today. The authority \nwe gave the President to use to send the troops there was related to \nSaddam Hussein, to weapons of mass destruction, to a whole series of \nthings, none of which are applicable--not al-Qaida, incidentally. This \nis a war which has completely morphed into what it is today, without \ncongressional authorization. But for the fact that the troops are \nthere, the Congress wouldn't send them there for what they are doing \ntoday. Just because you are there is the last reason to be sending \nyoung Americans out to continue to put their lives in harm's way.\n  We hear this issue of precipitous. I guarantee you, in September, the \nPresident is going to start redeploying some troops. And well into next \nyear, we all know we can't sustain the current level of deployment. \nEverybody knows that. Talk to the military; talk to the Pentagon. We \ncan't sustain it. There is a looming, huge reality standing over the \nSenate which is the reality of the deployment schedule itself, that at \nthe current levels of our Armed Forces, at the current rate of \ndeployment, we are not able to sustain the numbers we have there well \ninto next year without busting the Armed Forces completely. That \ndoesn't seem to enter the debate, according to the other side.\n  This isn't sustainable beyond next year. We don't even move most of \nthe troops out until beyond that period of time. So there is a complete \nlogic to the date that has been chosen. It is not arbitrary. It was not \npicked out of the air, and no poll has set what is happening here. In \nfact, if you followed the polls, you wouldn't be in Iraq at all. That \nis not what we are suggesting.\n  We acknowledge that there are interests. Yes, there are interests in \nthe region. Yes, there are interests we have with respect to our ally \nIsrael. Yes, there are interests with respect to Lebanon. Yes, if we \njust up and walked away, al-Qaida would use that. But that is not what \nthis debate is about or ought to be about. What we are talking about \nis, how do you best take the sacrifice and commitment of our troops and \nhonor it with a policy that in fact can achieve what we want to achieve \nin the region?\n  It is the judgment of many of us, including some Republicans, that we \nhave reached a point where you best achieve what we need to try to \nachieve in Iraq by this fundamental change in what our troops are there \nto do. What we are doing is changing the mission from a mission where \nwe are proactively going out into the community, into homes, \nproactively engaged in doing what the Iraqis ought to, after 5 years, \nbe doing for themselves.\n  The Prime Minister of Iraq himself has said that they are prepared to \ntake over the security. The Prime Minister has said they don't need us \nthere in the same way we are. The people of Iraq don't want us there in \nthe numbers that we are there today. In fact, I think one of the things \nwe ought to vote on in this authorization is whether there should be a \nplebiscite in Iraq. Let's ask the Iraqis in an open vote whether they \nwant the United States to be there in the way we are there today. Let's \ndo that. I am confident of what the outcome would be.\n  The fact is, we are talking about how you get from here to there, \nwhich is where we all want to be, with a sufficient level of stability \nso that Iran cannot have increasing influence the way it does, that \nIraqis will be able to stop going down this spiraling downward course \nof violence which is consuming their society.\n  Most of the middle class of Iraq has now already moved out of Iraq. \nMuch of the middle class is in Syria, Jordan, other communities. What \nhas happened is, the very core that we relied on to achieve what we \nwanted to, because of the violence and because of the misjudgments, \nisn't there anymore. That even complicates matters more.\n  I heard the Senator from Minnesota say the other day that this is not \nan open-ended commitment that we have today. I don't know how it is not \nopen-ended unless, of course, he knows that General Petraeus is going \nto recommend that we bring some troops back in September because in the \nabsence of that, it is open-ended. There is nothing that says to the \nIraqis: Something is going to happen if you don't do X, Y, or Z.\n  Last year, we heard Ambassador Khalilzad and then General Casey and \nGeneral Abizaid say the Iraqis have about 6 months, and if they don't \ndo the following things in the next 6 months, it is going to be really \ndifficult. Guess what, Mr. President. We are a year beyond that now. We \nare 6 months beyond the 6 months. What happened? Nothing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. For what purpose?\n  Mr. INHOFE. For a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understood that the junior Senator from Massachusetts \nreferred to the NIE. I would like to ask a question because my \ninterpretation was totally different. The NIE that was released \nyesterday states that worldwide counterterrorism efforts over the past \n5 years have constrained the ability of al-Qaida to attack the homeland \nand have led terrorist groups to perceive the United States as a harder \ntarget to strike than on 9/11. It is a significant judgment that shows \nthat our counterterrorism efforts have been working. It also notes that \nal-Qaida leadership continues to plot high-impact attacks, and the safe \nhaven it enjoys along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border has likely \nincreased its capabilities to attack the United States. This doesn't \nmean, as some erroneously reported last week, that al-Qaida is as \nstrong as it was pre-9/11. It does mean that al-Qaida may be strong \nenough to carry out an attack on the United States.\n\n  The question I would ask, reading in context from the NIE, is, Do you \nagree with this interpretation?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I agree with all but the last judgment that \nwas made by the Senator. Any appropriate apolitical reading--and I am \ngoing over to read the full NIE, but I have read the public accounts of \nit and I have talked to some people about it. I would agree that, of \ncourse, we have done some hard work. Of course, it is more difficult to \npenetrate our country. Absolutely, one would hope. My God, after all \nthe money we have spent, after the reorganization of Homeland Security, \nafter what we have done at airports alone, let alone some of the \nefforts of the FBI and others with respect to foreign cooperation, of \ncourse, we have hardened. I don't question that.\n  Have we done even as much as I and others want to do? The answer is \nno. We have a lot of undone work with respect to chemical plants and \nnuclear facilities and ports and communities. Frankly, I would have had \nevery bit of our baggage x-rayed and inspected. We put passengers \nthrough this incredible rigmarole, but you can put a piece of baggage \non an airplane that hasn't gone through it. That is absurd. Not to \nmention our ports and the question of port security. We had a vote here \nnot so long ago to guarantee that we upgrade our port security even \nmore so that the containers that come in by the millions are more \nsecure. There is a lot we can do still.\n  But, yes, we have hardened. I agree with that. Are we a tougher \ntarget today vis-a-vis al-Qaida than we were on September 11? Yes, we \nare a tougher target than we were on September 11. But that doesn't \nrefute at all what has happened with respect to al-Qaida.\n  Al-Qaida was on the run. We had 1,000 al-Qaida in the mountains of \nTora Bora within months after invading Afghanistan, which I voted for \nand supported and completely believed was the right thing to do--go in \nand take them down. But I will tell you, I have heard from four star \ngenerals that we ran a risk-averse policy with respect to the effort to \ngo after al-Qaida in Afghanistan. When we had them surrounded in the \nmountains of Tora Bora, we didn't pull the trigger on the 10th Mountain \nDivision or the 1st Marines or on the 101st Airborne, all of which were \nin the locality. We didn't use them. We outsourced the job going after \nthe biggest criminal in American history. We outsourced the job to \nAfghan warlords who 1 week earlier had been on the other side fighting \nagainst us.\n  What happened, we all know. Al-Qaida escaped, went into the northwest\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\nPakistan territories where they have been reorganizing now for 4 years. \nWhat that intelligence report does tell us is that they are \nreconstituted, and they are exporting their lessons learned in Iraq to \nAfghanistan now, which has become far more fragile, far more of a \nchallenge, and they are exporting it to Europe. If you talk to the \nauthorities in Europe--Germany, in particular, but some other \ncountries--there is an increase. That is where the center of al-Qaida \nis today, according to many people in the intelligence community. It is \ngrowing. That threat is a threat not just to the United States but a \nthreat globally.\n  I continue to say--and I think the NIE is saying this to us--that al-\nQaida as an entity is as strong today as it was on September 11. After \nalmost $600 billion and over 4,000 lives and all of the turmoil we have \ncreated in Iraq because we are supposedly fighting them over there so \nwe don't have to fight them here, there is no way to escape the fact, \nthe reality that al-Qaida is in a better position to do whatever it \nwants to do, wherever it may be, including trying to attack us, \nnotwithstanding our hardening.\n  It is a lot tougher to get into the United States today. It depends \non where you come from. There are a lot fewer people from Middle \nEastern and other Islamic connected countries who are getting visas to \ncome into the United States. It is a lot tougher today. It should be; \nwe understand that. The reality is that al-Qaida is a threat.\n  But let's come back to Iraq, which is the key. Al-Qaida wasn't in \nIraq. The focus of this war was in Afghanistan and in other places. We \nshifted it to Iraq. We have put far more resources and far more \npersonnel into Iraq, and Afghanistan is getting worse. I have talked to \npeople who spend every day of their lives focused on defense and \nsecurity issues who are unbelievably concerned about what is happening \nin Afghanistan as opposed to concern about what is happening to Iraq in \nterms of the threat to the United States.\n\n  I come back to the point I was making a moment ago, and that is that \nthis remains open-ended fundamentally with respect to the demands on \nthe Iraqis to live up to their obligations, whether they are the \nprovincial elections or the constitutional challenges or the \nreconciliation process.\n  I met with Prime Minister Maliki earlier in the year. We talked about \nthe reconciliation process. He sat there and said: Yes, we are going to \nmeet tomorrow and the next day, and we are very confident about what is \ngoing to happen with the reconciliation. We are working at it.\n  I think the meeting was postponed. I think they held it a little \nlater. They got together. Nothing happened. There has been no \nreconciliation. Everybody understands that we haven't been going \nforward with that.\n  The question before the Senate, the real question is, Are we going to \nbe able to vote on something that is as critical as this without the \nparliamentary intercession? Let's let the chips fall where they may. \nThat is the way we have approached the Defense authorization bill \nhistorically.\n  The other question behind that is the question of how do we best \nprotect American interests in Iraq. There is a difference of opinion \nthere. Many of us have come to believe that it is by setting a date for \nlegitimate transformation of responsibility, that people's behavior \nwill change. I have seen that historically. Essentially, to whatever \ndegree one was able to try to give the Vietnamese an opportunity to be \nable to survive, it was because we transferred authority and \nresponsibility. I remember that as long as the Americans were carrying \nthe full weight out there doing whatever, nobody else felt they had to \ndo any lifting.\n  These politicians in Iraq are not going to make fully sort of \npreservational choices until they are faced with the reality that they \nhave to. As long as the U.S. security blanket is there, it protects \nthem from actually having to come to grips with those choices. It \nempowers them to be able to play out whatever power struggle is going \non with respect to one sect versus another, one region against another. \nSo they can sit there and say: Well, within the next months, these guys \nare going to get wiped out, and my interests will be different than \nthey are today. We believe that you have to change those perceptions of \ninterest and you have to change them now.\n  In addition, there is nothing in this amendment that deprives the \nPresident or the Congress or the country of the ability to protect our \ninterests in the region. Those interests, incidentally, we believe very \ndeeply are being injured by the current policy. We are creating more \nterrorists. The CIA has told us that. We have even had reports that al-\nQaida--the Osama bin Laden-al Zawahiri al-Qaida based in northwest \nPakistan and Afghanistan--is using what is happening in Iraq as a \nrecruitment tool, as a fundraising tool. It has become a magnet for \njihadists. The way you deal with that is to be smarter than we are \nbeing today, which is diffuse the American presence, have surrogates \nlegitimately doing what we are in the same interest. We ought to be \ndemanding more of the surrounding communities but, frankly, they have \nlost confidence both in Maliki and this administration. The ability to \ndo that is now much harder than it was.\n  We in this amendment do not withdraw all the troops from Iraq. Some \npeople don't like this amendment because of that. There are some in the \ncountry who think it should just be done tomorrow. That is not what \nhappens here. There is nothing precipitous about it at all. It begins a \nprocess that most people in the Senate know is probably going to begin \nin September, but it begins it with a clarity that begins to change the \ndynamics on the ground so you begin to best leverage the political \ntransformation that needs to take place.\n  It does so in a way that leaves the President the discretion to be \nable to have troops necessary to complete the training of Iraqis. It \nleaves the President the discretion to have troops necessary to \ncontinue to prosecute al-Qaida. And it leaves the President the \ndiscretion to be able to have the troops necessary to protect American \nfacilities and forces.\n  Five years--going into the sixth year--of this war, that is a recipe \nfor transforming America's presence there, for transforming Iraqi \nresponsibility, and for achieving the political settlement that is \nabsolutely unachievable as long as there is simply the kind of military \ncommitment that has been on the table to now. To date, the \nadministration has not shown anybody what their route is, what their \npath is, for the kind of political settlement that seems to escape them \nevery time they make the promise.\n  The fact is that the way the troops--I feel this as strongly as I \nfeel anything. I remember personally, when I thought a policy was not \nworking very well, how we wished that people were responding to the \nrealities of what was going on on the ground, and that we wanted people \nin Washington to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable about what the \ndynamics were on the ground.\n  I think the same is true of our troops over there, who are committed \nto achieving what they can, but who also--and I have talked to many of \nthem--feel as though they are trying to put a square peg in a round \nhole, that they do not have the right tools and the right dynamic to be \nable to accomplish what needs to be done.\n  So I say to my colleagues if you know what you are doing is not \nworking, if you know what you are doing is counterproductive, if you \nknow what you are doing is, in fact, working against your ability to \nmost effectively prosecute the war on terror, if you know what you are \ndoing is creating casualties out of missions that do not accomplish \nyour ultimate goal--which is providing the security that allows the \ntransformation of the politics; and there is no indication the politics \nare about to follow--if you know, in fact, you have strengthened one of \nthe primary entities you are concerned about in the region--Iran--if \nyou know you have lost ground with respect to Hamas and Hezbollah--\nbecause you have been focused elsewhere and not leveraging what needs \nto be done there--if you know so many interests of your country are \nbeing set back, you ought to change your policy.\n  You do not just change it on the military front. In the face of the \nadvice of our own generals that there is no military solution, you have \nto change it on the political and diplomatic front. This amendment has \na very significant,\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nleveraged, diplomatic approach, where it requires a very significant \neffort, where it has been lacking. And believe me, I have gone over \nthere enough and talked to enough people to understand the degree to \nwhich it is lacking. It is critical we leverage that kind of behavior.\n  So I hope we are going to--in the debate, we ought to have a real \ndebate. I have heard colleagues on the other side talk about a recipe \nfor defeat. If we continue down the road we are going now, we are \nsetting ourselves up to empower al-Qaida even more. If we continue down \nthe road we are going now--without the political resolution, without \nlegitimate leverage in the region that is more reasonable, and without \nthe transfer of legitimate responsibility and accountability to the \nIraqis--then we are going to have more American soldier casualties, we \nare going to stay in the same position we are in today, and a month \nfrom now, 2 months from now, 6 months from now, the judgments we are \ngoing to be called on to make will be exactly the same as they are \ntoday, only worse, because more time will have been spent, because \nopportunities will have been wasted, and because the opposition will \nhave been empowered even further.\n  That is what the choice is for all of us here. I hope we are going to \nhave sort of a real debate. It is legitimate you might differ over \nwhether a particular move is going to accomplish what you set out to \ndo, but please do not debate something that is not on the floor.\n  This is not a precipitous withdrawal. It does not abandon our \ninterests. It addresses our interests in a different way. It redeploys \nour troops. It keeps a significant presence, not just there but in the \nregion.\n  We have troops in Bahrain. We have troops in the gulf. We have troops \nin other parts of that region, in Kuwait. The fact is, America has the \nability to protect its interests vis-a-vis Iran. None of us wants to \nsee chaos in the long term, but there is chaos that is growing on a \ndaily basis, worse and worse, as a consequence of our presence. If we \nhave not learned that lesson by now, then we have learned precious \nlittle at all.\n  I hope we will have the real debate we deserve as we go forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely interested in the comments \nof the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts. I do not agree \nwith much of what he said, and maybe I can comment about some of the \ndisagreements as I make my remarks this morning. I will begin by saying \nthat on Iraq, absquatulation is not a policy.\n  Today we face a growing movement for the political abandonment of the \nwill to success in the biggest conflict we face in the whole 21st \ncentury. There are handfuls of people in pink wandering the hallways \nhere, and the party in the majority claims a growing groundswell to \nabandon the fight in the midst of the battle.\n  These are perilous times, and the political class of this country is \ndivided among those who desperately want to raise the white flag, those \nwho are fleeing to the tall grasses, and a beleaguered administration, \nbeleaguered in part--and let us be honest at a time when generosity \nwould be misplaced--by many of its own spectacular mistakes.\n  I hear from constituents who are worried--very worried--about the war \nin Iraq. But Utahns are stalwart in character. Not all of them support \nthe President's policy, and not all of them support me, to be sure. But \nI think I am being honest to suggest that the vast majority of my \nconstituents are as worried by the prospects of a U.S. unilateral \nwithdrawal as they are by the challenges we face in the middle of a \nbattle whose end many of my colleagues no longer have the patience to \nimagine, pursue, or achieve.\n  Such abandonment is not an option for our forces in Iraq.\n  I gave a speech on this floor several months ago where I said I was \nnot going to concede to the Democrats' strategy of unilateral \nwithdrawal. I pointed out the irony that the Democrats' \nlegitimate criticism of this administration's policy--that the Bush \nadministration went into Iraq unprepared for the consequences, and \nwithout imagining the requirements of the day after we toppled Saddam--\nwas, in fact, being repeated by the Democrats who now advocate a \nwithdrawal without preparing for the consequences, and with no \nconsideration of what will happen in Iraq, the region, and the world \nafter we decamp. I find this bitterly ironic.\n\n  While I agree with many of the criticisms of this administration's \nearly failures in the Iraq war, I will not stand quietly against the \nirony--indeed, the hypocrisy--of suggestions that it is OK to abandon a \nwar without considering the consequences, but damnable to begin one in \nthe same manner.\n  In the months since I spoke on this floor, where I gave my qualified \nsupport for the surge, I have listened carefully to the debate on and \noff the floor. I have talked to my colleagues, to administration \nofficials, to constituents and friends, here and abroad. I have read \nthe intelligence on the prospects for Iraq and the currents in the \nregion. I have traveled to Iraq, and I have traveled in the region.\n  I am a member of the Intelligence Committee, perhaps with the longest \ntenure in the history of the Senate on the Intelligence Committee, and \nI do not find things to be as my colleagues on the other side assert.\n  Nowhere have I found a silver lining to these clouds of conflict. But \nnowhere have I heard anyone say the clouds are less dark on the \nhorizon.\n  The three major problems I am most concerned about--the al-Qaida \nproblem, the Iran problem, and the moral and practical costs of \nabandoning the moderate Iraqis--have not been addressed in any \nsubstantive way in any of the policy prescriptions I have studied. If \nthe majority wants to decamp, they need to propose a policy context \nthat makes the United States safer on the day after, not more in peril.\n  There is an al-Qaida problem.\n  In May, I went to Ramadi. I was briefed on our base by General \nGaskin, and then we suited up to go for a walk in the town center. He \nwas with us, and walked with us in that town center. That is correct, \nwe had to suit up in armor for a walk downtown. This was no Sunday \nstroll for ice cream. But two facts were obvious: One, 6 months before \nwe strolled through those downtown streets, Ramadi was al-Qaida's \ncapital in Anbar Province and Iraq. On that day, 2 months ago, it was \nthe local Sunnis' capital again. And, two, the local Iraqis I saw and \nmet in Ramadi were happy to see us there. Had we walked down those same \nstreets 2 months ago, we would have been killed.\n  However you want to criticize the administration for its past errors, \nwe now have a workable counterinsurgency plan in operation. It is \nworking in Anbar, and al-Qaida is on the defensive.\n  Are they moving out to other places? We are. Are we following them, \nusing the counterinsurgency tactics we have finally mastered? We are. \nAre we going to abandon the field we have learned to dominate? You tell \nme. And we will abandon that field in this very Chamber if we keep \nfollowing what is being spoken to on the other side.\n  Here is what I learned about our successful counterinsurgency \ncampaign from General Gaskin. Al-Qaida declared Ramadi the capital city \nof the Islamic State of Iraq. There were no police in Ramadi last year. \nAl-Qaida in Iraq, or AQI, as we refer to it, had destroyed all the \npolice in the city. Starting in mid-February, the coalition cleared the \ndowntown in about 6 weeks. There were approximately 15,000 to 20,000 \nmembers of al-Qaida in Anbar initially. Now, about half of them are \ndead. Others are still trying to discredit the Government of Iraq and \ndiscredit the occupation. They represent us as occupiers, infidels, if \nyou will. They advance their goals with brutal methods. All of their \nfinancing comes from criminal enterprises. Al-Qaida is very cellular, \ndecentralized, but resilient and regenerative. They are self-\nsufficient, funding themselves through criminal activities--murder, \nintimidation, the black market.\n  We have finally learned to deal with the Sunni tribes. It took us too \nlong to understand the tribes, but al-Qaida did not understand the \ntribal culture either. Al-Qaida's intimidation activities and murder of \nfamilies--including young boys--enraged the local tribes and tribal \nleaders. The tribes' response was their realization that the expanded \ncoalition presence was a chance to get al-Qaida out of their lives, and \nthey\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\ncame to a mutual understanding with coalition forces, sending 1,200 of \ntheir boys for enlistment in the security forces in 1 day.\n  That was a turnaround. I was there with Senator Smith approximately a \nyear before then. There was no chance at all in that province. But \nbecause of the counterinsurgency, we have made tremendous strides, and \nthey are completely ignored by some here in this Chamber.\n  But the local population in Ramadi and al-Anbar has helped find two-\nthirds of the IEDs in this area. We have promoted the development of a \nneighborhood watch system there. Once you clear, you must leave a \nsecurity presence with coalition support. The locals will not give you \nintel if you do not leave a permanent presence to provide security. In \nthe words of General Gaskin: We are asking the Iraqis to gain capacity \nwhile they are at war. This is very unusual, and it is very difficult.\n  In counterinsurgency, the most important thing is how well you \nprotect the population, and what the level of violence is. We are \nmaking progress in al-Anbar. Are we going to abandon this progress? As \nGeneral Gaskin put it: It's like someone tells you the ship that you're \non is on fire. You jump off, but halfway down you discover that it \nwasn't on fire after all. You still have to deal with your decision to \njump: Either swim or drown.\n  As I have said, I am not in favor of jumping ship, but for those who \nare, the question is: What are we going to do? Swim or drown?\n\n  Last month, two analysts for the Radio Free Iraq service of Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty released a compelling report entitled ``Iraqi \nInsurgency Media: The War of Images and Ideas.''\n  In addition to cataloging the impressive degree to which the Iraqi \nSunni insurgency is using the Internet to purvey a constant stream of \nimages, propaganda, songs, and other images that glorify the fight \nagainst the coalition, this report makes clear that this barrage of \ninsurgent media is feeding the global extremist network.\n  According to the report:\n\n       The Iraqi insurgent media network is a boon to global \n     jihadist media, which can use materials produced by the \n     insurgency to reinforce their message.\n\n  The images of our precipitous withdrawal will be broadcast endlessly, \nto inspire and incite extremists throughout the world.\n  In fact, if you talk to the analysts who monitor insurgent media, you \nlearn that there are two prevalent themes today. The insurgents, \nincluding al-Qaida, are very media savvy, and they are avid consumers \nof Western and American media. They watch our floor debates. It is a \ncommon theme for them today to declare that we will withdraw. In our \nwithdrawal, they see victory.\n  If we abandon the counterinsurgency gains we have made, al-Qaida will \nnot only declare global victory and vindication, they will attempt to \nreclaim the territory in Iraq. And don't think anything otherwise.\n  Nowhere have I seen policy prescriptions from the other side or \nanywhere else, for that matter, other than the counterinsurgency and \nthe work that is going on right now to address this problem.\n  We cannot fight al-Qaida from across the border. And to suggest we \ncan protect all our interests by being in the little country of Kuwait \nis absurd. We cannot fight al-Qaida and ignore Baghdad. And we cannot \nwalk away from this fight with al-Qaida.\n  For those who want to withdraw without a policy prescription, all I \ncan say is, you may no longer be interested in al-Qaida in Iraq, but \nal-Qaida is interested in the United States, and always has been.\n  Let's talk about the Iran problem. My colleague from Massachusetts \nmentioned this as though it is not a problem. I am sure he did not mean \nthat. If you watch the Sunni insurgency media, you also determine an \neven more prominent theme. They assume, based on watching our media, \nthat we will abandon the cause. And they declare an even bigger threat \nis Iran. Nowhere have I read of a compelling policy prescription to \nanswer the question of how we will deal with Iran in the aftermath of a \nwithdrawal. Iran is competing with the United States in the region. We \nare getting unclassified briefs from Multi-National Force in Iraq \nofficers identifying the Iranian agents' role in supporting militias \nand funding explosively-formed penetrators EFPs, if you will--networks, \nwhich target the coalition.\n  Iran is playing a dangerous game, not because they solicit an armed \nreaction from us--which they calculate will not occur--but they are \ncarefully stoking sectarian and anticoalition conflict, while taking \nadvantage of the relative security our military presence provides.\n  What is our policy toward Iran should we decide to follow the \nprescription to abandon the fight in Iraq? All I have read is a hopeful \nrepetition of the desire for a diplomatic solution. I always hope for a \ndiplomatic solution. That is always a nice weasel way of hoping we can \nget out of these problems. I also hope to balance the budget, and I \nhope to cure AIDS. We are not making much headway in those, either.\n  This will not happen based on hope alone, however.\n  Those who think we can split from Iraq in the middle of the conflict \nand deal with Iran with a Tehran tea party are not just hopeful, they \nare delusional. Iran is a totalitarian regime in desperate economic \ncircumstances and desperate economic condition. There have been riots \nover gas-rationing in a nation awash--or should I say rich--in oil.\n\n  The population has suffered two generations of economic decline--in a \nnation rich in oil. The rich Persian culture has suffered the \nspectacular mismanagement of a corrupt and despotic regime.\n  Just several days ago, the Open Source Center provided an analysis of \nIran's treatment of its labor unions. I quote:\n\n       The abduction of the head of Tehran's transport workers' \n     union is the latest sign of the antagonism shown President \n     Ahmadinejad's government toward trade unions and other civil \n     society institutions. On April 11 it shut down the Iranian \n     Labor News Agency, which often reported on labor discontent \n     arising from Iran's economic failures as well as on student \n     unrest and human rights abuses. Mahumd Osanlu, head of the \n     Workers' Syndicate of the Tehran and Suburban Bus Company, \n     has not been heard from since he was beaten and abducted on \n     July 10 by plainclothesmen, presumably from the government.\n\n  Do I need to remind my colleagues that Ahmadinejad ran on a platform \nof helping the lower classes? This is the face of a corrupt and failing \nregime that is causing havoc all over the Middle East. Just ask the \npeople in Lebanon, if you want to, but you can also ask the people in \nIraq.\n  We are spending about $100 billion a year providing various degrees \nof stability through most of Iraq, stability on Iran's border. If we \nleave, there will be great instability. How will Iran react? My friend \nfrom Massachusetts seems to think they are not going to do one little \nthing. Once we leave, everything is going to stabilize and it is all \ngoing to be just wonderful. I don't think he quite went that far, but \nhe basically said Iran is not going to do much. But do we have a policy \nin place that will seek to advance our goals of containing the Iranian \nthreat, or is the policy of withdrawal hinging simply on the desperate \ndesire for diplomacy with despots?\n  There are moral and practical costs of abandoning the moderates in \nIraq. I disagree with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. \nThere are plenty of moderates. There are plenty of the middle class in \nIraq. Large areas of Iraq are not in turmoil. Large areas of Iraq are, \nbut there are plenty of people living there who want this country to \nwork. Eighty percent of them voted for freedom and voted for a \nrepresentative form of government.\n  What are the consequences for the moderates of Iraq if we withdraw? \nThere are, in fact, many moderates, many Iraqis intermarried between \nfaiths, many Iraqis who are urban professionals, many Iraqi women are \neducated, in contrast to what the al-Qaida people and the Taliban \npeople would do to women. All of these are attributes of the moderate \nmasses who are today intimidated by the insurgents, by gangsters and \nterrorists, and who are currently failed by Iraqi politicians.\n  Nonetheless, they are there in significant numbers. They will suffer \nimmensely in the chaos that will follow our withdrawal.\n  If we believe that a principal key to addressing the sources of \ndiscontent\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\nthat fuels violent extremism in the Muslim world was the empowerment of \nthe moderate classes seeking modern civil society, our abandonment of \nthe cause in Iraq will do more than fuel the ferocious violence of al-\nQaida, the deadly competition fomented by Iran; it will seal our \nability to appeal to the moderate Muslim elements throughout the world, \nto build civic culture in autocratic societies. Our natural allies in \nthese societies--the young and the educated, the professional, the \nwomen seeking to escape the oppression of the veil--will not respond to \nour entreaties because they will have seen that the United States does \nnot continue to stand with its allies. They will see the images of our \nwithdrawal. They will see the self-satisfied propaganda of the \ninsurgents and al-Qaida, and they will be afraid to be with us.\n  I fear they will see images of the slaughter of innocents.\n  They will go back into the shadows, and the shadows of autocracy or, \neven worse, Islamic fascism will grow. We will have squandered not just \nthe good will of our natural allies--those who want to modernize into \npeaceful and productive societies--but we will have squandered the \nfaith of hundreds of millions throughout the world who will see no \nreason to stand by or with us. Whom will we blame for the slaughter of \nmoderates, and whom will we turn to the next time we seek allies in the \nMiddle East?\n  Should those who advocate withdrawal today succeed in their ill-\nconceived attempt to run away from reality, reality will not let us \nescape. Without a policy to fight al-Qaida in Iraq, to compete with an \nunstable and adventurous Iran, and to prevent the slaughter of Iraqi \ninnocents on a scale much greater than we see today, a withdrawal will \nbe calamitous.\n  The consequences on our ability to conduct foreign policy, to win the \nwar on terror, and to advance our values of democracy and peace will be \nimmense.\n  After the capitulation driven by congressional Democrats that led to \nour abandonment of Vietnam in the 1970s, the Soviets became emboldened \nand advanced throughout what was known then as the Third World--in \nAngola, Central America, and Afghanistan. We regained our footing in a \ndecade, and we won the Cold War because we found our will. Without a \nstrategy to accompany the policy of withdrawal, the consequences--an \nemboldened al-Qaida, aggressive Iran, and intimidated, harassed, and \nslaughtered Iraqi moderates--will haunt us much longer than after our \nVietnam withdrawal. After all, the Vietnamese did not threaten our \ncountry. They did not threaten our mainland. These people have, and \nthese people continue to threaten our mainland. These people continue \nto say, as was said just a week ago, that they are going to cause havoc \nover here.\n\n  I am 73 years old, and I fear that should we concede to the powerful \ncall for withdrawal without a sound policy, the harm to this Nation \nwill last longer than I have years to live.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, whom I hold in high \nesteem, quoted General Petraeus earlier, saying that of all the \nresources General Petraeus could have, the one he wanted most was time. \nThe one he wanted most was time. This is a very important point, and I \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Arizona for making it.\n  Many people today believe that whatever the outcome this month, we \nhave set a deadline for September. I say: Any progress achieved by \nSeptember will be incremental, at best. Counterinsurgencies can be won, \nbut they will not be won on a congressional election cycle. We should \nnot be so arrogant as to presume we can make them fit into such an \nabsurd construct. Let us be honest and admit that if we want to sustain \nthe fight in Iraq, we should give it much longer than a September \ndeadline. Perhaps in a year, perhaps in two, we can see a success, but \nfor this, we need more than time. We need will. That is what I see \nevaporating around all of us here in the Senate.\n  The majority is waving the flag of withdrawal. There is no \naccompanying policy to shape the way the geopolitical environment will \nbe affected. Our enemies will be emboldened, our competitors \nencouraged, and our friends throughout the region will be like me: \ndiscouraged.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has said \nwe are not talking withdrawal; we are talking a redeployment. Who is he \nkidding? We are going to leave a small contingency there to do exactly \nwhat Secretary Rumsfeld was doing, with an emboldened al-Qaida? Come \non. I think they are ignoring the fact that the al-Qaida people have \nsaid they are going to establish a worldwide caliphate and impose their \nwill on everybody--especially us.\n  One thing I would just like to say is they have piled into Iraq. They \nwere there before, in spite of what the distinguished Senator has said. \nMaybe not in as great numbers; of course not, but they have piled into \nIraq knowing that if they defeat us there and we turn tail and run for \nthe high grasses, they will have accomplished something they didn't \neven dream they could accomplish 5 years ago.\n  This is not a simple war. This is not a war against another nation. \nIt is not a war where people on the other side wear uniforms. It is a \nwar where they commit terror all over the world. It is a war where they \nhave threatened us. It a war where they kill innocent human beings. It \nis a war where they don't think anything of sending their young people \nstrapped with bombs to blow themselves up, to maim and kill innocent \ncivilians.\n  If we do what our friends on the other side want to do, our enemies \nwill be emboldened, our competitors encouraged, and our friends \nthroughout the world will lose an awful lot of faith and confidence in \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, absquatulation is not a policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Good morning. Not long ago, a woman who lives in \nPawtucket, RI, wrote me:\n\n       I care about the human spirit, which I think is deeply \n     wounded by our occupation in Iraq. I have three friends \n     serving this country because they believe it is their duty. I \n     believe it is your duty to bring them home. I beg you for an \n     end to this war.\n\n  She is not just a lone voice from one State. All over this country, \nAmericans call for an end to this war. At the grocery store, around the \nkitchen table, and in places of worship, Americans are sharing their \nfrustration and outrage at a President who refuses to listen, refuses \nto admit mistakes and misjudgments, and stubbornly refuses to change \ncourse.\n  The amendment sponsored by my distinguished senior Senator, Jack Reed \nof Rhode Island, and the honorable chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Carl Levin of Michigan, would require a redeployment of \nAmerican troops to begin within 120 days of enactment. It sets a \nreasonable, responsible goal: that the redeployment be completed by \nApril 30 of next year--2008.\n  Let us be clear: the Levin-Reed amendment offers a new direction in \nIraq.\n  A vote for the Levin-Reed amendment is a vote to support our troops \nand their families who are bearing the burden of repeated deployments, \nlong separation, and sometimes debilitating injury, and they bear it \nwith courage, fortitude, and honor. This measure supports them by \nbringing the troops home safely and with honor.\n  A vote for the Levin-Reed amendment is a vote that will help give our \nmilitary the time and the resources to rebuild and recover from the \nstrain on our troops and equipment.\n  A vote for the Levin-Reed amendment opens strategic doors to renew \ndiplomacy in the Middle East and throughout the world and to begin \nrestoring America's standing, prestige, and good will in the global \ncommunity.\n  More and more of our colleagues in this body recognize the need for \nthis new direction. Many of those who supported the war in the past \nhave now said they can no longer support President Bush in his failed \nand misguided course in Iraq. But I say to my friends, when the issue \nbefore us is our single most important matter of foreign policy and \nnational security, words alone are not enough.\n  When our Nation's course has been as misdirected and mismanaged as it \nhas been, words alone are not enough.\n  When, in the face of this policy's failure and the resulting chaos in \nIraq,\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\ncorrective action is called for, words are not enough.\n  And when the opportunity for that correction is within our reach, \nwithin our grasp, if only we would seize it, mere words are not enough.\n  This is a day when we are called upon to act. The question before us \nis simple: Are you in favor of bringing our troops home? That is a \nserious question, and it demands serious, reasoned, and thoughtful \ndebate.\n  I was recently struck by words spoken in this Chamber by Senator \nRichard Lugar of Indiana. Senator Lugar's words imparted a \nthoughtfulness that too long has been missing from this debate. Too \noften, this administration communicates not with reason but with \nslogans and sound bites: ``Stay the course.'' ``Support the troops.'' \n``Global war on terror.'' ``Cut and run.'' ``Precipitous withdrawal.'' \nI say to anyone watching this debate: When you hear those words coming \nfrom this Chamber, I hope an alarm bell goes off in your head, a signal \nthat thinking and reason have ended and sloganeering has begun. You \ndeserve better.\n  In May of 2003, President Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS \nAbraham Lincoln and said this:\n\n       Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle \n     of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.\n\n  In the background, of course, was the banner that read: ``Mission \nAccomplished.''\n  Then, over a year ago, in June 2006, President Bush announced \nOperation Together Forward, a ``joint effort to restore security and \nrule of law to high-risk areas in the capital city'' of Baghdad.\n  Then, this January, the President said he would send tens of \nthousands more troops there, part of a surge to try yet again to secure \nIraq's capital.\n  The months since President Bush's surge have been among the deadliest \nof the war. Nearly 600 U.S. soldiers have died since the announcement \nof the surge, and over 3,500 have been wounded. Last month, more than \n100 American servicemembers died in Iraq. The month before that, more \nthan 100 American troops lost their lives. The month before that, April \nof this year, over 100 American deaths. Between February 10 and May 7 \nof this year, the Pentagon reports U.S. forces sustained an average of \n25 casualties each day--more than during that time in the previous \nyear.\n  Alasdair Campbell, the U.K.'s outgoing Defense Attache at its Baghdad \nEmbassy, said in May:\n\n       The evidence does not suggest that the surge is actually \n     working, if reduction in casualties is a criterion.\n\n  The Pentagon's survey found that, on average, more than 100 Iraqi \ncivilians were killed or wounded each day between February and May--\nnearly double the daily total from the same period 1 year ago.\n  The number of unidentified murdered bodies found in Baghdad soared 70 \npercent during the month of May--726, compared to 411 in April. At \nleast 21 unidentified murdered bodies were found in Baghdad just this \npast weekend. The displacement of Iraqi civilians has continued \nthroughout the spring--90,000 Iraqis per month in March, April, and May \nof 2007, according to the Brookings monthly Iraq Index. The average \nweekly number of attacks across Iraq surpassed 1,000, compared to about \n600 weekly attacks for the same period 1 year ago. More than 75 percent \nof the attacks were aimed at U.S. forces.\n  In an interview with the Washington Post in June, retired general \nBarry McCaffrey said:\n\n       Why would we think that a temporary presence of 30,000 \n     additional combat troops in a giant city would change the \n     dynamics of a bitter civil war?\n\n  In a survey taken in February and March of this year, 53 percent of \nIraqis viewed their security environment as ``bad or very bad,'' and \neven in that environment, 78 percent of Iraqis, in an ABC News study, \ndo not support having American or coalition forces in their country. \nOnly 18 percent have confidence in U.S. and coalition troops, the BBC \nhas reported, and 51 percent approve of attacking our forces.\n  David Kilcullen, General Petraeus's top counterinsurgency adviser, \nsaid last month:\n\n       We haven't turned the tide. We haven't turned the corner. \n     There isn't light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n  We will not turn the tide, we will not turn the corner, and there \nwill be no light at the end of the tunnel until this administration \nmakes it clear that our intent is to withdraw our forces rapidly and \nresponsibly.\n  The other side argues that to dispute this President's judgment is to \nfail to support the troops, even though that very judgment has \ncatastrophically failed the troops and our country.\n  I traveled to Iraq in March, in my capacity as a new member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, to get a firsthand look. I met brave \nRhode Islanders in Fallujah and at a medical center where Rhode \nIslanders are helping provide care to our wounded soldiers. They, like \nall our troops in Iraq, are serving our Nation with dedication, \ncourage, and honor. Our troops are working so hard and accomplishing so \nmuch, but this administration has not given them the support they \nneed--not in the field of battle, not when they return home, and, most \nimportantly, not with wisdom to match their bravery.\n  As I traveled around Rhode Island in the last few years I met mothers \nwho felt they had to buy body armor for their sons who were being \nshipped to Iraq because they could not trust this administration to \nprovide it.\n  Just this week, USA Today reported extensively on the Pentagon's \nfailure to address the Marines' request for Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtection--or MRAP--vehicles.\n  In February, a series of articles in the Washington Post highlighted \nshortfalls in the care and treatment of our wounded warriors at the \nWalter Reed Army hospital. The Nation's shock and dismay reflected the \nAmerican people's support, respect, and gratitude for the men and women \nwho put on our Nation's uniform. They deserve the best, not shoddy \nmedical equipment, rundown facilities, and bureaucratic snafus.\n  This administration says we need to support the troops. I agree. We \ncan support the troops by ensuring that they have the equipment, \nresources, and protection they need--and by caring for them when they \nreturn home. We can also support them with wise strategies arising from \nhonest debate.\n  The President says Iraq is part of a vast ``global war on terror'' \nand that remaining mired in a conflict there is critical to our \nnational security. But the war in Iraq has made us less, not more, \nsecure. The way to reverse this trend is to redeploy our troops out of \nIraq.\n  After our country has expended over $450 billion and lost more than \n3,600 American lives, according to the unclassified key judgments of \nthe National Intelligence Estimate released yesterday, al-Qaida and \nother Islamist terrorist groups remain undiminished in their intent to \nattack the United States and continue to adapt and improve their \ncapabilities.\n  While the Bush administration wallows in Iraq, al-Qaida has protected \nsanctuary along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, again \naccording to the unclassified key judgments of the NIE.\n  National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that he believes a successful attack by al-Qaida \nwould most likely be planned and come out of the group's locations in \nPakistan, not Iraq. Al-Qaida, the perpetrators of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks on the United States, remains a significant threat to \nour country and our national security, and 4 years of war in Iraq has \nnot changed that fact.\n  President Bush and his diehard allies say that what we and the \nAmerican people support is cut-and-run or a precipitous withdrawal.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment requires that we begin redeploying American \ntroops from Iraq 4 months after the measure is enacted--not 4 days, not \n4 weeks, but 4 months. Surely, with the greatest military in the world, \nwe have the capacity to plan in 4 months to begin a redeployment of our \ntroops. In fact, I would be surprised and concerned if our military \nwere not already planning for such a contingency.\n  Then, the Levin-Reed amendment sets a date for redeployment of April \n30, 2008. If this amendment became law tomorrow, that would give our \nmilitary and this administration more than 9 months to plan and \nimplement our troops' redeployment--a redeployment that leaves a \nmilitary presence for force protection, training, and\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\ncounterterrorism in Iraq. Is that truly a precipitous withdrawal? It is \nnot. Those who say it is are not being straightforward with the Senate \nand with the American people.\n  Let me say this, because it is one of the elements of this issue \nwhich President Bush has completely and willfully overlooked: The time \nit will take for us to redeploy should not be idle or wasted time; it \nmust be a time of great energy and effort, because it is our time of \nopportunity to begin the tough process of diplomacy that can help \nstabilize the Middle East and restore America's standing and prestige \naround the world.\n  It is a window of time in which we must aggressively engage the \nregion and the world community in the ongoing work to rebuild Iraq and \nrestore stability there, in which we can confound the insurgents who \nfoment civil war from within Iraq and the global jihadists who import \nviolence from without it. It is a window in which Iraq's political \nleaders can be motivated to work for cooperation, unity, and real \nprogress.\n  In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, former Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger described the reality that the cauldron of Iraq may \noverflow and engulf the region. He goes on to say that:\n\n       The continuation of Iraq's current crisis presents all of \n     Iraq's neighbors with mounting problems. . . . Saudi Arabia \n     and Jordan dread Shiite domination of Iraq, especially if the \n     Baghdad regime threatens to be a satellite of Iran. The \n     various Gulf sheikdoms, the largest of which is Kuwait, \n     find themselves in an even more threatened position. Their \n     interest is to help calm the Iraq turmoil and avert \n     Iranian domination of the region.\n\n  Then he says that:\n\n       Given a wise and determined American diplomacy, even Iran \n     may be brought to conclude that the risks of continued \n     turmoil outweigh the temptations before it.\n\n  But make no mistake, as long as we occupy Iraq, the broader \ninternational engagement we need will remain elusive. With the \nannouncement of a U.S. redeployment, Iraq's neighbors must face the \nprospect that the Iraq cauldron may overflow, and they will, therefore, \nbe obliged to take a more helpful--in the case of Saudi Arabia--or a \nmore tempered--in the case of Iran--role in the area's future. They \nwill have no other practical choice because their own national \ninterests will now be squarely on the line.\n  As ADM William J. Fallon has said:\n\n       I see an awful lot of sitting and watching by countries in \n     the neighborhood. It is high time that changed.\n\n  Well, it is high time that changed, but our mediate and buffering \nmilitary presence prevents that from changing.\n  A redeployment will also deprive the insurgents of a strong \nrecruiting tool--the al-Qaida narrative that the United States has \nimperial designs over Muslim lands, which resonates strongly in the \nMiddle East due to their own colonial experiences with the British and \nthe Ottomans.\n  If we make it clear that our troops are coming home--and, critically \nimportant, that we are not leaving permanent bases behind--the \ninsurgents and terror networks will lose this defining argument.\n  The Bush administration and its supporters noted that the Sunni \nsheiks of Anbar Province have recently turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. \nWhen I met with Marine commanders in Fallujah during my trip to Iraq in \nMarch, they told me the same thing--and what an important and exciting \ndevelopment that was.\n  The marine general briefing us made clear that these Sunni sheiks \nturned against al-Qaida in the realization that the United States would \nnot be in Iraq forever, thanks to the political debate this Congress \nhas insisted on since the November election. It was the prospect of our \nredeployment that moved them to action.\n  Once all factions in Iraq must face the naked consequences of their \nactions, we should hope, and expect, to see similar moments of \nstrategic clarity emerge.\n  How are they doing without that pressure? Last week, we saw a report \nfrom the White House that was deeply troubling. The report said that it \nhas become significantly harder for Iraqi leaders to make the difficult \ncompromises necessary to foster reconciliation.\n  In particular, the administration has focused on four objectives: \nprovincial elections, deBaathification, constitutional reform, and the \nhydrocarbons law. These are the exact same issues U.S. and Iraqi \nmilitary leaders stressed to us during our trip in March. Without \nprogress in these areas, I was told by our generals, our military \ntactics would not succeed in accomplishing the ultimate goal.\n  It would be putting it mildly to say I was not reassured by the \nsignals I received from our meetings with Iraqi officials. There was a \nsevere disconnect between the urgency of our generals about this \nlegislation and the absence of equivalent urgency, or even energy, on \nthe part of Iraqi officials. One American soldier I met put it in \nplain, homespun terms:\n\n       If your parents are willing to pay for the movies so you \n     don't have to use your own money, or if you can get your big \n     sister to do your homework for you, who wants to give that \n     up?\n\n  Well, Mr. President, it is time. To quote the report:\n\n       1, the government of Iraq has not made satisfactory \n     progress toward enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Baathi-\n     fication reform. This is among the most divisive political \n     issues for Iraq and compromise will be extremely difficult.\n       2, the current status [of efforts to enact hydrocarbon \n     legislation] is unsatisfactory. The government of Iraq has \n     not met its self-imposed goal of May 31 for submitting the \n     framework hydrocarbon revenue-sharing laws.\n       3, the government of Iraq has not made satisfactory \n     progress toward establishing a provincial election law.\n       4, the government of Iraq has not made satisfactory \n     progress toward establishing a date for provincial elections. \n     Legislation required for setting the date has not been \n     enacted.\n       5, the government of Iraq has not made satisfactory \n     progress toward establishing provincial council authorities.\n\n  So how does the administration respond to the list of unsatisfactory \nprogress on their key elements? Let's turn again to the White House \nreport:\n  De-Baathification:\n\n       This does not, however, necessitate a revision to the \n     current plan and strategy.\n\n  Hydrocarbon legislation:\n\n       This does not, however, necessitate a revision to our \n     current plan and strategy.\n\n  Provincial elections.\n\n       However, at this time, this does not necessitate a revision \n     to our current plan and strategy.\n\n  It is clear that the Iraqis have not yet made that progress. Yet this \nPresident and this administration refuse to take the one step that \ncould truly galvanize real change in Iraq--announcing a redeployment of \nAmerican forces. They must look into the abyss. We must announce that \nwe will redeploy our troops. This is a necessary step.\n\n  A redeployment of our troops creates the potential to change the \noverarching dynamic for the better, freeing us to focus more \neffectively on strategies to counter al-Qaida and stabilize the region.\n  This is a critical step, and thoughtful, reasoned political and \ndiplomatic leadership will be essential to take advantage of the new \ndynamic a redeployment offers.\n  This is a positive step, to improve our posture and advance our \nstrategic interests.\n  I know my Republican colleagues wish to couch this change of course \nin terms of failure and abandonment. Whether this is just for \nrhetorical advantage, or whether they just cannot see redeployment as a \ncalibrated part of a new and more promising regional strategy, I do not \nknow. Let me say this, though. This is not a test of resolve. We have \nan enormously complex problem, a problem we have tried to solve by \nmilitary force alone. Despite heroic efforts by our military, that \nstrategy has failed--catastrophically. It did not fail because anything \nwas lacking in our troops, it failed because the strategy was wrong--\nwrong at its inception, wrong in its execution, and wrong now.\n  We in the Senate must challenge the administration to summon the \npolitical courage and the moral courage to face the fact that the \nstrategy was wrong and needs to change. It is never easy to admit \nmistakes, but when the lives of our troops and the strategic position \nof our country are at stake, they have to do what is right, not what is \npolitically comfortable or fits the rhetoric. This should not be too \nmuch to ask of a President of the United States.\n  If, as so many believe, we are on a continuing collision course with \nthe\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\nfacts, with the lessons of history; if our strategy is, in fact, ill-\nadvised; if we indeed are creating and maintaining a poisonous dynamic \nin the region for ourselves, can we not at least consider that \nredeployment--specifically, the credible threat of redeployment--can \nopen new doors for resolving the civil conflicts over which we are now \nthe unwelcome police?\n  The measure now before the Senate sets forth a thoughtful, \nresponsible path to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. It provides our \nmilitary commanders with the time and resources they need to redeploy \nour troops safely. It will focus Iraq's political leaders on making \nprogress, where, to put it mildly, thus far insufficient progress has \nbeen made on measures critical to their nation's future and our \nsuccess. And it will galvanize the international community and the \nregion in the practical and self-interested pursuit--or acceptance--of \na more stable, more secure Iraq.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment is the new direction Americans have called \nfor. It is the change of course we desperately need. In a few hours, \nthis long debate, this long night, will draw to a close. I urge my \ncolleagues to let us vote up or down, yes or no, on the new direction \nthe Levin-Reed amendment embodies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Simply put, we need to avoid micromanaging the war from \nthe floor of the Senate. We need to let our military leaders perform \ntheir duties and give them time for our new way forward in Iraq to be \nsuccessful. We now have before us the Levin-Reed amendment, which sets \na timeline for us to begin withdrawal from Iraq. We cannot afford to \nset a hard deadline to begin to walk away from Iraq. The cost of \nfailure is too great to our future long-term national security. It is \nin America's security interest to have an Iraq that can sustain, \ngovern, and defend itself. Too much is at stake to simply abandon Iraq \nat this point. The price of failure is simply too great.\n  I will continue to vote against any legislation that sets arbitrary \ndeadlines and thresholds in Iraq, and I plead with my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Let me remind our colleagues that we have seen terrible results from \npolitical motives being placed above military necessities: the attempt \nat rescuing the American Embassy hostages from Tehran, and Beirut, in \nthe 1980s, and Somalia in the 1990s. Leaving Iraq in the current \nsituation would only result in emboldening terrorists around the world. \nBin Laden himself is on record, after these previous withdrawals, \ncriticizing our lack of will and questioning our commitment to fight \nthese zealots. We have to learn from our mistakes in the past.\n  I refer to a quote in the Iraq Study Group's final report on page 37 \nand 38:\n\n       A premature American departure from Iraq would almost \n     certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further \n     deterioration of conditions.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, \n     greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a \n     threat to the global economy.  Al-Qaeda would depict our \n     withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq \n     descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could \n     eventually require the United States to return.\n  Of course, I remain upset that more progress has not been made on the \npolitical and domestic security front within Iraq, but that reality \ndoesn't diminish the fact that al-Qaida is training, operating, and \ncarrying out their mission in Iraq right now. They are clearly still a \nthreat and are still determined to accomplish their goals of attacking \nus and our allies around the world. What is most unfortunate about this \ndebate is that clearly the majority party in the Senate has already \nprejudged the work our commander in Iraq, GEN David Petraeus, is trying \nto carry out. As we all know, in September a complete review of Iraq \npolicy, including a detailed assessment of the surge, will be \npresented. I look forward to that assessment. I look forward to making \nthe appropriate decisions based on that report. It would be \ndisingenuous to discontinue the plans our military leaders have planned \nand are putting into place simply for political gain.\n  I quote General Petraeus, commander of the multinational force in \nIraq. He said:\n\n       If I could have only one [thing] at this point in Iraq, it \n     would be more time. I can think of few commanders in history \n     who wouldn't have wanted more troops, more time, or more \n     unity among their partners; however, if I could only have one \n     [thing] at this point in Iraq, it would be more time. This is \n     an exceedingly tough endeavor that faces countless \n     challenges. None of us, Iraqi or American, are anything but \n     impatient and frustrated at where we are. But there are no \n     shortcuts. Success in an endeavor like this is the result of \n     steady, unremitting pressure over the long haul. It's a test \n     of wills, demanding patience, determination and stamina from \n     all involved.\n\n  I think we ought to give him his one wish.\n  This is a similar situation we were in only months ago. Many in this \nbody wanted to reject the strategy General Petraeus proposed in Iraq, \neven before he had been given the full opportunity to perform his \nmission. I still cannot comprehend why my colleagues would agree to a \nnew bipartisan strategy in Iraq but only months later not be willing to \nsupport our self-imposed guidelines.\n  On July 12, the President issued a report as required by the fiscal \nyear 2007 supplemental appropriations bill, assessing the progress of \nthe sovereign Government of Iraq in achieving the benchmarks detailed \nin the bill. The report told us 8 of the 18 benchmarks detailed in that \nbill received satisfactory remarks. While we are certainly disappointed \nthat more benchmarks were not achieved, it is important to highlight \nthe successes being made and how the Iraqi Government is performing, as \ntheir success will ultimately allow us to responsibly reduce our troop \nlevels.\n  The benchmarks that have reached success so far are as follows: The \nGovernment of Iraq has made satisfactory progress toward forming a \nconstitutional review committee and then completing the constitutional \nreview. The Government of Iraq has made satisfactory progress toward \nenacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form semi-\nautonomous regions. The Government of Iraq has made satisfactory \nprogress toward establishing supporting political, media, economic, and \nservices committees in support of the Baghdad security plan. The \nGovernment of Iraq has made satisfactory progress toward providing \nthree trained and ready Iraqi brigades to support Baghdad operations. \nThe Government of Iraq has made satisfactory progress in ensuring the \nBaghdad security plan does not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, \nregardless of their sectarian or political affiliations. The Government \nof Iraq, with substantial coalition assistance, has made satisfactory \nprogress, once again, toward establishing the planned joint security \nstations in Iraq. The Government of Iraq has made satisfactory progress \ntoward ensuring that the rights of minority political parties in the \nIraqi legislature are protected. And finally, the Iraqi Government is \nmaking satisfactory progress in allocating funds to ministries and \nprovinces for reconstruction projects.\n  General Odierno, on the surge progress, says:\n\n       The increased presence is having an effect, and it will \n     continue to be felt in the weeks to come. We still have not \n     reached . . . the end of our surge. Every day we are making \n     progress.\n\n  That is from LTG Ray Odierno, U.S. Army Commander of the \nmultinational corps in Iraq. He goes on to list some specific examples. \nI don't need to list all those specific examples, but a full page in \nfine print where he points to successes in Iraq. What is most \nunfortunate during this debate is that the Democratic majority has put \nin jeopardy the passage of the Defense authorization legislation, \nsomething that simply has not happened in decades. By pushing for a \nfailed Iraq policy amendment to the Defense authorization bill, the \nmajority are willing to trash legislation that is vital to our men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces. The managers of the bill, Chairman Carl \nLevin and Ranking Member John McCain, should be commended for their \ngood work on this comprehensive and vital legislation. The \nauthorization bill provides our men and women in combat zones with the \nresources and equipment they need to complete their missions. It also \nprovides for our troops at home by ensuring they receive appropriate \nmedical care upon their return and the training needed prior to \ndeployment.\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\n  Finally, the bill provides for the health and well-being of our Armed \nForces and the tools they need to defeat terrorism and defend our \nNation from future attacks. An important component of this bill is the \nincreased commitment to the quality of life for our service men and \nwomen. The authorization includes $135 billion for military personnel, \nauthorizing payment of combat-related compensation to servicemembers \nmedically retired for a combat-related disability and lowering the age \nat which members of the Reserves may draw from their retirement. This \nbill further provides our men and women with quality health care by \nadjusting $1.9 billion for TRICARE benefits and directing the \nDepartment of Defense to study and develop a plan addressing the \nfindings of the Mental Health Assessment Commission.\n  This bill also gives our troops the necessary protection to combat \nthe threats they are facing right now, particularly to counter \ninsurgent improvised explosive devices--commonly known as IEDs--threats \nwhich remain the No. 1 killer of American troops. This bill includes $4 \nbillion to the individual services and special operations command for \nMine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. It also fully funds the \nPresident's request of $4.5 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive \nDevices Defeat Office for blast injury research and the procurement of \nIED jammers.\n\n  Unfortunately, this legislation is threatened by the insistence of \nthe majority leader on having this protracted and unnecessary debate. \nThere is no doubt that we face extremely difficult challenges in Iraq. \nWe have not made enough progress. The citizens of Iraq must be willing \nto fight for their own freedom. But we should not cut General \nPetraeus's time short in implementing his plan that this body \noverwhelmingly approved of only a few months ago.\n  I have a quote or two I wish to share and remind the body about what \nthe Democrats, the opposite party, have said. The Democrats' dismissal \nof General Petraeus's report is part of a pattern. The Baghdad security \nplan was declared a failure 2 months before U.S. reinforcements arrived \nin Iraq. Senator Reid from Nevada is quoted as saying ``This war is \nlost'' and that ``the surge is not accomplishing anything.'' Senator \nLevin said, ``It's a failure.'' But the surge only began in mid-June, 2 \nmonths after the Democrats first declared it a failure.\n  General Petraeus said:\n\n       The surge has really just . . . begun.\n\n  Hours ago I heard the minority whip talk about how many on this side \nhave acknowledged mistakes that have been made during the Iraq war, but \nhow we won't vote to pull our troops out right away. I have been one of \nthose Members of the Republican caucus who has said publicly that \nmistakes have been made. I will point out that the Commander in Chief \nhas stated the same thing. That said, regardless of the errors that \nhave been made, it does not mean the mission or the policy is any less \nimportant. In fact, I am trying to think of a conflict in which we have \nbeen involved that we can't point to some mistakes. I am very aware \nthat the longer we stay in Iraq, the more it will cost the United \nStates, both in money but, more importantly, in the lives of American \nmen and women. However, I won't support the Levin-Reed amendment \nbecause I believe it is based on the assumption that by leaving Iraq \nprematurely, Americans will be safer.\n  The terrorists have made it abundantly clear that Iraq is central to \nthe war against the civilized world. They are committed to fighting \nthere and will not stop unless we defeat them. If we have to fight, it \nis preferable not to fight on our own soil. So let's hurry and have the \ncloture vote on the Levin-Reed amendment so we can defeat it. I ask my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment and let us return to the important \ndebate on Defense authorization to ensure our troops have the adequate \nsupport here at home and abroad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come here to the floor this morning to \nspeak about the strategy that we are moving forward with in Iraq. I \nalso come here to say the debate over the last several days, including \novernight, has been a very important debate and one we do need to have. \nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve the debate that is taking \nplace here in the Senate.\n  As the sun rises today across America, it is midafternoon in Baghdad, \nin Iraq. There the temperatures are close to 100 degrees as we speak. \nIn Iraq today we know there are almost 160,000 men and women in uniform \nwho are serving there, doing the duty they have been called to do on \nbehalf of a grateful nation. So it is for them, for the 160,000 troops \nwe have in Iraq today, for the 1.4 million veterans of both Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, that we in the Senate \nshould have a debate about our way forward in Iraq.\n  I, therefore, say to my colleagues who have come to the floor as the \nnight has gone on and have said things such as this is all about cut \nand run, this is about surrender, this is a political stunt, that they \nare wrong. With all due respect, those kinds of labels are not helpful \nas we deal with what is a fundamental American issue, the issue of war \nand peace and the way forward for all of us here in this country and \nthe way forward for our Armed Forces. Those kinds of labels, those \nkinds of attacks are not worthy of the reason the American people sent \nus all here to this body to try to define and devise the best policies \nfor America, the best of policies that will make America strong, the \nbest of policies that will restore America's standing in the world, the \nbest of policies that will honor and recognize that contribution of the \ngreatest generation of America, the generation of World War II. That \nkind of labeling is not worthy of trying to bring us together in a \nmanner and a way that will help us find stability in Iraq, in the \nMiddle East, bring our troops home, and achieve the goals I believe at \nthe end many of us would agree upon in the Senate.\n  I do not believe the long debate over all of last night has been at \nall a lost cause. It is important for those of us, the 100 Members of \nthe Senate, who represent the 300 million people of America to come to \nthe floor and give voice to the future of the most fundamental national \nsecurity issue of our time. The most fundamental national security \nissue of our time is how we deal with the issue of terrorism, how we \ndeal with creating stability in the Middle East and, ultimately, how we \nbring our troops home out of harm's way. This debate on those \nfundamental issues is one that is worth having. Those who would demean, \nwho would take away, who would detract from the importance of this \nquestion by trying to use labels--such as ``surrender'' or \n``precipitous withdrawal,'' ``cut and run''--do not do a service to the \ncountry in advancing a policy that is worthy of the sacrifice so many \nhave made.\n  I hope as we move forward, not only in today's debate and in the vote \nthat will take place later on this morning, as well as when we deal \nwith this issue in July and perhaps into the August recess, perhaps \ninto September, perhaps into October, that we will be able to find a \ncommon way forward.\n  I am reminded, as I was listening to some of the labeling that was \ngoing on here last night, of a campaign that took place in Georgia in \n2002, where a great American by the name of Max Cleland, who had given \nso much of his life, his blood, and his limbs for the freedom of \nAmerica in Vietnam, was used as a political pawn in that election of \n2002 by people here in Washington and other places who dared put the \nlabel on him as unpatriotic. This man, who gave so much to his country, \nwho was willing to give the very last ounce of devotion and courage in \nhis life to do the ultimate sacrifice, was labeled as unpatriotic. So \nthe labeling we see taking place here in this debate on the Senate \nfloor through the night and through the rest of the day smacks of that \nsame kind of labeling that is unworthy of our purpose in the Senate.\n  I hope as we move forward, we can find a way of working together to \naddress the reality and the difficulty of the issues we face. Our \ntroops know the importance of this debate. The 1.4 million veterans who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan and their families know the importance \nof this debate. There is probably not a Member of this Chamber today \nwho has not spent many\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\nhours, both in Iraq, as well as with our troops back home, and in \nAfghanistan talking to them about the reality on the ground, what it is \nthat they see, how it is conditions are unfolding, and how it is that \nthey believe we ought to move forward with a policy that is worthy of \ntheir bravery.\n\n  The solemnity of this debate should not be lost on America, as the \nsun rises over this country. The solemnity of this debate should not be \nlost, particularly when we think about the men and women who have given \ntheir lives already in this cause in Iraq.\n  As of today, just from my State of Colorado, at the top of the Rocky \nMountains--my State of Colorado--we have had 51 members of Colorado's \npopulation killed in Iraq. We have had 443 who have been wounded in \nIraq. U.S. casualties in Iraq today are 3,618--3,618 Americans have \ngiven their lives in Iraq.\n  So the solemnity of this debate should be one that should honor those \nwho have given their lives in the effort in Iraq, as they have done the \nduty commanded by the Commander in Chief.\n  Beyond those who have given their lives and the sacrifice their \nfamilies have made to this effort, we also must remember the solemnity \nof this time and this moment when we think about the 26,806 Members of \nour armed services who have been wounded in Iraq. Many of us have spent \ntime at Walter Reed or spent time with veterans back home where we see \nwhat has happened to the lives of those who have lost their limbs, who \nhave had traumatic brain injuries.\n  Eighteen percent of those who have gone from Fort Carson, CO, have \nreturned with a traumatic brain injury. It is for those people that we \nmust make sure we have a solemn debate devoid of the politics, devoid \nof the politics that we see taking place with the labeling that is \noccurring here today.\n  There is no doubt that as we look at what has happened in now what is \nalmost a 5-year war in Iraq, there is a legion of mistakes that have \nbeen made. My friends on the other side of the aisle will concede there \nhave been major mistakes made, that in the early years of the war \neffort there were mistakes made on intelligence, mistakes made on the \ninformation that was provided to the Congress, multiple mistakes in \nterms of looking at the way forward and simply not being able to find \nit.\n  I believe when the President landed on the naval carrier and said the \nmission had been accomplished, in his heart and in his mind he did \nbelieve the mission had been accomplished. He did believe the mission \nhad been accomplished because the government of Saddam Hussein had been \ntoppled. Our brave men and women--some 300,000 men and women strong--\nhad gone in and had taken the Iraqi Republican Army down and had \ntoppled Saddam Hussein. So when the President said ``mission \naccomplished,'' now 4 years plus ago, I think he believed that was in \nfact the case.\n  But it was also an absolute failure to be able to look ahead at the \nreality of the complexity and the political conditions that existed in \nIraq at the time. I believe those who testified before the Congress in \nthose days and said it would cost less than $50 billion to undertake \nthis effort--I believe they were telling the American people what they \nthought was the case. But, sadly, they were very mistaken because we \nnow knock on the door of having invested not $50 billion, not $100 \nbillion, not $200 billion, not $300 billion, not $400 billion, but we \nare over the $500 billion mark. How could we as America be 12 times off \nthe mark--12 times off the mark--in terms of what this war would cost \nthe American taxpayer? How could we be so far off the mark, perhaps 100 \ntimes off the mark in terms of the number of men and women who would be \nkilled in Iraq? No one ever anticipated 4\\1/2\\ years ago that there \nwould be over 3,600 Americans who would be killed in Iraq.\n  So there has been a legion of mistakes that have been made. History \nwill look at those mistakes. History will look at those mistakes and \nreach its own judgment.\n  Let me say, we should learn from those mistakes, as we move forward. \nIn my view, that is what the Iraq Study Group did. That was a \ncommission, in fact, that was created by legislative action of this \nSenate and the House of Representatives and signed by the President. It \nwas a kind of template for which I believe we should strive to find a \nway of re-creating here in terms of their tenure and their approach to \nthis fundamental issue of war and peace.\n  President John Kennedy said, at one point:\n\n       So let us not be blind to our differences, but let us also \n     direct attention to our common interests and to the means by \n     which those differences can be resolved.\n\n  Let me say that again. He said: ``let us also direct attention to our \ncommon interests and to the means by which those differences can be \nresolved.''\n  We have differences here on the floor of the Senate this morning, as \nthe sun rises across America. We have had differences over the last \n4\\1/2\\ years with respect to this war and the direction of this war. \nBut I hope we find it among ourselves, Democrats and Republicans, to \nfind a way forward together. I think if we do that, we will reach the \nvision and the aspiration that was articulated by President Kennedy \nwhen we find ourselves in the position where we have these fundamental \ndifferences among us.\n  I want to spend a few minutes on what I think is a good way forward \nfor all of us. The Iraq Study Group--again, made up of 10 of the most \nprestigious Americans, people who have earned every right to be called \nthe statesmen of America--came up with a number of recommendations and \na number of findings. But at the beginning of the report, it is \nimportant for us to remember that in December of 2006--now some 7 \nmonths ago--the Iraq Study Group said:\n\n       The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating.\n\n  ``Grave and deteriorating.''\n\n       There is no path that can guarantee success, but the \n     prospects can be improved.\n\n  It is with that thought in mind that many months ago I began to work, \nespecially with Lee Hamilton, and with former Secretary James Baker, to \ncraft legislation to implement the Iraq Study Group recommendations. \nThose recommendations that are set forth in the amendment which we have \nfiled, which is cosponsored by 14 of our colleagues, is a way forward \nthat establishes a new direction in Iraq. It does some things which are \nperhaps from the point of view of some not enough; but in the point of \nview of others, I think they are very important things for us to do, \nbecause for the first time as part of United States policy what we say \nis: No. 1, we will move forward to transition the mission from combat \nto training and support. We will do a mission change--a mission \nchange--from combat to training and support. So our combat mission will \nbe something we will transition out of Iraq.\n  They also say, and we include in the legislation, that as part of \nnational policy we set forth a goal that this transition can, in fact, \nbe completed by the early part of 2008. That is some 9 months from \nwhere we stand today.\n\n  In addition, what this legislation does, as a matter of United States \nlaw, is for the first time it sends a clear, unequivocal signal to the \npeople of Iraq and to the Iraqi Government that these billions of \ndollars we are spending, and the huge amount of military support and \neffort we are putting into Iraq is going to come to an end, that our \nefforts are conditioned upon the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government \nmaking substantial progress toward making their Government work and \nproviding security on the ground.\n  Thirdly, what the legislation does, as a matter of our policy in the \nSenate, is set forth the major diplomatic offensive that is ultimately \nnecessary to bring about a peace in the very complex and difficult \nsituation we face not only in Iraq but also throughout the Middle East. \nI do hope we have at some point an opportunity to vote on that \namendment.\n  Finally, with respect to the Iraq Study Group, I heard a couple of \ncriticisms about our legislation. One of those criticisms is that it is \noutdated. I would say it was not a snapshot. Those recommendations--\nthat were put forth in December by a group that spent about $1 million \nin putting together that report, and spent countless days and weeks and \nmonths in coming up with the only coherent set of bipartisan \nrecommendations on the way forward--those recommendations are as valid \ntoday as they were back in December.\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\n  Congressman Lee Hamilton wrote a letter on July 9 addressed to me, \nand for others who are working on the bill with me. What his letter \nsaid, in conclusion, is that our legislation ``outlines the best chance \nof salvaging a measure of stability in Iraq and the region. It provides \na bipartisan way forward on a problem that cannot be solved unless we \ncome together to address this singular national issue.''\n  I am hopeful we will be able to find that way forward.\n  Let me conclude then by saying this: Some people have said our \nefforts here in the last several days, including the all-night \nsession--sleepless here in Washington, DC; watching the night come, \nwatching the sunrise here in Washington, DC--has been a political \nstunt. It is not a political stunt when the voices of 100 Senators, or \nat least some of those Senators, are heard on this floor debating how \nwe ought to move forward on the most fundamental issue of national \nsecurity of our time.\n  It is for that reason that I commend the majority leader and I \ncommend those who have called on us to make sure we put the spotlight \non such an important issue. I commend them for their courage, and I am \nhopeful that as our country and our Senate moves forward in trying to \ndeal with what is a seemingly intractable issue perhaps we can think \nback to the Scriptures, we can think back to the Book of Matthew, and \nremember what was said where He said: Blessed are the peacemakers. \nBlessed are the peacemakers.\n  It is the peacemakers ultimately who will help us chart a new and \ndifferent direction forward in Iraq that will help us achieve the \nsuccess I believe 100 Members of this Senate want; and I believe that \nis to bring our troops safely home, and to create the best conditions \nto salvage a measure of stability in Iraq and in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to the previous \nspeaker, the junior Senator from Colorado, I reviewed what he and \nSenator Lamar Alexander have put together, and I think of a lot of the \noptions out there, that is one that is fairly reasonable. But I \ndisagree with the offensive nature that people have taken with some of \nthe terms, such as ``resolution of surrender'' and ``cut and run.'' In \nreality, I believe that is what we are talking about.\n  A couple things were said. First of all, it happens in the case of \nformer Senator Max Cleland, he was one of my closest friends. We \nactually were in a Bible study together. We were together every week, \nspending quality time and intimate time together. Never once did anyone \nquestion his patriotism.\n  Max Cleland--I heard the story from him, what happened to him in \nVietnam. Then I also saw the campaign that came up. Yes, they talked \nabout votes, how perhaps his votes were different than the person who \nwas opposing him who was serving in the House at that time. Never once \nwas his patriotism questioned.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for \na question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, through the Chair to my good friend from \nOklahoma, I enjoy our work together on many multiple fronts, but with \nrespect to former Senator Cleland, I did see the pain from the attacks \nthat were made against him in Georgia. With respect to what you refer \nto, my friend from Oklahoma, concerning, quote, ``the surrender \nresolution,'' in my view, from what I have heard from my colleagues \nhere as we have entered this debate, it appears what we are talking \nabout is a way for an orderly disengagement from Iraq.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I understand.\n  Mr. President, reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. My question----\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am glad to yield for a question, but we already heard \nthis speech in terms of the interpretation of the vote we will have at \n11 o'clock. We have an honest difference of opinion, I say to my good \nfriend, the junior Senator from Colorado. He has expressed his opinion, \nand I want to express mine.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. May I ask a question? Will the Senator from Oklahoma \nyield for a simple question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. For one question. Go ahead.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. It is my understanding that even under the Levin-Reed \namendment there would be a significant troop presence that would remain \nover the long term in Iraq for the limited missions that are defined in \nthat legislation. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Let me reclaim my time and expand on that a little bit.\n  There is still a continued troop presence in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and \nother places. There always is a troop presence. And after this is \nover--depending on what the outcome is--I would assume there will \nalways be a troop presence there regardless of how we vote on any \nresolution today.\n\n  Now, let me say a couple other things that were stated on the floor. \nI was sitting here at about at 5:15 or 5:30 this morning, when \nstatements were made by the junior Senator from Massachusetts as to our \ntroops who have been involved with IEDs, who have lost their lives, and \nthat nothing changed after that, nothing was accomplished after that. \nThat is another way of saying they have died in vain.\n  Let me tell you, I have been in the AOR of Iraq, not always in Iraq, \nbut this AOR, 14 times. I probably have talked to more troops, gotten a \nbetter feel as to what people are about over there than any other \nMember. I think to even suggest that someone has died in vain is \ntotally outrageous.\n  Now, one of the things that has been stated over and over again that \nI do agree with by the opposition over there is we have a problem with \nour equipment. We have a problem with the funding of the military.\n  Let me suggest to you, in America, this is the only democracy where \nif people at home want to know how their Member of Congress--from the \nHouse or the Senate--is voting on issues, they can find out. I suggest \nto you that the worst way to find out how someone is voting on issues \nis to ask them. You do not want to do that.\n  But if you are concerned, for an example, as to how we are voting on \na tax issue--if you are for tax increases, you do not ask the guy, you \ndo not say, Senator Salazar, are you for tax increases? No, you do not \nwant to do that. But you can look at the ratings. We have ratings on \nevery conceivable subject. The National Taxpayers Union will tell how \neach Member votes in terms of tax increases.\n  Are you conservative or liberal? Well, I suggest to you the ACLU \nloves the liberals. The ACU loves the conservatives. I am proud of my \nrating. It happens to be No. 1 out of 100 Senators. So people will \nknow. They do not have to ask me.\n  If you are concerned about how a Senator is voting in terms of \nsupporting small business, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness rates all Democrats, Republicans, House and Senate, on those \nissues.\n  If you are concerned--this is what I am getting around to now--if you \nare concerned about who is supporting the military, there are groups \nthat do that. The Center for Security Policy, for example, says the \naverage Democrat supports the military 17 percent of the time, the \naverage Republican 79 percent of the time.\n  Now, if you question that, let me show you the chart I have in the \nChamber.\n  For Democrats to stand on this floor and talk about the problems of \nthe strained military, the problems of overdeployment, the problems we \nare having, look at what has happened. I do not think there was a month \nthat went by back during the 1990s, during the Clinton administration--\nwhen they were cutting the military, cutting our force strength, \ncutting money out of our military--when there wasn't this euphoric \nstatement: Oh, the Cold War is over, so we do not need a military \nanymore. That actually was floating around these Chambers. So what \nhappened during the 1990s?\n  If you take what the benchmark was in 1993, fiscal year 1993--that \nwould be this black line shown on the chart--and do nothing but \nconsider inflation, then this goes up here. In other words, if we get \nnothing except maintaining what we had in 1993, this would be the black \nline.\n\n  President Clinton's budget request came in at this red line. You see \nthe\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\ndifference between the red line and the black line: $412 billion less \nthan just maintaining the status quo.\n  Now, it was during that time that I was making statements on the \nfloor: We have very serious problems in terms of our modernization \nprogram. We are going to have to do something about this. I was so \nproud of GEN John Jumper, and this is before he was the chief. He stood \nup as, I believe, a lieutenant general at that time and he made this \nstatement. He said: Our potential adversaries have equipment that is \nbetter than ours. He was talking about strike fighters. He was talking \nabout China having bought, I believe it was 240 of the SU-30, SU-35 \nseries that the Russians were making and saying that they are actually \nbetter in many respects than our F-15s and F-16s.\n  Back in the 1990s, we were cutting back on the modernization program. \nWe were not moving forward with the modernization and going toward the \nF-22s and the F-35s and the future combat system and things we are \ndoing today. This is what happened, and our troop strength went down, \nour ships went down from 600 to 300. It is the downsizing that we have \nbeen paying for. Now what happens? This President came in, and 9/11 \ntook place in 2001. When this happened, all of a sudden we are faced \nwith a situation where we had a downsized military. We had to start \nreembarking on our modernization program. But all of this we had to be \npaying for.\n  We have had amendment after amendment that says we are going to have \nto do something about our deployments. Yes. Our deployments are \nunreasonable at this time, but it is because we went through this cycle \nback in the 1990s. I think it is very important that people understand \nwhere we came from and how we got in this position we are in today.\n  Now, a lot of things have been lost in this debate. I think the other \nside--the Democrats, the liberals--would like to have us believe that \nthis is just the United States. They have completely forgotten or \ndisregarded the global nature of this problem, this war which is out \nthere. It is global. Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, the United States, \nFrance, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, Indonesia, Great Britain, Jordan, \nEgypt, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Algeria, Yemen, and Tunisia are just \na partial list of the countries which have had terrorist attacks.\n  The National Counterterrorism Center reported that approximately \n14,000 terrorist attacks occurred in various countries during 2006. \nNow, they say that half of those were in Afghanistan and Iraq. That \nmeans 7,000 terrorist attacks happened all over the world outside of \nIraq and Afghanistan. We remember just in the last 30 days the \nterrorist attacks. A car bomb exploded outside Somalia's Prime \nMinister's residence, killing six people. These are all in the last 30 \ndays. A bomb exploded in front of a crowded tea shop in Thailand, \nkilling a woman and wounding 28; an explosion outside the Ambassador \nHotel in Nairobi, killing a man and injuring 37 others. A bomb exploded \noutside a clothing shop in Istanbul and more in Peru and other places. \nSo it has happened all over. The suicide bombers drove an SUV into the \nGlasgow Airport, injuring six people, just 2 weeks ago. A suicide \nbomber drove into a convoy of Spanish tourists, killing nine people. \nThat was just last week. This is the global nature of this war.\n  What has this President been doing after 9/11? People don't realize \nwhat has happened and the results, the very positive results of these \nthings that took place. We passed the PATRIOT Act, which broke down the \nwalls between Federal law enforcement and intelligence communities, \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security, created a position of \nDirector of National Intelligence, created the National \nCounterterrorism Center, and worked with all of the intelligence \nsystems.\n  My predecessor--when I came over from the House to the Senate--was \nDavid Boren, Senator David Boren, who is now the president of Oklahoma \nUniversity. After I was elected, he said he wanted to talk to me about \na problem which he had been unsuccessful in resolving. You might \nremember that he was the chairman at that time of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. He said: We have a problem, a serious crisis in \nour intelligence system. He said: We have, the NSCA and the CIA and the \nDIA and all of these people, but they are not talking to each other.\n  It is a crisis we started approaching, and it wasn't until this came \nalong--the efforts of this President--that we got our intelligence act \ntogether to a much greater degree. What kind of results are we having? \nWell, the President made a statement, and I think it is worth \nrepeating: The terrorists only have to be right once; we have to be \nright 100 percent of the time.\n  Have we avoided, because of all of these efforts the President has \nmade, a disaster here in this country? I really believe we have. We \ncaptured an al-Qaida operative named Ali Saleh al-Marri in the United \nStates who was targeting water reservoirs, the New York Stock Exchange, \nand the U.S. military academies. We broke up two other post-9/11 \naviation plots, one targeting the Library Towers in Los Angeles and the \nother targeting the east coast. Four men were indicted for an alleged \nplot to attack the John F. Kennedy International Airport by blowing up \nthe jet fuel supply. We disrupted a plot by a group of al-Qaida-\ninspired extremists to kill American soldiers at Fort Dix. We have \nworked with the Brits and other countries. Together, we successfully \nbroke up a plot in the U.K. to blow up passenger airlines going to \nAmerica which could have rivaled the tragedy of 9/11. Of course, we \nknow what happened down in Piccadilly Circus in the theater area, the \nplot, the terrorist plot that was planned there that we stopped.\n  So I guess what I am saying is we know these things were going on. \nThere is no way to say for sure that thousands of Americans are alive \ntoday because of the efforts of this administration, but I believe it, \nand everything I have mentioned here is all documented in terms of \nplots against this country that perhaps we would not have been able to \ndefend ourselves against prior to that time.\n  It does bother me when we talk about how this isn't a surrender \nresolution, this isn't a cut-and-run resolution. Sure, it is. We see \nal-Qaida--they see the victory in Iraq as a religious and strategic \nimperative, something they have to do. This is not something which is \noptional for them; they have to do it. In fact, Osama bin Laden called \nthe struggle in Iraq a war of destiny. This is Osama bin Laden. That is \nhow he characterized it. It reminded me, when I heard that, of one of \nthe great speeches of all time. It was given by Ronald Reagan way back \nbefore he was even Governor of California. It was called ``A Rendezvous \nWith Destiny,'' using the same words--the characterization of Osama bin \nLaden when he talked about the ``war of destiny'' that is taking place. \n``A Rendezvous With Destiny.'' I have often said it should be required \nreading for all schoolkids.\n\n  Every time I see the Senator from Florida, the junior Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez, I think about his trip from Cuba over to this \ncountry, and it reminds me of the speech Ronald Reagan made when he \nsaid ``a rendezvous with destiny.'' He talked about the Cuban who had \nescaped from Cuba, and as his small craft floated up on the shores of \nFlorida, a woman was there, and this Cuban started talking about the \natrocities of Communist Cuba and of Castro and the problems that were \nover there, and she said: I guess we in this country don't know how \nlucky we are. And he said: How lucky you are? We are the ones who are \nlucky because we had a place to escape to. What he was saying is that \nwe have been this beacon of freedom in this country for so many years.\n  I can remember--and the occupant of the chair was there at the same \ntime I was, in the other body, back during the war in Nicaragua. At \nthat time, the Communists were trying to take over. One of the great \nthings Ronald Reagan did was to kill communism in Central America at \nthat time, and that endured for some 20 years afterward. But at that \ntime, in Nicaragua, I was going down there quite often because we were \nwatching Daniel Ortega and we were watching the Sandinistas and we knew \nwhat was happening down there. So we would go down to see these brave \npeople who were fighting for their freedoms.\n  I can remember going to a hospital tent in Honduras, just across the \nborder from Nicaragua. I went down there several times. I would just \nlook and\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\nmarvel at these young kids. Keep in mind, at that time, those who were \ndefending their freedom against communism were young people because all \nthe older ones had been killed already. They had a hospital tent. I \nremember the hospital tent was about half the size of this Chamber. All \nthe way around the peripheral of this hospital tent were beds. In the \nmiddle was an operating table with no shield or anything up, and they \nwere operating on these young kids as they came back and getting them \nready to go back into battle to fight for their freedom against \ncommunism in Nicaragua.\n  I remember going around the room and talking to these individuals in \ntheir language and saying: You know, I admire you so much. You are just \nfighting against impossible odds. How can you keep driving yourself to \ngo back? I remember getting the answers as I went around the room.\n  I came to a little girl. Her name was Maria Elana Gonzalez. She was a \nlittle bitty girl. She might have been 90 pounds. It was her third trip \nto the hospital tent. She wouldn't be going back into battle because \nthat morning they had amputated her right leg and the blood was oozing \nthrough her bandage. She looked up at me after I had asked that \nquestion and she said: Es porque han tomado los campos, han tomado las \ncasas, han tomado todo de lo que tenemos. Pero, de veras, ustedes en \nlos Estados Unidos entienden. Porque tuvieron que luchar por su \nlibertad, por lo mismo que estamos luchando ahora.\n  What she said was: How can you ask that question? We are fighting \nbecause they have taken our farms, they have taken our houses, they \nhave taken all that we have. But surely you in the United States \nunderstand this because you had to fight against the same odds for your \nfreedom.\n  That little girl couldn't read or write. She didn't know her history. \nShe didn't know if our Revolutionary War was 10 years ago or 200 years \nago. But she knew we were the beacon of freedom, the beacon of freedom. \nI wonder what is happening to that beacon of freedom.\n  We are looking at this war now, the serious nature of this war.\n  Winston Churchill said--and I quoted this several times on this \nfloor, but I think it is worth repeating. He said:\n\n       Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and \n     easy. Always remember, however sure you are that you could \n     easily win, that there would not be a war if the other man \n     did not think he also had a chance.\n\n  That was just as true in World War II as it is today.\n  So we are facing an enemy today that is adaptive. He is willing to do \nanything. You can't negotiate with him. It is not a country. In a way, \nit is more dangerous. We compare this war and certainly some of the \nterrorists who are running the other side with Hitler and with Stalin. \nThose things in some ways were not as dangerous because they were more \npredictable. This is not predictable. You can't defeat a country and \nsay the war is over because it is not over. As I mentioned, this is \nglobal, the attacks that are taking place. Any plan to leave Iraq \nbefore we have had a chance to understand the outcome of the troop \nsurge does two things: It tells the enemy that they have been \nsuccessful and their methods worked, and secondly, it gives them the \npatience to wait us out.\n  One of the things I learned in my many trips over there is the \nculture of the people is different. They don't think of today and \ntomorrow or next week; they think of long periods of time. Oh, we are \nnot going to be there 2 years from now? Oh, fine. We will just go into \nhibernation. We will wait for 2 years. Everything is going to be fine. \nWe will just wait until that happens. You can't win by--they can only \nwin by attacking our resolve.\n  When we talk about the resolve, I wonder about that beacon of \nfreedom, when that little girl in the hospital tent looked at America. \nWhat has happened to it since that time? You look at our resolve that \nhas been lost in Somalia. It wasn't until they dragged the naked bodies \nof our troops through the streets of Mogadishu that finally we didn't \nhave the stomach for it, and so that beacon of freedom went out. We saw \nit in Vietnam, in Lebanon, in the Khobar Towers.\n  I recognize, and everyone recognizes, there have been mistakes in \nthis thing. The President recognized this in his speech on January 10. \nHe said a lot of things that I think were very profound observations at \nthat time that I will address in just a minute. But when you look at \nthe consequences of a premeditated withdrawal, when the enemy knows \nwhat we are going to be doing in the future--one of the great generals \nof our time is General Maples. He was actually the commanding general \ndown in Fort Sill in Oklahoma at one time. He is now the DIA Director. \nHe said:\n\n       Continued Coalition presence is the primary counter to a \n     breakdown in central authority. Such a breakdown would have \n     grave consequences for the people of Iraq, stability in the \n     region, and the United States strategic interests.\n\n  John Negroponte and General Hayden both agree with that.\n  It is not too late to avoid this. I don't think it is time to start \ncutting our losses and just hope that all this goes away. If we can \nassist the Iraqis and reach that point of sustainable self-governance, \nthen we can bring defeat to our enemies and stability to the region. We \nall want this. All those who have not personally seen the changes, the \nvisible changes that are taking place in Iraq, seen the girls who can \nnow get an education and seen that they can now have weddings in the \nstreets without the fear of having troops come in there and kidnap all \nthe girls and rape them and bury them alive--people have forgotten \nalready how bad things were at that time in Iraq.\n  So I just have to say this: Regretfully, I have been sitting here \nsince 5 o'clock trying to get on the floor, and now we are running out \nof time. But I would say this, and I think it is something which is \nvery significant; that is, the President, in his speech on January 10, \ntalked about the necessity for victory in Iraq, but he used a term that \nnobody heard and nobody remembered and nobody listened to, and it is \ncalled from the bottom up. A ``bottom-up victory'' is what he wanted. \nThis President is talking about it with the people.\n  Let me tell you what has happened. On my last trip--keep in mind, I \nhave made some 14 trips to the AOR, and the last trip was after the \nsurge was announced. We saw a number of things. First of all, it didn't \ngo unnoticed by the people over there that there are some resolutions \nlike the one we will considering at 11 o'clock today, and consequently \nthat got their attention. I think some good came from that. But that, \nalong with David Petraeus going over there as commander in chief, along \nwith the surge, has really had some results. For the first time over \nthere, I saw changes.\n  A few minutes ago, one of our Republicans was talking about the \nchange in Ramadi. It was the senior Senator from Utah. In Ramadi, if \nyou remember a year ago, that was getting ready--or, as we say in \nOklahoma, that was fixing to be the terrorist capital of the world. It \nis now secure. In Fallujah--this is just less than a month ago, in \nFallujah--it is secure, and it is secure by our security force--by the \nIraqi security force and not by ours. In other words, they are taking \ncare of their own over there. The joint security stations where our \ntroops, instead of coming back to the Green Zone, will stay over there \nand bed down with the Iraqi security forces, develop intimate \nrelationships with them, and learn to love each other--this is what is \nhappening right now.\n  I was mistaken. All these years, we have been talking about Maliki \nand all the political leaders. I am beginning to think really that the \nsuccesses that are taking place and the bottom-up success right now \nafter the surge are actually coming from the religious leaders. We \nmonitor--and we do this as a matter of course--all of the mosque \nceremonies. I think they meet once a week like most churches do, and up \nuntil December, 85 percent of the messages that were by the clerics and \nby the imams in the mosques were anti-American. They started dropping \noff until in April of this year, there wasn't one anti-American \nmessage. The results are there. As a result of that, we are having many \nof the citizens, just on their own, as the Senator from Utah \nmentioned--because he was there a short time after I was there, and he \nsaid they are doing things now that they haven't done before.\n  Just as we have, in Tulsa, OK, and in all of our cities in Oklahoma \nand here\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\nin Washington, DC, a Neighborhood Watch Program where the neighbors \nvolunteer to go out and watch, this is happening in Baghdad, Fallujah, \nRamadi, all throughout Iraq right now.\n  These are people who are going out and risking their lives with spray \ncans, spray-painting circles around undetonated IEDs, and it is being \ndone successfully. I think there is a level of panic setting in on \nthose individuals who have gone over there and seen that the surge \nappears to be working.\n  I don't think we should be cutting and running at this stage. We have \na huge investment there. We have taken out a ruthless leader, one who \nwould rival Hitler in the atrocities he has committed. Now that we have \nan opportunity to do that--to have a different form of government in \nthe Middle East--and people who say it wasn't Iraq all this time, sure, \nit was Iraq. There were training centers in Iraq training people to do \ndifferent things. In the town of Salman Pak, they were training \nterrorists how to fly airplanes into targets. Did they train the 9/11 \nterrorists? There is no way of knowing that. Nonetheless, the training \ncamps are not there anymore. We have had successes.\n  I know people want to talk about the failures, but I will say to you \nthis is a very critical vote. If we vote at 11 o'clock today to leave \nbefore the job is done, that would be a crisis and a slap in the face \nfor our troops over there fighting so bravely for our freedom back \nhere. I am a product of the draft of many years ago, and I believed you \nwould never be able to have an all-volunteer force and have it with the \nquality we had in the draft. I realize now that I was wrong all those \nyears ago, that we have the finest young people in the world in our \nmilitary. They understand what the mission is. They understand the \nthreat facing them. The first thing they asked me is: Why is it the \nAmerican people don't understand, or the media? They don't ask that \nquestion now because they have the benefit of having talk radio. They \nhave FOX instead of depending on CNN International, and they realize \nthe American people are by their side.\n  So this is critical. Is it worth staying up all night for? I think it \nis. I look forward to defeating the effort of the Levin-Reed amendment \ntaking place at 11 o'clock today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nacknowledging there is something that is worth staying up all night \nfor, that this is a debate we must continue to have. But this is also a \nvote we must have. The American people and our troops deserve nothing \nless than an up-or-down vote.\n  I disagree with the Senator from Oklahoma when he said we would be \nsomehow hurting our troops by not staying the course. I think we need \nto change the course. I think this idea that we somehow dishonor our \ntroops by having a free and open debate about this is wrong. I think it \nis wrong to say we dishonor our troops when we talk about a change in \ncourse in Iraq, because I think it is what they deserve. We need a \nsmart way to get our soldiers out of harm's way and transition to the \nIraqi Government. This is about getting this policy right for our \ntroops in the field, about giving them what they deserve: a simple \nmajority vote. That is what we need today.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will recognize our current strategy in \nIraq is not working, that a new strategy based on drawing down U.S. \nforces is necessary, and this strategy must be implemented now. After 4 \nyears, over 3,600 American soldiers have been killed, over 25,000 have \nbeen wounded, and almost $450 billion has been spent. We cannot wait \nuntil next year, or until next month, or until September to change our \nstrategy. After 4 years, we cannot wait for the Iraqi Government to \ndemonstrate the progress before we begin bringing our soldiers home, \nand it has shown no indication of a commitment to compromise and \nreconciliation. After 4 years, we cannot ask our men and women in the \nfield to continue to risk life and limb indefinitely in the pursuit of \na policy that so many of our colleagues across the aisle have now \nadmitted and have spoken out about and said this policy needs to be \nchanged, that it is not working. Talk is talk. But now it is time to \nvote.\n  Our troops have done what they have been asked to do. They deposed an \nevil dictator. They guaranteed free elections in Iraq. We all know \nthere can be no purely military solution in Iraq. This has been agreed \nto by so many military commanders, experts, and Members in this body \nthat it doesn't need to be argued anymore. We recognize true stability \nin Iraq will only come with political compromise between their various \nethic factions. Only Iraqis can reach that agreement. Given that, \nshould our strategy not be transitioning to Iraqi authority now, not \nsome undefined time in the future?\n  We must push the Iraqi Government to assume the duties it was elected \nto perform, to lead the process in negotiation and deal-making. Our \nopenended commitment is impeding this process and inhibiting the will \nof the Iraqi people to stand up and take responsibility for their own \ncountry.\n  Nine months ago, the Iraq Study Group proposed a pragmatic change of \ncourse that focused on political and economic initiatives, intense \nregional, and international diplomacy that would tie all nations with \nan interest in Iraq together, and beginning the phased redeployment of \nU.S. forces from Iraq. Since the issuance of the Iraq Study Group \nreport, some conditions on the ground have remained the same, and a \nnumber have gotten worse. In the last 3 months, more U.S. troops were \nkilled than in any other 3-month period during the entire war.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside differences, to forget about past \nagreements or voting records, and focus on what is best for our troops \nin the field going forward. We owe it to these brave men and women in \nthe field to get this policy right. I believe the best thing we can do \nfor our troops, our national interest, and for the Iraqis is to adopt \nthe new strategy proposed by my colleagues Senators Levin and Reed that \nwould begin bringing our troops home, removing the bulk of our combat \nforces by the spring of next year. We know this cannot be done \novernight, and the troops will be remaining to train the police and \nguard our embassies, and for special forces. We also know it is time to \nsend a message to this Iraqi Government that it is time for them to \ngovern.\n  Keeping over 160,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq is simply not the answer. \nWe need to start bringing them home. In March, I visited Baghdad and \nFallujah and saw firsthand the bravery and commitment of our troops. I \nhad a number of meetings set up with Minnesota troops. Of the 22,000 \ntroops who were sent over as part of this surge, 3,000 were from \nMinnesota. In fact, they are the longest serving Guard unit right now \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. A number of them are now coming home. We \nrejoice in Minnesota for the ones coming home to their families. But we \nknow that, sadly, they are being replaced by other soldiers from across \nthis country. I remember one of the Congressmen who had gone to Iraq \nshortly after I did. He came back and talked, as a House Member, about \nhow it reminded him of--going through the market,--a farmer's market in \nIndiana.\n  Well, that is not my memory from Iraq. What I remember, first, is our \ntroops and how they didn't complain about the heat, or about their \nextensions, or about their equipment. They only asked me two things: \nWhat the State high school hockey tournament scores were, and then they \nasked if I would call their moms and dads and husbands and wives when I \ngot home. I did that. I talked to about 50 moms. I have to tell you \nthey told me different stories. They told me about children who were \nwaiting for their dad to come home, that they thought they were going \nto come home in January, and they were waiting month after month. They \ntold me about how scared they were every time they turned on the TV. \nThey told me about how proud they were of their child but that they \nwanted him to come home.\n  My starkest memory of that trip was not some farmer's market in \nIndiana; my memory was standing on the tarmac of the Baghdad airport \nwhere nine Duluth firefighters called me over to stand with them. \nFirst, I didn't know what it was. They were there to do their duty. \nThey were saluting in front of a firetruck while six caskets draped in \nthe American flag were loaded onto a plane. They didn't know what\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\nfallen soldiers were in those caskets. They didn't know who they were. \nThey just knew it was their duty to salute and they knew the lives of \nthe families of these fallen soldiers would never be the same.\n  There is not a day that goes by that I don't think about the \nMinnesota soldiers I met over there. They never complained. They did \ntheir jobs. They deposed an evil dictator and guaranteed free \nelections. Now it is time to bring them home. One thing that struck us \nin our State is that this is a different kind of war. Up to 40 percent \nof the troops fighting in Iraq are members of the National Guard and \nReserves. In many respects, the war has involved a different kind of \nsoldier. In Vietnam, the average age of an American soldier was 19 \nyears old. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the average age of an active-duty \nsoldier is 27. The average age of National Guard members is 33. Three-\nfourths of all soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have families \nof their own, and fully one-half of those who have been killed have \nleft families behind. Almost 22 percent of the Guard and Reserve \nmembers have had multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. For 4 \nyears, these citizen soldiers have gone above and beyond the call of \nduty as this war has lasted longer--our involvement has lasted longer \nthan our involvement in World War II. These citizen soldiers have made \nextraordinary sacrifices.\n  As we see our Guard and Reserve come home in Minnesota, the longest \nserving unit in this war, we know many have come back injured and \nmaimed. I think I heard it is a thousand in this war across this \ncountry who have lost a limb, and 20-some thousand have been injured. \nHaving served and sacrificed for 16 months, these men and women earned \ntheir rest and their right to live their lives in peace. But we keep \nsending them back and we keep sending them back.\n  All across my State, I have heard a strong and clear message from \nMinnesotans: Change the course in Iraq. Push for the strategy and \nsolution that will bring our troops home and transition to Iraqi \ngovernance.\n  They want to see a surge in diplomacy, not a surge in troops. It is a \nmessage that was echoed all over this country last fall, from Montana \nto Minnesota, from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The people of Minnesota, \nlike their fellow citizens around the country, recognize what is at \nstake in Iraq. As I have traveled around our State, I have spoken with \nmany families who have paid a personal price in this war. I think of \nClairmont Anderson, who would drive hundreds of miles to attend public \nevents. Every time anybody even brought up the war, he would start to \ncry. It is because his son Stewart, an Army Reserve major, was killed \nin a helicopter crash in Iraq. I think of Kathleen Waseka from St. \nPaul, MN. In January, her son James Waseka, Jr., was killed while \npatrolling on foot in an area near Fallujah. He was assigned with the \nMinnesota Army National Guard First Brigade, the same unit that was \nextended under the President's escalation. Sergeant Waseka was the \nthird member of his unit to die within a 6-week period. I also think of \nBecky Lurie of Kerrick, MN, near Duluth. She is the mother of 12 and a \nformer State senator. Her son Matt was killed when the Army helicopter \nhe was piloting went down north of Baghdad. I watched this Gold Star \nmother--a woman who has adopted 8 children--comfort her grandchildren, \nhold her shaking husband, and stand tall for hours in a high school gym \nin Findley, MN, where hundreds of people came together to gather for \nher son's memorial service. Clairmont Anderson, Kathleen Waseka, and \nBecky Lurie are parents whose children made the ultimate sacrifice in \nservice to our country. They are among the many Minnesotans who have \ntold me, without apology, that they want to see a change of course in \nIraq. They pray that others will not experience their pain.\n\n  Although I opposed this war from the beginning, I recognize many did \nsupport it. But many years later, we are now dealing with a \ndramatically different situation. What we now know about the events and \nfacts leading up to the war has changed dramatically. The conditions \ninside Iraq have changed dramatically. Our role there has changed \ndramatically. We need an up-or-down vote today. If we don't have a \nregular up-or-down vote, as the American people have asked for, we are \nnot going to get the change of course the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \nrecommended, the change of course that Iraq needs to halt its civil \nwar, or the change of course our military forces deserve.\n  As of Thanksgiving, as I said, this war has lasted longer than World \nWar II. Have we not asked our men and women to sacrifice enough?\n  Recently, at the funeral for a fallen soldier, I heard a local priest \nsay our leaders have an obligation to do right by our children when we \nsend them to war. This particular soldier was very tall and very \nstrong. As the priest talked about him, he talked about the fact that \neven though this young man was over 6 feet tall, he was still our \nchild. He said our children may be over 6 feet tall when we send them \nto war, but they are still our children. If the kids we are sending to \nIraq are 6 feet tall, he said, then our leaders must be 8 feet tall. I \nadd that if these soldiers are willing to stand up and risk their lives \nfor our country, those of us in Congress must be brave enough to stand \nup and ask the tough questions and push for the tougher solutions and \nnot be afraid to have an up-or-down vote on a change of strategy in \nIraq. Clairmont Anderson, Kathleen Waseka, and Becky Lurie are standing \ntall. The parents with whom I met, whose kids were supposed to come \nhome back in January, have been waiting and waiting for that telephone \ncall, and waiting and waiting for those letters. They have been \nstanding tall all these months.\n  The members of the Minnesota National Guard whose deployment ceremony \nI attended a few months ago in Duluth stood tall. The teenage brother \nand sister I met there who saw their dad and their mom deployed to Iraq \nat the same time stood tall. The injured soldiers in the VA hospital in \nMinnesota, recovering from traumatic brain injuries, and in their \nwheelchairs, with their strength and their spirit are standing tall.\n  I say to my friends across the aisle, by having an honest and open \ndebate about the war as we have done tonight, we in Congress can stand \ntall, but we can only stand tall when we allow for a fair and honest \nvote about the strategy in Iraq. Our Constitution says Congress should \nbe a responsible check and balance on Presidential power. Congressional \noversight of our Iraq policy is long overdue. On behalf of the public, \nMembers of this body have a responsibility to exercise our own \nconstitutional power in a fairminded, bipartisan way, to insist on \naccountability and to demand a change of course. Ultimately, the best \nway to help our soldiers and their families is not only to give them \nthe respect and the benefits and the help they deserve, but also to get \nthis policy right.\n  I hope my friends across the aisle will see the merits of this debate \nand allow for an up-or-down vote on the Levin-Reed amendment. Our \ntroops and our families deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to our new colleague from Minnesota, I say \nshe expressed herself very well. This is a debate where nobody expects \nto change votes or minds in the short term. But it is a chance to \nexpress why you believe what you do about Iraq and how we go forward in \nthat regard. It is always good to showcase our differences.\n  All of us in the body need to ask one question: Why is the Congress \nat such a low approval rating with the American people? What is it \nabout what we are doing up here that is giving the public a bad taste \nabout the way Congress works? That is a question I don't know how to \nanswer completely. But I have a feeling that most Americans see \nCongress interacting with each other as if we are talking past each \nother and not many problems are being solved. We are trying to show the \nother side as being worse than we are.\n  It seems to me we are trying to construct a whole session of Congress \naround exposing other people's weaknesses and solving very few \nproblems. Every now and then, you will step out in the middle, and the \nSenator from New York, the Presiding Officer--we have done some things \nI am very proud of, so there is hope. There are efforts\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\ngoing on here in other areas to try to bring the Congress together and \ndo some things that are important.\n  About Iraq, the reason no one is going to change their mind is that \nwe just have a basic philosophical difference about how we go forward. \nLet me tell you what drives me more than anything else about the short \nterm and the long term. The one thing we failed to do after the fall of \nBaghdad is plan for the worst-case scenario. One of the problems we \nhave had is that we always assumed the best and never planned for the \nworst. We have gone down this road many times. The mistakes early on \nhave come back to haunt us. We never had enough troops. The security \nsituation got out of hand. We underestimated how hard it would be to \nbuild a democracy out of the ashes after dictatorship, and those early \nmistakes have cost. But in every war, you make mistakes.\n  What I am trying to do is talk about where we are now and where we \nare going to go. Acknowledging the early mistakes, we have paid a \nprice. Let's not repeat them in another form. The old strategy after \nthe fall of Baghdad was to focus on training, to keep the American \nmilitary footprint as low as possible, empower the Iraqi military and \narmy to take over their country and go fight al-Qaida and other \nextremist groups in firefights and come back behind walls. After 3\\1/2\\ \nyears of engaging in that strategy, al-Qaida got stronger. We lost \ncontrol of different provinces in Iraq to al-Qaida. Extremism grew, and \nwe had no political reconciliation.\n  For 3 years--2 years, anyway; 2\\1/2\\ at least--I, along with Senator \nMcCain and others, have been saying the old strategy wasn't working. I \ndo defer to military commanders. We all should to a point. Every \ngeneral and every politician should have their work product judged by \nresults. It was clear to me that the old strategy was not producing the \nresult to secure the country, bring about political reconciliation, and \ncontrol extremism. As a matter of fact, the old strategy, which lasted \nfor 3 years, resulted in losing ground to the enemy, a stronger al-\nQaida, a more fractured Iraq, and we were going nowhere fast. So I, \nalong with others, pushed for a new strategy. The new strategy wasn't \nwithdrawal. It was quite the opposite--reinforce.\n  Since February of this year, we have been bringing new combat \ncapability into Iraq. We have added troops to make up for the mistakes \ninitially made right after the fall of Baghdad. What has that \nadditional combat capability done in Iraq and what has it failed to do? \nI think it is undeniable that General Petraeus's new strategy has been \nenormously successful in certain areas of Iraq that had been previously \nlost to al-Qaida. To me, that is the most encouraging sign yet of \nprogress in Iraq. What has not happened is a securing of the country as \na whole, the destruction completely of al-Qaida, the chilling out of \nIranian involvement, and political reconciliation.\n  The new strategy is just exactly that--new. Instead of being behind \nwalls with a limited military footprint, General Petraeus has deployed \nAmerican forces into communities that were previously held by al-Qaida \nin Anbar Province. We have taken the fight to the enemy, and we have \nbeen able to dislodge al-Qaida in provinces that they dominated under \nthe old strategy.\n  But here is the good news: Beating al-Qaida is always going to happen \nwhen we engage them because we are so much better militarily than they \nare. But the people who lived under their control in Anbar for all \nthese months broke from al-Qaida and aligned themselves with us.\n  The best evidence I have seen thus far of a new strategy working is \nthat not only have we liberated Anbar Province, a place you couldn't go \n6 months ago, if you were a Member of Congress, to be somewhere you can \nwalk around now like Ramadi. In the year 2006, there were 1,000 people \nwho volunteered to be policemen in Anbar Province for the whole year. \nAs of now, in 2007, 12,000 Iraqis have volunteered to be part of the \npolice force in Anbar. They are all from that area. Once the sheiks \nbroke from al-Qaida and joined with the coalition forces, they made a \ncall to the local community for the sons of Anbar to stand and fight, \njoin the police. We will soon be able to reduce our combat presence in \nAnbar because the alliances we have formed with the local leadership, \nthe addition of police, and the maturing of the Iraqi Army will allow \nAnbar to be held by the people of Iraq who live in Anbar. That was made \npossible only because we added combat capability at a time when it \nmattered.\n  The biggest reason Anbar flipped is because al-Qaida was brutal when \nthey were in the place. The people in Anbar, the Sunni Arabs, had a \ntaste of al-Qaida life, and they did not like it. Al-Qaida engaged in \nsome of the most brutal acts imaginable against people under their \ncontrol.\n  They killed family members of the leadership. They went after people \nwhom they considered to be a threat. They imposed a way of life and \nliving on the people of Anbar Province that was unacceptable. \nLiterally, al-Qaida overplayed their hand. At the time they were \noverplaying their hand, literally comes over the hill American combat \npower in a new fashion, more of it reconfigured. It was a magic moment \nwhere we moved out behind the walls, created joint security stations. \nIraqi police and soldiers would live with American soldiers in joint \nsecurity stations. So in your neighborhood, now you will have a joint \nsecurity station not far away where there will be American soldiers, \nIraqi police, and army units living together that will be there to \nprotect you and your family. These joint security stations have been a \nfundamental change in policy militarily.\n  Counterinsurgency is about going into the areas where the insurgents \ndominate, militarily dislodging them but changing the dynamic on the \nground so it would be hard for them to come back. If we will continue \nto support those who have broken from al-Qaida and joined us, then we \nwill have a stable situation in Anbar that we could never have achieved \nunder the old strategy. Because people break away from al-Qaida, does \nthat mean they embrace democracy--Sunni, Shia, and Kurd coexistence? \nNo. But it is a start. It means they have rejected a way of life that \nhas no place on the planet for people like us.\n  My good friend from New York, we have found many things that we can \nwork on in common. But here is something else we have in common. A \nDemocrat from New York and a Republican from South Carolina are viewed \nthe same by our enemy, al-Qaida. They hate us both. If they could kill \nus both, they would because we have agreed that whatever differences we \nhave, they could actually be a strength. When we get into a dispute, we \ngo to the courthouse; we don't go out in the street and start killing \neach other. In America, religious differences are not only accepted and \ntolerated, they are viewed as a strength.\n\n  There are three conflicts going on in Iraq. One is among the \nsectarian population in Iraq, the Sunnis and Shias and somewhat the \nKurds. That conflict can only be resolved by the Iraqi people embracing \nwhat they have in common, accepting their differences as a strength, \nand rejecting this desire to break away. I think that can happen \nbecause there are enough Sunni, Kurds and Shias willing to die to make \nthat happen that I am still optimistic.\n  We had our own Civil War. It is hard to get different people from \ndifferent backgrounds to live together, but we are an example that it \ncan happen. But it comes sometimes at a great sacrifice. So the \nsectarian violence in Iraq will only be solved by having enough control \nof the security to keep tensions down and trying to build political \nreconciliation.\n  During immigration, I learned a lesson. People get mad when you do \nhard things. They can say pretty awful things about you. I learned a \nlot of cuss words that I never knew before. That is what happens in \nAmerican politics when you try to embrace hard issues. People get mad. \nThat is democracy. It is about expressing yourself. You just pay the \nprice when you do that politically. But the price we pay is being \ncalled bad names. It may affect your election; it may not.\n  In Iraq, if you want to find the middle ground, they try to kill your \nfamily. Remember how hard it was on immigration when all those phone \ncalls flooded your office trying to tell us: You better not do this; \nyou better not do that. Imagine trying to sit down at a table in Iraq \nto find common ground with someone who represents a side that just \nmaybe killed your family.\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\n  I would argue that political reconciliation in Iraq is hard because \nit is hard here. It is harder there because of the security environment \nwhich has broken down. We would be wise to provide better security. \nThat is the way to get political reconciliation.\n  The key to solving sectarian conflicts in Iraq is better security, \nmore diplomatic pressure, economic and political aid, and pressure to \nget the Iraqis to live as one with some amount of autonomy. The Sunnis, \nthe Shias, and the Kurds are finally going to figure out that you will \nhave a better life living together than if you try to break away \nbecause if the Shias try to dominate and create an Iranian style \ntheocracy, the Sunni Arab nations are not going to sit on the sideline. \nIf you are a Sunni trying to take power back by the use of a gun, they \nare not going to allow you to dominate the country by the force of \narms, and you are not going to be able to split away from the rest of \nIraq and live in peace because your neighbors are always going to \nconsider you a threat.\n  If you are Kurd in the north and you think you can live up there \npeacefully and ignore what is happening in the south, you have another \nthing coming because turmoil in Iraq will make your life difficult. If \nyou think you can break away from the rest of Iraq and have a Kurdish \nindependent state without consequences from Turkey, you are kidding \nyourself.\n  Each group really will one day figure out we are better off in terms \nof our long-term interest to find some common ground here on how we can \nlive together. That is going to happen, but we have to control the \nviolence better and we have to push them harder.\n  The second fight involves al-Qaida. I was on this morning with \nSenator Obama on the ``Today'' show. He said something I believe is \nabsolutely correct: Reasonable people can disagree. The one thing I \nhope reasonable people can agree is that al-Qaida is very unreasonable. \nIf you could find some common ground with this crowd, please let me \nknow. I have yet to find a way to reach out to al-Qaida without getting \nyour arm taken off. They don't have a plan that we can buy into. I \ndon't think they have an agenda that any of us, Republicans or \nDemocrats, can say: Let's work on some middle ground.\n  Their agenda for the world is not totally different from Hitler's \nagenda for the world. It is a religious-based, driven conflict. They \nhave taken a religious view of life that excludes moderate Muslims, \nJews, Christians, and anybody who disagrees with them, and they feel \ncompelled by God to topple all forms of moderation. People who do not \npractice Islam, in their view, are just as bad as we are. They have an \nagenda to make sure that those folks in the Middle East who reject \ntheir religion really pay a heavy price. One, they will be dominated, \nand if they don't change, they will be killed. Hitler had the same \nview: If you are racially different, if you don't live under the thumb \nof the Aryan race, you will be worked to death or killed. Al-Qaida is \nno different. They have a religious agenda they are trying to impose on \nthe world.\n  Am I worried about al-Qaida sweeping the world and conquering \nWashington? No. Am I worried about al-Qaida taking over all of Iraq? \nNo. Here is what I am worried about: If we let the country break apart \nand we have chaos in Iraq, they flourish, al-Qaida flourishes, because \nthey go to places where lawlessness reigns, where they can intimidate \npeople, and it allows them to move their agenda forward. Their agenda \nis pretty clear: Where moderation raises its dangerous head, lop it \noff.\n  The reason they have come to Iraq is because we went there; that is \npartly true. But the real reason they have come is they don't want the \npeople in Iraq to change course. It is not about us changing course. We \nhave changed course. The old strategy of sitting behind a wall and \ntraining and doing nothing else has been replaced by an aggressive \nstrategy of going out in the neighborhoods, finding the enemy, \nsuppressing the enemy, forming new alliances.\n  Let me tell you their strategy. They are very much on message. Where \nthey find moderation, they are going to go after it. If they can be \nperceived as having won in Iraq, then what happens to the world at \nlarge? Are we safer? The answer is no. What they will do then, by \ndestabilizing this attempt at democracy in Iraq, they will move the \nagenda to the Gulf Arab States, not because I say so but because they \nsay so. One of the big threats they see in the Mideast is the Gulf Arab \nStates engaging in the world through commerce and basically having a \ntolerant form of religion. The ultimate prize for al-Qaida is not only \nto create a caliphate in Baghdad that would dominate the region \nreligiously, it is to destroy Israel. I am not making this up. I am \njust regurgitating what they say.\n\n  The surge--the biggest change I have seen in Iraq has come in Anbar \nwhere literally 12,000 people have joined the police in 2007 at this \ndate versus 1,000 for the whole year 2006. The reason I am encouraged \nis that people again have broken away, and they have associated \nthemselves with a different way of living. They didn't like al-Qaida. \nThey are trying to start over again. We are giving them a chance to do \nso. The alliances in Anbar and Diyala that are being formed could be \nlong lasting to provide security.\n  The third conflict is with Iran. We passed a resolution not long \nago--I think it was last week--that was a damning indictment of Iran. \nThat resolution had a long list of activity that we unanimously \napproved to be happening. That activity was the Iranian Government, \nthrough the Kuds force, was actively involved in the IED business, \ntrying to provide materials to insurgents in Iraq to kill young \nAmericans in the most effective way possible. We have captured two \nbrothers who were responsible for kidnapping five Americans and \nexecuting them, and we have found from that capture that the resources \nto plan that attack came from Iran. It was a very sophisticated attack. \nThey had vehicles they made up to be like American vehicles. They had \nAmerican uniforms on. They went into a secure compound, got through the \nsecurity checks, went in, and captured five Americans working with \nIraqis that day, took them off. They were going to kidnap them, but it \nall went bad and they killed them. We found the two brothers in charge. \nThey have Shia connections. They are tied to the Iranian regime. They \nwere getting much of their support from the Kuds force in Iran, the \nRevolutionary Guard. That is another conflict.\n  The question for us is, If we said in July we are going to withdraw \nin May of 2008, if that were the statement to be made by the Senate by \nthe end of this week, I ask one question: If you were an al-Qaida \noperative fighting in Iraq, your life has been pretty miserable lately \nbecause Petraeus is all over you. We are killing them, capturing them, \nputting them on the run in a way never known before. That is why \nZawahiri last week issued a call for reinforcements, because he \nunderstands his force is under siege in Iraq and things are not going \nwell because the local people are beginning to turn on them. So he told \nhis al-Qaida brothers: Hang in there. The winds in Washington are \nblowing our way. Hang in there. Help is on the way.\n  I would argue as strongly as I know how that if the Senate did pass \nthe Levin-Reed amendment, which says within 120 days from now we are \ngoing to be withdrawing, that every al-Qaida operative who feels under \nsiege would have a tremendous boost in morale. It would be welcome news \nto al-Qaida in Iraq. The Senate has declared this war over militarily. \nWe are beginning to leave. You would say: Thank God, because right now \nyour life is miserable because of this new alliance we have formed and \nnew combat power we put on the ground.\n  To those who have sided with us in Anbar and other places, if you \nread in the newspaper the end of this week that the U.S. Senate \ndeclares withdrawal to begin in 120 days, all troops are out by May of \n2008, it would be, in my opinion, a heartbreaking event to read about \nbecause you would wonder: Now that I have chosen a new course and I \nhave openly stood against al-Qaida and Iranian involvement, what is \ngoing to happen to me and my family?\n  My good friend from Iowa has a different view of what happened in \nVietnam than I do. Just as sure as I am standing here, al-Qaida would \nbe emboldened if they heard we are going to withdraw beginning in 120 \ndays. They would believe they are back into the fight and if they could \njust hang in\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\nthere, this thing is going to turn around in their favor. For all those \nwho broke with al-Qaida and joined us, their biggest fears are they are \ngoing to get killed. And they will.\n\n  What would Iran say? Iran would look at America anew. They would \nbelieve, I think rightly so, that their strategy of a proxy war \nproduced dramatic results because what they have been able to achieve \nis that this experiment in tolerant democracy, with an Iraqi spin on \nit, failed.\n  Why is the Iranian Government trying to drive us out of Iraq? Why are \nthey helping extremists of all kinds defeat American forces? Why are \nthey trying to undermine the Maliki government? My belief is, they \nunderstand if a form of democracy emerges on their border in Iraq, it \nis this theocracy's worst nightmare. So they are doing what they are \ndoing for a reason. That reason, to me, is pretty obvious. They do not \nwant any democracy to emerge in their neighborhood because it is a \nthreat to the way they do business.\n  The reason al-Qaida goes to Iraq is they do not want moderation to \ntake off anywhere.\n  So I hope and literally pray we will give General Petraeus until \nSeptember to keep doing what he is doing, and that in September we will \nlook at the evidence presented to us about the successes and failures \nof the surge.\n  If you keep an open mind, here is what I think you find in July: The \nsurge has created a change in dynamic on the ground in Iraq beneficial \nto us and detrimental to al-Qaida, and that is undeniable. Does that \nmean all the problems in Iraq are over? No. The surge has not produced \npolitical reconciliation we hoped for. I do believe if we begin to \nwithdraw, political reconciliation that we hoped for is forever lost \nbecause people begin to make decisions based on when we leave and what \nis best for their family, not what is best for Iraq.\n  If we begin to leave now, in July--make a public announcement we are \nbeginning to leave--al-Qaida gets bolstered beyond belief. If we stay \nwhere we are in terms of a new strategy being implemented aggressively, \nI think by September the al-Qaida footprint in Iraq will be greatly \ndiminished, and those areas where they dominated will be easier to hold \nbecause the Iraqis have made a commitment to hold they never had \nbefore, and they will have the capacity to hold. If we will continue to \nallow this general and these new troops to do their job, al-Qaida is \nthe biggest loser. Simultaneously, we are going to have to push the \nMaliki government to do things they need to do.\n  If we continue to show strength, Iran will change their policy. If we \nshow weakness to Iran and al-Qaida, this war does not end, it gets \nbigger.\n  In conclusion, it is not about coming home. We all want them home as \nsoon as possible. It is not about heartbreak. We all share it. I have \nhad many parents come up to me who have lost children in Iraq or \nspouses and tell me: Please, do not let them die in vain. They believed \nthey could win. They believed in what they are doing. Give the rest of \nthem a chance to win. I have had people come up and say: I think my son \nor daughter, my husband or wife, died in vain. Don't let anyone else \ndie.\n  Senators Reed and Levin believe that by setting a date to withdraw \nnow, it will put pressure on the Iraqis to do things they have not yet \ndone. I understand that. They believe that without additional pressure, \nthe Iraqis will use us as a crutch. Fundamentally, I disagree with that \nconcept. I think if you say we are going to withdraw now, in 120 days, \nit does not pressure the Iraqi politicians to do things quicker. It \nensures they will never get done. It takes an enemy that is on the run \nand breathes new life into them. It takes an enemy called Iran and \nmakes them bolder.\n  The signal you are trying to send has more than one audience. If the \nSenate tries to send a signal in July that we are beginning to withdraw \nin 120 days, and we will be out by May of 2008, the signal will be \nreceived by this group al-Qaida: We can do this if we hang in there. \nAnd the signal will be received by those in Tehran: We are going to \ndrive America out. We have turned the corner when it comes to \ndestroying this new democracy in Iraq.\n  Every moderate force that broke from al-Qaida, which is trying to \nstand up to Iran will feel like: My God, what is going to happen to my \nfamily?\n  If we choose to allow the military to continue this successful \noperation, stand behind them without equivocation, listen to them in \nSeptember about what to do, I think we can build a security environment \nnever known before in Iraq, and I think our best hopes of securing that \nnation, so reconciliation will one day occur, are achieved.\n  It is not about your patriotism; it is not about feeling heartbroken \nfor those who have lost their lives. It is about how do you fight this \nwar with an enemy that knows no boundaries.\n  My last thought: There has been a formula that has existed since the \nbeginning of time that works. When people rear their ugly head and \nstart talking about their neighbor having no place on the planet, when \npeople start using religion as a way to dominate their neighbor, an \nexcuse to dominate their neighbor, when people openly talk about \ndestroying a particular ethnic group, or a particular race, or a \nparticular religion, when they start doing that in terms of words and \ndeeds, the rest of us who disagree need to stand up.\n  In the 1930s, too many people sat on the sidelines, ignoring the \ndangers of their time. The dangers of their time were Adolph Hitler and \npeople like him who had no place on the planet for people who they \nbelieved were ``racially inferior'' or different in terms of the way \nthey wanted to live their lives.\n  This enemy is saying things about fellow human beings that not only \nshould be rejected in words, should be rejected by action. The action I \nam looking for, when it comes to the al-Qaida agenda, is to destroy it, \nto use every military force we have to destroy it, to align ourselves \nwith people who reject it, and see this thing through.\n  God bless.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan and I wish to \ntake a couple minutes while we make a unanimous consent request: that \nat least the majority leader's time will be from 10:50 to 11 a.m.; from \n10:40 to 10:50 will be for the Republican leader; 10:30 to 10:40 will \nbe for the chairman of the committee; and 10:20 to 10:30 will be \nallocated to me. I ask unanimous consent that be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think that is precisely what has been \ntyped up, and that is our intent, that those last four 10-minute slots \nbe allocated in the way the Senator from Arizona has proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, finally, could I point out, during the \nentire night we have been basically going back and forth on both sides \nof the issue. I think all Senators who sought recognition were able to \nspeak sometime during the night. I hope we would be able to continue \ngoing back and forth, unless there is a lack of speakers on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, has that previous unanimous consent request \nbeen adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not yet been adopted.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida addressed the Chair.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand now the Senator from Florida \nis seeking recognition; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on this side, \nfollowing the Senator from Florida, Senator Bingaman be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Lautenberg be recognized on this side--just \non this side.\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, and reserving the \nright to object, I would hope my colleagues would recognize that gives \nus an hour and 10 minutes until the unanimous consent agreement kicks \nin. I know there are additional speakers on both sides to take up that \ntime. So I hope they would be economical with their views.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I advise my colleague from \nMichigan that I believe the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nwas here planning to speak before I spoke. So on the Democratic side it \nwould be Senator Nelson, and then Senator Lautenberg, and then myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bingaman for that. I was \nnot aware of that. Let me revise the unanimous consent request. Before \nI do so, in light of what Senator McCain has said, let me inquire of \nthe Democrats--I say to Senator Lautenberg, if you could stay here for \n1 minute. I am wondering if the Senator from Florida could give us an \nidea of the amount of time he needs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Whatever is the pleasure of my chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Should we say up to 10 minutes each?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Given the number of speakers, if I could say, I think \nmaybe 10 minutes maximum, and I would add to that unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Craig and Senator Chambliss be added on this side \nin rotation. I think up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Well, I wanted to do like so many, to speak much \nearlier. Six a.m. was the time I had reserved, and it was believed then \nthat we would have two or three people to fill an hour. I would like 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me now revise the unanimous consent \nrequest in this way: that Senator Nelson be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes, that Senator Lautenberg be recognized for up to 15 minutes, \nthat Senator Bingaman be recognized for up to 10 minutes on this side, \nwith alternating to the other side.\n  I say to the Senator I think that would leave 35 minutes to be \nallocated on your side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on this side, I ask unanimous consent to \nadd to that unanimous consent request that 10 minutes each be allocated \nto Senators Craig, Chambliss, and Cornyn. I think given the spillover, \nthat probably will take up the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as I had listened to some of the debate, I wondered: \nDo we not have the ability with a significant majority in the Senate to \ncome together on the differences that have divided us over the course \nof this debate throughout the evening? I think we do, if we would take \noff our partisan hats, if we would take off our ideological hats.\n  It is clear where the American people are. It is a truth you cannot \nsustain a war unless you have the support of the American people.\n  This impression is not only seared into me as a result of the reading \nof history, but it was clearly the case when I had the privilege of \nwearing the uniform of the country as a lieutenant and as a captain. It \nwas during the Vietnam era. That was clearly a time in which the people \nof the country were split. The big difference then and now, in the \ntreatment of the troops, is that everybody in the country supports our \ntroops, and every Senator does, and we are amazed at their bravery, and \nwe stand up and repeat that over and over. That was not the case back \nin Vietnam. That was not the case, where returning troops, \nunbelievably, sometimes, were spit upon. But that is not the case now.\n  The question is, how do you keep a bad situation from getting worse? \nAnd the question is not whether we support the troops; we do. It is the \nquestion: What is the policy set by the Government of the United States \nthat those troops ought to be carrying out? How do we bring some kind \nof success out of a very bad situation?\n  Now, the rhetoric has been hot, and it has been intense, and it has \nbeen polarizing. The Levin-Reed amendment has been characterized as \nthough we are going to pick up and walk out of Iraq. That is not what \nthe Levin-Reed amendment says. It says we are going to start a process \nof withdrawal, but troops are going to stay in Iraq to go after al-\nQaida--which is clearly there now as a result of us having been there \nfor the last 4 years--to go after al-Qaida, to provide force protection \nfor the Americans who are there--which would also mean providing border \nprotection--and to train the Iraqi Army. That is not a pack up and \nwithdraw. The philosophy of the Levin-Reed amendment, which this \nSenator supports--and last Friday I gave the history of how I have come \nthrough all of these votes since that vote in the fall of 2002 to \nauthorize the President to expend moneys for prosecuting a war--the \nquestion for us has been, how do we bring some success?\n  Now, in fact, we look at this as if Iraq is monolithic. It is not. It \nis many different things. It is a concentration of Kurds in the north, \na concentration of Sunnis, and some mixture with Shiites, in the \nmiddle, and a concentration of Shiites in the south. We are having \nsuccess with the surge in the western province of al-Anbar, but that is \nbecause it is primarily Sunni, and that is because the real enemy there \nis al-Qaida. Indeed, the surge of the Marines is having success, slowly \nbut having success.\n  But remember, Iraq is many things and many faces. That is not the \ncase in Baghdad because in Baghdad what you have is a sectarian warfare \nthat has been going on for 1,327 years between Sunnis and Shiites that \nhas, in effect, become a civil war.\n  When Senator Coleman and I were in Baghdad meeting with the foreign \nnational security adviser, Dr. al-Rubaie, before Christmas, he said: \nThis not a sectarian war. This is Baathists trying to take back over \ntheir control.\n  We could not believe he would make that statement when it was so \nobvious, and it has been so obvious, that it is Sunnis on Shiites and \nShiites on Sunnis, and some Shiites on Shiites, and some Sunnis on \nSunnis.\n  In the middle of that chaos of a civil war, a surge may have a \ntemporary appearance, but at the end of the day, it is not going to \nwork. A surge will work in Anbar.\n\n  So let's be clear that when people make extreme statements, what we \nare talking about is a very complicated situation.\n  Now, do we think we are going to continue to be full bore in Iraq in \nanother 2 years, another 3 years? Do we really think the American \npeople are going to put up with that? No. The Levin-Reed amendment, \nwhich this Senator supports--and it took me a long time to get here, \nMr. President--is a recognition of the practicality on the ground: \nwithdrawing ourselves from the middle of a crossfire of a civil war \nand, instead, consolidating our positions to train the Iraqi Army, to \ncontinue to go after al-Qaida, and to provide force protection.\n  So at the end of the day, we can all get together. You can probably \nhave two-thirds of the Senate all coming together. One particular \napproach is we ought to be doing it around the Levin-Reed amendment, \nbut it doesn't look as if we are going to. Later on down the road, the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Colorado, and I are cosponsors of \nanother kind of amendment around which people could consolidate and \nunite. Sooner or later, we all are going to have to come together.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair notify me when I \nhave 1 minute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I begin today by saying that I oppose \nthe Levin-Reed amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I \noppose the\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\namendment for three important reasons: First of all, I believe the \namendment unconstitutionally usurps the power of the Commander in \nChief. Secondly, the amendment tells our enemies when they can take \nover in Iraq. Thirdly, the amendment is the wrong approach at the wrong \ntime.\n  Also, I wish to focus on what we are missing by spending unnecessary \ntime last night and today debating this amendment. We have had a \nDefense bill pending before the Senate now for a week and a half and \nhave yet to discuss this bill in substance.\n  The bill which we have yet to make any real progress on does the \nfollowing things for our men and women in uniform: First of all, it \nauthorizes a 3.5-percent pay raise for our men and women in the armed \nforces. It authorizes additional tools for combating post-traumatic \nstress disorder and traumatic brain injury and provides improved health \ncare benefits for our injured warriors. It takes new steps to recognize \nthe contributions of our Reserve Forces through increased retirement \nbenefits and robust reintegration programs. It tightens our acquisition \nprocesses, our contracting policies, and increases benefits to our \ncivilian personnel. It increases the amount of leave our military \npersonnel can carry over, a provision which DOD strongly advocates as a \nway to increase the morale of our troops. It authorizes $4 billion for \nmine-resistant vehicles and critical MRAP vehicles that we need so \ndesperately to protect our men and women. It authorizes $135 billion \nfor allowances, bonuses, death benefits, and permanent change of \nstation moves. It authorizes payment of over 25 types of bonuses and \nspecial pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, reenlistment, and \ncontinued service by Active-Duty as well as Reserve military personnel. \nIt fully funds the President's budget request for the Army's future \ncombat systems and adds $90 million for the Armed Robotic Vehicles. It \nauthorizes $775.1 million for reactive armor.\n  I could go on for a long time cataloging the good things in this bill \nthat we are not talking about. We are not focusing on them because of \nthe time we have spent yesterday, last night, as well as today, \nfocusing on this amendment, which we could have dealt with several days \nago. This side of the aisle has been prepared to vote and we have been \nasking for that vote, yet that vote has not taken place.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind the people who are on the \nreceiving end of the decisions we make and the votes we take in this \nbody; that is, the American soldier, sailor, airman, and marine who is \nout there doing what we have asked them to do in service to our \ncountry.\n  I appreciate the comments last night of the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman, regarding my good friend, General Lynch, who commands \nthe 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA, and Task Force Marne in \nBaghdad. General Lynch and his troops are in harm's way as we speak--\nright now--executing the duties and the responsibilities the American \npeople have asked of them. General Lynch recently commented that the \naddition of thousands more surge troops in the recent weeks has enabled \nhim to clear insurgents in 70 percent of his territory south of \nBaghdad. I would like to share a few of General Lynch's comments \nregarding his mission and the work in which his troops are involved.\n  Regarding the effects of ceasing the current strategy now in place, \nGeneral Lynch has said the following:\n\n       You'd find the enemy regaining ground, reestablishing \n     sanctuary, building more roadside bombs, and the violence \n     would escalate. It would be a mess.\n\n  Regarding the current mindset of the Iraqi people that he encounters, \nGeneral Lynch has said:\n\n       What they are worried about is our leaving, and our answer \n     is: ``We're staying.''\n\n  Regarding our need to stay and keep doing what we are doing, General \nLynch has said the following:\n\n       We need these surge forces. They came in for a reason. They \n     are being used for the reason they were sent to be used for.\n\n  These comments by General Lynch and the perspective he shares from \nIraq is that it would be a mistake to give up on the President's \nstrategy now. That is why I oppose the Levin- Reed amendment.\n  Months ago, some in the media declared Al Anbar Province lost. Ramadi \nwas declared by AQI--al-Qaida in Iraq--as the capital of AQI. Today, it \nis clear that they were wrong and that the President's new strategy has \neffectively turned Al Anbar around.\n  I was in Al Anbar 2 months ago, and I have to say I was significantly \nimpressed by the job General Gaskins and his folks are doing. We were \nable to take a convoy ride to the middle of downtown Ramadi. We were in \na safe and secure setting for the first time in years, in that \ncommunity. We saw children returning to schools. We saw markets open. \nWe saw people walking on the streets for the first time in years. \nPeople now felt safe and secure because al-Qaida has now been cleared \nout of Ramadi and out of virtually every inch of Al Anbar Province. The \nsurge is working in Al Anbar Province and in the self-declared capital \nof al-Qaida.\n  The last elements of the troop increase that the President proposed \nback in January became operational in Iraq on June 15. Let me quote \nretired Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Jack Keane, who has been \ncritical in the right ways and positive as well as other ways about \nIraq--a good man, a good soldier. Here is what he said:\n\n       It is my judgment the security situation is making steady, \n     deliberate progress and it will continue to make progress as \n     we go on through the rest of the summer and into the fall. \n     The thought of pulling out now or pulling out in a couple of \n     months makes no sense militarily in terms of what we are \n     trying to achieve, and that is providing security and \n     stability for Iraq so that we can make some political \n     progress.\n\n  If there is one strategy that does not make sense at this point \neither militarily or politically, it is signaling to the enemy, during \na time when we are making early progress in establishing security and \nlaying the grounds for reconciliation, that we are leaving and that \nthey can have the country. This is an extremely ill-advised approach \nfor which the United States, the Middle East, and especially the Iraqi \npeople will pay dearly for decades to come.\n  I have never been more convinced that waiting for General Petraeus's \nreport in September was more right than yesterday afternoon when two \nyoung Georgia veterans, Tripp Bellard and Ruben Maestre, visited my \noffice. I wish every Member of this body could have heard the passion \nand the emotion and the strength in their voices. Their resolve was \nclear, yet they were humble and forceful at the same time. I say to my \ncolleagues, these men implored me to speak out. They said that America \nneeded unwavering leadership now more than ever. They could not have \nbeen more clear when they said that pulling out of Iraq now would mean \nchaos and would have implications for our troops and for the Nation \nthat would be beyond horrific. These were men who had been deployed to \nIraq more than once and not for a few months. These were men who have \nbeen on the ground and who fervently echoed what I have heard without \nexception on every single trip I have taken to Iraq, from my first trip \nseveral years ago to my last one just 2 months ago. I have heard it \nfrom privates, and I have heard it from generals--that we must not \nleave prematurely and that we must not act prematurely.\n  I wish to relate another anecdote about a conversation I had with a \nyoung female Army soldier. I had lunch with her in Ramadi. She is a \nGeorgian with whom I had a very delightful conversation about a number \nof issues. But I asked her: Why in the world did you join the Army 3\\1/\n2\\ years ago in the face of the ongoing conflict in Iraq? She said: \nSenator, my life was not--I was not accomplishing in my life what I \nwanted to accomplish. I needed to head in a different direction. I felt \nlike serving my country was something that I could do. She then said: \nSenator, I signed up in the face of Iraq knowing that I would go to \nIraq. This is not my first trip to Iraq; it is my second tour of duty \nin Iraq. I know I am here for the right reason. I know the mission we \nhave to accomplish. I am prepared to accomplish that mission because it \nis necessary and it is the right thing to do. As I visit with the \npeople of Iraq here in the streets of Ramadi on a daily basis, I am \nreminded of what freedom is all about.\n  Boy, you talk about emotion. You talk about a great young American. \nThose folks are truly great Americans.\n  There is no better commentary on the status in Iraq than the men and\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\nwomen who are on the ground, and they are all telling us loudly and \nclearly that now is not the time to leave, nor is it the time to judge \nthe strategy. The right time to evaluate the strategy is September, and \nthe right time to give our forces what they deserve, by passing the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am sure that what is taking place on \nthe floor of the Senate must present a terribly confusing picture to \nthe American people. It is hard to understand even being here, with \ncolleagues shouting their support for the American troops while they \ninject that what they need is an injection of truth serum for the vote. \nThen it will be plain and simple to see where they are, those who are \nopposing a direct vote, an up-or-down, as we call it, to take place, \nand that will answer the question: Do you want our soldiers, airmen, \nseamen, and marines returned home, as the American people are \ndemanding? I remind our friends that the obligation is to get our \npeople back to their families as soon as possible.\n  Outside my office, I pay respect to America's lost soldiers, our \ncasualties of war, in a display called the ``Faces of the Fallen.'' It \ngives a picture and some background of the soldiers who gave their \nlives in this ill-conceived and seemingly endless war in Iraq. Every \nday, families, friends, and visitors search through thousands of photos \nlooking to see if there are people they know, while they try to \ncomprehend the human cost of this war to parents, spouses, children, \nsiblings, and friends across our country.\n  Four years and 4 months have passed since President Bush sent young \nAmerican men and women to fight in a war based on faulty intelligence \nand incomplete information about an enemy and the scope of this \nferocious conflict. Now 160,000 American men and women are mired in a \ncivil war in Iraq, facing thousands of insurgents willing to die \nthemselves while they try to kill any American they can find.\n\n  Mr. President, 3,613 brave American souls will never again sit at a \nfamily table, play with their children, or return to their jobs and \ntheir communities. Ninety-one of those men and women came from New \nJersey. They set their boots on the ground in Iraq never expecting they \nwould not put them back on American soil again. Now their faces and \ntheir stories live on only in our memories.\n  But the solemn story those numbers tell does not stop there. Nearly \n27,000 troops have left combat with wounds to their body. More than 800 \nof them have lost limbs or sight or other senses. Many more have left \nwith their minds totally impaired. More than 30,000 soldiers now live \nwith post-traumatic stress disorder or brain injuries, robbing them of \nthe ability to think clearly or perform tasks that once came easily. \nThey put themselves in the line of fire and fought to give the \nPresident's policy a chance, but the policy has failed.\n  It was more than 3 years ago that the President, in military dress, \nstaged on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, proudly \ndeclared ``mission accomplished.'' Mission accomplished? A declaration \nof victory in millions of American minds? How casual. How cruel. How \ninept. The President did this without hesitation or pause or the idea \nof the cost soldiers would come to endure in the future and the \nhellfire they would face. There were 139 American soldiers who had died \nby that date, by the day that ``mission accomplished'' was declared. \nCompare that with today's count, which stands above 3,600. Mr. \nPresident, 139 American soldiers then--``mission accomplished''--and \nnow the death toll is over 3,600. ``Mission accomplished''--a show of \ngrandeur, a curtain of disaster, misleading, and I don't know if the \nPresident really understood what was taking place in front of his eyes.\n  Today, the President continues to use statements that defy reality. \nVice President Cheney joined in. He said in those times, ``We will be \ngreeted as liberators with sweets and treats,'' with not a hint of \nintelligence available before that. Today, the President continues to \nuse statements that defy reality. We have to look back a little bit to \nsee when Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said this war could last 6 days, \n6 weeks, perhaps, I doubt, 6 months. He said that in February of 2003, \na month before the invasion. What were they thinking? It is hard to \nunderstand. They were getting intelligence. They had the best \ninformation available, and they didn't use it.\n  Just last week, the President said:\n\n       The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq \n     were the ones who attacked us in America on September 11th.\n\n  This statement smacks of the same careless rhetoric we heard 4 years \nago. The most frightening part about that statement is either President \nBush actually believes what he is saying, doesn't bother to check, or \nis he deliberately distracting the American people?\n  The fact is that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida attacked us on 9/11 and \nIraq had nothing to do with the tragedy of 9/11. The Defense \nDepartment's own inspector general confirmed this past February that \nthe Saddam Hussein regime was not directly cooperating with al-Qaida \nbefore the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Has the President forgotten about \nOsama bin Laden, the man responsible for inflicting those wounds on the \nvictims, their families, and this country? The war with al-Qaida and \nthe hunt for Osama bin Laden began and continues outside of Iraq. Yet \nOsama bin Laden is still at large, and al-Qaida has become stronger as \na result of President Bush's failed policies.\n  This administration took its eye off the ball. Instead of capturing \nor killing Osama bin Laden, we are stuck in the middle of a civil war \nin Iraq with ever-escalating American casualties. That is why some of \nus in this Congress believe deep in our minds and in our souls that \nthis carnage must end and we have to fight to bring our troops home \nfrom Iraq. We are fighting with our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who are giving us reasons to continue with the surge and continue \nwith the exposure in harm's way of our brave men and women.\n\n  Millions of Americans are begging us for a change of course. They are \ntired of having their sons and daughters coming home in flag-covered \ncoffins--coffins that are hidden from the public eye by order of the \nPentagon. They don't even let pictures be taken of those flag-draped \ncoffins showing the honor that is bestowed upon the person in that \ncoffin.\n  The American people want Congress to step in and start to bring our \ntroops home in a responsible way. The amendment by Senators Levin and \nReed would do just that. It would begin to redeploy our troops out of \nIraq within 120 days and remove all combat troops by the end of April \nof next year. Some American forces would remain to perform \ncounterterrorism operations, protect U.S. personnel, and to train Iraqi \nforces.\n  This amendment reflects the will of the American people, and it is a \nresponsible way to phase our troops out of the civil war in Iraq. But \ninstead of having a vote to decide where a majority of the Congress \nstands, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are standing in \nthe way. They are resorting to process to keep us from having a vote so \nthat the American people can see very clearly where we each stand on \nthis issue. So we stayed here all night. That is not much of a \nsacrifice; that is not much when you consider our people in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Soon, every Senator will go on record, and their constituents will \nknow whether they want to continue the President's failed policy or are \nthey looking for a new, brighter day, a chance to bring our people back \nto their families?\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side have called for change. If \nyou look at recent votes, seven of them had the courage to stand with \nthe Democrats and say: Yes, we agree that this conflict has gone on \nlong enough and we ought to start doing something to bring them home. \nBut with the President dug in on staying the course, saying the right \nthing is not enough. Change will only come with a vote.\n  So I ask my colleagues to stand up and support the Levin-Reed \namendment so we can begin to bring our men and women home. Let the \nAmerican people hear our sincerity, and they will when they see \nprocedural attempts to hide this vote and obstruct the return.\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nThe slogan they are using is ``cut and run.'' The result would be \n``stay and die.''\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand in front of a desk in which a \nformer Idaho senator by the name of William E. Borah stood. He was \nrenowned for a variety of things after the turn of the 19th into the \n20th century. He was an outspoken isolationist and opposed Woodrow \nWilson and led the battle to destroy the League of Nations. He was \nsuccessful. We never joined the League of Nations. America came home \nfrom World War I, pulled up its bridges and it remained a relatively \nisolated island in a world until World War II.\n  We know times have changed. We also know that great debates about \nforeign policy have occurred on the floor of the Senate down through \nthe centuries. We have had a very valuable debate over the last 24 \nhours in large part about foreign policy but in a surprising way about \nmilitary tactics.\n  There is one role that we play here in the United States Senate and \nthat role is a political role, it is not a military role. Not 535 \ngenerals. There are a few of us--I'm not one of those--who've had \nextensive military experience and who might have the kind of strategic \nknowledge necessary to make decisions that are general--that our \ngenerals could and are making on the field at this moment. But I am \nalways suprised when we decide to become tacticians, when we decide to \nuse the floor of the United States Senate as a command center, when we \nmeet in secret rooms around the Capitol to decide how troop movements \nout to happen and what the rules of engagement ought to be. No, we \nshouldn't be playing that role. That's why when we confirmed General \nPetraeus unanimously in the Senate, we said to him very clearly, you go \nto Iraq in relation to a surge that is being implemented and you come \nback to us and give us your honest and fair assesement in September.\n  So why then the last 24 hours have we been deciding or trying to \nprejudge Petraeus, to jump in front of him acting like the general that \nhe is and the general who is on the ground in Baghdad as we speak? It \nis raw politics. That's what it is all about. And that's what you have \nseen played out here in the last 24 hours. Now, I would be the first to \ntell you that good politics sometimes doesn't produce good policy, \nespecially if you're reacting at the moment--if you are reacting at a \nsnapshot of a polling data where the American people are reacting \nbecause they have been fed information instantly about something that \nmay or may not be true in the broader perspective.\n  But that's what we're doing here, and that's what we do best. But let \nme suggest that sometimes good policy--so why then the last 24 hours \nhave we been deciding or trying to prejudge Petraeus, to jump in front \nof him acting like the general that he is and the general who is on the \nground in Baghdad as we speak? It is raw politics. That's what it is \nall about. And that's what you have seen played out here in the last 24 \nhours. Now, I would be the first to tell you that good politics \nsometimes doesn't produce good policy, especially if you're reacting at \nthe moment--if you're reacting at a snapshot of a polling data where \nthe American people are reacting because they have been fed information \ninstantly about something that may or may not be true in the broader \nperspective.\n  But that is what we're doing here, and that is what we do best. But \nlet me suggest that sometimes good policy--good politics does not in \nthe long term produce good policy. It is with that point in mind that I \nhope that the Levin-Reed Amendment goes down that it doesn't gain the \nnecessary votes to proceed to a final vote.\n  We ought to be focused on the content of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and all that it means to our country and to our \nveterans because of a variety of key amendments that have been placed \nin this very important document. And I think that America, if they've \nbeen watching C-SPAN for the last 24 hours have not heard one word or \nvery few words about the embodiment of this bill and its value and what \nit will do to the long-term stability of our military and the care of \nour veterans.\n  I was once chair. I am now Ranking Member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee and Senator Akaka and I have put a very large and valuable \namendment in there that deals with traumatic brain injury and the \nextension of eligibility of the eligibility of care as we work to \ncreate a seamless environment between men and women coming out of our \narmed services and becoming veterans and becoming eligible for the care \nthat our Veterans Administration can provide for them. Mental health \nevaluations, trying to get ahead of traumatic brain injury that may not \nmanifest itself for months and years after men and women come out of \nthe armed services. Dental care for our returning service members and \nhomeless programs and all other kinds of things are embodied in this \nvery important legislation.\n  So, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you have had \nyour 24 hours of politics. Now I hope we can have a vote, move on, and \nget to the final passage of the Defense Authorization Act that is so \nimportant to our country in the short term and in the long term, and I \nwould hope that this Senate shows some consistency in what we do, and \nthat consistency would be to wait until September in what I think will \nbe a fair and honest and factual evaluation by General Petraeus as to \nthe situation, the current environment and the future in Iraq. And at \nthat time, as a United States Senator representing the State of Idaho, \nI am prepared to make decisions that are different than those today as \nit relates to our involvement in Iraq, if the facts so demonstrate it.\n  General Petraeus has a lot of credibility, not only with this \nCongress but with the American people and the polls are showing that. \nWhile Americans are very frustrated over the war in Iraq, they don't \nwant to cut and run at this moment, and that's what Levin-Reed is all \nabout, cutting and running.\n  And what happens if we do that? What happens if we don't find a \nstrategic way out? It is important that we put ourselves in perspective \nof the world that involves Iraq and its surrounding neighbors. You have \nheard a lot of rhetoric about the instability, about the role of Iran \nand certainly what's going on in the north here with the Kurdish \npopulation and what Turkey is doing, amassing troops along this border. \nYou've heard about what's going on in Lebanon and certainly the \ntraumatic reality that is happening there. Premature withdrawal from \nIraq would risk, I believe, plunging this--that Nation into chaos which \ncould spill over its borders into the gulf region that you see here.\n  Iran, which is a threat to vital U.S. interests and continues to \nprovide lethal support to Shia militants who target and kill U.S. \ntroops and innocent Iraqis, would exploit our premature departure to \ndominate and control much of -Iraq. Here they are, a very large nation \nwith very powerful forces and resources, just waiting for the \nopportunity to fulfill their historic Persian vision of the region.\n  Tehran's terrorist proxy to Hezbollah continues to foment in \ninstability in Lebanon. They've already leapfrogged Iraq. They're over \nhere, creating tremendous influence in that region. Hamas, another Iran \nproxy, continues to kill and maim innocent Israelis and Palestinians \nand is attempting to establish a jihadist state in the Gaza.\n  Here we are--another leapfrog over Iraq. Iraq is simply in the way of \nIran. It's quite plain. It's quite simple. And it is very visual when \nyou look at the map. And without some stability in Iran--in Iraq, the \nability of it to control itself and its borders, the ability to govern \nitself, the reality of what could happen in the region is in fact \ndramatic consequences, a collapse, a major war within the region, not \nonly a civil war within Iraq but the ability of Iran and Syria to \nexploit the situation that would occur there. Tehran would extend its \ndestabilizing activities to another very important part of the region--\nKuwait--and the oil-rich regions of eastern Saudi Arabia along this \nborder here, one of the larger producing oilfields in the region and \nthe kingdom could well fall. And those are the realities we face at \nthis moment that I think few want to talk about. Let's talk about \nanother consequence.\n  I will put the balance of my statement in the record. But the other \nconsequence, Mr. President, that we've not\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\ntalked about is what happens when 54 percent of the world's oil supply \ngoes to risk with a collapse of the region. And this is a reality check \nthat we only talk about in hushed terms, because we don't like to talk \nabout our dependency on a part of the world that is so unstable. With \nthose thoughts, I yield the floor.\n  What happens to the world energy supply if Iran does gain more \ncontrol in the Middle East? What are the realities of the consequences \nof an Iran that possibly could gain control over 54% of the world \nenergy supply? They could place a choke hold over the Strait of Hormuz \nand possibly in sea lanes in the region, severely limiting the supply \nof oil to the world market. That is not just a reality that the United \nStates must face, but a reality for the world. I have worked very hard \nwith my colleagues to lessen the U.S. dependence on foreign oil. \nHowever, we are not yet capable of raising production in the United \nStates because we have been blocked by the other side of the aisle from \ndoing so. Therefore, a premature withdrawal from Iraq could have dire \nconsequences with our economy and energy supply; but would also have \nthe same effects on the world economy.\n  The facts are, Mr. President, that the war we are fighting in Iraq \nhas serious and real national security implications and we cannot \nprejudge our best and brightest military commanders by playing politics \nwith their duties and best judgement. We should not preempt General \nPetraeus's progress report coming in September and I hope that the \nSenate will go on record today as saying we are not a body of generals, \nwe do not know best how to conduct a war and determine how many troops \nit will take to secure Iraq. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nvoting down Levin-Reed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in October 2002, this Chamber gathered \nto consider one of the most serious decisions I have been involved in \nconfronting in the 25 years I have been in the Senate. That was a \ndecision on whether to grant President Bush authority to invade Iraq. \nAt that time, nearly 5 years ago, I opposed the invasion of Iraq, \nbelieving that it was necessary to give the United Nations weapons \ninspectors the time they needed to determine whether Iraq did, in fact, \npossess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. I believe that we \nneeded to gather the facts and we needed to make an informed decision \nas to whether Iraq posed such a terrible and immediate threat to our \ncountry that regime change was warranted. As we all know now, the \nweapons of mass destruction were nowhere to be found.\n  Unfortunately, the weapons of mass destruction were not the only \nthing the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and \nother members of the administration were wrong about when it came to \nbeginning this war. They were also wrong in thinking that we could \nsucceed in Iraq without substantial help from our allies. They were \nwrong to reject warnings that the invasion would fracture Iraq's \ndelicate sectarian balance. They were wrong to dismiss legitimate \nquestions about how we would rebuild Iraq's civil society. They were \nwrong to think that Iraq's neighbors, Iran and Saudi Arabia, in \nparticular, would ignore their opportunity to fill a regional power \nvacuum after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime. They were wrong \nto promise the American people, as Secretary Rumsfeld's assistant, Ken \nAdelman, did, that Iraq would be a ``cakewalk.''\n  My statement at that time, nearly 5 years ago, was the following:\n\n       If war must be waged, other countries should be there with \n     us sharing the costs and helping to restore stability in what \n     will almost certainly be the tumultuous aftermath of military \n     action.\n\n  Mr. President, ``tumultuous'' only begins to describe the calamity we \nface in Iraq today. Almost 5 years have passed since that October day. \nFive years is longer than it took Presidents Roosevelt and Truman to \ndefeat the Axis Powers in World War II.\n  Today, Iraq is diverting the United States from other very important \nforeign policy matters. First, of course, it is diverting us from the \nfight against terrorist networks worldwide. Second, it is diverting us \nfrom responding to the rise of China as a world power. Third, it is \ndiverting us from reducing our dependence upon fossil fuels and \nparticularly lessening our dependence on foreign sources of energy. \nFourth, it is diverting us from keeping our country economically \ncompetitive during this era of globalization.\n  Respect for America around the world has eroded dramatically as a \nresult of this war. To many around the world, the symbol of our country \ntoday is no longer the Statue of Liberty; instead, it is Abu Ghraib.\n  President Bush and Vice President Cheney often tell us that we are in \nIraq to fight the terrorists who attacked us on September 11.\n  In his 2003 State of the Union speech, the President told us that \nSaddam ``aids and protects'' terrorists, including members of al-Qaida.\n  In 2004, the Vice President promised ``ample evidence confirming the \nlink . . . between al-Qaida and the Iraqi intelligence services.''\n  In 2005, the President said:\n\n       They are trying to shake our will in Iraq, just as they \n     tried to shake our will on September 11.\n\n  In March, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       Iraq's relevance to the war on terror simply could not be \n     more plain. . . . As we get farther away from 9/11, I believe \n     there is a temptation to forget the urgency of the task that \n     came to us that day.\n\n  Just last week, as many speakers have reiterated, President Bush \nsaid:\n\n       The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq \n     were the ones who attacked us in America on September 11th.\n\n  So the administration has been consistent in its formulation of this \nproblem. The truth is, Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11. He \ndid not support al-Qaida before September 11, and al-Qaida had no \npresence in Iraq prior to that date. Saddam Hussein was a brutal \ndictator, but his regime posed little immediate threat to the United \nStates or its allies. The Baath party, as a secular Arab nationalist \nmovement, had no history of cooperation with al-Qaida or other Islamist \nmovements.\n\n  The truth is that al-Qaida's offshoot, al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, is in \nIraq today because of our decision to invade. As the Washington Post \npointed out recently, al-Qaida in Mesopotamia is an Iraqi phenomenon. \nIts membership is largely Iraqi. It derives its primary financing \nindigenously from kidnappings and other criminal activities. And those \nterrorists and would-be terrorists who have come to Iraq from other \ncountries would not have been there absent this conflict.\n  Al-Qaida in Mesopotamia thrives over Sunni grievances over our \noccupation of that country. Our continued occupation of that country is \nits best recruiting tool.\n  President Bush has treated terrorism as a monolith. As David \nKilcullen, a counterterrorism analyst, has written, the President has \nlumped together all terrorism, all rogue states, all strategic \ncompetitors.\n  Lumping every dangerous terrorist movement together profoundly \nmisconstrues the nature of terrorism and, in fact, encourages eclectic \ngroups to collaborate. It places our Nation in greater jeopardy, not \nless jeopardy.\n  So the question today is, where do we go from here?\n  The fundamental problem in Iraq today is not a lack of U.S. troops; \nit is an absence of national reconciliation. The U.S. role in Iraq \nshould not be to police an endless civil war. Rather, it should be to \nfacilitate a settlement among the parties themselves.\n  The President has belatedly realized that we did not marshal enough \ntroops to stabilize Iraq following our invasion in 2002. But today, \nmerely adding troops is not the solution. The administration's ongoing \ntroop surge is unlikely to prove effective absent a broader political \nsettlement.\n  If current trends continue, our policy will be, de facto, one of \nsiding with the Shia over the Sunnis. The Shia-led government knows \nthis. It has, therefore, played for time by clinging to the status quo, \nby dragging its feet on national reconciliation. The Shia-led \ngovernment has shown little sign that it appreciates the need for \naccommodation of national minorities. It has missed the most important \nmilestones that have been identified by the Iraq Study Group and by \nthis Congress.\n  The administration's own benchmark report released several days ago \nreports unsatisfactory progress on debaathification, on passage of an \noil law, on holding provincial elections, on disarming militias. The \nIraqi Constitutional Review Commission has failed to make adequate \nprogress.\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\n  There has been progress on other benchmarks. I welcome that progress. \nBut these were second-order issues compared to the challenge of \nnational reconciliation. And the bloodshed continues.\n  Going forward we need to focus on two objectives.\n  First, we need to send the Iraqi ruling elite a crisp and credible \nsignal that our commitment to maintaining forces in that country is not \nunconditional. Only by making this point loud and clear do we create \nthe possibility that the Shia-led government will take the painful \nsteps necessary toward national reconciliation.\n  The U.S. has a moral responsibility to do what it can to create a \ndegree of political stability in Iraq. But I repeat the key phrase in \nthat sentence, ``do what we can,'' for we can do no more.\n  Our commitment to Iraq is not openended. We cannot impose a political \nsettlement without the cooperation of the political elites in the \ncountry. The Iraqis themselves must want a solution.\n  Second, we need to draw down U.S. troop presence in a responsible \nway. Too precipitous a withdrawal will undermine the credibility of \nAmerica's commitment to facilitating a political settlement in the \ncountry. We need to provide a carrot by allowing for the continued \npresence of U.S. forces in a peacekeeping capacity if the Iraqi \nGovernment does bring about some measure of national reconciliation.\n  It is because of these two principles that I supported the first \nsupplemental appropriation this spring. That legislation set a firm \ndate for beginning withdrawal. That was the stick.\n  It set a date for completing withdrawal. This arrangement left open \nthe possibility of leaving some U.S. peacekeepers in Iraq if, \nultimately, the factions forged a political settlement. That was the \ncarrot.\n  This approach remains sound today. And today, with these objectives, \nin mind, I would urge five steps that we must take in Iraq.\n  First, we need to announce a firm deadline to begin a drawdown of \nU.S. troops from Iraq.\n  The credible threat of a withdrawal, perhaps more than withdrawal \nitself, may convince the Iraqi ruling elite of the need to accommodate \nnational minorities. The mere threat of a withdrawal says that our \ncommitment to Iraq is not unconditional. It proclaims that we will not \npreserve the failed status quo.\n  I applaud my colleagues, such as Senator Levin, Senator Reed and \nSenator Feingold, for fighting for a firm deadline. They may disagree \non the specifics of withdrawal.\n  But they do agree that if they do not continue to push for a firm \ntimetable, the Bush administration will cling to that failed status \nquo.\n  The fact that the administration is even considering alternatives is \na direct result of our decision to push for some change in direction by \na specific date.\n  Second, we must form a multinational working group to discuss the way \nforward in Iraq.\n  It is crucial for Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to be involved. They \nhave historical and religious links to national minorities in Iraq. \nThey have the most to lose by continued instability there. We cannot \nachieve any political settlement in Iraq without their active \nparticipation.\n  Third, this group--not the Iraqi Government--should convene a Dayton-\nstyle multinational conference to help Iraq's factions forge a \npolitical settlement.\n  Fourth, such a settlement would provide for a negotiated withdrawal \nof U.S. combat troops, as the Iraq Study Group prescribes. If \nappropriate, other U.S. troops could stay, ideally as part of a \nmultinational or U.N. peacekeeping force.\n  Finally, we should implement the other recommendations of the Iraq \nStudy Group, including using our good offices to mediate other \nconflicts in the Middle East, including the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict. President Bush should begin by appointing a special envoy to \nthe region, and I applaud his announcement yesterday of a resumption in \naid to West Bank Palestinians.\n  I conclude my remarks by saluting the servicemen of my home State who \nhave given their lives while answering our Nation's call to duty in \nIraq.\n  I have asked the Pentagon for an accounting of all New Mexican \nservice personnel who have died in Iraq to this date, and that is the \naccounting I will go through at this time.\n  While the people of New Mexico and of our entire Nation mourn their \nloss, we will always celebrate the lives they led and the sacrifices \nthey made for our country.\n  Marine LCpl Christopher Adlesperger, 20, of Albuquerque, NM, attended \nthe University of New Mexico before joining the Marine Corps in 2003. \nHe was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions in Fallujah \non November 10, 2004.\n  SGT James Akin, 23, of Albuquerque, NM, is quoted by the Albuquerque \nTribune as saying, ``Live life to serve, because you can.

Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment in this \nall-night session and the attempt to call this PR stunt progress for \nour troops. It is clear that some in this Chamber are putting rhetoric \nbefore results. Our troops in Iraq continue to pay the price of \npolitical rhetoric in Washington, DC.\n  I believe my colleagues truly care about our troops and I share their \ndesire to have all of our troops home as soon as possible. To endorse a \nstrategy of withdrawing troops in 120 days after this bill passes, \nhowever, undermines those very troops. We make it even more difficult \nfor them to achieve their mission. With today's rapid communication \nmade possible by the Internet, cell phones, and other technologies, \nwhat we say here can almost instantaneously find its way around the \nworld and straight to the camps of both friends and foes--and they are \nboth watching. In fact, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that \nthe whole world is watching to see what we will decide to do.\n  Ambassador Ryan Crocker, our U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, has made some \nvery interesting comments that I find valuable. He, like our military \ncommanders in Iraq, is in the best position to give us in Washington a \ntrue assessment of the situation on the ground. Ambassador Crocker has \nstated that he could see the Iraqi Government achieve none of the \ndebaathification benchmarks and yet have a situation of stability and \nprogress. At the same time, we could see a situation where all \nbenchmarks are achieved and yet have an unstable and unsecure nation.\n  In statements on this floor, I have discussed the goals of benchmarks \nfor the Iraqi Government--and I continue to believe we should be \nsetting those goals. We should be helping the Iraqi Government achieve \nthem. But we cannot expect the Iraqi Government to exist in a vacuum \nwhere our American ideals of democracy will simply exist in 1 day, 1 \nmonth, or 1 year.\n  I have also recently read an article by former Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger in the Washington Post. Dr. Kissinger wrote about the \ncenturies-long struggles between the Sunni, Shiia, and Kurdish \npopulations in Iraq. He, too, points out that it is unrealistic to \nexpect these groups to, in a matter of a few years, forget hundreds of \nyears of conflict and work together in our timeframe.\n  I will ask that three articles be printed in the Record.\n  The people of the United States and certainly the members of the \nSenate should continue to press for progress being made by the Iraqi \nGovernment. We should provide our troops and our civilian \nrepresentatives on the ground in Iraq with the resources they need to \nassist the Iraqis in achieving a secure and stable state. We must not \nundermine their efforts in attempt to score political points.\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\n  An assessment of military actions will be released in September. When \nthat assessment is made by those on the ground in Iraq, I will \ncarefully evaluate what their determinations mean for the future of \nAmerica's troops serving in Iraq.\n  I want to close by expressing my heartfelt thanks to all of the men \nand women serving in our U.S. Armed Forces. You are all true heroes. \nYou have volunteered to defend our Nation, our freedom, and our way of \nlife. For those of you deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the \nworld, I hope you know the difference you are making in the lives of \nthe people around you. Your families, friends, and the people of \nAmerica are safer because of the work you are doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the articles to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2007]\n\n                            Was Osama Right?\n\n                           (By Bernard Lewis)\n\n       During the Cold War, two things came to be known and \n     generally recognized in the Middle East concerning the two \n     rival superpowers. If you did anything to annoy the Russians, \n     punishment would be swift and dire. If you said or did \n     anything against the Americans, not only would there be no \n     punishment; there might even be some possibility of reward, \n     as the usual anxious procession of diplomats and politicians, \n     journalists and scholars and miscellaneous others came with \n     their usual pleading inquiries: ``What have we done to offend \n     you? What can we do to put it right?''\n       A few examples may suffice. During the troubles in Lebanon \n     in the 1970s and '80s, there were many attacks on American \n     installations and individuals--notably the attack on the \n     Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, followed by a prompt \n     withdrawal, and a whole series of kidnapping of Americans, \n     both official and private, as well as of Europeans. There was \n     only one attack on Soviet citizens, when one diplomat was \n     killed and several others kidnapped. The Soviet response \n     through their local agents was swift, and directed against \n     the family of the leader of the kidnappers. The kidnapped \n     Russians were promptly released, and after that there were no \n     attacks on Soviet citizens or installations throughout the \n     period of the Lebanese troubles.\n       These different responses evoked different treatment. While \n     American policies, institutions and individuals were subject \n     to unremitting criticism and sometimes deadly attack, the \n     Soviets were immune. Their retention of the vast, largely \n     Muslim, colonial empire accumulated by the tsars in Asia \n     passed unnoticed, as did their propaganda and sometimes \n     action against Muslim beliefs and institutions.\n       Most remarkable of all was the response of the Arab and \n     other Muslim countries to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan \n     in December 1979. Washington's handling of the Tehran hostage \n     crisis assured the Soviets that they had nothing to fear from \n     the U.S. They already knew that they need not worry about the \n     Arab and other Muslim governments. The Soviets already \n     ruled--or misruled--half a dozen Muslim countries in Asia, \n     without arousing any opposition or criticism. Initially, \n     their decision and action to invade and conquer Afghanistan \n     and install a puppet regime in Kabul went almost unresisted. \n     After weeks of debate, the U.N. General Assembly finally was \n     persuaded to pass a resolution ``strongly deploring the \n     recent armed intervention in Afghanistan.'' The words \n     ``condemn'' and ``aggression'' were not used, and the source \n     of the ``intervention'' was not named. Even this anodyne \n     resolution was too much for some of the Arab states. \n     South Yemen voted no; Algeria and Syria abstained; Libya \n     was absent; the non-voting PLO observer to the Assembly \n     even made a speech defending the Soviets.\n       One might have expected that the recently established \n     Organization of the Islamic Conference would take a tougher \n     line. It did not. After a month of negotiation and \n     manipulation, the Organization finally held a meeting in \n     Pakistan to discuss the Afghan question. Two of the Arab \n     states, South Yemen and Syria, boycotted the meeting. The \n     representative of the PLO, a full member of this \n     organization, was present, but abstained from voting on a \n     resolution critical of the Soviet action; the Libyan delegate \n     went further, and used this occasion to denounce the U.S.\n       The Muslim willingness to submit to Soviet authority, \n     though widespread, was not unanimous. The Afghan people, who \n     had successfully defied the British Empire in its prime, \n     found a way to resist the Soviet invaders. An organization \n     known as the Taliban (literally, ``the students'') began to \n     organize resistance and even guerilla warfare against the \n     Soviet occupiers and their puppets. For this, they were able \n     to attract some support from the Muslim world--some grants of \n     money, and growing numbers of volunteers to fight in the Holy \n     War against the infidel conqueror. Notable among these was a \n     group led by a Saudi of Yemeni origin called Osama bin Laden.\n       To accomplish their purpose, they did not disdain to turn \n     to the U.S. for help, which they got. In the Muslim \n     perception there has been, since the time of the Prophet, an \n     ongoing struggle between the two world religions, Christendom \n     and Islam, for the privilege and opportunity to bring \n     salvation to the rest of humankind, removing whatever \n     obstacles there might be in their path. For a long time, the \n     main enemy was seen, with some plausibility, as being the \n     West, and some Muslims were, naturally enough, willing to \n     accept what help they could get against that enemy. This \n     explains the widespread support in the Arab countries and in \n     some other places first for the Third Reich and, after its \n     collapse, for the Soviet Union. These were the main enemies \n     of the West, and therefore natural allies.\n       Now the situation had changed. The more immediate, more \n     dangerous enemy was the Soviet Union, already ruling a number \n     of Muslim countries, and daily increasing its influence and \n     presence in others. It was therefore natural to seek and \n     accept American help. As Osama bin Laden explained, in this \n     final phase of the millennial struggle, the world of the \n     unbelievers was divided between two superpowers. The first \n     task was to deal with the more deadly and more dangerous of \n     the two, the Soviet Union. After that, dealing with the \n     pampered and degenerate Americans would be easy.\n       We in the Western world see the defeat and collapse of the \n     Soviet Union as a Western, more specifically an American, \n     victory in the Cold War. For Osama bin Laden and his \n     followers, it was a Muslim victory in a jihad, and, given the \n     circumstances, this perception does not lack plausibility.\n       From the writings and the speeches of Osama bin Laden and \n     his colleagues, it is clear that they expected this second \n     task, dealing with America, would be comparatively simple and \n     easy. This perception was certainly encouraged and so it \n     seemed, confirmed by the American response to a whole series \n     of attacks--on the World Trade Center in New York and on U.S. \n     troops in Mogadishu in 1993, on the U.S. military office in \n     Riyadh in 1995, on the American embassies in Kenya and \n     Tanzania in 1998, on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen in 2000--all of \n     which evoked only angry words, sometimes accompanied by the \n     dispatch of expensive missiles to remote and uninhabited \n     places.\n       Stage One of the jihad was to drive the infidels from the \n     lands of Islam; Stage Two--to bring the war into the enemy \n     camp, and the attacks of 9/11 were clearly intended to be the \n     opening salvo of this stage. The response to 9/11, so \n     completely out of accord with previous American practice, \n     came as a shock, and it is noteworthy that there has been no \n     successful attack on American soil since then. The U.S. \n     actions in Afghanistan and in Iraq indicated that there had \n     been a major change in the U.S., and that some revision of \n     their assessment, and of the policies based on that \n     assessment, was necessary.\n       More recent developments, and notably the public discourse \n     inside the U.S., are persuading increasing numbers of \n     Islamist radicals that their first assessment was correct \n     after all, and that they need only to press a little harder \n     to achieve final victory. It is not yet clear whether they \n     are right or wrong in this view. If They are right, the \n     consequences--both for Islam and for America--will be deep, \n     wide and lasting.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 12, 2007]\n\n                        The ``Benchmark'' Excuse\n\n       Ryan Crocker, the U.S. Ambassador in Iraq, is a 36-year \n     career diplomat who has served under seven administrations in \n     Iran, Syria, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Pakistan. He's \n     no partisan gunslinger. So it's worth listening to his views \n     as Congressional Democrats and a growing number of \n     Republicans press for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq on \n     the excuse that the Iraqi government hasn't met a set of \n     political ``benchmarks.''\n       ``The longer I'm here, the more I'm persuaded that Iraq \n     cannot be analyzed by these kinds of discrete benchmarks,'' \n     Mr. Crocker told the New York Times's John Burns in an \n     interview on Saturday, referring to pending Iraqi legislation \n     on an oil-sharing agreement and a relaxation of de-\n     Baathification laws. ``You could not achieve any of them, and \n     still have a situation where arguably the country is moving \n     in the right direction. And conversely, I think you could \n     achieve them all and still not be heading towards stability, \n     security and overall success in Iraq.''\n       Mr. Crocker's comments are a useful reminder of the \n     irrelevance--and disingenuousness--of much Washington \n     commentary on Iraq. For proponents of early withdrawal, the \n     ``benchmarking'' issue has provided a handy excuse to make \n     the Iraqi government rather than al Qaeda the main culprit in \n     the violence engulfing their country. A forthcoming \n     Administration report indicating lagging political progress \n     is certain to be seized on by Congress as it takes up a \n     defense spending bill and debates an amendment ordering troop \n     withdrawals by the fall. A proposal to mandate extended times \n     between deployments (and thus force withdrawal) failed \n     narrowly in the Senate yesterday, though not before winning \n     the support of seven Republicans.\n       Nobody claims the Iraqi government is a model of democratic \n     perfection, or that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is the \n     second coming of Lincoln. We advised the White House not to \n     lobby against his predecessor.\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n     But Mr. Maliki's government is democratic and more inclusive \n     than most reporting suggests, and it is fighting for its life \n     against an enemy that uses car bombs and suicide bombers as \n     its policy instruments. In an interview this week in the New \n     York Post, General David Petraeus noted that while the \n     performance of the Iraqi Army has been mixed, ``their losses \n     in June were three times ours.'' To suggest that Iraqis \n     aren't willing to fight for their freedom is an insult to \n     their families.\n       General Petraeus also noted that ``the level of sectarian \n     deaths in Baghdad in June was the lowest in about a year,'' \n     evidence that in this key battlefield the surge is making \n     progress. As a result, al Qaeda is being forced to pick its \n     targets in more remote areas, as it did last week in the \n     village of Amirli near Kirkuk, where more than 100 civilians \n     were murdered. More U.S. troops and the revolt of Sunni \n     tribal leaders against al Qaeda are the most hopeful \n     indicators in many months that the insurgency can be \n     defeated.\n       But that isn't going to happen under the timetable now \n     contemplated by Congress. ``I can think of few commanders in \n     history who wouldn't have wanted more troops, more time or \n     more unity among their partners,'' General Petraeus told the \n     Post. ``However, if I could only have one at this point in \n     Iraq, it would be more time.''\n       It's also not going to happen if Congress insists on using \n     troop withdrawals to punish Iraqis for their supposed \n     political delinquency. The central issue is whether the \n     Iraqis can make those decisions without having to fear \n     assassination as the consequence of political compromise. The \n     more insistent Congress becomes about troop withdrawals, the \n     more unlikely political reconciliation in Iraq becomes.\n       That said, it's becoming increasingly clear that the issue \n     of reconciliation has become a smokescreen for American \n     politicians who care for their own political fortunes far \n     more than they do about the future of Iraq or the \n     consequences of Iraq's collapse for U.S. interests in the \n     Middle East. Here again, they could stand to listen to Mr. \n     Crocker.\n       ``You can't build a whole policy on a fear of a negative, \n     but, boy, you've really got to account for it,'' he said. \n     ``In the States, it's like we're in the last half of the \n     third reel of a three-reel movie, and all we have to do is \n     decide we're done here. . . and we leave the theater and go \n     on to something else. Whereas out here, you're just getting \n     into the first reel of five reels, and ugly as the first reel \n     has been, the other four and a half are going to be way, way \n     worse.''\n       Mr. Crocker is referring, of course, to the possibility of \n     far nastier violence if the U.S. departs before Iraqi \n     security forces can maintain order. Some will denounce this \n     as a parade of horribles designed to intimidate Congress, but \n     we also recall some of the same people who predicted that a \n     Communist triumph in Southeast Asia would yield only peace, \n     not the ``boat people'' and genocide. Those Americans \n     demanding a U.S. retreat in Iraq will be directly responsible \n     for whatever happens next.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 10, 2007]\n\n                         The Way Back From Iraq\n\n                        (By Henry A. Kissinger)\n\n       The war in Iraq is approaching a kind of self-imposed \n     climax. Public disenchantment is palpable. The expressions of \n     concern by the widely admired Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) are \n     a case in point. On the other hand, a democratic public \n     eventually holds its leaders responsible for bringing about \n     disasters, even if the decisions that caused the disaster \n     reflected the public's preferences of the moment. And \n     precipitate withdrawal would produce such a disaster. It \n     would not end the war but shift it to other areas, such as \n     Lebanon, Jordan or Saudi Arabia. The war between Iraqi \n     factions would intensify. The demonstration of American \n     impotence would embolden radical Islamism and further \n     radicalize its disciples from Indonesia and India to the \n     suburbs of European capitals. Whatever our domestic \n     timetables, the collapse of the American effort in Iraq would \n     be a geopolitical calamity.\n       We face a number of paradoxes. Military victory, in the \n     sense of establishing a government capable of enforcing its \n     writ throughout Iraq, is not possible in a time frame \n     tolerated by the American political process. Yet no political \n     solution is conceivable in isolation from the situation on \n     the ground. What America and the world need is not unilateral \n     withdrawal but a vision by the Bush administration of a \n     sustainable political end to the conflict.\n       Traditionally, diplomacy strives to discover common goals \n     and distill them into a workable compromise. What \n     distinguishes the diplomacy on Iraq is that, in the end, it \n     needs to distill a common approach from common fears. Each of \n     the parties--the United States, the internal parties, Iraq's \n     neighbors, the permanent members of the U.N. Security \n     Council--face the reality that if they pursue their preferred \n     objectives, the cauldron of Iraq may overflow and engulf the \n     region. The United States and most of Iraq's neighbors have \n     powerful national interests in preventing the emergence of \n     terrorist training areas in Iraq. None of Iraq's neighbors, \n     not even Iran, is in a position to dominate the situation \n     against the opposition of all other interested parties. Is it \n     possible to build a sustainable outcome on such \n     considerations?\n       The answer must be sought on three levels: internal, \n     regional and international.\n       The internal parties--the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds--have \n     been subjected to insistent American appeals to achieve \n     national reconciliation. But groups that have been conducting \n     blood feuds with each other for centuries are, not \n     surprisingly, struggling in their efforts to resolve their \n     differences by constitutional means. They need the buttress \n     of a diplomatic process that could provide international \n     support for carrying out any internal agreements reached or \n     to contain conflict if the internal parties cannot agree and \n     Iraq breaks up.\n       Though much media attention focuses on which countries \n     should be involved in the diplomacy, the real debate should \n     start with the substance of what the diplomacy is meant to \n     achieve.\n       The American goal should be an international agreement \n     regarding the status of Iraq. It would test whether Iraq's \n     neighbors as well as some more distant countries are prepared \n     to translate general concepts into converging policies. It \n     would provide a legal and political framework to resist \n     violations. These are the meaningful benchmarks against which \n     to test American withdrawals.\n       Such a diplomacy might prove feasible because the \n     continuation of Iraq's current crisis presents all of Iraq's \n     neighbors with mounting problems. The longer the war rages \n     the more likely the breakup of the country into sectarian \n     units. Turkey has repeatedly emphasized that it would resist \n     such a breakup by force because of the radicalizing impact a \n     Kurdish state could have a Turkey's large Kurdish population. \n     But this would bring Turkey into unwanted conflict with the \n     United States and open a Pandora's box of other \n     interventions.\n       Saudi Arabia and Jordan dread Shiite domination of Iraq, \n     especially if the Baghdad regime threatens to become a \n     satellite of Iran. The various Gulf sheikdoms the largest of \n     which is Kuwait, find themselves in an even more threatened \n     position. Their interest is to help calm the Iraq turmoil and \n     avert Iranian domination of the region.\n       Syria's attitudes are likely to be more ambivalent. Its \n     ties to Iran represent both a claim to status and a looming \n     vulnerability. It goes along with Iranian-dominated Hezbollah \n     in Lebanon to reduce Western influence, but it fears \n     confrontation with the United States and even more with \n     Israel, should the region run out of control.\n       Given a wise and determined American diplomacy, even Iran \n     might be brought to conclude that the risks of continued \n     turmoil outweigh the temptations before it. To be sure, \n     Iranian leaders may believe that the moment is uniquely \n     favorable to realize millennial visions of a reincarnated \n     Persian empire or a reversal of the Shiite-Sunni split \n     under Shiite domination. On the other hand, if prudent \n     leaders exist--which remains to be determined--they may \n     conclude that they had better treat these advantages as a \n     bargaining chip in a negotiation rather than risk them in \n     a contest over domination of the region. However divided \n     America may appear and however irresolute Europe, \n     geopolitical realities are bound to assert themselves. The \n     industrial countries cannot permit their access to the \n     principal region of energy supply to be controlled by a \n     country with Iran's revolutionary and taunting foreign \n     policy. No American president will, in the end, acquiesce \n     once the full consequences of Iranian domination of the \n     region become apparent. Russia will have its own reasons, \n     principally fear of the radicalization of its Islamic \n     minority, to begin resisting Iranian and radical Islamist \n     domination of the Gulf.\n       Combined with the international controversy over its \n     nuclear weapons program, Iran's challenge could come to be \n     perceived by its leaders as posing excessive risks. This is \n     probably why Iran (and Syria) seem to be edging toward \n     dialogue with the United States and why a genuine mutual \n     interest may arise in such a dialogue.\n       Whether or whenever Iran reaches these conclusions, two \n     conditions will have to be met: First, no serious diplomacy \n     can be based on the premise that the United States is the \n     supplicant. America and its allies must demonstrate a \n     determination to vindicate their vital interests that Iran \n     will find credible. Second, the United States will need to \n     put forward a diplomatic position that acknowledges the \n     legitimate security interests of an Iran that accepts the \n     existing order in the Gulf rather than strives to overthrow \n     it.\n       Such a negotiation must be initiated within a multilateral \n     forum. A dramatic bilateral Iranian-U.S. negotiation would \n     magnify all of the region's insecurities. If Lebanon, Jordan, \n     Saudi Arabia and Kuwait--which have entrusted their security \n     primarily to the United States--become convinced that an \n     Iranian-U.S. condominium is looming, a race for Tehran's \n     favor may bring about the disintegration of all resolve. \n     America needs to resist the siren song of a U.S.-Iranian \n     condominium. Within a multilateral framework, the United \n     States will be able to conduct individual conversations with \n     the key participants.\n       Its purpose should be to define the international status of \n     the emerging Iraqi political structure into a series of \n     reciprocal obligations. In such a scheme, the U.S.-led \n     multinational force would be gradually transformed into an \n     agent of that arrangement, also the lines of the Bosnian \n     settlement in the Balkans or the Afghan structure. \n     International forces would be established along Iraq's \n     frontiers to block infiltration. Until this point is reached, \n     U.S. forces should be deployed to have the greatest impact on \n     the\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\n     issues of greatest concern to America--the creation of \n     terrorist bases or the emergence of a terrorist regime--and \n     in numbers appropriate to their mission.\n       A forum for diplomacy already exists in the foreign \n     minister's conference that met recently at Sharm el-Sheikh, \n     Egypt, and that has agreed to reassemble in Istanbul at a \n     date yet to be determined. It is in the United States' \n     interest to turn the conference into a working enterprise \n     under strong, if discreet, American leadership.\n       Such a diplomacy is the context for a reliable exit \n     strategy. It would also provide a framework for the eventual \n     participation of friendly countries with a big stake in the \n     outcome. No nation is more seriously threatened by \n     radicalized Islamism than India. Its large Muslim population \n     might be tempted from the democratic path by the success of \n     radical Islamists in the Middle East. Other countries with \n     interests in a moderate outcome are Indonesia and Malaysia. \n     They could be involved in a peacekeeping role once a regional \n     agreement exists.\n       All this suggests a three-tiered international effort; an \n     intensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties; a regional \n     forum like the Sharm el-Sheikh conference to elaborate an \n     international transition status for Iraq; and a broader \n     conference to establish the peacekeeping and verification \n     dimensions.\n       Neither the international system not American public \n     opinion will accept as a permanent arrangement an American \n     enclave maintained exclusively by American military power in \n     so volatile a region. The concept outlined here seeks to \n     establish a new international framework for Iraq. It is an \n     outcome emerging from the political and military situation \n     there and not from artificial deadlines.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the Cornyn amendment \nbecause it significantly misrepresents the NIE because it makes \nassumptions about what may happen in Iraq that are speculative, and \nbecause it represents the same failed mindset that has resulted in the \ncurrent disaster in Iraq. While the dangers of Iraq becoming a failed \nstate are real, this amendment seeks to justify the current massive and \nindefinite U.S. military presence in that country, which is an \nunacceptable distraction and diversion of resources from the fight \nagainst al-Qaida and its affiliates worldwide.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on an amendment \noffered by Senator Cornyn, amendment No. 2100, that states, in part, \nthat it is the Sense of the Senate that the ``Senate should not pass \nlegislation that will undermine our military's ability to prevent a \nfailed state in Iraq.'' I opposed that amendment, but my vote should \nnot be viewed as a lack of concern for the consequences of a failed \nIraqi state.\n  I agree that it is not in the interest of the United States for Iraq \nand the rest of the Middle East to devolve into total chaos, and no one \nin this body argues differently. However, I opposed the amendment \nbecause it suggests that the United States Senate will be bound to a \npolicy of supporting an endless U.S. military involvement in Iraq. By \nimplying that it is our military's responsibility to prevent a failed \nstate in Iraq, the Cornyn amendment suggests that it is up to our \nservice men and women, now and into the future, to undo the missteps of \nan ill-conceived adventure directed by a reckless President.\n  The amendment fails to define what exactly a ``failed state'' is, nor \nhow the U.S. military should go about preventing one. Some may not have \nnoticed, but Iraq is perilously close to a reasonable definition of \n``failed state'' already. In the third annual ``failed state'' index, \nanalysts for Foreign Policy magazine and the not-for-profit Fund for \nPeace said Iraq is now the second most unstable country in the world. \nIts standing deteriorated from last year's fourth place on a list of \nthe 10 nations most vulnerable to violent internal conflict and \nworsening conditions.\n  Mr. President, I feel that we should be relentless in our efforts to \nbring Osama bin Laden to justice and to vanquish the al-Qaida terror \nnetwork. This amendment, however, does not say anything new, and it \ndoes not imply a change in U.S. policy. What it does, however, is \nsuggest that if the failing situation in Iraq does not improve, if the \nIraqi government does not step up, if the sectarian violence that has \npersisted for over a millennia does not abate, the U.S. Senate should \nnot take action that would allow us to modify the mission or withdraw \nforces--ever. That, Mr. President, is an extremely unwise and imprudent \nstatement and an even more unwise policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I will take just a moment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Texas speaks, I be given the time until 10:20 a.m., and \nthat it be taken from Senator Reid's time previously agreed to in the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I do not intend to object, but merely \npoint out that it is my understanding I have 15 minutes, from now until \n10:20 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas has been given 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am struck by the fact that during the \ncourse of this debate on the Levin-Reed amendment some Senators seem to \ntake the attitude that our presence in Iraq is merely optional, that we \ncan choose to do whatever we want to do without regard to the \nconsequences. I think of those consequences, as 94 Senators indicated \nyesterday by their vote on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that said \nwe would do no act that would make it more likely that Iraq would end \nup in a failed state because the danger that poses to our national \nsecurity. I don't believe our presence in Iraq is merely optional.\n  I do not agree with our colleagues who seem to say that, well, the \nonly thing missing is enough pressure on the Iraqi political leadership \nto get their act together, and if they would do what the American \nCongress wants them to do on the timetable the American Congress thinks \nis appropriate, then we are going to pull the plug, we are going to \nleave Iraq, and leave Iraqis to themselves, as if the consequences of \nthat action would be borne only by the Iraqis. In fact, I believe the \nconsequences of that action would be disastrous to American national \nsecurity, as well as to the region in the Middle East.\n  So I do not believe it is merely a matter of putting more pressure on \nthe Iraqis. As a matter of fact, I marvel at the irony of Members of \nthe Senate saying after decades of living under a brutal dictator and \nthe literal genocide that had resulted from the murders he carried out \nand the suppression of the Shiite majority by the Sunni minority under \nthe Baath party, that somehow this new democracy can spring to life as \nour democracy has after 231 years and solve these problems. Such as, \nwhy can't they pass a law that says we will share the oil revenue, \nwhile we have been unsuccessful in solving the insolvency of our Social \nSecurity system. They suggest there needs to be reconciliation \novernight between the Shiites and Sunnis when it took us well over 100 \nyears and a civil war in which 600,000 Americans died for the civil \nrights movement to take root and to overcome the scourge of slavery.\n  I think some of my colleagues are taking an unrealistic approach when \nit comes to how fast we expect this new democracy to take the political \nsteps to solve some of these problems. And, of course, they cannot do \nit unless basic security is provided--security for them and security \nfor us.\n  That is why it is important that we not listen to the armchair \ngenerals here in Washington, DC, with very little military experience \nin fighting and winning wars. It is one reason why we need to listen to \nthe generals on the ground, people such as GEN David Petraeus and \nothers who have stated very clearly what the consequences of failure \nwill be to the United States.\n  I also marvel at the short memories of some of my colleagues who said \nwe should not have gone into Iraq in the first place after 77 Senators \nin this body voted to authorize the President to do that. Do they \nforget the fact that Saddam Hussein defied, I think it was 16 or 17 \nUnited Nations resolutions to open up his country to weapons inspectors \nfrom the United Nations, and the concern, of course, post-9/11 that \nSaddam was developing chemical, nuclear, or biological weapons and that \nhe\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\nwould share that technology with terrorists such as al-Qaida?\n  And the idea that al-Qaida has sprung up in Iraq overnight, not \nbecause of the conditions created under Saddam or postwar Iraq, but \nbecause of something we did, to me is an amazing allegation. So it is \nAmerica that is to blame for al-Qaida being in Iraq. That, I suppose, \nis the allegation.\n  I am glad to see at least our colleagues do acknowledge that al-Qaida \nis in Iraq, and, of course, we are met today with the news that the top \nal-Qaida figure in Iraq was captured. Adding information from him \nindicates the group's foreign-based leadership wields considerable \ninfluence over the country of Iraq.\n  I don't see how colleagues can vote in favor of the Levin-Reed \namendment, which calls for a rapid withdrawal of forces before the \nIraqis are able to stabilize their own country and are able to defend \nthemselves and at the same time vote for the amendment we voted on \nyesterday, which was adopted 94 to 3, saying we are not going to take \nany action which makes it more likely that Iraq will become a failed \nstate because as the National Intelligence Estimate and the Iraq Study \nGroup indicated, a failed state in Iraq means a free hand for al-Qaida. \nA free hand for al-Qaida in Iraq makes Iraq less safe, but it also \nmakes America less safe because, as we all know, war is an interactive \naffair. We can quit fighting, but it doesn't mean our enemy will. Of \ncourse, were we to bring our troops home, as all of us want to do, the \nonly question is whether we are going to do it based on an arbitrary \ntimetable with the risk of a failed state or whether we are going to do \nit based on conditions on the ground and with the objective of leaving \nIraq with the capability to govern and defend itself.\n  The question is, are we going to bring our troops home at a time and \nin such a manner as it increases the likelihood that Iraq will descend \ninto a failed state with, of course, the opportunity for al-Qaida to \nregroup, to recruit, to train, and then export further terrorist \nattacks to the United States? This is the reality. Were we to leave \nIraq before it has the capability to defend and govern itself, our \nenemies would simply follow us here.\n\n  It is almost as if some of our colleagues want to pull the covers \nover their head and pretend if they do so, if we ignore the threat, it \nwill go away. Unfortunately, life is not that simple. Nor is the threat \nillusory, as some of our colleagues indicate.\n  So it is important that the Levin-Reed amendment be defeated, that we \nnot set an arbitrary timetable to tie the hands of GEN David Petraeus \nwith this new strategy that has recently been completed--that is, the \nsurge of troops and the operational surge underway--and with the kind \nof success we have seen turning Anbar Province around, a place that \npreviously no one could go because al-Qaida basically ruled the roost. \nNow we are starting to see some signs of success there and hopefully \nbegin to let the counterinsurgency strategy that General Petraeus was \nsent over to execute, one that will allow our troops and the Iraqis to \nclear the threat, to then hold the area, and then to allow the \npolitical operatives in Iraq the space in which to do the important \nreconciliation that we all know is essential to the long-term success \nand stabilization of that country.\n  This is a historic vote we will be having in a few minutes, and I \nhope our colleagues will vote in the interest of American national \nsecurity, will vote in the interest of doing nothing that would \nincrease the likelihood of a failed state and providing al-Qaida an \nadditional foothold and operating space within Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday in Chicago, Eric Lill was laid \nto rest. Eric Lill grew up in the Bridgeport neighborhood on the south \nside of Chicago. He watched the White Sox. He ate Connie's pizza. On \nSeptember 11, he was moved to enlist in the Army. He left in February \nof 2002 to serve, and in his second deployment in Iraq, he was killed \nby a roadside bomb.\n  On Sunday, SPC Eric Lill came home from Iraq in a flag-draped coffin. \nHe was 28 years old. He leaves behind a 6-year-old son and a 4-year-old \ndaughter.\n  Eric Lill's story is a story repeated thousands of times across \nAmerica during the course of this war, 150 times in my home State of \nIllinois--stories of bravery and heroism. There are also 30,000 stories \nof injured Americans who have come home with amputations and traumatic \nbrain injuries, some whose lives will never be the same. They are our \npatriots, our heroes, and we salute them.\n  Across the street from Eric Lill's house on the south side of Chicago \nis the home of his grandmother, Marlene Alvarado. Specialist Lill used \nto call his grandmother every Saturday from Iraq to tell her he was \nsafe. This morning, Mrs. Alvarado looks out her front window over at \nher grandson's house still decorated with yellow ribbons.\n  During the course of this 4\\1/2\\-year war, a war that has lasted \nlonger than World War II, there have been many yellow ribbons, there \nhave been many flag-draped caskets, and there have been many broken \nIraqi promises.\n  I listened to the speeches from the other side of the aisle pleading \nwith us to be patient with the Iraqis; the time will come when they \nwill lead their nation forward. I could give the Iraqis patience if it \nweren't patience paid for in the lives and blood of American \nservicemen. We have been patient for 4\\1/2\\ years. It is time for the \nIraqis to stand and defend their own nation.\n  It is time for honesty, not bravado. It is time for realism, not \nfantasy. This war was born in deception. At the highest levels of our \nGovernment, it has been waged with incompetence and arrogance. Sadly, \nit is the most serious foreign policy mistake of our time. This war \nwill not end if we depend on the insight or the humility of our \nPresident.\n  We, those of us who are Members of the Senate, must speak for the \nAmerican people. We must speak for our war-weary soldiers, and we must \nbring this war to an end. At the end of this debate, there will be a \nvote on an amendment, the only amendment which will bring our soldiers \nhome and end this war responsibly.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in \nthis bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For what purpose does the Senator from \nIllinois rise?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we have had an extensive debate, obviously, \non the floor of the Senate. I was scheduled originally to speak at 6 \na.m. Because there was an enormous backlog, I have not had an \nopportunity to speak on this issue.\n  I rise this morning in strong support of the amendment offered by \nSenators Levin and Reed. I am proud to join them as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  We have heard from the administration and from many of our colleagues \nin this Chamber that we need to give the President's surge more time, \nthat we need to wait to hear the report in September before we make a \nbinding decision to redeploy our troops. Yet, we learned just last week \nthat the Iraqi political leaders have not met a single benchmark that \nthey had agreed to in January. Not one.\n  We do not need to wait for another report. We have seen the results \nof a failed policy in the form of multiple deployments, more sacrifice \nfrom our military families, and a deepening civil war in Iraq that has \ncaught our troops in the middle.\n  It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq, where each day we see \nthe consequences of fighting a war that should never have been \nauthorized and should never have been waged. The single most important \ndecision a President or Member of Congress can make is the decision to \nsend our troops into harm's way.\n  It is that decision that determines the fate of our men and women in \nuniform, the course of nations, and the security of the American \npeople. It is that decision that sets in motion consequences that \ncannot be undone.\n  Since this war began, 3,618 Americans have been killed--532 since the \nPresident ignored the will of the American people and launched his \nsurge. Tens of thousands more have been wounded,\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\nsuffering terrible injuries seen and unseen.\n  Here is what else we know: We know that the surge is not working, \nthat our mission in Iraq must be changed, and that this war must be \nbrought to a responsible conclusion.\n  We know Iraq's leaders are not resolving their grievances. They are \nnot stepping up to their security responsibilities. They are not \nimproving the daily lives of Iraqis.\n  We know that the war in Iraq costs us $370 million a day and $10 \nbillion each month. These are resources that could be spent to secure \nour ports and our borders, and to focus on a resurgent Taliban in \nAfghanistan and the wider war on terrorism that is yet to be won.\n  We know that because of the war in Iraq, America is no safer than it \nwas on 9/11. Al-Qaida has gained the best recruiting tool it could ask \nfor. Tens of thousands of terrorists have been trained and radicalized \nin Iraq. And terrorism is up worldwide.\n  If America is attacked again, it will be in no small measure a \nconsequence of our failure to destroy al-Qaida at its roots in \nAfghanistan and our failure to adequately secure the homeland. The \ndecision to authorize and fight a misguided war in Iraq has created a \nnew cadre of experienced terrorists bent on the destruction of the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  If there is still any question about whether Iraq has been a \ndistraction from this critical war in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that \nshould have been resolved yesterday with the release of the most recent \nnational intelligence estimate. That report said that al-Qaida ``has \nprotected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack \ncapability, including: a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas, operational lieutenants, and its top \nleadership.''\n  And last week, a new threat assessment concluded that al-Qaida is as \nstrong today as it was before 9/11.\n  Seeing yet another report like this, I can only repeat what I said \nnearly 5 years ago, during the runup to this war. We are fighting on \nthe wrong battlefield. The terrorists who attacked us and who continue \nto plot against us are resurgent in the hills between Afghanistan and \nPakistan. They should have been our focus then. They must be our focus \nnow.\n  I opposed this war from the beginning, before the Congress voted to \nauthorize the war in 2002. I said then that I could not support a war \nbased not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics. I \nworried that it would lead to a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, \nat undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.\n  I believed then--and I still believe now--that being a leader means \nthat you'd better do what's right and leave the politics aside. Because \nthere are no do-overs on an issue as important as war. You cannot undo \nthe consequences of that decision.\n  In January, I introduced a plan that would have already started \nbringing our troops home and ending this war, with a goal of removing \nall combat brigades by March 31, 2008. Seventy-eight days ago, \nPresident Bush vetoed a bipartisan plan that passed both Houses of \nCongress that shared my goal of changing course and ending this war.\n  During those 78 days, 266 Americans have died, and the situation in \nIraq has continued to deteriorate.\n  It is time to set a hard date to signal a new mission in Iraq and to \nbegin to bring our troops home. It is time to ensure that we complete \nthe change in mission and the drawdown of our forces, by the end of \nApril 2008--a date that is consistent with the date in my plan back in \nJanuary.\n  As we redeploy from Iraq--as I believe we must do--we have to \nredouble our efforts on all fronts in Afghanistan to ensure we do not \nlose ground there.\n  Certainly, we have had some success there over the last 5\\1/2\\ years, \nwhether it is the five-fold increase in the number of Afghan boys and \ngirls now attending schools or the free elections of a president and \nparliament.\n  Yet the remaining challenges in Afghanistan are enormous:\n  Opium production is expected to reach a record high this year, with \nrevenues helping to fuel the Taliban and al-Qaida; the Taliban has \nincreased its campaign of suicide attacks and roadside bombings in \nrecent months; most troubling is this simple fact: The leaders of al-\nQaida--Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and the \nleader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, remain at large. They are now free \nto operate in a safe haven in northwest Pakistan.\n  That has to change.\n  First, the United States must increase reconstruction efforts, on \nboth the civilian and military side. If we are serious about winning \nthe war on terror, we must shift to greater investments in winning the \nhearts and minds of Afghans. The U.S. should allocate money in a way \nthat allows more flexibility in our spending, permitting funding of \nlocal projects that benefit communities and promising local \ngovernments.\n  Second, the United States and NATO must turn around the security \nsituation so that average Afghans regain their faith in the ability of \ntheir government and the international forces to ensure their security. \nDespite more than 5 years of an international military presence in \ntheir country, the sad reality is that most Afghans do not believe \ntheir government can guarantee their safety.\n  Taliban violence is on the rise, and is reaching into areas of the \ncountry, like the north, that had been relatively stable until a few \nmonths ago. Secretary Gates' commitment of an additional 3,200 American \ncombat troops and the U.K. commitment of at least 1,000 new troops were \npositive steps. But we must also encourage other NATO allies to supply \nmore troops and withdraw the caveats that prevent some NATO forces from \nassisting allies in the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan.\n  Third, the Afghan Government, with our help, must do more to respond \nto the needs of its people, starting by combating its culture of \nimpunity and rampant corruption. The Afghan people will never trust \ntheir government unless it begins effectively to combat the lawlessness \nthat has long plagued the Afghan countryside.\n  Fourth, in order to make headway against corruption, the United \nStates and our allies must revamp our counternarcotics efforts. For too \nlong, the United States and NATO have combated this issue with, at \nbest, half measures, and we now face a situation where the drug trade \nis exacerbating instability with drug revenues funding the insurgency.\n  Finally, any possibility of long-term stability in Afghanistan \ndepends on addressing cross-border issues with Pakistan and other \nneighbors.\n  Simply put, Pakistan is not doing enough to deal with al-Qaida and \nTaliban safe havens within its borders. In the past months, Pakistan \nhas arrested or killed several high value targets, but its overall \nrecord remains poor. Any solution must take the fiercely independent \ntribal culture of the border region into account. And we should ensure \nthat when we provide money to reimburse the Pakistani military for \nfighting al-Qaida and the Taliban along the Afghanistan border, the \nPakistani military is meeting that commitment.\n  The central front in the war on terrorism is not in Iraq; it is in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. As we change course in Iraq, we must correct \ncourse in South Asia. And it is long past time that we did so.\n  But to make that change, the American people need real leadership \nfrom this Chamber--not empty rhetoric.\n  We are engaged in important work in the Senate. If only the \nwillingness to work toward solutions were commensurate with the \nimportance of the topic we are undertaking, we might make some \nprogress. I hope that our colleagues do not choose further obstruction \nover progress, delay over decision.\n  The only point I wish to add is all of us are patriots. The Senator \nwho is managing for the minority at this point is a certified American \nhero. All of us want to see our troops come home safely. All of us want \nthe best possible result in Iraq. The only thing I would say is, given \nthat we have no good options at this point, that we have bad options \nand worse options, I think it is very important for us to take this \ndebate seriously and to recognize that none of us are interested in \ndictating military strategy to the President but, rather, in setting a \nmission for the military, and that is what this debate is about.\n  Given the National Intelligence Estimate that has come out, I think \nit is\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\nimportant for us to be prudent and consider what the best steps forward \nare now, and that is something I hope emerges from this debate. It is \nmy belief the best thing to do now is to vote for Reed-Levin.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 60 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, may \nthe Senator from Florida also have 1 minute and the vote be delayed by \nthe appropriate time taken by the three speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a very detailed speech after \nthis vote laying out why I think this vote is important.\n  We started down this road, and we have been banging away since the \nBiden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe resolution back in January, to the Biden-Levin \nposition, and now the Reed-Levin amendment, all of which are \nessentially the same thing. I want to make it clear that this is simply \na first step. We have to keep from careening off this highway and get \nout of the civil war, and then we have to be in a position where we \ncome up with a political solution so that when we leave Iraq and we \nbring our children home, we don't just send our grandchildren back.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me this time, and as I said, when \nthe vote is over and there is more time, I will, as passionately as I \ncan, try to clarify what I think the situation is that we find \nourselves in in Iraq and what our overall policy--not just the Levin-\nReed amendment but what else we must be doing.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for his generosity, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the leader for the time \nallotted, and I wish to take this time to say that I do oppose the \nLevin-Reed amendment. I believe it is very important for the Nation at \nthis point in time to not change course until September when we have \nhad an opportunity to not hear from people in this Chamber but when we \nhave an opportunity to hear from the general on the ground, General \nPetraeus, when he comes back and reports to us on the conditions in \nIraq and what his recommendations might be.\n  I think this is too important. The danger to our Nation as a result \nof Iran's very aggressive tendencies, as well as al-Qaida's continued \npresence in Iraq, makes it essential that this mission not be \nterminated prematurely and certainly not until the time we have had the \ngenerals on the ground give us their assessment of this latest \nstrategy, which we approved and put in place in order for us to see \nsome progress forward.\n  There are signs of progress on the ground. I am encouraged by some of \nthose things I hear in spite of the noise that doesn't allow it to \nbreak through. The fact is, it does appear things are improving \nsomewhat on the ground. At the end of the day, the proper time for us \nto make a judgment is September and not now.\n  The amendment before us, the Levin/Reed amendment, would mandate the \nBush administration begin reducing the number of troops in Iraq within \n120 days and maintain only a ``limited presence'' by April.\n  In 120 days, can we physically reduce our troops that quickly in a \nsafe manner? What about our equipment? Can that be done in 120 days?\n  The issue clearly is not our shared desire to see our troops come \nhome safely and at the earliest time within the needs of our Nation's \nsecurity. All of us want our troops home. The question is, what is the \ncorrect policy for our country in Iraq? Last week we received an \ninterim report on the status of the situation in Iraq. To be sure, it \nwas a mixed report--showing just half of the benchmarks being met. But \nlet's look at that report in its proper context.\n  There are those who would inflate this report's significance beyond \nits intended purpose and use it to prod a hasty end to the war. I think \nthose efforts are misguided. This was not a report on the impact or \neffectiveness of the surge. It was a status report of where Iraq stands \ncurrently on its path to peace, stability, sovereignty, and democracy. \nAnd here are the areas where there has been satisfactory progress in \nIraq:\n  The Iraqi Government has formed a Constitutional Review Committee and \nthey have implemented procedures to form semi-autonomous regions.\n  They have established support committees for the Baghdad Security \nPlan and they have provided three trained Iraqi brigades to support \nBaghdad operations.\n  They are insuring Baghdad is not a safe haven for outlaws, regardless \nof their sectarian or political affiliation.\n  They have established all planned joint security stations in \nneighborhoods across Baghdad.\n  They are ensuring the protection of minority political parties and \nthey are spending $10 billion Iraqi revenues on reconstruction \nprojects.\n  These are the areas where there has been satisfactory progress. But \nmore progress remains to be seen.\n  They have yet to solve the issues related to debaathification reform. \nThey have yet to implement an equitable distribution system for oil \nrevenues.\n  The Iraqis have only just begun to enact new election laws. They have \nyet to ensure that Iraqi Security Forces, ISF, are providing even-\nhanded enforcement of the law--and on that point, we are holding the \nISF to an appropriately high standard. The problem is that there has \nbeen a tendency for some police to gravitate back to the old habits of \nsectarianism. Our presence is having a positive impact on ensuring that \ndoesn't occur. And the interim report also notes there are areas where \nit is too early to assess progress.\n  So there is the status report. Take it for what it is. It is a \nsnapshot in time about the condition of the Iraqi government and where \nthey are on this path to stability and democratic rule. If we are going \nto measure progress, it is good to know how much is being made. This is \nthat report.\n  To those who want to inflate it as an indicator of the effectiveness \nof the surge, I would say to my colleagues that the surge has only \nfully been in place for the last 3 weeks.\n  The question is what should happen between now and September when \nGeneral Petraeus will report to the President. At that time the surge, \nnow in its third week, will have had 12 weeks. That will provide a \nbetter gauge of where we are. But even then it will be a very short \ntime. We know more time is necessary.\n  I am confident that by September, we will have a good assessment from \nGEN David Petraeus. He will know what progress the surge is making--\nwhat progress is attainable--and whether it is having the desired \nimpact toward our common goals.\n  And yet despite the fact that the surge for stability is less than a \nmonth in place, despite the fact that Iraq has become a battleground \nwhere al-Qaida is doing everything they can to fight the West, here we \nare today, again, debating precipitous withdrawal.\n  The senior senator from Michigan says of his amendment, ``Beginning a \nphased redeployment this year will add incentives for the Iraqis to \nmake the hard compromises necessary to bring their country together and \nsecure it.'' I disagree.\n  Beginning a phased redeployment will add to the security problems. It \nwill add to the instability. It will add to the sectarian violence and \nthe killing. It will destroy any chance of pushing that country toward \nthe place where we all hope it will be. It may even put our forces at \nrisk in a defeated dangerous and humiliating defeat.\n  I ask those supporting this withdrawal to consider the consequences. \nConsider what would occur if we left Iraq right now in a 120-day \ntimeframe dictated by politics and polls and politicians in Washington, \nnot generals on the ground. Is this a sound strategy for our military? \nCan this be accomplished?\n  Leaving now would leave a security void in Iraq. The vacuum created \nwould be filled by al-Qaida and Iran. The Kurds would be threatened by \nTurkey.\n  Al-Qaida would have a training ground free from the threat of \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\nencroachment. Sectarian fighting would create even greater loss of \nIraqi lives.\n  We have to be cognizant of the consequences of a precipitous troop \nreduction and withdrawal. If we leave Iraq now--will we have to return \nat a later date?\n  We will be back fighting a larger enemy, a strengthened enemy, a more \nbrutal enemy, an even more determined enemy emboldened by our defeat.\n  Our leaving Iraq right now will strengthen our enemies; namely, al-\nQaida. Don't take my word for it; take the words of our military \nleaders on the ground.\n  MG Rick Lynch is quoted in recent news reports saying that American \nwithdrawal would ``clear the way for the enemy to come back.'' He says \ntroop pullout would ``create an environment where the enemy would come \nback and fill the void.''\n  General Lynch added that in the field, Iraqi citizens often ask two \nquestions. The first is whether the U.S. is staying. The second is how \ncan we help. Iraqis, tired of having their villages attacked, their \nhomes destroyed by the so-called insurgents--are looking to America. \nBut they want to know that we will be there if they make a commitment.\n  I appreciate those clear words from one of our military commanders on \nthe ground. Would it be a good idea to consult them first? No one cares \nmore about our troops than the officers who lead them. I rather take \nhis view than that of a politician.\n  Come September we are set to receive an update from General Petraeus \non the status of operations after the surge has been in place long \nenough for us to tell whether or not we are making the progress that \nneeds to be made. At that point let us reassess. Are our goals \nattainable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have nearly finished this little \nexhibition, which was staged, I assume, for the benefit of a briefly \namused press corps and in deference to political activists who oppose \nthe war who have come to expect from Congress such gestures, empty \nthough they may be, as proof that the majority in the Senate has heard \ntheir demands for action to end the war in Iraq.\n  The outcome of this debate, the vote we are about to take, has never \nbeen in doubt to a single Member of this body and, to state the \nobvious, nothing we have done for the last 24 hours will have changed \nany facts on the ground in Iraq or made the outcome of the war any more \nor less important to the security of our country. The stakes in this \nwar remain as high today as they were yesterday. The consequences of an \nAmerican defeat are just as great, the cost of success just as dear. No \nbattle will have been won or lost, no enemy captured or killed, no \nground will have been taken or surrendered, no soldier will have \nsurvived or been wounded, died, or come home because we spent an entire \nnight delivering our poll-tested message points, spinning our sound \nbites, arguing with each other, and substituting our amateur theatrics \nfor statesmanship. All we have achieved is remarkably similar newspaper \naccounts of our inflated sense of the drama of this display and our own \ntemporary physical fatigue. Tomorrow, the press will move on to other \nthings and we will be better rested. But nothing else has changed.\n  In Iraq, the American soldiers--marines, sailors, and airmen--are \nstill fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as \ndangerous, difficult, and consequential as the great battles of our \nArmed Forces' storied past. Our enemies will still be intent on \ndefeating us and using our defeat to encourage their followers in the \njihad they wage against us, a war which will become a greater threat to \nus should we quit the central battlefield in defeat. The Middle East \nwill still be a tinderbox which our defeat could ignite in a regional \nwar that will imperil our vital interests at risk there and draw us \ninto a longer and far more costly war. The prospect of genocide in \nIraq, in which we will be morally complicit, is still as real a \nconsequence of our withdrawal today as it was yesterday.\n  During our extended debate over the last few days, I have heard \nSenators repeat certain arguments over and over. My friends on the \nother side of this argument accuse those of us who oppose this \namendment with advocating ``staying the course,'' which is intended to \nsuggest that we are intent on continuing the mistakes that have put the \noutcome of the war in doubt. Yet we all know that with the arrival of \nGeneral Petraeus, we have changed course. We are now fighting with a \ncounterinsurgency strategy, which some of us have argued we should have \nbeen following from the beginning and which makes the most effective \nuse of our strength and does not strengthen the tactics of our enemy. \nThe new battle plan is succeeding where our previous tactics have \nfailed, although the outcome remains far from certain.\n  The tactics proposed in the amendment offered by my friends, Senators \nLevin and Reed--a smaller force confined to bases distant from the \nbattlefield, from where they will launch occasional search-and-destroy \nmissions and train the Iraqi military--are precisely the tactics \nemployed for most of the war, which have, by anyone's account, failed \nmiserably. Now, that, Mr. President, is staying the course, and it is a \ncourse that inevitably leads to our defeat and the catastrophic \nconsequences for Iraq, the region, and the security of the United \nStates that our defeat would entail.\n  Yes, we have heard quite a bit about the folly of staying the course, \nthough the real outcome, should this amendment prevail and be signed \ninto law, would be to deny our generals and the Americans they have the \nhonor to command the ability to try, in this late hour, to address the \ncalamity these tried and failed tactics produced and salvage from the \nwreckage of our previous failures a measure of stability for Iraq and \nthe Middle East and a more secure future for the American people.\n  I have also listened to my colleagues on the other side repeatedly \nremind us that the American people have spoken in the last election. \nThey have demanded we withdraw from Iraq and it is our responsibility \nto do, as quickly as possible, what they have bid us to do. Is that our \nprimary responsibility? Really? Is that how we construe our role, to \nfollow without question popular opinion even if we believe it to be in \nerror and likely to endanger the security of the country we have sworn \nto defend? Surely we must be responsive to the people who have elected \nus to office and who, if it is their wish, will remove us when they \nbecome unsatisfied with our failure to heed their demands. I understand \nthat, of course. And I understand why so many Americans have become \nsick and tired of this war, given the many mistakes made by civilian \nand military leaders in its prosecution. I, too, have been made sick at \nheart by these mistakes and the terrible price we have paid for them. \nBut I cannot react to these mistakes by embracing a course of action \nthat I know will be an even greater mistake, a mistake of colossal \nhistorical proportions, which will--and I am as sure of this as I am of \nanything--seriously endanger the people I represent and the country I \nhave served all my adult life.\n  I have many responsibilities to the people of Arizona and to all \nAmericans. I take them all seriously, or I try to. But I have one \nresponsibility that outweighs all the others, and that is to do \neverything in my power to use whatever meager talents I possess and \nevery resource God has granted me to protect the security of this great \nand good Nation from all enemies foreign and domestic. And that I \nintend to do, even if I must stand to thwart popular public opinion. I \nwill explain my reasons to the American people, I will attempt to \nconvince as many of my countrymen as I can that we must show even \ngreater patience--though our patience is nearly exhausted--and that as \nlong as there is a prospect for not losing this war, then we must not \nchoose to lose it. That is how I construe my responsibility to my \nconstituency and my country. That is how I construed it yesterday, that \nis how I construe it today, and that is how I will construe it \ntomorrow. I do not know how I could choose any other course.\n  I cannot be certain that I possess the skills to be persuasive. I \ncannot be certain that even if I could convince Americans to give \nGeneral Petraeus the time he needs to determine whether we can prevail \nthat we will prevail in Iraq. All I am certain of is that our defeat \nthere would be catastrophic, not\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\njust for Iraq but for us, and that I cannot be complicit in it. I must \ndo whatever I can, whether I am effective or not, to help us try to \navert it. That, Mr. President, is all I can possibly offer my country \nat this time. It is not much compared to the sacrifices made by \nAmericans who have volunteered to shoulder a rifle and fight this war \nfor us. I know that. And I am humbled by it, as we all are. But though \nmy duty is neither dangerous nor onerous, it compels me nonetheless to \nsay to my colleagues, and to all Americans who disagree with me, that \nas long as we have a chance to succeed, we must try to succeed.\n\n  I am privileged, as we all are, to be subject to the judgment of the \nAmerican people and history. But, my friends, they are not always the \nsame judgment. The verdict of the people will arrive long before \nhistory's. I am unlikely to ever know how history has judged us in this \nhour. The public's judgment of me I will know soon enough. I will \naccept it, as I must. But whether it is favorable or unforgiving, I \nwill stand where I stand and take comfort from my confidence that I \ntook my responsibilities to my country seriously, and despite the \nmistakes I have made as a public servant and the flaws I have as an \nadvocate, I tried as best I could to help the country we all love \nremain as safe as she could be in an hour of serious peril.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues from \nMichigan and Rhode Island for their great leadership on this issue, and \nI want to say that I have a great deal of respect for my friend from \nArizona. He said we shouldn't make this debate one of sound bites, and \nthat is one of the reasons I rise.\n  Repeatedly, we have heard from the other side the slogan ``cut and \nrun.'' When they use ``cut and run,'' that is the same kind of \ndangerous, nasty sloganeering that got us into this mess to begin with. \nThe other side--some, anyway--seem to have a penchant for avoiding \nserious debate and instead use slogans as a sort of 2 by 4 to beat the \nother side into submission. Well, first, I want to assure my colleagues \nthat is not going to happen. We believe strongly in our position, and \nit is right.\n  But I want to ask my colleagues who use the slogan ``cut and run,'' \ndo they believe that 70 percent of the American people are for cut and \nrun? Because 70 percent are for withdrawal within a year. Do they \nbelieve the brave soldiers who are risking their lives for us are cut \nand run when they say to us--and many have--that this policy makes no \nsense? Do they accuse the parents of the loved ones who have died and \nwho then say they do not believe we should be there to be for cut and \nrun?\n  Let us have a serious debate, as we have had tonight, last night, and \nthis morning. Let us have a serious debate, as we have had, but let us \nnot resort to these slogans, and let us not let fear overtake policy. \nThat is why we got in the mess in the first place.\n  Let me just review for my colleagues what Levin-Reed does. Levin-Reed \nsays that we begin to withdraw in 120 days, complete the withdrawal by \nApril, and then leave what force is necessary for counterterrorism, \ntraining, and force protection. It will be a much smaller force, most \nof them will be out of harm's way, but it is decidedly not cut and run.\n  I want to ask my colleagues one more question. When the President, in \nSeptember, decides to withdraw troops, which he will have to do, given \nboth the facts on the ground and the pressures from his side of the \naisle, are those colleagues going to accuse the President of cut and \nrun?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we had a tremendous debate last night, \nand we are close to a vote today. I am proud of the debate that has \noccurred, and I hope all Senators will shortly vote on the Levin-Reed \namendment to redeploy our troops from Iraq, to refocus our fight on al-\nQaida, and to support our men and women who serve us overseas.\n  It is time for President Bush to finally accept what the American \npeople already know: the war in Iraq is not making us safer, and our \ntroops should not remain in the crossfire of that country's civil war.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush refuses to listen to the generals, to \nthe commissions, and to the experts. He stubbornly insists that leaving \nAmerican troops in the middle of a civil war will somehow cause \nfactions that have been fighting for centuries to agree to work \ntogether.\n  We have tried that approach, and we have paid dearly. We have given \nthe Iraqi Government the time to reach the agreements needed to form a \nstable government. We have done our part. The Iraqi Government has not \ndone its part.\n  We should not ask more Americans to sacrifice their lives for an \nIraqi government that is unwilling to make even the smallest sacrifices \nfor their people and their future.\n  Because the President refuses to follow a responsible path forward, \nwe in Congress must force a change in our country's policy on Iraq. For \nmonths, Democrats have been trying to force that change.\n  We have been blocked by Republicans who've continued to support the \nPresident's ``war without end.'' Now--we are starting to see \nresponsible Senators break ranks with the President and work with us to \nimprove our security.\n  The upcoming vote on the Reed-Levin amendment is a test for all \nSenators. Do they stand alone with the President, or do they support \nredeploying our troops and making. America more secure? That is the \nchoice every Senator will have to make on this vote.\n  As we look at the challenges in Iraq--and the threats around the \nworld--Democrats want to do four things; redeploy our troops from Iraq; \nrefocuses our fight on al-Qaida; rebuild our military; and respect our \nveterans.\n  That is the responsible way to protect our citizens, keep our country \nsafe, and keep our military strong.\n  We have tried the President's direction, and where had it led us? \nMore than 3,600 American service members have been killed and another \n20,000 wounded. We have spent nearly 500 billion taxpayer dollars, and \nunder the President's approach there is not end in sight.\n  It's time for a new direction, and it begins with redeploying our \ntroops.\n  Iraq's civil war cannot be solved by our military. It can only be \nsolved when the Iraqis decide for themselves that working together will \nbring them a better future.\n  As a foreign military power, we cannot force the Iraqis to set aside \ntheir differences and work together. They have to reach that conclusion \nthemselves it Iraq is to ever become a peaceful, stable country.\n  When I was in Iraq in 2005, I met with the leaders of the various \nfactions. Each of them saw themselves as representing their ``one \ngroup--not as people who needed to come together for the greater \ngood.'' Unfortunately, since my visit, those sectarian differences have \nonly gotten stronger.\n  The Iraqis have not made the progress that only they can make, and I \ndon't think we should keep asking Americans to risk their lives for an \nIraqi Government that's not doing its job.\n  So our first step must be to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. The \nReed-Levin amendment sets a firm deadline to begin the redeployment \nbeginning 120 days after enactment, and it sets April 30, 2008, as the \ndate to complete the redeployment.\n  Now this does not mean that every servicemember will be coming home. \nAs Senator Lugar said, we will need to keep some servicemembers in Iraq \nfor counterterrorism, for training, and to protect American interests. \nOther troops will be needed in other places around the globe as we stay \non the offensive against al-Qaida and other terrorists. But under this \namendment, the bulk of U.S. troops will be redeployment from Iraq.\n  Second, after we redeploy out troops, we need to refocus our energy \non defeating al-Qaida.\n  Today, the Director of National Intelligence released the latest \nNational Intelligence Estimate. The report says al-Qaida has \n``Protected and regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack \ncapability.''\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\n  The report also says that al-Qaida has established a safe haven in \nnorthwest Pakistan, has operational lieutenants, and still has its top \nleadership in place. And it is determined to strike us here at home.\n  So while the President has kept our military tied up in Iraq, al-\nQaida has been gaining strength, and we must defeat it.\n  Third, we need to rebuild our military. According to generals who \nhave testified before Congress, the war in Iraq has weakened our \nmilitary's readiness, left our equipment destroyed, hurt our ability to \nrespond to disasters at home, and left our troops without fully rounded \ntraining.\n  Today, we are forcing a very tough tempo on our servicemembers. The \nPentagon has extended tours of duties for our troops. The \nadministration has deployed troops sooner than planned.\n  The administration has sent troops without all the training and \nequipment they could have received.\n  The administration has deployed troops without the down-time at home \nthat our servicemembers and their families deserve. In fact, 56 members \nof the U.S. Senate tried to fix that last week with the Webb amendment, \nbut a majority of Republican Senators blocked us.\n  Our military is the best in the world. I believe we need to address \nthe strains on our servicemembers, so we can remain the best in the \nworld.\n  The Iraq war is also impairing our readiness by destroying our \nequipment. For example, the Army is supposed to have five brigades' \nworth of equipment pre-positioned overseas. But because of the war in \nIraq, the Army is depleting those reserves.\n  General Peter Schoomaker told the Senate in March, ``It will take us \ntwo years to rebuild those stocks.''\n  Mr. President, our military is the best in the world. I believe we \nneed to address the strains on equipment and personnel, so we can \nremain the best in the world.\n  To meet the President's surge, the Pentagon has been sending some \ntroops to Iraq earlier than planned and keeping other units there \nlonger than planned. That means that troops get less time at home, less \ntime between deployments, and less time to train.\n  Commanders are forced to shorten the training their troops receive, \nso they are focusing on the specific training they need for Iraq--but \nnot for other potential conflicts.\n  Now, that makes sense. If there's limited training time, we want all \nthat time devoted to their most immediate need. However, many military \nleaders are warning that this fast pace diminishes our ability to \nrespond to other potential conflicts.\n  Here's how the colonel who commands the 1st Marine Regiment put it:\n\n       Our greatest challenge is and will remain available \n     training time, and because that time is limited, our training \n     will continue to focus on the specific mission in Iraq. This \n     has, and will continue to, limit our ability to train for \n     other operations.\n\n  Army COL Michael Beech told the Senate in April that he believes our \ntraining strategy is broad enough to support a variety of other events. \nBut he added: ``However, if deployed in support of other emerging \ncontingencies, I would be concerned with the atrophy of some specific \ntactical skills unique to the higher-intensity conflicts.''\n  So military commanders are telling us they are concerned that our \nability to train for other missions has been limited and certain \ntactical skills have had to take a backseat to Iraq.\n  We need to make sure our troops are trained for whatever conflict \nthey might face, and changing direction in Iraq will allow us to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, the Iraq war has especially impacted the readiness of \nour National Guard. The chief of the National Guard Bureau, LTG Stephen \nBlum, testified that the readiness of National Guard forces is at an \nhistoric low. General Blum said that ``Eighty-eight percent of the \nforces that are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped \ntoday in the Army National Guard.''\n  Not only do we rely on our Guard and Reserve members around the \nworld, but we rely on them here at home to respond to natural disasters \nand emergencies. With fire season upon us on the west coast, I'm very \nconcerned that we don't have all the capabilities at home we should \nhave.\n  After the horrible tornadoes in Kansas, the Governor of Kansas said \nthat recovery efforts were hampered because there weren't enough \npersonnel or equipment. Those resources were in Iraq, not here at home.\n  COL Timothy Orr of the U.S. Army National Guard told the Senate that \nhis brigade's homeland security capabilities have been degraded. He \ntestified:\n\n       Our ability as a brigade to perform these [homeland] \n     missions continues to be degraded by continued equipment \n     shortages, substitutions, and the cross-leveling of equipment \n     between the state and nation to support our deploying units.\n\n  Finally, we need to respect our veterans. That means keeping our \npromise to meet their needs as a they come home--whether it's for \nhealthcare, benefits, education or support.\n  Since Democrats have controlled Congress, we have made dramatic \nprogress for our veterans. First we passed a budget that treated our \nveterans as a priority.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee and I was pleased to work with \nChairman Conrad to pass a budget resolution that provides over $43.1 \nbillion for veterans' care.\n  Our budget increases funding for veterans by $3.5 billion over the \nPresident's proposal; funds 98 percent of the independent budget, which \nis devised by veterans service organizations; and it rejects the higher \nfees and copayments that the President had proposed, which would have \nforced more than 100,000 veterans to leave the VA health system.\n  We also passed a supplemental that for the first time since the start \nof the war provided funding to help met the needs of our veterans.\n  We provided $1.78 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nhelp those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, to reduce the backlog \nin benefits, and to ensure medical facilities are maintained at the \nhighest level.\n  And just last week, we added the wounded warriors bill to the Defense \nauthorization bill. This proposal will address any of the problems that \ncame to light from the Walter Reed investigations. It will ensure \nservice members don't fall through the cracks as the move from the \nPentagon to the VA. It will help us diagnose, prevent and treat PTSD \nand traumatic brain injury. And it addresses the problems with unfair \ndisability ratings among other improvements.\n  Mr. President, it is time to change course in Iraq. So far the \nPresident has been unwilling to recognize the reality on the ground.\n  Here in the Senate, we have an opportunity to force the President to \nchange course in a responsible way.\n  The Reed-Levin amendment gives every Senator a choice; either you \nwant to stay the course in Iraq and leave Americans in the middle of a \nviolent civil war or you believe it's time for a change.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the responsible thing for our troops, \ntheir families, our military's readiness and the fight against terror \nby voting for this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, President Bush is fond of slogans over \nstrategy. We have heard them--``bring them on,'' ``cut and run,'' ``as \nthey stand up, we will stand down.'' As my colleague, Senator Snowe, \nand our cosponsors have pointed out, he is fond of placing hopes over \nreality. Well, the reality today is threefold.\n  First, the precise steps must be taken by Iraq's political leaders, \nand they have not done that. Second, we cannot sustain this level of \nforce past next spring because of the limits of our military structure. \nThird, the President has lost the confidence of the American people and \nthe public support, and you cannot conduct a strategy without that.\n  That is not a political comment, that is a strategic tactical \ncomment. According to the Field Manual, and I quote:\n\n       At the strategic level gaining and maintaining U.S. public \n     support for a tactical deployment is critical.\n\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\n\n  We must change our strategy in Iraq. No strategy can be sustained, \nregardless of the slogan, without the necessary troops and strong \npublic support, and in this case decisive action by the Iraqi political \nleadership. The longer we delay--the longer we delay--the more public \nsupport erodes and options to avoid a more chaotic redeployment \ndisappear.\n  To those who urge delay, to wait until September, to wait until next \nspring, I would ask them to ask several questions: First, after 4 years \nof observing the political process in Baghdad, political maneuvering \nwithout effect, do they believe 6 weeks, until September, 6 months, or \neven 6 years will fundamentally change the sectarian political dynamic \nin Baghdad, the violent struggle between Shia, who feel paranoid, and \nSunnis, who feel entitled to rule? Even on a tactical level, will 6 \nweeks or 6 months or 6 years provide irreversible progress on the \nground without the political progress necessary?\n  The Levin-Reed amendment tries to recognize the reality on the ground \nboth there and here and to shape our strategy to sustain an effort to \nserve the interest of this country, and we hope the region and the \nworld, and I urge passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Just about everybody now agrees there is no military solution in Iraq \nand that the only way to end the violence is for the Iraqi political \nleaders to settle their differences. Their own Prime Minister Maliki \nacknowledged that in November when he said, in words that all of us \nshould remember:\n\n       The crisis is political and the ones who can stop the cycle \n     of . . . bloodletting of innocents are the [Iraqi] \n     politicians.\n\n  Our brave service men and women are dying and being wounded while \nIraqi leaders dawdle. The Iraqi leaders themselves made specific \ncommitments to pass legislation relative to sharing power, sharing \nresources, amending their Constitution, holding provincial elections. \nThey made those commitments to be achieved by specific dates. They were \ntheir commitments. We didn't impose them on them. These are their \ncommitments that they have not kept. Because they have not kept their \ncommitments, our troops are paying the price, caught in a crossfire of \na civil war.\n  If there is any hope of forcing the Iraqi political leaders to take \nresponsibility for their own country, it is to have a timetable to \nbegin reducing American forces and to redeploy our forces to a more \nlimited support mission instead of being everybody's target in the \nmiddle of a civil war. That transition is the only way we can force the \nIraqi leaders to act.\n  If the Republican leader's procedural roadblock proceeds this \nmorning, we will be denied the opportunity to vote on an issue which \njust about every American has strong feelings on: whether to change \ncourse in Iraq by setting a timetable to reduce the number of our \ntroops in Iraq. Because of that procedural roadblock, we will not be \nvoting at 11 o'clock on Levin-Reed but on whether to proceed to vote on \nLevin-Reed.\n  Our amendment deserves the chance to be voted on by this body. The \nAmerican people deserve that vote. They deserve to know if we support a \ntimetable to reduce our troop presence in Iraq. They deserve to know \nwhether each of us favors a change of course in Iraq. If you do not \nagree with our amendment, vote against it. But do not prevent the \nSenate from voting on it, expressing our will on this critical issue. \nThe American people deserve for us to vote up or down, do we want to \nchange course in Iraq in order to improve the chance of success in \nIraq, which can only happen if the Iraqi leaders understand we cannot \nsave them from themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I characterized that the \nDemocratic leadership's decision to hold us here through the night as a \ntheatrical display more worthy of Hollywood than Washington. Indeed, \nanyone who watched it all unfold might have thought they were tuning in \nto an episode of the ``Twilight Zone.''\n  How else can we explain a majority party that was asked repeatedly \nthe day before to schedule a vote on the pending Levin troop withdrawal \namendment standing straight-faced on the Senate floor in front of giant \nbillboards that read: ``Let us Vote.'' How else to explain Member after \nMember standing up to rail against a 60-vote threshold that they \nfrequently insist upon themselves.\n  The junior Senator from Connecticut has embodied the best traditions \nof this country and this body throughout this entire debate. He has \ntaken a lonely stand. In acting out the freedom and the power that he \nand every other proud voice of dissent has under the Rules of this \nbody, he showed the world the greatness and the genius of our \nGovernment. Here's what Senator Lieberman had to say:\n\n       I am exercising my right within the tradition of the Senate \n     to do what senior colleagues have advised over the years--to \n     stop the passions, the political passions of a moment from \n     sweeping across Congress into law . . . so with respect to my \n     colleagues who are saying, let us vote, we will vote. But the \n     question is, on that vote, will we ask for 60 votes for pass \n     this very, very significant amendment? And I say it is in the \n     best traditions of the United States Senate to require 60 \n     votes before this amendment is adopted.\n\n  So before discussing the amendment itself, I want to thank my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Connecticut for his courage, for \nreminding us again and again, at no little personal cost to himself, \nwhat we are about in this war and what we are about in this body.\n  Last night's theatrics accomplished nothing. Nearly every major paper \nin America noted this morning that we could have had the vote on the \nLevin troop withdrawal amendment without any of this fanfare. And that \nis really all it amounted to: sound and fury, because after 24 hours of \ndebate, after all the gags and giggles and gimmicks, the cold pizza and \nthe empty cots, the essential thing remained unsaid. We still don't \nknow what the amendment we are about to vote on would mean for our \ntroops, our allies, our mission, or our interests.\n  With the Senate now in its second week of debate on the Levin \namendment, after last night's 24-hour talk-athon, I rise yet again to \nask a simple question: What would the Levin amendment do?\n  Its sponsor tried to explain on Sunday the practical effect it would \nhave. He said, ``Most of our troops would be out of there by April \n30.''\n  Can he show me where in the text it says this? He can't. It doesn't. \nThis 1\\1/2\\ page amendment contains nothing but vague assertions.\n  We need to know what the authors of this amendment intend to do with \nthis mission, what their plan is. General Petraeus deserves to know. \nOur troops deserve to know. Our allies deserve to know. The people of \nIraq deserve to know.\n  So I ask again the questions I asked last week: the Levin amendment \nsays the Secretary of Defense shall ``commence the reduction of the \nnumber of United States forces in Iraq not later than 120 days after \nthe date of the enactment of this Act.'' What would this reduction \ninvolve?\n  The Levin amendment says members of our Armed Forces will only be \nfree to protect United States and Coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, to train Iraqi Security Forces, and to engage in \n``targeted counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda.'' What does \n``targeted'' mean?\n  The senior Senator from Michigan was asked these questions by the \npress. He said he didn't want to get into a debate as to how many \ntroops will be needed. He said answering that question would be \nchanging the subject. But that is the subject, isn't it?--whether and \nhow many troops we are going to keep in Iraq.\n  Isn't that what this whole debate is about? Don't we have a right to \nknow how many troops the senior Senator from Michigan thinks are \nnecessary to achieve our goals? To prevent the mayhem our top \ncommanders have warned would be the result of a precipitous withdrawal?\n  The most important questions are left unanswered. All we have are \nvague assertions that no one, not even the sponsor of this amendment, \nhas attempted to explain with any measure of clarity.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what we do have clarity on. Let me remind\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\nthe Senate of what we agreed to in legislation in May as a framework \nfor considering our current strategy in Iraq.\n  A bipartisan majority voted 80 to 14 in May to fund General \nPetraeus's Baghdad Security Plan. We agreed that we would receive a \nreport on benchmarks in July. We voted, and put into law, that General \nPetraeus and Ambassador Crocker would report in September on progress.\n  We are now in the second week of debate on the Levin amendment, and \nwe expect several others will be filed outlining a number of different \nways of revisiting the Petraeus plan.\n  But in my judgment, the plan we put forward in May, and put into law, \nis still valid--to give General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker about \n60 more days to prepare their assessment. At that point we will have \nallowed the Baghdad Security Plan 3 months to work since it became \nfully manned last month. The benchmarks report and the timeline we set \nin May was clear. It gave us, the troops, and our allies, clarity on \nwhat was expected.\n  A Democratic-led Senate voted to 81-0 to send General Petraeus into \nIraq. A bipartisan majority of 80 senators told him in May that he had \nuntil September to report back on progress. His strategy has led to \nsome military successes. Yet just 1 month after this strategy became \nfully-manned, Democrats are declaring it a failure. Some of them were \ncalling it a failure as early as January.\n  The Levin amendment is not a credible alternative to the current \nstrategy. By aiming to short-circuit the Petraeus plan just 1 month \nafter it became fully manned and 2 months before we would expect a \nreport, we short-change ourselves and our forces on the field.\n  We need to give General Petraeus until September to do his work. That \nis a commitment we made and signed into law. We need to stand by that \ncommitment.\n  For this and the other reasons I have outlined, I will vote against \ncloture on the Levin amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. First, Mr. President, I extend my appreciation--I speak for \nall Senators, Democrats and Republicans--for the help we received this \npast 2 days from the employees who are working in the Capitol complex. \nHundreds and hundreds of employees are here every day. They were here \nall night last night, most of them with little or no rest. This great \nfacility would not operate every day but for them.\n  I am especially fond of and protective of the Capitol Police because \nI was one. But they are only the vessel about which I speak today, \nbecause it is not only the Capitol Police--and they worked long and \nhard--but it is the custodians, it is everyone including the valiant \nstaff we have seated before the Presiding Officer. If we were asked--\nany one of 100 Senators--how to get something done here without them, \nwe couldn't do it. I have been here for a quarter of a century. I could \nbe here for a quarter of a century more and still couldn't understand \nhow their important work is done. Again, speaking for all Senators, I \nsay to all who work here in the Capitol, we appreciate very much your \ntime and effort.\n  I hope these past 2 days have shined a bright light on how important \nour work is here in the Senate. The American people have spoken so many \ndifferent ways. We are, of course, faced every day with the never-\nending polls that this organization takes, that organization takes, and \na lot of times there is some variance in those poll numbers--but not \nthe last couple of months. The American public opposes the surge; they \nare opposed to the war; they want our valiant troops to come home.\n  As I wrote to the distinguished Republican leader yesterday:\n\n       There are no more solemn decisions facing Members of \n     Congress than the conduct of war and the placing of troops in \n     harm's way.\n\n  Mr. President, that is true. This I sincerely believe.\n  Last night we had an event at 9 o'clock in the park. A Congressman by \nthe name of Patrick Murphy spoke. He is from Pennsylvania. He was in \nIraq, fighting as a soldier, a few years ago. He is now a Member of \nCongress. He talked about the need for us to bring home his comrades, \nthe people who served with him. When he came home, 18 others, those \nother paratroopers in his unit, were dead.\n  What we are dealing with here is most important, most serious, and \nthat is why we have been at it for 2 days nonstop. This is one of the \nmost important decisions Members of Congress will ever be required to \nmake, especially given the stakes involved, the stakes in the Middle \nEast, in Iraq, for our military and for our national security.\n  We must proceed carefully and deliberately but proceed we must. The \nactions we take here can force a change, a change in President Bush's \nbadly failed Iraq policy. That is what the American people expect the \nSenate to do, not simply to walk in lockstep as the President continues \nto walk down this disastrous path, but to finally change direction. \nThat is our goal. That is what we must do and that is what the Levin-\nReed amendment does.\n  The amendment recognizes what General Petraeus and all the experts \nhave said from the very beginning: There is no military solution to the \nchaos in Iraq. The amendment recognizes that the more U.S. military \nforces caught policing the civil war in this country we call Iraq, it \nis not to the interests of the United States and it is not in the \ninterests of bringing stability to Iraq. The amendment recognizes we \nhave an enduring interest in Iraq, and certainly in the Middle East, \nand we will not abandon those interests.\n  Levin-Reed gives the President no choice but to change course. Levin-\nReed requires the President take the steps to responsibly end the war \nthat the country and our brave men and women in uniform demand and \ndeserve. Bring them home. Let them come home. Levin-Reed sets a firm \nstart date and a firm end date to transition the mission to begin the \nreduction of U.S. forces beginning 120 days after enactment, and to be \ncompleted by April 30, 2008.\n  Levin-Reed limits the United States mission to limit it to \ncounterterror, training, and force protection operations after April \n30, and requires that the reduction in forces be part of a \ncomprehensive diplomatic, regional, political, and economic effort, \nincluding the appointment of an international mediator.\n  I am compelled to defend the authors of this amendment. My friend, my \ncounterpart, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, ridiculed, \nbelittled this amendment. Those of us who have served in the Senate \nknow that any time Carl Levin deals with legislation, there is \nnothing--nothing--left for guesswork. Literally every ``i'' that should \nbe dotted, every ``t'' that should be crossed, every comma that should \nbe in a sentence, every semicolon that is placed there once in a while, \nwill be in that legislation. I say this with all my friends here in the \nSenate, no one is a better legislator than Carl Levin. All who have \nserved in the Senate have dealt with him. There is no way you can give \nhim something and say, Is this OK with you, but he will say, No, I have \nto read it. After he reads it, he has to study it.\n  We all know what the Levin-Reed amendment talks about. What a \ncombination. This good man from Michigan, who has devoted his life to \npublic service and has spent his Senate career in the Armed Services \nCommittee, teamed up with a graduate of West Point, Jack Reed, to whom \nwe all look for advice militarily. How many times has he been to Iraq, \n8, 10 times?\n  Why is it important that Jack Reed went to Iraq? Because he served at \nWest Point with many of the people over there now who are officers. He \ncan get information there that none of the rest of us can get. What a \ncombination. What does this combination say to the American people? \nThat there must be an end date to what is going on in Iraq.\n  Their amendment, I repeat, says there must be redeployment starting \nin 120 days. That is pretty straightforward.\n  Mr. President, I will use leader time if my time runs out.\n  It also says that redeployment will start in 120 days; that on April \n30, 2008, the forces left in Iraq according to our military will be \nused for counterterrorism activities, training the Iraqis, and \nprotecting our assets in Iraq. There is not much to speculate on what \nthat\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\nmeans. Of course, the military will set what parameters will be used in \nthose different duties they have, but the military--that is what they \ndo. So this amendment of Senators Levin and Reed is very \nunderstandable, it is direct and to the point. It is a simple, \nstraightforward, responsible amendment. It strikes the right balance \nbetween military and diplomatic solutions. It allows our Nation to \nreduce its large combat footprint in Iraq and refocus on the enemy that \nattacked the Nation nearly 6 years ago.\n  For the American people, the surge has had far too long to determine \nwhether it will work. Six months, 600 dead Americans, untold numbers \nwounded, $60 billion. This amendment allows our Nation to reduce its \nlarge combat footprint in Iraq. It gives our troops the strategy they \nneed to succeed in a very difficult environment. It is supported by an \noverwhelming majority of the American people, it is supported by a \nbipartisan majority in the Senate and, most important, it is binding.\n  President Bush has proven beyond any doubt that if we simply express \nopinion and pass ``Sense of the Senate'' legislation, if we do not put \nteeth behind our legislation, he will ignore us.\n  It could not be clearer that if we give this President a choice, he \nwill stay hunkered down in Iraq until the end of his failed Presidency.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate report released yesterday \namplifies the fact that the war in Iraq has taken our attention and \nresources away from the growing threats we face around the world. We \ncannot keep marking time while President Bush's failed war plan \ncontinues to crumble.\n  We can vote to end the war right now. Democrats are united in our \ncommitment to do so and our resolve has never been stronger. More and \nmore Republicans have come out to publicly break from the President's \nendless war strategy. They deserve credit for doing so. I commend and \napplaud them. But their words will not end the war; their votes will.\n  After 52 months of war; after more than 3,600 American dead; after \ntens of thousands more wounded; after $500 billion of our tax dollars \nspent; after chaos in Iraq has become entrenched; after no meaningful \nsigns of progress by the Iraqi Government; after the President's own \nintelligence reports indicate that the war has made us less safe and \nal-Qaida is gaining strength; after a troop escalation has only led to \nmore violence; after all of this, after all of this, isn't it time to \nchoose a new path? The answer is yes.\n  Let's choose that new path now. Let's finally answer the call of the \nAmerican people. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this \nfilibuster. I urge them to stop blocking a vote on this crucial war-\nending amendment. By voting yes on cloture, we can make this the first \nday of the end of the war.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Members would vote from \ntheir desks. I further ask unanimous consent that the Chaplain give our \ndaily player immediately following my remarks, which I have completed. \nThe reason is, otherwise, he would do it at 1 o'clock. If ever there \nwere a time for prayer, it would be before this very important vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we vote from our desks. I have cleared \nthis with the Republican leader, and ask that the Chaplain be now \ncalled upon to render the prayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to the order of February 29, 1960, as modified this day, the \nSenate, having been in continuous session, will suspend for a prayer by \nthe Chief of Staff to the Senate Chaplain, Alan N. Keiran.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9434-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9434-S9436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  Eternal Father, Creator of the season, as the Members of this body \nrun a legislative marathon, may they feel Your devine presence. Allow \ncontact with You to calm their fears, to silence their anxiety, to hush \ntheir restlessness and to fill them with Your peace. Strengthen them so \nthat they are not weary in pursuing a worthy goal knowing that a \nharvest awaits those who persevere in doing Your will.\n  Give them gratitude for the opportunities You have given them to be \nstewards of our national destiny. And as You remind them that to whom \nmuch is given, much is expected.\n  We pray for Your will to be done here in this Chamber as in heaven. \nIn Your mighty Name I pray. Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Levin-Reed, \n     et al., amendment No. 2087, to H.R. 1585, Department of \n     Defense Authorization, 2008.\n         Carl Levin, Ted Kennedy, Byron L.

On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the Levin-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been a long week, and it is hard to \ncomprehend, but it is only Wednesday, Wednesday morning. We have now \nbeen in session continuously for 2 days. On Monday, I submitted a \nsimple request for consent to proceed to an up-or-down vote on the \nLevin-Reed amendment to the Defense authorization bill. As I have \nstated, this amendment provides a clear, binding responsible path to \nchange the U.S. mission and reduce our combat presence in Iraq. It \nhonors the sacrifice of our troops, reflects the will of the American \npeople, and lets us rebuild and focus our military on the growing \nthreats we face throughout the world.\n  Regrettably, Republicans chose to block this amendment. They chose to \nblock a bipartisan amendment, Mr. President, to deny the American \npeople an up-or-down vote. They chose to continue protecting their \nPresident instead of our troops, no matter the cost to our country.\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\n  In contrast, my Democratic colleagues and a number of brave \nRepublicans came to the floor of the Senate throughout the night to \nmake our case. I am proud of what they have said and what they have \ndone. We spent 2 days showing America that we are not going to back \ndown, we are going to continue to fight, and that if President Bush and \nhis allies in Congress refuse to budge, we will continue to show them \nthe way.\n  How could we possibly shrink from this fight? How could we possibly \ntry to avoid this fight? As we speak, many of our 160,000 men and women \nserving in Iraq are wrapping up another day of war, real war on foreign \nsands. For them, it was yet another day caught in an intractable civil \nwar, Sunni versus Shia, Shia versus Sunni, Shia versus Shia, Sunni \nversus Sunni, and--what other combinations can we come up with--with \nour troops caught in the crossfires, our troops trying to protect the \nShias, Sunnis, and the Kurds, and all of them after our troops.\n  As the Iraqi people have said in poll after poll, about 70 percent of \nthem think we are doing more harm in their country than good.\n  The high temperature today in Iraq was about 115 degrees, and our \ntroops were wearing about 100 pounds of equipment. This was the 1,583rd \nday of the war. They have served us each and every day with courage, \ndespite being taken to war falsely, prematurely, and recklessly. They \nhave served us each and every day with courage and valor, despite a \nPresident who still lacks a plan for success. They have served us each \nand every day with courage, despite too many in Congress who remain \nunwilling to change course.\n  Those 160,000 troops deserve more. They and all Americans deserve a \ndebate and votes on legislation that will finally provide them a \nstrategy to honor their great sacrifice.\n  As we have just seen, a bipartisan majority of the Senate supports \nLevin-Reed. A bipartisan majority of the Senate supports a binding new \npolicy that would responsibly bring the war to an end so we can return \nour focus and resources to the real threats and challenges our great \ncountry faces. Yet a Republican minority blocked a vote on the \nbipartisan amendment that would deliver that new course, and instead \nthey chose to stand behind the President and this tragic failure he has \nled.\n  So today I am filled with a mixture of pride and regret--pride for my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, who have risen to this crucial \ncause in giving the American people the debate they deserve, yet regret \nfor my colleagues who have blocked the will of the people and the \nmajority of this Congress. I believe the will of the people must be \nheeded, and I believe this critical vote must proceed.\n  In an effort to make progress on this issue and this bill, I will, \ntherefore, request unanimous consent to move to a vote on the four Iraq \namendments to the Defense authorization bill outlined yesterday morning \nin my letter to Senator McConnell. My unanimous consent request is \neminently fair. It would provide up-or-down, yes-or-no votes on three \nother bipartisan Iraq amendments in exchange for the same on Levin-\nReed.\n  Under my proposal, we would vote on these Iraq amendments: Levin-\nReed, Lugar-Warner, Salazar-Alexander, and Nelson-Collins. In addition, \nI also indicated in my letter that I am prepared to agree to up-or-down \nvotes on other amendments as well.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate considers the following Iraq amendments, they be subject to \nmajority votes: the pending Levin-Reed amendment, the Byrd-Clinton \ndeauthorization amendment, the Warner-Lugar amendment No. 2208, the \nSalazar-Alexander Iraq Study Group amendment, the Nelson-Collins \namendment No. 2124, and Senator Landrieu's al-Qaida amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, not many \nAmericans of our generation have failed to see the movie \n``Casablanca.'' There are many memorable lines in that movie. My \nfavorite was uttered by the actor, Claude Rains, when he walked into \nthe casino and said incredulously: ``Gambling in Casablanca?'' Followed \nby the comment: ``Round up the usual suspects.''\n  Sixty votes in the Senate? As common as gambling in Casablanca.\n  I think we can stipulate, and my good friends on the other side of \nthe aisle stipulated from time to time over the years when they were in \nthe minority, that in the Senate it takes 60 votes on controversial \nmatters. What is more controversial than the war in Iraq? Of course, it \nis going to take 60 votes. No one in the galleries and certainly no one \nin this town and even casual observers of the Senate across the country \nwould be surprised that on a controversial matter of this consequence \nit would require 60 votes.\n  Now the leader has also made some observations about the status of \nthe war. Most Members on this side of the aisle don't believe it is any \naccident that we haven't been attacked again since 9/11. They believe \nit is because we have been on the offense in places such as Afghanistan \nand Iraq, and we have taken it to the enemy. A lot of them are dead, \nmany of them are in Guantanamo, and the rest are on the run.\n\n  There is no plan after the Levin amendment. Withdraw, and then what? \nWhat happens then? We haven't been dodging this debate. We offered to \nhave the Levin amendment voted on yesterday. The only reason we stayed \nin all night was to provide a bit of theater on an extraordinarily \nimportant issue.\n  This is a serious debate. Members on this side of the aisle engaged \nin this debate throughout the evening. We were not afraid of the \ndebate, but we certainly were not delaying the vote. We would have been \nhappy to have the vote at any point over the last few days.\n  So, Mr. President, the request was that we have additional Iraq \nvotes----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With a simple majority.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we have order?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not a movie in which we are \ninvolved. This is a debate on one of the most serious issues this \ncountry has ever faced. Thousands of Americans have been killed in \nIraq, tens of thousands have been wounded, and we are depleting the \nNational Treasury by more than half a trillion dollars. But my \ndistinguished friend's statement clearly indicates what has happened in \nIraq since we last took up this debate.\n  We passed the Defense authorization bill last November. We had Iraq \namendments then. There were no 60-vote margins. But in the last 7 \nmonths since that debate took place, this war has gone in the wrong \ndirection--in the wrong direction. That direction is the way that \nPresident Bush has managed this war. That is why all of a sudden now \nthat 7 months has gone by with thousands more Americans being wounded, \nand hundreds and hundreds more being killed, suddenly this is an issue \nthat requires 60 votes.\n  If there were ever a picture, look at what happened last November and \nlook what happened today. Of course, they need 60 votes because all \nthese amendments would pass with simple majority--all of them, every \none of them telling the President he should change course. The \ndifference is how to tell the President to change course. The Levin-\nReed amendment did it by mandating a timeline.\n  I am disappointed to see that my friend is leading the Republicans to \nobstruction over progress. I understand the Senate rules. Other than \nthis man sitting behind me, I think I know the rules about as well as \nanyone in this Chamber. I understand the Senate rules allow for \nminority filibuster over the will of the majority, but that is not the \ntradition of this bill, and it should not be the path that is chosen \ngiven the stakes involved.\n  But because Republicans continue to block votes on important \namendments to the Defense authorization bill, we can make no further \nprogress on Iraq and this bill at this time.\n  Progress is also blocked by two other troubling realities. First of \nall, more than 300 amendments have been filed. We have not been able to \nget a finite list of amendments for consideration. Majority and \nminority staffs of the Armed Services Committee have been\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\nunable to work in a bipartisan manner to clear large numbers of routine \namendments due to the objections of one or two Members on the other \nside of the aisle. The chairman and ranking member have been able to \nclear amendments in this fashion for as long as I can remember, but not \nthis year, not with this handful of dedicated obstructionists--not all \nbut a few.\n  Seated in this front row is one of the managers of this bill, Senator \nJohn McCain. John McCain is not known for putting things in managers' \namendments that shouldn't be in managers' amendments. If there ever was \na guardian of something in a managers' amendment, it is the senior \nSenator from Arizona. But in spite of that, in spite of his reputation, \nthe reality is that no one puts anything in a managers' amendment \nunless this man looks it over--and he is a comanager of this bill--and \nwe still haven't been able to clear these managers' amendments.\n  For these and other reasons, I temporarily laid aside the Defense \nauthorization bill and entered a motion to reconsider. But let me be \nclear to all my colleagues, and especially my Republican colleagues, I \nemphasize the word ``temporarily.'' We will do everything in our power \nto change course in Iraq. We will do everything in our power to \ncomplete consideration of the Defense authorization bill. Why? Because \nwe must do both.\n  I remind my Republican colleagues, even if this bill had passed \nyesterday, even if this bill passed today, its provisions would not \ntake effect until next October.\n  So we will come back to this bill as soon as it is clear that we can \nmake real progress. I have spoken with Senator Levin, the manager on \nthis side. I have spoken with the assistant leader, the whip, Senator \nDurbin. I have asked them to sit down with their counterparts, Senator \nMcCain and Senator Lott, to work on a process to address these \noutstanding issues, especially the managers' amendment, so that the \nSenate can return to it as soon as possible.\n  In the meantime, we will continue to work with our Republican \ncolleagues who are saying the right things--a number of them, a \nsignificant number of them--on Iraq but aren't yet committed to voting \nin the right way. But we will get there. As Gladstone once said:\n\n       You cannot fight against the future. You cannot fight \n     against the future. Time is on our side.\n\n  In this case, time and the American people are also on our side. The \nLevin-Reed amendment would allow us to rebuild our badly overburdened \nmilitary and return our focus to the real security threats posed by al-\nQaida and other terrorist organizations.\n  I think it is important, Mr. President, that I mention the other \nprocedural roadblock that was thrown up trying to do this bill: the \nWebb amendment. What did the Webb amendment do? If you are in country \n15 months, serving in the military, you should be able to stay home for \n15 months. There was a procedural block.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment would allow us, as I have indicated, to take \na look at our overburdened military and do something about it and \nreturn our focus to the real security threats posed by al-Qaida and \nother terrorist organizations. As the new National Intelligence \nEstimate makes very clear, these growing threats demand our attention.\n  In today's newspaper, and there are other places, but here is only \none headline: ``Problems Spur Efforts in Protection of Federal \nBuildings.'' The Homeland Security Agency needs more help, is what this \nnews story is all about.\n  President Bush likes to say we must fight the terrorists in Iraq so \nwe do not have to fight them at home, but we all know there were no al-\nQaida forces in Iraq prior to the war. And as the President's own \nintelligence experts admit, the war has only stoked the flames of \nterrorists and made us more vulnerable to attack.\n  These experts concluded in the National Intelligence Estimate that \nthe threat to our homeland is growing as al-Qaida has regenerated its \ncapacity to launch attacks. While the Bush administration's \npreoccupation with Iraq has prevented us from addressing that threat, \nthere is important action the Senate can take and should take.\n  Therefore, I am going to ask unanimous consent to move to \nconsideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill, chaired by \ntwo of our most senior Members, Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Thad \nCochran. This critically important legislation provides $37.6 billion \nfor Homeland Security activities. It is more than the President asked, \n$2.3 billion. This bill was reported unanimously by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee--unanimously--and it will give the Senate an \nopportunity to show who is serious about protecting America from \nterrorist attacks.\n  I would hope that given the urgency of the national security issue, \nas highlighted by the National Intelligence Estimate and the need to \nmake progress on appropriations bills, we can move to consideration of \nthis most important bill.\n  The President, in his Saturday address 2 weeks ago this coming \nSaturday, said: Why aren't we doing appropriations bills? Well, we have \nan opportunity to do a very important appropriations bill dealing with \nhomeland security. Our security--not dealing with Iraq, not dealing \nwith Afghanistan--dealing with our security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9436-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9436-S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2008--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

I would really like to take it up now. That is why I asked \nthis consent. I am sorry if there was some confusion in that regard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was my understanding the majority leader was \nplanning to go to a reconciliation bill next and then try to get \nunanimous consent to go to this next week.\n  Mr. REID. The only reason I was doing that, of course, is that there \nwas an inkling from your floor staff you would object to us going to \nthis immediately.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to object in the short term, and we can \ndiscuss it privately because I think there is a chance we can do that \nshortly. But for the moment I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now withdraw the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me just say a few more words. We have \nbeen prevented from acting on the 9/11 recommendations. I should say \nthat now we are in conference, and I am so appreciative of that. I \nunderstand Chairman Lieberman is going to hold his first meeting \ntomorrow. It took a while\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nto get there, but that is important. But we also need to change the \ncourse in Iraq, and that didn't happen, and so now we have this.\n  We have all seen and heard reports that our intelligence community \nhas concluded that al-Qaida's strength has grown to its 9/11 levels, \nand the statement of the Secretary of Homeland Security that he has a \ngut feeling we are at greater risk of being attacked this summer by \nterrorists. In spite of all this, we have just seen an example of \nobstructionism that has slowed down and prevented the Senate from \nconsideration of this bill today.\n  The latest obstruction would delay important investments. This \nHomeland Security bill does lots of things. We just finished the \nimmigration debate. This is not as good for border security as the \nimmigration bill would have been--I don't expect we will do that debate \ntoday--but it does do some good things. This bill hires 3,000 more \nBorder Patrol agents and provides 4,000 more detention beds. When \nsomeone is picked up, they will have a place to put them. This provides \n$400 million for port security grants. This bill provides $1.83 billion \nfor State and local first responders. And one other example is that \nthis bill provides monies for the purchase and installation of \nexplosive detection equipment at airports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9437-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

We have just seen a procedure in the last 24 hours \nwhich has been a colossal waste of time.\n  The time to have a showdown with the President was either on the \nfunding request, which was 2 months ago, or in September. There was no \nway there would have been sufficient votes to have 60 votes or 67 votes \nto have anything meaningful done. And speaking for myself, having been \nin this body for a substantial period of time, I think what has \nhappened in the past 24 hours has been an indignity.

And I would also----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The leader speaks at great length about if another \nMember seeks to speak, he ought to be accorded that privilege.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he is going to have all day to talk. He has \nthe right to object, and he did that. We listened to his statement.\n  We believe the American people were entitled to have 2 days, at least \n2 days of debate on the Levin-Reed amendment to change the course in \nIraq. He may disagree. I would bet, with all due respect to my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania, that the people of Pennsylvania \nwant a change of course in the intractable war in which we find \nourselves in Iraq.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. So the Senator can talk about a waste of time. But I move \nto proceed to H.R. 2669, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Presdient, I rise today to express my surprise that \nthere is actually an objection to taking up the fiscal year 2008 \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill today. The bill, which was \nreported by the Appropriations Committee by a vote of 29-0, provides \n$37.6 billion to help secure the homeland. That includes funds to \nsecure our borders, funds to hire 3,000 more border patrol agents, and \nfunds to provide 4,000 more detention beds. It includes funds for the \nmen and women of the Coast Guard to guard our ports and seaways. It \nincludes funds to protect 2 million citizens who travel by air every \nday, including money to inspect air cargo on passenger aircraft. There \nare funds to implement the SAFE Port Act. We include funds to equip and \ntrain our police, fire, and emergency medical personnel to deal with \nany disaster.\n  Incredibly, the President has threatened to veto the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill because it exceeds his request. Today, we \nhave heard an objection to even debating the bill from a Member on the \nPresident's side of the aisle.\n  Just last week, the Secretary of Homeland Security publicly said that \nit was his ``gut feeling'' that the United States faces an increased \nthreat of attack this summer. Shouldn't that wake us up to the need to \npass this bill?\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\n  On the heels of the Secretary's warnings, yesterday, the \nadministration released its latest National Intelligence Estimate \nconcerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. I will quote from \nthe report:\n\n       We judge the U.S. Homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qa'ida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the Homeland and a continued effort by these terrorist \n     groups to adapt and improve their capabilities . . . . [W]e \n     judge that al-Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put \n     operatives here. As a result, we judge that the United States \n     currently is in a heightened threat environment. . . . We \n     assess that al-Qa'ida's Homeland plotting is likely to \n     continue to focus on prominent political, economic, and \n     infrastructure targets with the goal of producing mass \n     casualties, visually dramatic destruction, significant \n     economic aftershocks, and/or fear among the U.S. population.\n\n  Those are the words written by the best intelligence analysts in our \nGovernment. Is anybody listening? Hear me. Is anybody listening? Let me \nsay this again to see if anybody is listening. Pay attention. I will \nquote again from the report. This is the latest national intelligence \nestimate concerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. Man, you \nbetter listen to that. You better listen. Hear me out there. I will \nquote again from the report.\n\n       We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next 3 years.\n\n  You better pay attention.\n\n       The main threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and \n     cells, especially al-Qaida, driven by their undiminished \n     intent to attack the homeland--\n\n  Our homeland. Your homeland. My homeland.\n\n     and a continued effort by these terrorist groups to adapt and \n     improve their capabilities. We judge that al-Qaida will \n     intensify its efforts to put operatives here. Here.\n\n  Not somewhere else, here.\n\n       As a result, we judge that the United States currently is \n     in a heightened threat environment. We assess that al-Qaida's \n     homeland plotting is likely to continue to focus on prominent \n     political, economic, and infrastructure targets, with the \n     goal of producing mass casualties, visually dramatic \n     destruction, significant economic aftershocks, and/or fear \n     among the population.\n\n  Those are the words, not by Robert C. Byrd, these are the words \nwritten by the best intelligence analysts in our Government. Is anybody \nlistening? Is anybody listening? I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, \nbless his heart, he is one of the greatest Senators of all time, is \nanybody listening? You can bet the American public is listening.\n  My hope, the people out there looking at this floor, they are \nlistening. The people out there on the highways and the byways, the \nmountains, the valleys, those warnings should compel our Government, \nboth in the executive and legislative branches, to get our priorities \nstraight.\n  It is the safety of the American people that matters here. Let me say \nthat again. It is the safety of the American people, that is all 300 \nmillion of them, it is the safety of the American people that matters \nhere, not some political ping-pong between the President and the \nCongress. Our mission must be to prevent terrorist attacks against this \ncountry.\n  In light of the concerns raised by his own administration about the \nthreat of another terrorist attack, I call on the President, I call on \nthe President to pull back on his veto threat. Pull back. I plead with \nall the Senators to allow this body to do the people's business and to \nproceed to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. The peoples' \nsafety is at stake. Delay is foolish.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy letter to the President, dated today, on this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2007.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President:\n\n       ``We judge the U.S. Homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years.

[W]e \n     judge that al-Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put \n     operatives here. As a result, we judge that the United States \n     currently is in a heightened threat environment.''\n\n       Those are the words contained in the declassified National \n     Intelligence Estimate, released yesterday. Those are the \n     words written by the best intelligence analysts in our \n     government. Those are the words that should force our \n     government--both in the Executive and Legislative branches--\n     to reevaluate the priority that we are giving to funding to \n     stop terrorist attacks against this country.\n       The Senate Committee on Appropriations has approved \n     legislation investing $37.6 billion in the nation's highest-\n     priority security projects. These dollars would be put to use \n     immediately, toughening border security with new agents, \n     better technology, and stricter immigration enforcement to \n     close gaps that terrorists could exploit (as did the 9/11 \n     hijackers). These dollars would help to shut down the \n     dangerous gaps in security at U.S. seaports. The legislation \n     would make serious investments in security at the nation's \n     airports, deploying new canine teams and screening technology \n     at airports nationwide to detect explosives and radiation in \n     cargo loaded onto passenger aircraft. The funds would provide \n     critical support for police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency medical teams--the first line of response to any \n     attack.\n       Unfortunately, you have threatened to veto the homeland \n     security funding legislation. In light of the new analysis \n     from our intelligence experts and the warnings that they and \n     Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff have voiced, I urge you \n     to reconsider this veto threat.\n       With the concerns outlined by your Administration's top \n     experts, and with the glaring gaps that continue to exist in \n     our homeland security protections, we must come together in \n     the best interests of the American people. It is their lives \n     and their futures in danger. Posturing will not protect the \n     people from attack. Smart investments in their security will.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The senior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to conclude \nthe statements I had made earlier today after being interrupted by the \nSenator from Nevada, that I might say accurately, rudely interrupted.\n  I was speaking in the context of reserving a right to object to a \nunanimous consent request, and the technical rules provide that \nspeeches may not be made but only an objection lodged. But it has been \nthe common practice in this body to allow a Senator who reserves the \nright to object to make a statement as to why the objection is being \nlodged.\n  This is in reply to the Senator asking unanimous consent and who has \nspoken at some length to give the reasons why an objection is being \nlodged. When the majority leader cut me off, then made reference to \nwhat the people of Pennsylvania want, the last time I looked, Senator \nCasey and Senator Specter represented the people of Pennsylvania, not \nSenator Harry Reid.\n  When he talks about my State, then he talks about me, and he raises \nan intonation that I did not know what my constituents want. I at least \nought to have an opportunity to reply because I think I know more about \nPennsylvania than Senator Reid does.\n  But to be cut off in that context was rude, to say the minimum. There \nare rules and there are customs, there are accepted practices. It is \nthe custom of this body, when a Senator reserves a right to object and \nseeks to make a statement, to let him make the statement. That is the \ncustom and that is the accepted practice. When the majority leader \ntalks about the rules, we saw on the immigration bill how one Senator \ncan tie this place up in knots, can bring the Senate to a screeching \nhalt by utilizing the rules: asking for the full text of amendments be \nread, asking that the previous day's business be read. The rules would \npermit any Senator to stop the Senate in its tracks from doing any \nbusiness.\n  So there is something more than the rules. There is the custom and \nthere is the accepted practice that if the Senate does not run on \ncomity, on courtesy, on basic decency, the Senate cannot run at all.\n  Now, I had made the comment about reserving the right to object \nbecause I strenuously object to what has transpired in this body in the \npast 24 hours. We had a meaningless, insulting, all-night session for \nabsolutely no purpose. It was an indignity to the Senators who were \nkept here all night to vote on a procedure that had no purpose \nwhatsoever. The Senate luxuriates in its\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\nreputation as the world's greatest deliberative body. But last night's \nperformance made us the laughingstock of the world. There was no way \nthat anything meaningful would happen as a result of a vote on the \nLevin-Reed amendment. There is no doubt that there are not 67 votes \npresent to override a veto. There is little doubt that there are not 60 \nvotes present to bring the issue to a vote.\n  So what were we doing on an all-night session? The majority leader \nstated the purpose was to show the American people he would not back \ndown. Well, I think he showed the American people how ineffective he \nis. The time when the majority leader and the Democratic leadership in \nthe Congress could have asserted itself was on the supplemental \nappropriations bill. That was the bill which the President needed to \ncontinue funding the war in Iraq. We were out of money. It took $100 \nbillion, approximately, to move forward. That was the point where, as \nthe majority leader said, he wanted a majority of 51-vote majority to \nexpress the will of the Congress, it could have been done.\n  The Democratic leadership in the Congress backed down. I thought they \ndid so appropriately in a contest with the President because the safety \nof the troops was involved. But that was the time to take a stand if \nthe majority leader wanted to have a vote of 51.\n  When he takes down the Department of Defense authorization bill, it \nis not his bill alone, it is not just the Levin-Reed amendment, there \nare a lot of other provisions in that bill.\n  Senator Leahy and I had an important amendment on habeas corpus which \nis relevant to the operation of the Department of Defense and \nGuantanamo, and the detention of many men who have been denied rights \nestablished in 1215 under the Magna Carta, and this body unadvisedly, \nerroneously legislated to take away that habeas right.\n  I continue to think it would be corrected in the courts, but that is \nanother matter too lengthy to go into now. But Senator Leahy and I had \nthat amendment pending. Senator Kerry and I and others have an \namendment pending on signing statements, where the President has \ndisregarded the legislation passed by the Congress to cherry-pick and \nadd limitations in so-called signing statements.\n  There was also an amendment which this Senator had proposed to bring \nup for a vote on rendition. So there was a great deal more to be done \non this bill than Iraq alone.\n  But with respect to Iraq, there were other amendments which ought to \nbe considered, and which should have been considered, without the \nmajority leader taking the bill down. We could have debated the Levin-\nReed amendment in a few hours and we could have debated the Warner-\nLugar amendment in a few hours and we could have debated the Salazar-\nAlexander amendment in a few hours and we could have done it during the \ndaytime yesterday, instead of having quorum calls consume the time of \nthe Senate when nothing is done here, until the majority leader decides \nto exercise his power to keep the Senate in all night on a meaningless, \ninsulting session.\n  But there are important matters to be debated on what Senator Warner \nand Senator Lugar have proposed. They have suggested, and they filed an \namendment, directing the President to prepare a plan by October 16, a \nplan which would contemplate withdrawal starting December 31. But it \ndid not tell the President he had to do it, and there is a serious \nconstitutional question with the President's authority as Commander in \nChief. Certainly, Congress cannot micromanage the war. The question \nabout putting limitations on Presidential authority is a tough issue, \nbut it would be well to have the President plan for a contingency.\n  We know the planning has been insufficient, no planning as to what \nwould happen after Saddam Hussein fell. So when Senator Warner and \nSenator Lugar wanted to put that forward, we should have debated it. \nWhen it calls for consideration of withdrawal on December 31, we should \nhave debated it. When they call in that amendment for another \nresolution defining the scope of the President's authority on the war, \nwe should have debated it.\n  Senator Salazar and Senator Alexander had an amendment which would \nincorporate the findings of the Iraq Study Group. I was seriously \nconsidering, still am considering, cosponsoring those amendments. I \nthink had we known Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass \ndestruction, we would not have gone into Iraq. But once in Iraq, we do \nnot want to leave it in an unstable situation and in turmoil. We have \nhad very forceful statements from very prominent Republican supporters \nof the President that if there is not real progress, significant \nprogress by September, the funding will not be continued. I have said \nthat if we do not have the metaphor of ``a light at the end of a \ntunnel'' by September, that funding is in serious question. But those \nare not matters which we are going to decide in July; those are matters \nwhich we will decide in September.\n  After we have the report by General Petraeus and after we have the \nPresident's report, we will make a judgment as to what we will do in \nSeptember. That was the import of the appropriations bill which we \npassed 2 months ago, funding through September 30. The issue of funding \nfor the next fiscal year is one which this Congress will have to decide \nwhen the issue is ripe. I am uncertain as to what my vote will be. But \nI do believe that if there is not a light at the end of the tunnel, \nthat it is a very questionable matter to proceed indefinitely because \nof the failure of the Iraqis to live up to their commitments to end \nsectarian violence, to deal with the legislative proposals in their \nParliament on oil revenues and many other matters.\n  But I hope we will see a reevaluation of what is going to be done in \nthe Senate.\n  This body is very different than it was when I was elected in 1980, \nvery different from what it was when Senator Byrd was elected in 1958 \nand Senator Biden was elected in 1972. With Senator Byrd and Senator \nBiden, there is real comity, and so with Senator Leahy and myself on \nJudiciary and Senator Harkin and myself on the appropriations \nsubcommittee. But that is the exception, regrettably, rather than the \nrule around here. When a Senator seeks to speak, he ought to be \naccorded some basic courtesy and comity on what is custom and what is \npractice.\n  I had a short talk with Senator Lott after the majority leader \ninterrupted me, and Senator Lott said the majority leader did the same \nthing to him a couple of days ago. When Senator Lott was majority \nleader, he didn't have that practice. Senator Lott said the majority \nleader wanted to publicly apologize. Senator Lott said: Not necessary. \nPublic apologies don't mean much.\n  It doesn't mean much to make this speech to an empty Chamber, \nfrankly. The time I should have been heard was when Senators were on \nthe floor, when Senators were considering what the majority leader had \ndone in taking down the bill. That is when it was right.\n  As I sat here waiting for time to speak and consulting with the \nmanagers of the bill to get their consent, the majority leader came \nover and said: I will see to it that you get recognized first. I said: \nNo, thanks, I will get myself recognized. There is a time when no one \nelse is around and on a jump ball a Senator can get recognized.\n  Those practices, I think, are not only rude but dictatorial--\ndictatorial to flout the custom and the practice of this body and to go \nback to technical rules. If those technical rules are applied, and any \none of us can do it, this body will cease to function.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes. I consulted \nwith Senator Kennedy. I ask that my time be counted under \nreconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I share the frustration of my friend from \nPennsylvania. I remember when my colleague, Senator Byrd, whom I still \ncall the leader, was leader when I got here after Senator Mansfield. \nHow things have changed in many ways.\n  One of the things that has changed is what we saw take place today. \nHere the single most critical issue facing the United States of America \ntoday--the\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\ncarnage that is taking place in Iraq, the fact that our blood and \ntreasure is being spilled with no apparent end in sight--and the notion \nthat we would have to resort to a filibuster to stop a vote when a \nclear majority of Senators who believe there is an urgent need to \nchange course in Iraq is not only dismaying but the consequence of it, \nI believe, is to kick the can down the road another 2 to 3 months and, \nin the meantime, many Americans are going to be injured and killed, \nwhich I believe can be avoided.\n  Ever since the Democrats took back the Congress, we have been working \nto build pressure on the administration and, quite frankly, a number of \nour Republican colleagues to change course in Iraq because I don't \nbelieve there are a dozen Republican Senators who agree with the \nPresident's present position. I don't believe there are a dozen \nRepublican Senators who believe the results are going to be \nfundamentally different on September 5 than they are today, although I \nrespect the fact that they concluded they want to wait to give the \nPresident every opportunity to demonstrate his plan can work.\n  Here is the problem, with all due respect. The problem is we are \nfaced with two false choices in the Congress. One is put forward by the \nadministration and sustained by a minority of votes that says we should \ncontinue to do what we are doing and essentially hand off the problem \nto the next President. I don't know anybody who believes that through \nescalating this conflict, adding American forces, there is any \nreasonable prospect that would bring about the only thing that will end \nthis war, and that is a political settlement among the Iraqis.\n  Then there are a number of Democrats who have a view, out of \nfrustration, that we must begin to get out of there, get out and hope \nfor the best. Their premise is: Look, there isn't any reasonable \nprospect of us being able to do this militarily, and the hope is that \nsomehow if we get out, the Iraqis, the Kurds, the Sunnis, and the Shias \nwill have a bit of an epiphany, as we Catholics say, that they will get \ntogether and say: Oh, my goodness, America is leaving and we better get \ntogether and settle our differences or things are going to completely \nimplode.\n  The fundamental flaw in all of that thinking, in my humble opinion--I \nknow I am like a broken record, I have been saying it for over 3 years \nand I laid out a concrete plan over a year ago--the fundamental flaw is \nthere is no possibility in the lifetime of any Member of this Senate \nfor there to be a coherent central government in Baghdad that has the \nability to gain the faith and trust of the people of Iraq and the \nability to govern that country. It will not happen. Mark my words. \nThere is no possibility of that happening. Never, to my research, have \nI ever found there has been a situation where there has been a self-\nsustaining cycle of sectarian violence, a self-sustaining civil war, \nwhich is exactly what we have now in Iraq, that it has ever ended in \nany other than one of four ways: a major power goes in and occupies the \ncountry for a generation or more, not an option available for us, nor \nis it in our DNA to do that. We are not the British Empire; we are not \nthe Ottoman Empire; we are not the Persian Empire; nor do we want to \nbe.\n\n  The second option is: Install a dictator. Wouldn't that be the \nultimate irony for the United States of America to install a dictator?\n  The third option: Pick a side. Wage in on one side of the sectarian \nviolence, wipe out the other side. That is not a good option. A, it \nwould be immoral; B, it would take a couple years and; C, it would \nignite a Sunni-Shia revolution from the Mediterranean to the Himalayas.\n  There is a fourth way it can end, and that is establish a federal \nsystem within the country separating the parties, giving them control \nof the fabric of their daily lives, their own security forces in their \nown neighborhoods, their own laws relating to religion, education, \nmarriage, divorce, property, jobs, a federal system.\n  Coincidentally, that is exactly what the Iraqi Constitution calls for \nin article I. It says: We are a decentralized federal system.\n  Absent a political settlement, there is no way--I will make the \nprediction I shouldn't make because I have been around here long enough \nto know that everything you say on this floor you are reminded of if \nyou turn out to be wrong. If you are right, you are never reminded of \nit. If you turn out to be wrong, you are reminded of it whether it is 6 \nmonths, 12 months or 12 years later.\n  I honestly believe, absent a radical change in course resulting in a \nfederal system existing in Iraq, the only option the next President of \nthe United States is going to have is going to be a reenactment of the \nscene in Saigon, with helicopters lifting people off the roofs of the \nembassy in the green zone. That is how it is going to end, in disaster.\n  Not only do I not want my son who is a captain in the U.S. National \nGuard going to Iraq, I don't want my grandson going or my \ngranddaughter. How we leave Iraq, what shape we leave it in, what \nprospect for a political settlement exists will determine whether my \ngrandson goes back 15 years from now.\n  All we did today was take what was originally called the Biden-Hagel, \net cetera, resolution that we introduced in January, then the Biden-\nLevin resolution, then the Levin-Reed-Biden, et al, now the Levin-Reed \namendment. They all do the same thing. There is not a dime's worth of \ndifference.\n  What they all said was this: Mr. President, the first thing you do \nwhen you are in a hole is stop digging; stop digging us deeper into \nthis disaster. Cease and desist from placing our troops in the midst of \na civil war. We are in the midst of a civil war. The ``success'' we are \nhaving in Anbar Province, what is it doing? It is making the Shia \nconclude we are arming and engaging with the Sunnis and the former \nBaathists, making it harder for us to get the Shia to agree to action \non the oil law, which would be the thing to get the Sunnis to buy into \na united Iraq.\n  We are in the midst of a civil war, and the whole thesis of the idea \nwe came forward with as early as January and we voted on again today is \nto say: Get out of that civil war. Use American forces for only three \nexpress purposes: One, train the Iraqi Army; two, deny al-Qaida \noccupation of large swaths of territory, particularly in Anbar \nProvince; and three, protect our diplomats there.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, last week we heard President \nBush give a progress report on Iraq. It reminded me of a guy who jumps \noff a 100-story building and as he passes the 50th floor, somebody \nyells out: How's it going? And he yells back: So far so good. That is \nthe summary of the President's report, except it is not even going well \nso far and the outcome is absolutely certain: continued disaster.\n  Also, last week, Bob Woodward revealed that back in November, CIA \nDirector Michael Hayden made the very point I have been making for 2 \nyears in a private meeting with the Iraqi Study Group. He said:\n\n       The inability of the central Government to govern is \n     irreversible.\n\n  There is ``no milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing \naround.'' The CIA then went on to say:\n\n       We have spent a lot of energy and treasure creating a \n     government . . . that cannot function.\n\n  What more do we need? I ask my colleagues, what more do you need? Our \nown intelligence community has been saying since last November that the \ninability of the central government to govern is irreversible--\nirreversible.\n\n  Nothing has happened since General Hayden made his remarks to change \nthat assessment. The time now is to stop digging that hole, redeploy \nour forces, save American lives, and begin to push a political \nsettlement.\n  I conclude by saying that yesterday's release of the unclassified key \njudgments of the National Intelligence Estimate on ``The Terrorist \nThreat to the U.S. Homeland'' highlights the urgency of changing our \ncourse in Iraq. The so-called NIE is a devastating indictment of the \nadministration's failure to accomplish its most important mission--\ndestroying al-Qaida and the threat it poses.\n  It confirms what was reported last week, that the al-Qaida we failed \nto finish off in Afghanistan and Pakistan, because we went into Iraq, \nhas ``regenerated,'' and it remains intent on attacking us at home. \nThat should put to rest once and for all this administration's false \nrefrain that we are fighting over there so we don't have to fight\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\nthem over here. That is rubbish. Our own intelligence, the NIE--that is \nall the intelligence agencies in the U.S. Government--have come to a \nconsensus position.\n  It spotlights the danger posed by al-Qaida in Iraq, a group \nindependent but now affiliated with al-Qaida of bin Laden. Al-Qaida in \nIraq is a Bush-fulfilling prophecy. I will say it again. Al-Qaida in \nIraq is a Bush-fulfilling prophecy. It did not exist in Iraq prior to \nour invasion. But the failed policies, failure to deal with an \nadministrative policy, a political solution, what it does now is to \nhelp al-Qaida energize extremists around the world, raise money for new \nrecruits, and become stronger. All the more reason we must act now to \nrefocus our energy and resources on al-Qaida and start to get our \ntroops out of Iraq's civil war, while limiting the mission of those who \nremain to denying al-Qaida in Iraq a safe haven.\n  Finally, I say to my colleagues, regardless of one's view on the war \nand how to end it, there is one commitment each and every one of us \nshould make. That commitment is so long as there is a single--a \nsingle--American troop in Iraq--a single American troop in Iraq--that \nwe should do all that is needed to give them the best possible \nprotection this country can provide, and the way to start with that is \nto replace the humvees with these mine-resistant vehicles that in our \nlast supplemental I was able to convince our colleagues to add 1.7 \nbillion more dollars to build them. These vehicles have a V-shaped hull \nand they can reduce casualties from roadside bombs up to 80 percent. \nRight now, 70 percent of all the casualties taking place in Iraq is \nbecause of roadside bombs.\n  I will offer an amendment to the Defense bill when we get to it to \nmake clear, with absolutely no ambiguity, that Congress will provide \nevery single dollar needed and every authority necessary to build these \nvehicles as quickly as possible because our kids are dying, and it can \nradically reduce the number of casualties.\n  I conclude by saying our Republican colleagues say--all of whom I \nrespect, but the one I particularly respect is Senator Lugar--that they \nexpect the President to voluntarily change course.\n  I have absolutely no faith, none whatsoever, in this President to \nvoluntarily do what should be done. The only way it is going to happen \nis when our Republican friends stop voting with the President and start \nvoting to end this war by supporting our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about \nwhat has gone on in the Chamber in the last 24 hours and of name \ncalling. I am proud to have worked extra hard the last 24 hours. It \nseems to me the symbolism of working extra hard and losing some sleep \nis an important symbolism.\n  Yes, yes, we all know we didn't have the votes to overturn the \nstubborn denial of this President as to the failure of his policy, but \nwe showed the American people we are willing to work harder and try \nharder and stand up to the face of power for the right strategy to \nsecure our Nation from terrorists and to support our military.\n  I am following to this microphone decades of experience in the \nSenate. I sat this morning and listened--and this afternoon--to Senator \nByrd, Senator Specter, and Senator Biden. I was reflecting on the years \nof experience they represent in the Senate. I don't have those years of \nexperience. I have mere months. But I am confused with the insistence \nof 60 votes on anything of substance we are facing in the Senate. I am \nconfused at attempts to block ethics reform; to block taking Federal \ntax dollars away from big oil. I am confused at the effort to block \nreimportation of prescription drugs and to block negotiation for lower \ndrug prices in Medicare Part D. I am confused about delays and stalling \ntactics to embrace the 9/11 recommendations on homeland security.\n\n  The majority should rule, and I am hopeful what we did over the last \n24 hours will have an impact on the way we work together to move \nforward on the problems that face America.\n  I also wish to briefly say that over the last 24 hours I have felt \nhistory, as I have reflected on other all-night filibusters throughout \nthe history of this great body. I pinch myself when I open my drawer \nand I see the name of Harry Truman. When I sit at my desk and glance \ndown and I see his name scrawled in the drawer of my desk on the Senate \nfloor, it is amazing to me that I have the opportunity to sit in his \nSenate seat and to advocate for accountability in this war effort.\n  Senator Webb and I had worked on an amendment we were going to offer \nto the Defense authorization bill that I think Senator Truman would be \nproud of, because he got in his vehicle and drove miles and miles \nacross this country during World War II, in a Democratic \nadministration--as a Democratic freshman Senator under a Democratic \nPresident in a time of war--and he said we have to do better about how \nwe are spending taxpayer money. We cannot allow war profiteers to \ntarnish the image of the men and women who are fighting for us in World \nWar II. That was his view, and so the Truman Committee was born. Out of \nthat committee, billions of dollars were saved, and America felt better \nabout our ability to clean up our act, to oversee the efforts of our \nmilitary in a way that is fiscally responsible and honors the service \nof our military.\n  Senator Webb and I, along with the other seven freshmen Democrats in \nthe Senate, have fashioned a new, independent commission on war \ncontracting, and we will now introduce this amendment as a stand-alone \nbill. I implore my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to \nnot play partisan games with this effort. This is an independent \ncommission, fashioned in many ways not only after the Truman Committee \nbut after the 9/11 Commission. It will look at war contracting in a \nthorough way.\n  Let us be honest. We are not going to turn back from contracting in a \ntime of war. We will continue to contract. People need to understand \nnow that we have more contractors on the ground in Iraq than we have \nmilitary, with 180,000 contractors. I have had the opportunity over the \nlast 6 months to see firsthand how we have failed in the stewardship of \npublic money, with billions of dollars wasted, billions of dollars in \nunfair profits to private companies because we have not written the \ncontracts well, we have not overseen the contracts, and we have not \nheld them accountable.\n  This commission will allow us to take a thorough look at war \ncontracting, and it will also expand the authority of the Special \nInspector General on Gulf Reconstruction so we can look at not only \nreconstruction contracts but those support contracts for our troops. It \nis important we get this done because we can't go back, but we must go \nforward and make sure that in the spirit of Harry Truman, we never \nallow war profiteering to affect our ability to stand strong, as the \nstrongest and most powerful Nation on the planet.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2327.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be suspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation now before the Senate \nwas passed out of our committee 17 to 3. It has strong bipartisan \nsupport. At the outset of this extremely important education measure, I \nwish to say I am enormously appreciative and grateful to my colleague \nand friend, the Senator from Wyoming, for his leadership and enormously \ngrateful to all the members of our committee for their participation \nand involvement, and the staff of our committee has done an \nextraordinary job.\n  The work started on this legislation many, many, many months ago. We \nunderstood the need for this legislation,\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nas we understood the need to work on the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act. The reauthorization legislation is not in this \nparticular package, although I am strongly in support of it, as my \ncolleague, Senator Enzi, is. We understand that, under the procedural \nrules, if we were to add that legislation onto this particular \nprovision, there would be serious issues and questions whether the \nreconciliation provisions would continue to lie, and that might put the \ntotality of our education legislation effort in some jeopardy. But I \nwish to, at the outset of this debate, give assurances to all our \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, that Senator Enzi and I \nare one in terms of the desire for the Senate to pass the \nreauthorization legislation.\n\n  Somewhat later in this discussion, I will go through in some detail \nthe provisions of that reauthorization legislation. We wish to focus on \nwhat I think is the heart and soul of the higher education debate and \nthat is, for the first time since the GI bill, we are providing very \nsignificant assistance to needy students in this country; and, \nsecondly, we are providing assistance to the middle class in relieving \nthem of a good deal of the pressure they have in paying off student \nloans in the future.\n  So this is where we are, as far as the higher education bill. We are \ngoing to continue to work with Senator Enzi and the other members of \nthe committee to try to find a satisfactory follow-on procedure for the \nreauthorization of the higher education bill. It has a number, as I \nmentioned, of very important provisions, and we will try to make a \nrecommendation to the full Senate either later today or tomorrow but \ncertainly before we conclude this legislation.\n  Education, I think as all of us understand, is the key to the hopes \nand dreams of American families and to the young people of this \ncountry. It has been that way since the founding of the Republic. I \ncome from the State--which I am proud to represent, Massachusetts--that \nhad in its constitution in 1780--John Adams was the author of the \nMassachusetts Constitution, the first constitution of all of the \noriginal States--it spelled out in very careful detail the \nresponsibility of the public to support education. At this time, they \nwere talking about the general education of the citizenry. Each and \nevery other State that wrote its constitution took literally from those \nparticular provisions of the Massachusetts references to education. \nEvery single State constitution has different provisions, but all of \nthem include important provisions for education.\n  Americans understand this is the key to our future. It is the key to, \nfirst of all, our ability to have our democratic institutions function \nand work well, to guarantee the rights and the liberties of the \nConstitution of the United States. Secondly, it is key to our economy \nso that we are going to be strong economically in the United States, \nwith an economy that is going to provide the opportunity for progress \nfor all the people of this country. Thirdly, it is essential, in terms \nof our national security, to make sure we have an informed citizenry \nwho is able to move ahead and take advantage of the extraordinary \ntechnology that is available in terms of our military, so we make sure \nthat we have the best trained, the best equipped, and the latest in \ntechnology guaranteed to those men and women who are going to fight for \nthe United States.\n  So education is the key. It is the key to all the important progress \nthis Nation is going to make in the future. We take a good deal of \npride in the fact that we are going to provide help and relief to \nmillions and millions of Americans who have been increasingly pressured \nby the extraordinary explosion of the cost of tuition for the young \npeople of this country.\n  As we look back again at history, to the development of the public \nschool system, we note that Horace Mann, the great educator, believed \nin the public school system. We look at the efforts that were made \nduring the American Civil War, the Morrill Act. Even in the height of \nthe Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, establishing the \nland grant colleges, which made such a difference to States all across \nthis Nation.\n  We remember the extraordinary steps that President Roosevelt took in \nthe GI bill after World War II. We had some 15, 16 million Americans \nwho were under arms at the end of World War II in 1940, with an average \nage of 26 years old--26 years old in 1940--with 1 year of high school \neducation. So many of these individuals went off to war and served for \n3, 4, 5 years in the military and then came back. President Roosevelt \nsaw the importance of developing the GI bill, and that made such a \ndifference. Many believe it was the piece--the piece--of legislation \nthat made possible the development of the middle class in this country.\n  If you take what the United States spent in the 6 years after the GI \nbill was enacted, it would come to approximately a third of the Federal \nbudget in 1951. That is the kind of priority Americans put on education \nat that time, and that has been a priority that has been certainly \nmissing for a long period of time. It does seem to me we are restating \nand reaffirming a strong commitment to higher education in this \nlegislation.\n  Another important event in terms of increasing the support for higher \neducation came in the late 1950s--1957, to be specific. At the time of \nthe launch of the Sputnik, there were concerns the Soviet Union was \ngetting ahead, and so we had the National Defense Education Act, which \nprovided assistance in the areas of math and science. For many of those \nleading our research agencies and independent agencies in the Federal \nGovernment, it made such a difference for those graduates in that \nNational Defense Education Act.\n  Then in 1960, we had a national debate in this country, at that time \nbetween my brother, then-Senator Kennedy and Vice President Nixon, \nabout higher education. Where were we going? This was the issue that \nwas put forward to the American people. What are we going to say to the \nyoung people of this country if they wish to gain admission to any \nschool or college in this country--any school or college--on the basis \nof their ability, their willingness to work hard? We in the Federal \nGovernment were going to provide enough assistance to those individuals \nso they would be able to gain entrance to that school or college. It \ncould be grants, it could be loans, it could be work-study programs, it \ncould be the requirement that they are going to have to work in the \nsummer, gain some contribution from their family, but nonetheless it \nwas going to be a range of different opportunities that were going to \nbe put together to permit those individuals who came from needy \nfamilies, who had ability and dedication and commitment, to gain \nentrance to schools and colleges anyplace in this country. We were \ngoing to make that a commitment. In 1960, that was a principal issue \nduring the course of the campaign, and we saw the passage of the Higher \nEducation Act in the early 1960s.\n\n  A great debate at that time was whether we were going to provide \nassistance to the student or assistance to the university, and the \ndecision was made it would be to the student. That is basically the \norigin of the Pell grant. Since that time, we have seen a number of \ndifferent opportunities for individuals to move ahead and gain \nassistance.\n  What we have seen is the challenge that is out there today. I am \ngoing to take a few minutes to point out the challenges that exist \ntoday for so many of those who are going on to college. If we look back \nat 1986-87, you see the average tuition fees, room and board, for a 4-\nyear private college, which was $9,800. Now, it is $30,000. If we are \ntalking about the average tuition for four-year public colleges, it \nincreased $4,000 to $12,000 in that same period, virtually a 300-\npercent increase in the last 20 years. This has put an enormous stress \non students.\n  Each year, nearly half of all college-ready students, from families \nwith incomes under $50,000, can't go to a 4-year college because of \ncost. Let me repeat that again: Nearly half of all college-ready \nstudents in families with incomes under $50,000 can't go to a 4-year \ncollege because of the cost. Each year, we have some 400,000 talented, \ncollege-qualified students, who cannot go on to higher education \nbecause they can't afford to do so.\n  We know what happens in colleges and universities now, with students \ntaking longer and longer to complete their degrees. They have to work \nharder and longer, both in the summertime or taking semesters off, so \nthey can\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\ngain greater resources to be able to complete their school and earn \ntheir degree.\n  Look at this. Going back to 1985-86 and what the costs were at that \ntime, and now look what the assistance, the maximum Pell grant, is as a \nshare of tuition fees and room and board from 1985-86 to 2005-06, and \nyou see it has gone from 55 percent for a public 4-year institution \ndown to 33 percent; 24 percent in 1985-86 to 14 percent for a private \n4-year institution. What this is basically saying is the neediest \nstudents, those with ability, those with skills, are finding out the \nassistance they need has been gradually withdrawn; that the kind of \nassistance for them has been significantly reduced, which has put more \nand more pressure on the middle class and working families.\n  Because of these increasing costs and stagnant grant aid, more \nstudents now have to take out loans to finance their education. If you \nlook at 1993, less than half of all graduates had to take out loans. \nBut in 2004, nearly two-thirds had to take out loans to finance their \neducation. This is extraordinary. In 1993, not all that long ago--not \nall that long ago, over half of students did not have to take out loans \nin order to go to school. Now, two-thirds have to do so.\n  What has been the result? This is the result. The young people who \nare graduating from the universities in our country are now \nincreasingly heavier and heavier in debt. In 1993, $9,250; in 2004, 10 \nyears later, $19,000. This is the average debt. This doesn't even begin \nto include what it costs to go to graduate school or medical school. \nThen you are going into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Young \npeople who would like to go into general practice, into higher degrees \nof specialties, they are going to have to pay off a large debt. So it \nhas all kinds of implications for a graduate's career choices and life \nchoices.\n  Anyone who goes to a school or a university or a college and who \nstays around during the course of a lunchtime, you will find out that \nstudents are talking not about their books or classes or their \nteachers, they are talking about their debt. They are talking about \ntheir debt. This has been the dramatic shift and the change. As a \nresult of this, we see this is having an effect upon the quality of \nlife for the young people in this country.\n  What have we tried to do and what have we done with this legislation? \nWe know what the challenge is. We will have an opportunity to get into \ngreater detail on that during the course of the debate. But what have \nwe attempted to do, and what have we done in this legislation? What \ndoes this legislation provide?\n  First of all, it provides a historic increase in need-based grant \naid, $17 billion increase in need-based grant aid. That is the largest \nincrease since the GI bill.\n  What else does it do? Better payment options that cap a borrower's \nmonthly payment at 15 percent of their monthly discretionary income. \nWhat does that mean? For any family in America, when their child \ngraduates he or she will never pay more than 15 percent of their \nmonthly income as they go on through their life. We know now that many \nindividuals pay a good deal more than that, and it presents an \nextraordinary burden on them. We are saying to these young people and \ntheir families: You will never pay more than 15 percent of your monthly \nincome.\n  We are providing loan forgiveness for borrowers who work in public \nservice jobs. What we are saying is any young person who works in a \npublic service job--you work as a teacher, you work as a childcare \nprovider, you work as a special education teacher or assistant working \nwith students with disabilities, if you work with the fire department, \nif you work with the police department--you will repay your debt at 15 \npercent of your salary for a period of 10 years, and then your debt is \nforgiven--released--forgiven, effectively. It makes a major difference \nin terms of young people's career choices, where they might go. I will \ncome back to this because this point is enormously important.\n  We provide protection for working students by not penalizing their \nearnings. We've found that as students earn slightly more while \nattending college, suddenly their eligibility for financial assistance \nis changed and they fall further in debt to pay for their education. We \nhave addressed that issue and addressed the longer loan deferment \nperiods for borrowers in economic hardship. And we provide that benefit \nat no cost to the taxpayer by reforming the student loan industry so it \nworks for students, not banks. This provision does not cost the \ntaxpayers; it saves the taxpayers because we are taking the money from \nthe banks and providing it for the students themselves. We will come \nback to demonstrate that the banks are going to do just fine later in \nthis discussion.\n  I want to show what we do in terms of the Pell Grant Program. Over \nfive million young Americans participate in the Pell Grant Program. As \nyou see in this chart, it has been effectively stuck at $4,000 or close \nto that in 2002, 2004, 2006, all during this recent period of time. \nThen, when our party, the Democrats, took over, we were able to bump \nthat up to $4,310. And then under this proposal it will increase to \n$5,400 in 2011. We are trying to grow the program. It is costly but \nworth it. It makes a life-and-death difference to young people who need \nthis program.\n  Let me return to a point I was making a minute ago. If an individual \nworked in the public sector, this bill provides loan forgiveness. \nGraduates who work for 10 years in emergency management, public \neducation, public health in a social service agency, public services \nfor individuals with disabilities and the elderly, public service legal \nservices programs, including prosecution or public defense, public \nschool library sciences and other school-based service providers and \nteaching full-time at a tribal college or university--we are trying to \nsay to young people graduating from college, yes, you will have debt, \nbut we are saying you will never have to pay more than 15 percent of \nyour monthly income, and if you go into this occupation long term it is \neffectively forgiven.\n  How does it work? Let's take a starting teacher in Massachusetts. We \nhave a book that is available for our colleagues that does the same \nkind of run-through for all 50 States. Say the annual salary is \n$35,000, they have a loan debt of $18,000, monthly payments today of \n$209, monthly payments under IBR would be $148, and monthly loan \npayment relief of $61. The student loan payment relief under the \nincome-based repayment plan is $732 a year, and the amount forgiven \nunder the new Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program will be $10,000 \nof their debt if they are a public school teacher in Massachusetts. \nThat is just one example. You can make that applicable in any of the \nother areas. Those are the principal provisions that are included in \nthis legislation.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It will make an important \nand significant difference to affordability of and accessibility to \ncollege, to needy children, to the students in this country. We welcome \nthe very strong support we have had from the student associations and \nall the student groups. It will make a major difference for working \nfamilies in terms of providing some additional kinds of relief.\n  We have done this in a bipartisan way. We think this will make a \nmajor difference, and I am enormously grateful to my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming for all of his help. I will come back later.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that quorum calls during the \nconsideration of the bill be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need. I want \nto begin by thanking the chairman of the committee for the \nconsideration he has given to all of the amendments that went into the \nbill, and also further work from the time that we passed it out of \ncommittee to resolve any misunderstandings or any questions. It has \nbeen a tremendously cooperative effort and one that I think will lead \nto a very good bill when we finish with reconciliation.\n  That is not all we need to do for higher education, and I will be \nemphasizing that throughout the speech, but I am very much appreciative \nof the leadership and the bipartisanship that has been shown by the \nchairman and members of the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nwho serve on the committee. Both sides of the aisle are interested in \nmaking sure that we can make a college education as affordable as \npossible with as much help from the Federal Government as is possible.\n  Of course, I would note that every time we make a little adjustment \nat the Federal level, the colleges go ahead and make just as big an \nadjustment in their tuition, which is one of the ways we get to some of \nthe figures that are on that chart. But I do want to speak on this very \nimportant bill which is the substitute to H.R. 2669.\n  For millions of Americans, access to affordable college education is \nthe key to their success in the 21st century. We now have a global \neconomy, and to participate in that global economy a person has to have \nmore than a high school diploma. Without some additional education \nfollowing high school, these Americans will not have the qualifications \nfor over 90 percent of the new jobs that will be created in the next 10 \nyears.\n  I want to repeat that. Without additional education following high \nschool, these young Americans will not have the qualifications for over \n90 percent of the new jobs being created over just the next 10 years.\n  This bill, as did the reconciliation bill we considered in the 109th \nCongress, aimed at reducing the subsidies to lenders and providing \ngreater benefits to students. In the 109th Congress, approximately $20 \nbillion in changes were made to the Federal Family Education Loan, the \nFFEL Program, by reducing subsidies to lenders and providing $13 \nbillion in benefits to students. The bill before us reduces subsidies \nto lenders by another $18.5 billion and provides $17.6 billion to \nstudent benefits. The result is that within the span of 3 years we will \nhave made close to $40 billion in changes to the Federal student loan \nprograms.\n\n  Getting to this point has not been accomplished without difficulty. \nAgain, I thank the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Kennedy, for \nhis commitment to make the process as bipartisan as possible.\n  This is the second time in as many Congresses we have been on the \nbrink of systemic reform of Federal higher education programs. I do not \nwant to squander yet another opportunity to make these programs more \nefficient, as well as more effective. We are only seeing, at most, half \nthe picture by debating this bill separately from the larger higher \neducation reauthorization package.\n  We have a chart back here that shows that any way you slice it, \nhigher education is left undone if all we do is the reconciliation \nbill. What is left out?\n  FAFSA simplification: That is the form that students have to fill out \nin order to get Federal loans. It has been an extremely complicated \nform. We have made that considerably simpler.\n  Sunshine/loan disclosure, the year-round Pell grants so that students \ndon't just have to go to school through two semesters, but have access \nto summer semesters. This is important to students who are in \nvocational programs, and allows them to get into the workforce more \nquickly after high school.\n  Support for nontraditional students: We had some requirements before \nthat discriminated against the nontraditional students, the ones who \nare not just graduating from high school.\n  Graduate and international education, financial literacy and better \nborrower information and better privacy protections are all in the big \nyellow circle of reauthorization. It also provides improvements for the \nAmerican competitiveness grants and the SMART grants. Those deal with \nencouraging kids to go into science, math, engineering, technology, and \nforeign languages. There is additional money that is available if they \ndo that; some for their freshman and sophomore years in college, much \nmore for math and science in the junior and senior years. The \nreauthorization bill includes a College cost ``watch list'' and many \nmore provisions.\n  A big piece of the pie is this other part we still need to do. Our \nchallenge is not only to improve access to higher education but to \nensure that the quality of our system of higher education is not \ncompromised. We need to consider both pieces of legislation because \nAmerica's students must have all the tools they need to complete higher \neducation and to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for the \n21st century. We want them to be competitive.\n  The American system of higher education is renowned throughout the \nworld. I can highly attest to that after having gone to India, seen how \ntheir educational system works and how it is becoming very competitive \nwith the United States, and seeing what we need to do to ``stay \nahead.''\n  Of course, they like to send their graduate students to the United \nStates for an education because they learn creativity and flexibility. \nIn most of the other countries around the world they learn the basics, \ncan do excellent calculations and have a vast amount of knowledge. But \nwhat our colleges specialize in is teaching kids to think, to come up \nwith new ideas. That is what has kept America ahead.\n  Our more than 6,000 colleges and universities enroll over 14 million \nstudents and provide access to all types of academic and technical \nskill-building programs.\n  In Wyoming we only have a handful of the total of these 6,000 \ncolleges and 14 million students. In fact, we only have one 4-year \nuniversity, and we have seven community colleges. Our grand total of 10 \naccredited institutions of higher education in the State is the \nsmallest of any State but Alaska.\n  But I do have to digress just a little bit, after we talked about how \nmuch students had in loans, and mention that students are worried about \ntuition, they should take a look at the University of Wyoming. The out-\nof-State tuition is less than most in-state tuition in other States.\n  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the Western Governors \nUniversity. This last weekend I got to attend their graduation and it \nis a unique university. It is largely for nontraditional students, and \nits program is done completely online. There are no classrooms to go \nto. The average age of their students is about 38. That was the average \nage of the graduates this last weekend. Their tuition is $5,600 per \nyear--not per semester. You can take as many courses as you can pack \ninto that year included in that amount.\n  At Western Governors you are assigned a mentor who is a part of the \nteaching staff. As soon as you get there, that person watches, \ncounsels, and even follows you 1 year after you are out. So there are \nsome bargains out there even for people who feel tied down where they \nmay be now.\n  One of the persons who spoke at graduation was a woman who has seven \nkids and, because of Katrina had to move four times during her last \nyear of education. She wanted people to know that if she can complete a \ndegree with seven kids and that many moves, that anybody can get a \ndegree in higher education. I will have more to say about the Western \nGovernors University and their low tuition and their opportunity to \ncomplete their programs from anywhere in the world. We have a lot of \nmilitary folks who are participating in that in different places in the \nworld.\n  But the American success story of higher education is at risk of \nlosing the qualities that made it great, which are competition, \ninnovation, and access for all. That is a real key in the United \nStates. I mentioned visiting India, where only 7 percent of their kids \nget to go on to higher education. That does create a very high level of \ncompetition to get in and probably produces more science, technology, \nengineering, math and medical people than we have. But our principle, \nour emphasis is on having innovation and access for all.\n  In this bill we are doing deficit reduction. Deficit reduction is a \ntool that should be taken seriously. While I am pleased that we have \nsaved about $1 billion toward deficit reduction in this process, we \nhave made some changes to the Higher Education Act that may prove to be \nproblematic in the long run. This bill is not the perfect solution. Not \neveryone is satisfied with where we have ended up, but I do believe \nthat with the traditional need-based grant aid we are making available \nto low-income students, we are moving in the right direction.\n  I recognize it is essential to find ways to ensure that students have \naccess to the financial assistance they need to attend and complete \ncollege. The cost of college has risen dramatically. We saw the figures \nearlier. At\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nthe same time, the need for a college education has never been greater.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure that the investment our students \nand families make in time and money is a good one and that they are \nconfident that there will be the financial aid to assist continued \naccess to college education.\n  We believe students benefit from competition in the student loan \nprograms, both within the FFEL program and between the FFEL and Direct \nLoan Programs. It is important to support both programs to ensure that \nthe needs of all students are well served.\n  I think many of us agree that if there is excess in the system we \nshould eliminate it. The key question is how much excess there is and \nhow to eliminate it. There are no perfect answers to those questions. \nThis bill is one answer. Do we all agree? No. But we need to provide \nstudents and parents assurance that they are receiving sound, honest \nadvice about their student loans in order to make informed decisions \nabout their futures.\n  This bill continues to recognize the unique role that our not-for-\nprofit lenders have in providing information to students and their \nfamilies. They conduct outreach to make college possible and assist in \ndebt management and default prevention.\n  Not-for-profits focus on communities and serve students locally. I am \npleased we are able to continue to acknowledge the important \ncontribution these entities make. We have reached a good balance in the \nreconciliation bill, reducing the subsidy to for-profit lenders by 50 \nbasis points, reducing the subsidy to nonprofit lenders by 35 basis \npoints, and reinvesting those savings in need-based grant aid to \nstudents.\n  Providing additional need-based grant aid is a critical component of \nincreasing access and affordability. I am pleased this bill does this \nby providing additional grant funds to Pell-eligible students over and \nabove the increased maximum Pell grant award that is included in the \nreauthorization bill. I wish to emphasize again, that this is in the \nreauthorization bill, so we cannot just do a part of this puzzle.\n  By increasing the income protection allowance, we have increased the \nability of working students to receive Pell grants, which is critically \nimportant as the student population in our colleges becomes more \nnontraditional.\n  In addition, I think there needs to be in the future some way that we \nbuild in an incentive for students to do better in high school, in \nparticular wiping out that wasted senior year. The incentive of Pell \ngrants can be effective in moving students to college with higher \nlevels of achievement.\n  Higher education is the on-ramp to success in the global economy. It \nis our responsibility to make sure everyone can access that on-ramp and \nreach their goals. The choice of whether to pursue a postsecondary \neducation is no longer an option. College or some kind of nationally \nrecognized skill certification is needed. We need to make sure \nindividuals have all the tools to understand their choices and shape \ntheir future.\n  Let me again remind you, we do not have the whole pie before us \ntoday. We are only talking about the little red sliver there. That \nslice of the pie. We have to do the whole thing. We will be leaving \nbehind students if we do not consider the entire scope of the Higher \nEducation Act, rather than the narrowly focused slice contained in this \nbill, and those programs that reach students and help them to persist \nin attaining a college degree.\n  By not considering the entirety of the Higher Education Act, we are \nforsaking quality in the Federal student loan programs by only cutting \ntheir bottom line. We will not provide the disclosure and information \nstudents and their families need to make informed financial decisions \nthat will have a significant future impact.\n  Finally, reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, the big part of the \npie, is critical to the success of what is the reconciliation bill, as \nit contains the programs that serve as the foundation for student aid. \nI supported reporting both bills out of committee. I did so with the \nexpectation that they would be considered together as a whole by the \nSenate.\n  I hope the Senate Democratic leadership will provide us with the \nopportunity to have an open and full debate on all aspects of the \nHigher Education Act immediately following reconciliation. Both pieces \nare essential. There is no reason we cannot debate them and finish them \nnow. I know there is huge bipartisan desire to get both of them done. \nSince the other one is the bigger part of the pie, probably even more \ninterest in getting the other one done. But they have to go together. \nOne does not work without the other.\n  I will continue to work with Chairman Kennedy and my colleagues on my \nside of the aisle to address this concern. I hope people will show up \nwith amendments, if they have amendments, so we can get them debated. \nThere is a 20-hour limit on debate. There is no limit on the vote-arama \nthat can happen at the end. But it is not very satisfying to have a \nvote-arama with no discussion and just a quick vote on the proposals \nthat are out there.\n  So I hope people will bring their proposals down. I hope there is a \nlimited number of them so we can condense the amount of time we debate \nthe reconciliation and get to the bigger part of the pie slice and get \nit wrapped up this week too.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership and bipartisanship in \ngetting us here and his willingness to work all the parts of the pie so \nwe can provide the quality of education and the access our students \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak, first, in favor of the \nlegislation Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have brought to the Senate \nfloor and also to speak in opposition to an amendment I understand is \ngoing to be offered to this bill at some point in the proceedings.\n  But let me begin by congratulating Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi \nfor their good work. This is a very major step forward in providing the \nresources young people in this country, not just young people but all \nAmericans, need in order to pursue postsecondary education.\n  It is a very major step forward. I am proud to be a supporter of this \nlegislation and proud to be part of the committee that Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Enzi chair and are the ranking member of.\n  We all know the costs of going to college have skyrocketed in recent \nyears. We have seen a 35-percent jump in tuition, adjusted average \ntuition and fees, for instate students at public colleges and \nuniversities since the 2001-2002 school year.\n  This 35-percent increase represents the largest increase in any 5-\nyear period since the Government has been keeping track of these \nfigures. This year alone, the cost of going to college is 6.3 percent \nhigher than it was last year, averaging $12,796, including room and \nboard in our schools.\n  At the same time, we are seeing increased competition among colleges \nand universities for the highest scoring students. These students \ncommand high tuition discounts, particularly in the form of merit \nscholarships. As a result, there is a smaller proportion of financial \naid budgets available for low-income students at colleges with rising \ntuitions.\n  Unfortunately, year after year, Congress has failed to raise the \namount of Pell grant scholarships for needy students. Congress finally \ndid increase Pell grants this year for the first time in many years. \nTen years ago, the maximum Pell grant covered more than 50 percent of \nthe cost of tuition and fees and room and board at a public 4-year \ncollege.\n  Last year, the maximum Pell grant covered only 35 percent of those \ncosts. I have a chart I wish to show to make that point. This chart is \nentitled, ``The Gap Between Grant Aid and Cost of Attendance to \nIncrease.''\n  You can see the cost of attendance at a 4-year public college is the \nred column, for each of those years starting with the 2001-2002 school \nyear and ending with the 2006-2007 school year.\n  So the red column is the cost of attendance, and the white column is \nthe maximum Pell grant. You can see it has been virtually stagnant \nduring this same period. As the chart demonstrates, the gap between \ngrant aid that is available to low-income students and what it costs to \ngo to college has increased very substantially since 2001.\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\n  In the 2006-2007 school year, that is the school year that we just \ncompleted, the average student came up short by almost $9,000. I submit \nit is a disgrace for us nationally each year to allow hundreds of \nthousands of students who are prepared to attend 4-year colleges to \nfail to do so because of the inability to deal with the financial \nbarriers they face. More and more students increasingly rely on loans \nto finance their education. We have seen a significant increase in the \namount of student debt in this country.\n  Let me show another chart. ``Students Are Borrowing More,'' is the \ntitle of this chart. And then the subtitle is: ``From 1993 to 2004, the \naverage amount of total student loan debt for 4-year college graduates \nhas more than doubled.''\n  In 1993, you can see the figure in this column, $9,250, that is the \naverage student debt at the end of a 4-year college. In 2004, the \naverage debt for a student who finishes a 4-year college and graduates \nis over $19,000. This chart demonstrates, I think very clearly, we have \nstudents graduating with too much student loan debt.\n  In New Mexico, the average student now graduates from 4 years of \ncollege with more than $16,000 of debt. The good news is the underlying \nbill, that is, the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, will actually \nincrease student aid by about $17.3 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Most importantly, this very significant increase does not add to our \nnational debt. It is paid for by cutting excessive Federal subsidies to \nlenders who are participating in the student loan program.\n  I have one more chart I wish to use to make a point. This chart is \ncalled, ``The Senate Proposal Increases Grant Aid for Students.'' This \nchart demonstrates the bill substantially increases Pell grants to \n$5,100 this next year and to $5,400 by 2011.\n  Under the proposal, the maximum Pell grant would increase by $790 \nnext year alone. In addition, the bill will simplify the financial aid \nprocess for low-income students by increasing the income level at which \na student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell grant. Also, \nit will protect working students, increasing the amount of student \nincome that is sheltered from the financial aid process.\n  This new student aid package could mean as much as $177 million in \nnew grant aid for students in my State of New Mexico alone over the \nnext 5 years. This increase would mean almost $41 million for students \nattending the University of New Mexico during this next 5-year period; \nalmost $44 million for students attending New Mexico State University; \n$15 million for students attending Eastern New Mexico University; more \nthan $6 million for students attending Western New Mexico University; \nand more than $5 million for students attending New Mexico Highlands \nUniversity.\n  The bill also would cap Federal student loan payments at 15 percent \nof a borrower's discretionary income. This would bring needed relief to \nstudents who do have excessive debt. In addition, the bill advances a \ncritical policy objective, that is, to incentivize students to pursue \ncareers in public service.\n  The bill would forgive the debt of borrowers who work in public \nservice careers, careers such as nursing and teaching and law \nenforcement, for a 10-year period. So the package is vital to the \nstudents in my State of New Mexico, to their families, and to our \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment that I understand is going to be \nproposed to this bill is an amendment that Senators Nelson of Nebraska \nand Burr of North Carolina will offer. This amendment would strip $3 \nbillion from the student aid package and put these critical Federal \ndollars into the wallet of the large for-profit lenders.\n  Let me state for the record I strongly support the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program. This is also known as the FFEL Program.\n\n  Most Senators understand this program is essential to helping so many \nstudents and their families gain access to college. Frankly, you don't \nknow how many of New Mexico's students would be able to gain access to \ncollege without this program.\n  The underlying bill, however, recognizes, as did the President in his \nfiscal year 2008 budget, that FFEL lenders are very heavily subsidized \nby the American taxpayer. Currently, these lenders are guaranteed a \nspecified interest rate by law regardless of what the student borrower \npays.\n  This rate is 2.34 percent higher than commercial paper. The President \nproposed to reduce the subsidy by one-half of a percent, by 50 basis \npoints. Similarly, the underlying bill reduces the subsidy by half of a \npercent for most of these lenders.\n  The main discrepancy, however, is the underlying bill recognizes the \ncritical role many of our State and private nonprofit lenders play in \nadministering the FFEL Program, and it imposes a smaller reduction on \nthem. I believe this is a fair and an equitable approach.\n  In my State, we have such a program. New Mexico Student Loans is a \nprivate, nonprofit corporation. It was created by the New Mexico State \nLegislature in 1981, to provide loans and educational programs and \nsystems to New Mexico students and families, ensuring the broadest \npossible access to higher education for citizens of our State.\n  Nonprofit lenders, such as New Mexico Student Loans, are limited by \nlaw in how they can use their revenues. If they earn more than the \nfunds have cost them, they either have to use that revenue to reduce \nthe cost of loans to students or send that funding back to the U.S. \nTreasury. The savings realized by nonprofits are returned to the \nstudents through zero-fee loans, through reduced interest rates, \nthrough principal forgiveness, for ontime payments, and specialized \nreduced interest rates and loan forgiveness programs for teachers and \nnurses and doctors.\n  In New Mexico alone, $8.6 million was returned to the borrowers \nthrough borrower benefits and loan forgiveness in 2006. For-profit \nlenders, on the other hand, returned these earnings not to the \nstudents, not to the borrowers but instead to their own shareholders. \nFor example, New Mexico Student Loans charges 0 percent interest for \nteachers if they stay and teach in New Mexico; it charges 0 percent \ninterest for nurses and doctors who practice in our State.\n  These programs are necessary to fill critical workforce shortages in \nmy State. Unfortunately, the Nelson-Burr amendment would eliminate the \ndistinction between the nonprofit lenders and the for-profit lenders, \nmany of them very large organizations such as Sallie Mae, Nelnet, Bank \nof America, Wachovia, and JPMorgan Chase.\n  It would eliminate that distinction between the nonprofits and the \nfor-profits by lowering the subsidy cut for the for-profit lenders to \nthe same rate we are providing for nonprofits.\n  The proponents of the amendments argue this amendment is about \nincreasing student choice and protecting the student loan program. I \nrespectfully disagree with that argument. To the contrary, the \namendment would do nothing to increase student choice; rather it would \nprovide a significantly greater competitive advantage to big banks and \nlenders, thereby forcing smaller lenders out of business.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment which is anticipated will be offered, \nthe Nelson-Burr amendment, would literally strip $3 billion from the \nfunds available for low-income students and significantly hinder the \nability of many nonprofit lenders to provide critical student services \nand benefits.\n  I am afraid the amendment is nothing more than an attempt to protect \nthe huge profits of large lenders and further enrich their shareholders \nat the expense of low-income students and the American taxpayers. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose that amendment if it is offered, as I \nunderstand it will be.\n  To conclude, I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their \nleadership in developing this legislation and bringing it to the \nSenate. I hope very much we can move ahead with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think all of us understand that both \nfor the sake of our country and for the millions of young people in our \ncountry, we need fundamental changes in\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\nthe way we do higher education in America.\n  If we are going to be effectively competitive in a global economy, we \nneed the best educated, the best trained workforce in the world. We \nneed to capitalize on the intellectual potential of all of our people. \nIt is a loss to our Nation and to the individual if there are people in \nour country who do not get the education they need to do what they are \npotentially able to do as American citizens.\n  I do not have to tell you or the people of our country that in \nAmerica today, we have some very serious problems in terms of higher \neducation. In my State of Vermont and all across this country, the cost \nof higher education is soaring, and what that means is that in order to \nsend young people to college, family members to college, people are \ngoing deeply in debt, coming out of college, depending on their income, \n$20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 in debt, which has an immediate \nimpact on the career choice that many young people are making.\n  If one comes out of college $50,000 in debt, if one comes out of \ngraduate school $100,000 in debt, what they are going to do is get a \njob which makes them a lot of money to pay off that debt rather than go \ninto the profession that they might otherwise have wanted to go into. \nThat is bad for the individual, and that is bad for our country.\n  Let me be very clear in congratulating Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, \nand other people on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on which I sit. My assistant, Dr. Huck Gutman, worked very \nhard in crafting a significant improvement in what we have seen in \nrecent years in terms of higher education, most notably very \nsignificant expansion and improvement in the Pell Grant Program.\n  We are making progress in beginning to deal with the very serious \nproblems of higher education and how Americans can afford higher \neducation. But also let me be very clear, and I don't know how many \nother Members of the Senate will agree with me, while we are making \nreal progress, we have a very long way to go.\n  When I talk with young people in the State of Vermont about higher \neducation, I ask them how many young people their age who are going to \ncollege in Germany or in Europe or even in Canada incur the kind of \ndebts they have and will incur when they get out of school.\n  Many young people in America are surprised to learn that in Germany, \nin other European countries, college education is virtually free. It is \nfunded by the government. Frankly, I think that is a good idea. We \nshould look at education in general, and higher education, as an \ninvestment in America with an understanding that if many young people \nare not able to get the education they need, our country loses in terms \nof its productivity; that it is a waste unimaginable, both for the \nindividual and for our society.\n  If, as currently is the case, for the first time in modern American \nhistory, hundreds of thousands of low-income young Americans are \nsaying: No, I don't want to go to college, I don't want to come out \n$50,000 in debt, think of what we are losing as a nation, not to \nmention the economic lost opportunities for those individuals.\n  Let me be very clear. Before we give hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent, before \nwe invest in weapons systems that are obsolete, it makes a lot more \nsense to me that we tell every family in America that a college \neducation and graduate school are going to be there for them if they \nare prepared to work hard and if they have the ability, they will not \nbe denied that opportunity because their family does not have a lot of \nmoney.\n  Let me also say I have serious concerns that at a time when we \ndesperately need more physicians to bolster our health care system, \nwhen we need more nurses, when we need more dentists, it is absurd that \npeople in the medical profession and in other professions are coming \nout deeply in debt, which also impacts their career choices.\n  We need, for example, primary health care physicians in Vermont. All \nover rural America, physicians are choosing other specialities because \nthey can make more money.\n  To my mind, what we have to say in America, if we are serious about \nhealth care, if we are serious about law enforcement, if we are serious \nabout making sure that low-income people have the public defenders they \nneed, that Legal Aid has the lawyers they need, we have to do \neverything we can to say that anybody in this country who has the \nability, is prepared to work hard, should be able to get a higher \neducation regardless of their income and not have to come out of school \ndeeply in debt. As a nation, we should look at that as an investment in \nthe same way we look at many other types of investments.\n  This bill is a good step forward, but in my view, over the years as \nwe fight to change national priorities, one of those priorities should \nbe that every young person, the kids in the fourth and fifth grade know \nif they do their work seriously, they will be able to get a higher \neducation; they will be able to make it to the middle class regardless \nof the economic situations of their families.\n  The cost of college in the last 20 years has tripled, but Federal \nfinancial aid has not kept up. Yes, we have given tax breaks to \nbillionaires, but, no, we have not increased Pell grants and other \nsources of financial aid. I am very happy the legislation we are \ndebating today will make college more affordable by raising the maximum \nPell grant to $5,100 next year and increasing to $5,400 by 2011. That \nis a significant change and a significant step forward in funding \nhigher education.\n  In Vermont, what we have seen is that between the 2000 and 2001 and \n2005 and 2006 school years, the cost of attendance, including tuition, \nfees, and room and board, at 4-year public colleges in Vermont \nincreased by 29 percent, from $12,836 to $16,571. Certainly, these Pell \ngrants will mean a lot to the families in the State of Vermont.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the situation is even worse for those \npeople who go to graduate school. Just an example: Students who attend \nthe very fine Vermont Law School in South Royalton, VT, graduate, if \none can believe this, on average $100,000 in debt. If they pay this \ndebt off over 30 years, it will mean they will be paying $900 a month \ntoward their debt for 30 years. If anyone doesn't think that impacts \ncareer choices, it certainly does.\n\n  This bill has a number of very important provisions. Most \nimportantly, it increases Pell grants and it says we have to make it \neasier for families in our country to afford college.\n  It also provides a very important provision regarding loan \nforgiveness. This is something I believe in very strongly. We have \nworked very hard on this provision with Senator Kennedy and others. \nWhat this is about is that in this legislation, there are loan \nforgiveness provisions for those people who go into public service. We \nall know if you want to make a whole lot of money, you go to some large \ncompany and make a lot of money. You may be one of the lucky ones \nmaking millions and millions of dollars a year. What happens if you \nwant to go into law enforcement? What happens if you want to be a \nteacher who works with disabled kids? What happens if you want to be a \nHead Start teacher or do the extraordinarily important work of early \nchildhood education, which is some of the most important work being \ndone in America because it enormously influences what kind of an adult \na young person will become. What happens if you want to do that?\n  In my State of Vermont, you can work in childcare and make $9 an \nhour, often without benefits. If you are coming out of school $50,000 \nin debt, you are not going to gravitate toward a job in which you make \n$9 an hour or $10 an hour because after you pay off your student loan, \nyou are not going to have a whole lot to live on because of the low \nsalaries and low wages those jobs involve.\n  What this legislation does, very appropriately--it is a good start; \nwe have to go further--it says to the young people of this country that \npublic service is an important calling. We want you to go out and work \nto be teachers, to be in law enforcement, to work in legal aid, to work \nas a public defender, to work in environmental protection, to work in a \nvariety of areas that are extraordinarily important for our country and \nfor our society.\n  Many of those jobs do not pay a whole lot of money. That is the \nreality. But we want you to be involved in\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\nthose jobs, to work in those jobs, and that means we are going to \nencourage you to do that by forgiving your debt if you do that. That is \none way to help you get involved in those professions.\n  Some of the professions that would be eligible for this loan \nforgiveness are a full-time job in public emergency management, \ngovernment, public safety, public law enforcement, public health, \npublic education, public early childhood education, public childcare, \nsocial work in a public child or family service agency, public services \nfor individuals with disabilities, public services for the elderly, \npublic interest legal services, including prosecution or public \ndefense, public library sciences, public school library sciences, or \nother public-school-based services. That is extraordinarily important.\n  What we have also done in this legislation is we have increased the \neligibility level for people to get Pell grants. That is important \nbecause with the limited amount of money that was previously available, \nI suppose appropriately enough most of that money went to those \nfamilies that were most in need, and that meant a large number of \nfamilies in the middle class or lower middle class were not eligible \nfor Pell grants. But we have expanded and raised the eligibility level \nso that many more families will be eligible.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude, this legislation is a significant step \nforward. I congratulate Senator Kennedy for his leadership, Senator \nEnzi, and all of the people on our committee who have worked on this \nimportant issue. But let's not in passing this legislation rest on our \nlaurels. This is a good start, but we have a long way to go.\n  My hope is that in the coming years, we will pass legislation which \nwill have the impact of saying to every young person in America: If you \nare in the sixth grade or seventh grade, and if your family does not \nhave a lot of money, if you study hard, if you do well in school, you \nwill be able to get all of the education you need so that you can make \nit to the middle class, so that you can exercise all of your \nintellectual potential, and you can get out of college or get out of \ngraduate school without being deeply in debt.\n  Education is not a ``cost.'' Education is an investment. If we are \ngoing to turn this country around and have the kind of health care \nsystem that provides health care to every man, woman, and child as a \nright, we need doctors to go into rural America. We need tens and tens \nof thousands more nurses. We need dentists. We need all kinds of people \nin health care, in law enforcement, in environmental protection working \nwith our youngest children.\n  We have to say to any American: We want you to do as well as you can \nto get all of the education you can. We are proud of what you are \ndoing. We see that as an investment in moving this country forward.\n  Again, I congratulate the leadership of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee which I am on. I think we have taken a good step \nforward. I certainly hope this legislation passes, and I hope we \ncontinue to make substantial progress in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nuse be charged to the bill.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have a number of our colleagues that \nhave called and indicated that they want to address these issues, and \nwe welcome their statements and comments. I want to just mention, as I \nwill during the course of the afternoon, some of the different \nprovisions of the legislation.\n  I know earlier in the day my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, \noutlined some of the provisions in what we call the reauthorization \nlegislation. I am in strong favor of reauthorizing the Higher Education \nAct. We are debating now the issue of loans and financing these \nprograms, which is extremely important and urgent for students, and \nthat is why this bill is on this fast track. This bill provides very \nimportant assistance to the neediest students and middle-income \nfamilies, and we want that to go into effect as rapidly as possible. \nBut we are also strongly committed to the other provisions of the \nreauthorization legislation that deal with the broader issues on \neducation.\n  I am hopeful during the course of the time that we are considering \nthis current legislation that we will be able to work out a process and \nproceed to moving ahead with the reauthorization. The reauthorization, \nas has probably been mentioned by my colleague from Wyoming, curtails \nsweetheart deals between lenders and colleges which so many American \nfamilies have been reading about and hearing about in recent years. It \nis an extraordinary scandal where too many of these lenders--and this \nhas been true in my own State of Massachusetts as well as other parts \nof the country--have been involved in sweetheart agreements and \nkickbacks, which, obviously, are completely unethical, unacceptable, \nand, in some instances, criminal. But we provide provisions to curtail \nthose kinds of abuses in the reauthorization legislation. We also \nsimplify what we call FAFSA--the Free Application for Federal Student \nAssistance--to make applying for Federal aid easier.\n  I have here, Mr. President, the current FAFSA form, and any \npreliminary view can see that this is enormously extensive, and \nextremely difficult, in many instances, to understand and to fill out. \nI am enormously grateful, and all of us should be, to our colleague and \nfriend, Senator Enzi, who by training and profession was an accountant, \nand he was willing to take on the task of simplifying this application \nto ensure that there was going to be adequate protection in terms of \nthe public interest and in terms of taxpayer interest, but also made it \nunderstandable and readable. So the reauthorization bill would create \nan EZ FAFSA, for the lowest-income students to use immediately, and \nwould phase out the paper application for all students over a number of \nyears.\n  I will show you what has happened and give some of the background. In \n2003-2004, about 1.5 million students who were likely eligible for the \nPell grant did not fill out this form. They had such difficulty in \ngoing through it, and too often in the high schools they attended they \ndidn't have the kind of professional assistance to help those young \npeople to take advantage of federal student aid. Twenty-eight percent \nof the lowest income independent students didn't fill out the FAFSA in \n2003-2004, and nearly all would have been eligible for the Pell grant.\n  So the HELP Committee package shortens the FAFSA for the lowest \nincome students, and for all students within the next few years. And \nthe HELP Committee package increases the income level at which students \nare automatically eligible for the Pell grant as well.\n  It might not sound like a very important provision, but this is an \ninstance where this application is enough to seriously discourage many \nyoung people, particularly those in middle-income and low-income \nfamilies, from moving ahead; and, as a result, an important loss to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Washington is here, a member of \nour committee who has been a champion on education--she has been a \nschool board member, a teacher in her own right, and has been a real \nleader on all of our educational issues, and was enormously valuable \nand helpful in the development of this legislation--and I am glad to \nyield such time as she may use on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank our floor managers, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, for yielding me time at this point to talk \nabout the extremely important legislation that we have before us today.\n  In these days of global competition, a college education is the \ngateway to a successful career, to a growing economy, and to a stronger \nfuture for our entire country. Today, we have in the Senate an \nopportunity to help more students attend college and to afford a \ncollege education. I am pleased to be here today to speak on the Higher \nEducation Access Act.\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\n  Mr. President, when I was growing up, my family didn't have a lot. \nThe only way I was able to attend college was through Pell grants and \nstudent loans. In fact, because of Pell grants and student loans, all \nseven kids in my family were able to go to college and to get an \neducation and to graduate. Today, those seven kids, because of Pell \ngrants and student loans, have become a school teacher, a lawyer, a \nfirefighter, a homemaker, a computer programmer, a sports writer, and a \nU.S. Senator.\n  In my book, Mr. President, that was a pretty good investment by our \ncountry. I want to make sure now that students today have the same \nopportunities I had growing up. It is important for them as \nindividuals, and it is critical for our country's future.\n  In recent years, the deck has become increasingly stacked against our \nstudents. College has become more expensive while some of our large \nlenders have taken advantage of students. Those students who are able \nto attend college are often graduated and saddled with debt and unable \nto have the resources to even buy a car or even think about purchasing \na home. Other graduates can't pursue public service jobs in areas where \nour country really needs their help because they can't afford to pay \nback their loans on a public service salary.\n  The bill that is before the Senate this afternoon will begin to turn \nthe tide back in favor of our students. It will put our students first \nand make college more affordable. It will help our recent graduates, \nand it will encourage public service.\n  I also worked on this bill to ensure that military servicemembers get \nmore time to defer their student loan payments while they are on active \nduty, and I was pleased to provide more help for homeless and foster \nstudents who often face unique problems when they try to navigate the \ncollege process.\n  Before I turn to some of the details in the bill, I want to take a \nmoment to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in moving these \nproposals forward and making sure this bill finally does right by those \nwho count the most, our students.\n  First, this bill raises the maximum Pell grant by 25 percent over 4 \nyears to $5,400 per student. That is going to make a real difference \nfor students in my home State of Washington. In my State of Washington, \nin 1986, the maximum Pell grant covered 53 percent of the cost of a \npublic 4-year college. Today, it only covers 33 percent of those costs. \nSo those students have gone from having 53 percent of their costs \ncovered down to 33 percent. By raising the maximum Pell grant, this \nbill is going to help students in Washington State and across the \ncountry do what we all want them to do, and that is to go to college.\n  In Washington State, this bill is going to make another $39.6 million \navailable in need-based grants next year alone, and over 5 years the \nbill will provide an additional $340.6 million for low-income students.\n  This bill will also ensure that college graduates are not trapped by \nhigh loan payments after college. It will guarantee that borrowers will \nnot have to pay more than 15 percent of their monthly income in student \nloan payments. That will help bring immediate relief to our students \nwhom we see burdened with these excessive loans.\n  Another problem with the high student loan debt is that it limits the \ncareer choice of many of our college graduates. Many of them can't \nafford to take a job in public service and pay back their loans at the \nsame time. This bill will help encourage public service by providing \nloan forgiveness for graduates who pursue careers in these areas.\n  As I worked on this bill with my colleagues, I thought it was very \nimportant to help out military servicemembers who have student loans. I \nhave worked very hard to allow those who are serving in combat or \nnational emergencies to defer their student loan payments during their \ndeployments and as they transition out of service. Today, under current \nlaw, it limits how long servicemembers can defer their payments to only \n3 years.\n  As many of us know, our military members have been on active duty \ntoday much longer than that. This bill makes a critical step forward in \nlifting that 3-year limit and will help make more of our servicemembers \neligible. Those who are serving our country have enough to worry about. \nFinancial challenges and worrying about paying back their student loans \nshould not be something they have to worry about as they serve overseas \nand transition back here to home.\n  I was also pleased to help improve college access for our homeless \nand foster students. Those students who are homeless or come from \nfoster homes face tremendous barriers in their education, especially \nthose who do not have a parent or guardian who are able to help guide \nthem through the process. In this bill, I worked to help simplify the \nstudent aid application process and made homeless and foster students \neligible for higher levels of assistance.\n  Before I conclude, I do wish to say there is one amendment that may \ncome on this bill about which I am very concerned, and that is because \nit would tear through this bill and undermine all the progress we have \nworked so hard to make for our students. That is an amendment that \nallows higher subsidies for some lenders, including lenders who acted \nso irresponsibly in the recent student loan scandals. That amendment is \ngoing to take money away from our students and take money away from the \nPell grants in this bill.\n  With this bill, we are trying to help more students afford college. \nThe amendment would take money away from our students and away from \nPell grants and I do not see any reason why we should change this bill \nand help fewer students and put that money back into the pockets of \nlenders. As we move through this bill, I hope we will reject efforts \nthat hurt students so we can pass this strong and effective student aid \nlegislation.\n  To me, it is simple. If we want our economy to grow, if we want our \npeople to succeed, if we want our country to be strong, we have to help \nmore students today get a college education. This bill that is before \nthe Senate will do that. I urge all our colleagues to support this bill \nin the strongest measure as it has been brought forward to us by \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wish to underline three very important provisions the \nSenator from Washington took a particular interest in, beyond the other \nprovisions on the legislation. She mentioned these in her excellent \ncomments, but I think it is worthwhile to take a moment to emphasize \nthem. I refer to those provisions dealing with homeless and foster \nchildren as well as those in the military. Under the provisions the \nSenator from Washington championed, homeless children and foster \nchildren, too often left behind, have enormous challenges. But we \nknow--we have all heard these extraordinary stories of the incredible \ndrive that so many of these young people have, even while facing \nextraordinary challenges. Under the provisions on which she worked \ntirelessly, the bill will establish these children as independent \nstudents--obviously, they have to have the academic qualifications to \nbe able to gain entry into the schools, private or public \ninstitutions--but they will be considered what we call independent \nstudents. This means they will be able to get some very small but \nimportant additional help and assistance that may be a lifeline to \nassist them and facilitate their admittance into schools and colleges; \nam I correct? I'm so pleased the Senator mentioned these two provisions \nbecause they are small items in a large piece of legislation, but I \nthink they are extremely important.\n  My colleague from Washington also mentioned the provisions dealing \nwith those individuals who are in the military, to permit them to have \na respite from repayment while they are on active duty service, serving \nour country. It seems they have challenges enough. They obviously will \nmeet their responsibilities when they are no longer on active duty. But \nit seems to me the help that is being provided for those in the service \nis critical, and so, if the Senator will comment again on the \ndifference these provisions can make to servicemembers, and those \nprovisions to homeless children and foster children, I think it will be \nuseful for our colleagues to know about.\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for his question. I actually became \ninterested in the issue of homeless children, foster children many \nyears ago when I served in our State legislature and found out, quite \nby accident, that students in our State were being denied access to \npublic schools simply because they didn't have an address. I never \nthought about it before. Everybody goes and their mom registers them \nfor school and they write their address down and they register and \nstart school with a big smile on their face. In my home State many \nyears ago, not if you were a homeless student. So I passed legislation \nin our State legislature to make sure that students who did not have an \naddress would be allowed access to any school to which they applied.\n  I followed that throughout my career and met amazing young people who \nhave tremendous capabilities who, through circumstances that had \nnothing to do with them, were either homeless or were foster children. \nA young man I worked with a few years ago had been in over 80 foster \nhomes from the time he was young until he was 18. Once they turn 18, \nthese foster students all of a sudden become independent, and they do \nnot have a parent to take them off to college on that first day that is \nso important or to send them a check once in a while to help them with \ntheir books or even to help them navigate through the paperwork that is \nrequired when you try to apply for financial aid.\n  With the help of Senator Kennedy and others on our committee, we put \nprovisions in this bill, only a few sentences but very significant, \nhelping to simplify the student aid application process for our \nhomeless students and to help both the homeless and foster students be \neligible for higher levels of assistance because they do not have \nanyone to rely on at home once they head off to college.\n  This is an important investment that will pay off in many ways, I \nbelieve, in the future, and give some hope to some young people who \ntruly, in our country today, deserve it.\n  On the other issue the Senator from Massachusetts talked about, I, \nsimilar to many Senators, go home and talk to young men and women who \nare either going off to war in Iraq or Afghanistan or around the globe \nor who have returned recently. I tell you, one of the things they \nconstantly struggle with is the issue of paying back their student \nloans. Similar to many young people today, they have gone to college \nmaybe for a year or two, maybe graduated with a very high student loan \nthey are required to pay back. But they are deployed over to Iraq, \ntrying to manage the paperwork of that or pay for it on a military \nsalary. It is impossible.\n  Along with our colleagues on the committee--I see Senator Clinton on \nthe floor today too--we put in a provision to make sure that when our \nmen and women are serving overseas, they not have to worry about paying \nback student loans. I think that is the least of what we should be \ndoing for those men and women we have asked to serve this country.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for working with us on these \ntwo provisions and tell all our colleagues, we have an obligation in \nthis country to the next generation. If you talk to anyone who is \nstruggling through school today or through college or is a graduate, \nthey will tell you the No. 1 worry they have on their mind is paying \nback that student loan.\n  We want them to be able to go out and get a job and give back to our \neconomy, purchase a home, be able to invest in themselves and their \nfuture. Yet they are worrying about paying back student loans. This is \na significant step forward, making sure the next generation has what \nthis generation had and generations have had before them, and that is \nfocusing on hope and opportunity and not on debt and long-term concerns \nabout being able to pay that back.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and appreciate his work on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield? I see the Senator from New \nYork here. The result of the good Senator's life story, talking about \nthe members of her family--the history of the GI bill is that for every \ndollar the Federal Government actually invested, $7 was returned. We \nare reminded again, this is not legislation that is going to cost the \ntaxpayer a nickel and it is going to increase opportunity and hope, \nparticularly for homeless children and foster children, because it will \nmake them eligible for additional help and assistance which will \neffectively enhance their opportunity to go to college, and help reduce \ntheir debt after they get out of school. It is opening up opportunity.\n  I again commend the Senator from Washington. She has been a leader on \nthe issue of veterans and, as all of us remember so clearly in the wake \nof the Walter Reed scandal, her very clear and powerful voice, both \nbefore that and afterward, as a voice for those families and the \nservice men and women. This is a practical and important provision in \nthis reconciliation bill that will make a big difference to our service \nmen and women and to their families. I thank her very much for all of \nher good work.\n  I see the Senator from New York. I thank her for her extraordinary \ncontribution in the development of this legislation. Senator Clinton \nhas been a leader, in terms of understanding some of the ethical \nchallenges that existed in the loan program and helping fashion some of \nthe most important provisions in this legislation that are going to \nensure that the resources which are out there, that are meant to go to \nstudents, go to students. I thank her for her extraordinary work in \nthat area. Also, Senator Clinton has been a leader in developing \nprovisions to support and assist nontraditional students, part-time \nstudents, and single mothers. They will have access to the assistance \nthey need to complete their education.\n  We have included in here, at her strong suggestion, the year-round \nprovisions for the Pell Grant Program. We are making it available all \nyear round because of the changing educational system and process. I \nthank her also for her work on the provisions that are enormously \nimportant to so many students and families--that is, helping \nindividuals who work in order to try to offset some of their education \ncosts. They get caught in this trap where they have higher income and \ntherefore less help and assistance. This legislation increases the \namount of income that is sheltered from the financial aid process in \norder to protect working students, and to reward their hard work.\n  The good Senator was enormously creative and imaginative helping us \ndeal with that situation. The young people of the country will be very \ngrateful and appreciative for her strong leadership and good work.\n  I yield to her such time on the bill as she might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to come to the floor and \ntalk about this extremely important legislation. I thank our leader, a \ngreat advocate on behalf of education, the chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Kennedy.\n  This bill represents a tremendous victory for students, for their \nfamilies, for higher education, for the future of the American economy, \nfor millions of families who still struggle to pay for college and for \nmillions of young people who will not only carry from their education a \ndegree, but, on average, more student debt than any graduates who came \nbefore them.\n  Most of all, this bill is a victory for that young boy or girl who is \nthriving in school, who might one day wish to attend college and \nfulfill his or her God-given potential but worries that such a wish is \nbeyond his or her reach; that it is too expensive to realize.\n  I commend the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle for \nthe great work that has been done bringing this bill to the floor. I \nwas thrilled with many of the provisions, some of which I have worked \non ever since I came to the Senate, particularly focusing on \nnontraditional students who more and more are becoming the norm--older \nstudents, married students, single-parent students--who often have \nfound there were barriers to their accessing whatever help was \navailable from the Federal Government programs to continue their \neducation.\n  I am also personally thrilled at what we have done for homeless and \nfoster youth. This has been a passion of mine, going back to my years \nas a law student, when I first started representing\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nabused and neglected children, children who ended up in the foster care \nsystem, all the way through my time in the White House, where we were \ninstrumental in working with the Congress in passing landmark \nlegislation to make adoption easier, to try to make the foster care \nsystem more responsive to the needs of the child and to accelerate \ndecisions being made as to whether a child would ever realistically be \nable to return to his or her biological family; to my years in the \nSenate, where we have continued to try to help students who are in the \nfoster care system as they age out.\n\n  As Senator Murray pointed out, when you turn 18 or graduate from high \nschool, whichever comes first, still in many States in our country, you \nare no longer eligible for the foster care system. What that has meant \nis that a social worker usually shows up at the foster home with a big \nblack garbage bag and tells the young man or woman to put his or her \nbelongings into that bag because they are no longer able to live in a \nfoster home with State support. Many young people whom I have been \nprivileged to know, some of whom have interned for me, worked for me in \nmy office here or in my office in the White House, they were the lucky \nones. They had the right combination of personal resilience and ability \ncombined with mentoring and some breaks along the way that enabled them \nto complete high school and often go to college at great cost.\n  Many of them had nowhere to go during summer vacations or \nThanksgiving or Christmas or any other break in the academic schedule. \nSome of them hid themselves in the dorm. Some of them stayed in bus \nstations or airports. Some of them prevailed upon a friendly professor \nor fellow student to take them in.\n  By recognizing the special needs of these special students, we do a \nvery important piece of legislative business that has a big heart in \nit. I thank my colleagues who worked with me and others to make this \nhappen.\n  When we think about the importance of college, it is hard to grasp \nthe fact that most young people in our country will not go to college \nand graduate. The college-going rate has been pretty stagnant now for \nabout 20 or 30 years. As the cost of higher education has gone up, it \nhas become even more difficult for young people to work their way \nthrough, to afford the increases in tuition and room and board. But the \ninvestment in college still remains a very good one.\n  Each additional year of education after high school increases an \nindividual's income by 5 percent to 15 percent. A college degree will \nenable an individual to earn close to $1 million more in the course of \na life's work than those who have only a high school diploma.\n  It is no coincidence that the rise of the American middle class \ncoincided with the explosion of college attendance. It unlocks economic \npotential, and it gives students access to the American dream--to a \ncareer and a life that they, then, can build.\n  But as I say, unfortunately in the past 25 years, the cost of college \nhas risen faster than inflation. College costs have tripled over the \npast 20 years and, as the costs spiral upward, so has the size of the \nloans and the loan payments that are necessary. Students who borrow, \ntake out loans averaging $15,500 while attending public colleges and \nuniversities and almost $20,000 while attending private schools, twice \nwhat they would have borrowed 10 years ago.\n  At New York University in Manhattan, 60 percent of students graduate \nowing an average of $27,639. At Idaho State University, 69 percent of \nstudents graduate owing an average of $29,467. At the University of \nMiami in Florida, whose president served with such distinction in this \ntown as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for 8 years, 58 \npercent of the students graduate owing an average of $31,723.\n  This debt limits students' options and damages their financial \nfutures. It is a chain around their ankles as they end their education \nand go out into the world of work.\n  With this reconciliation bill, we are cutting that chain. This bill \nwill provide $17.3 billion in student aid, the largest increase in \nstudent aid in more than a decade.\n  It will provide this aid without raising Federal taxes one dime. \nFirst, the higher education reconciliation bill increases the \npurchasing power of the Pell grants which help the lowest income \nstudents offset the cost of college. It is no secret to anyone in this \nChamber that the purchasing power of the Pell grants has declined \ndramatically, from nearly 60 percent of the cost of a public school 20 \nyears ago, to only 36 percent today.\n  This legislation provides the largest Pell grant increases in more \nthan a decade, increasing maximum Pell grants to $5,100 immediately, \nand to $5,400 by 2011.\n  Now, take my State, for example. This initial boost will provide over \n$200 million in increased grant aid to New York students for the 2007-\n2008 school year alone, and $1.7 billion by 2013. The legislation also \nraises the income cutoff for Pell grants from $20,000 to $30,000, \nmaking many more students from many more families eligible to receive \nPell grants.\n  Second, I am very pleased that the Higher Education Reconciliation \nAct tackles an issue addressed in legislation I sponsored in the last \nCongress called the Student Borrowers Bill of Rights. It provides \nprotection for student borrowers while they repay their loans. It does \nso by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of the borrower's \ndiscretionary income and provides several important protections to \nmembers of the Armed Forces and public service employees during \nrepayment.\n  This is critical to helping students manage their debt, essentially \nin the first few years after they graduate. Third, I am pleased the \nreconciliation bill also creates a new loan forgiveness plan through \nthe direct loan program for public service employees. I hear from many \nstudents in New York and around the country who would love to be \nteachers or police officers or firefighters or nurses or social workers \nor public defenders, but sadly they are so saddled with debt, that such \ncareers in the public arena seem like an impossibility for them. That \nis the wrong policy.\n  We want to encourage more young people to go into public service. Our \npolicies should respect that choice, not denigrate it. Under the loan \nforgiveness program, the remaining loan balance on a loan is forgiven \nfor a borrower who has been employed in a public sector job and making \npayments on the loan for 10 years. These jobs are essential to the \ncommunities they serve.\n  I believe this program will encourage public service and provide an \nincentive for borrowers to pursue low-paying, perhaps, but vital \nprofessions to our country. When I was getting ready to go to college \nmany years ago, my father, who was a small businessman, a very small \nbusiness, said he had saved enough money for me to go to college, and \nhe said, I will pay tuition, room and board, but if I wanted to buy a \nbook, I had to earn the money. That was fine because I worked ever \nsince I was 13 in the summer and during vacations. So I worked my way \nthrough college with my family's help. And when I graduated I decided I \nwanted to go to law school. I told my father that. He said: That is not \npart of the bargain. If you want to go to law school, you have to pay \nfor it yourself.\n  So I got a little scholarship, and I continued to work year-round, \nand I borrowed money directly from the Federal Government, the National \nDefense Education Act, something which many of us in this Chamber took \nadvantage of when we were pursuing our education.\n  The interest rate was very low. The repayment schedule was something \nI could handle. I did not have to worry about anyone raising the rate \non me or changing the terms. I worked first for the Children's Defense \nFund as a young lawyer, and then in public service here in Washington, \nworking for the Congress, and then teaching law at the University of \nArkansas and running a legal aid clinic.\n  During all of those years when I was doing public service and \nacademic work, I could handle what my repayment obligations were. I \nwant that available for young people today. I think it is so important, \nespecially as we look at what is happening in Government service and \nother public service professions, to see how there is an\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\naging going on that is going to eventually result in the loss of a lot \nof very experienced people.\n  You know, I spent Monday at Binghamton University in New York where \nwe have the only Ph.D. program in rural nursing. I met at the nursing \nfaculty with some of the nursing students. It is a wonderful program. \nBut, you know, the average age of a nurse in America is over 45. The \naverage age of a nursing faculty member is 54. We have many people who \nwant to go to nursing school, and we do not have places for them, even \nthough they are qualified. We have a lot of others who worry about how \nthey can pay for their education.\n  You could replicate that across every single profession that really \nfalls into the service profession, the caring professions, where we are \nseeing shortages of people because there is a disconnect between the \nsalary they are paid and the debt they have to incur in order to get \nthe credentials to be able to perform the public service.\n  So I believe in the long run this increase in student aid will pay \nfor itself. Not only do college graduates earn more and are therefore \nable to pay back the society, but they are less likely to draw on \npublic resources, and they are much more likely to make a contribution.\n  This bill has had great bipartisan support. I am very proud to have \nworked on it and to see the positive changes that it includes. Clearly, \nthis is something that I hope we will be able to pass by acclimation. I \nhope that after the difficulties and the debate and the disagreement of \nthe last week over the very difficult issue of Iraq, I hope we will \ncome together around a fundamental American value; namely, education.\n  We have the best higher education system in the world. It is a system \nfilled with second chances for people who decide at the age of 18 or 80 \nthey want to pursue an education in a community college or a technical \ncollege or a 4-year college or a university. This is one of the really \nimportant aspects of American society, and it is instrumental to the \nfurther development of our economy and the hopes of a return to shared \nprosperity for our people.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to come together to support this higher \neducation reconciliation bill, to make higher education more \naffordable. It is good social policy. It is good economic policy. It is \ncertainly good budgetary policy. It makes a big difference to millions \nand millions of hard-working young people and their families.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed as in morning business for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like all of the others, I was here \nthroughout the night. I was happy to do that because I strongly \nsupported the Levin-Reed amendment. But I had hoped that the filibuster \nwould be ended on this vital piece of legislation.\n  I was 1 of 23 Senators who voted against going to war in Iraq. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, my Senate partner from Vermont, voted \na similar way in the other body.\n  Mr. President, the President's Iraq strategy has been a disaster. It \nwas born of deception, fueled by incompetence, and pursued through \narrogance and stubbornness.\n  This strategy has not made us safer. It has undermined the \ninternational credibility that took generations of Americans' sacrifice \nto build; it has squandered billions of hard-earned tax dollars that \nwould have been better used in directly countering terrorists; it has \nskewed our priorities here at home; it has weakened our military \nreadiness; and it has created an open sore in an already volatile \nMiddle East.\n  It is time to extricate our troops from Iraq's civil war and let the \nIraqis and their regional neighbors forge their own political \nsettlement.\n  As many predicted, the security situation in Iraq has not appreciably \nimproved despite the President's surge strategy.\n  The ongoing violence comes from a deadly brew of suicide bombings, \nintra-ethnic conflict, and out-of-control militias--all unleashed by \nthe President's poorly planned invasion and occupation of the country.\n  Our troops can provide some semblance of security in limited areas \nfor limited periods of time. But this fleeting security largely just \nshifts the focal points of violence, and it comes at the horrific price \nof the lives and limbs of still more of our soldiers and marines killed \nand maimed every day in roadside bomb attacks and ambushes.\n  The issue is not whether our troops can gain control of a few city \nblocks but whether there is any way that we can stop Iraq's civil war.\n  I challenge anyone to say how we can do that, when the Iraqis do not \nyet have the political will to do it themselves.\n  The Iraqi Army is fraught with ethnic divisions and few Iraqi units \nare capable of fighting successfully on their own.\n  As others have pointed out, it often appears the Shiite-dominated \nIraqi Army is simply out to settle scores with the Sunnis who ruled \nIraq under Saddam Hussein. The unfortunate truth is that the Iraqi Army \ncannot bring security now, and it is unlikely to be able to in the \ncoming years without overwhelming, side-by-side support and sacrifice \nof American soldiers.\n  That leaves political reconciliation, and we all know where that \nstands. The Iraqis are no closer to an oil revenue-sharing agreement, \nno closer to an acceptable political arrangement, and no closer to a \nfunctioning government that serves all Iraqis. Our presence has become \nan excuse for inaction. Why should Shiites sacrifice when they have \nAmerican forces to die for them?\n  Why should the Kurds be more conciliatory when they think we will \nprotect them forever? Why should the Sunnis reconcile among themselves \nwhen they can fight Americans together?\n  Rory Stewart, an insightful author and observer of the Middle East, \nrecently commented that our presence in Iraq--is to use his phrase--\n``infantilizing Iraqi politics,'' making the Iraqis completely \nincapable of finding their own way.\n  As our troops are withdrawing, we should make a concerted diplomatic \npush, bringing together representatives of Iraq's Government and Iraq's \nneighbors.\n  They would have little choice but to recognize that without the U.S. \nmilitary's constant presence, they have to make some kind of \naccommodation among themselves.\n  That is what the Levin-Reed and the Feingold-Reid-Leahy amendments \nwould accomplish.\n  Based closely on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, both \namendments would require the withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq to \ncommence within 120 days.\n  By springtime of next year, only a small number of troops necessary \nfor limited counter terrorism, force protection, and training purposes \nwould remain in the country.\n  These amendments would effectively end the U.S. military presence in \nIraq as we know it.\n  The White House wants to wait to until September, when General \nPetraeus will report on progress from the surge. Yet it is folly to \nwait when we already know what the answer will be.\n  We are going to hear words like: The situation is still challenging, \nbut we are making progress. We are going to get a report like the \nglossy one released last week, which said the Iraqis are making \nprogress in some areas, as if that is enough reason to continue further \nstill down the wrong road.\n  We can already see the way the review is predetermined in statements \nof General Petraeus's deputies.\n  General Odierno told reporters a couple of months ago that the \ncurrent surge level of U.S. troops would be needed in Iraq through next \nyear. Major General Lynch, the commander of the southern portion of \nBaghdad, echoed that view only yesterday.\n  We in Congress have a constitutional responsibility to act now.\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\n  If we put off developing a consensus plan for the redeployment of \nU.S. forces, more of our troops will be needlessly killed and wounded. \nMore innocent Iraqis will lose their lives. And, as today's public \nsummaries of the National Intelligence Assessment on al-Qaida \nunderscore, the war in Iraq has made our country less safe. It is an \nindictment of the ruinous policies and strategies this administration \nhas pursued in Iraq, year after year.\n  We must end this treadmill trudge to nowhere. We must show the Iraqis \nthat only they can save their country. It is time to shift focus back \nto Afghanistan and to rebuild our military and our defenses at home. It \nis time to restore our reputation as a nation united in combating \nterrorism but unwilling any longer to sacrifice our sons, our daughters \nor our values for a flawed policy that cannot succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is there a speaking order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Alaska may \nhave an amendment to offer, and when she does, I will be happy to yield \nthe floor to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator from Alaska planning to offer an amendment?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator seek the floor at this time? Without \nyielding the floor, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understood it would be necessary \nbefore I offer such an amendment that there be a unanimous consent \nrequest propounded. I look to the floor managers at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will speak, and if the Senator from Alaska wishes to \noffer her amendment and that has been worked out, I will yield the \nfloor to the Senator from Alaska. I am not offering an amendment at \nthis time. Whenever she wishes to proceed, tap me on the shoulder.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address an issue which may be perceived as a \nbit arcane and is outside the policy within the debate that is \noccurring here, which is actually quite critical to the fiscal \ndiscipline of our Government and especially the Congress.\n  This bill comes forward as a reconciliation bill. This is an arcane \nterm which arises out of the Budget Act. The Budget Act creates the \nability for the Budget Committee, when it is creating a budget, to give \ninstructions to various committees within the Congress to meet goals \nset forth by the Budget Committee. These instructions are called \nreconciliation instructions.\n  The purpose of reconciliation is to control entitlement spending \nprimarily and to control the rate of growth of the Government, in fact, \nas a purpose.\n  It was structured because although part of the budget can discipline \ndiscretionary spending through what is known as caps, it is virtually \nimpossible to discipline the rate of growth of Government on the \nentitlement account side through spending caps because entitlements are \nprograms which people have a right to and a spending cap has no impact \non it.\n  So if we are going to affect the rate of growth of spending on the \nentitlement side, programs which people by law have a right to receive \nand is a Federal benefit--that is programs such as veterans' benefits, \neducation benefits under the Pell grant, in some instances, Medicare, \nMedicaid. Those are all entitlement programs. If you are going to \ncontrol those entitlements, you actually have to change the law.\n  So the Budget Committee--and it is probably the primary power vested \nin the Budget Committee--passes a budget to direct various committees \nin the Congress that have jurisdiction over various entitlement \nprograms to control the rate of those programs and, thus, the rate of \ngrowth of the Federal Government.\n  That was always the concept of the Budget Act--control the rate of \ngrowth of the Federal Government, especially in the entitlement \naccounts through reconciliation.\n  But what has happened is a total adulteration of that purpose. In a \nrather effective sleight of hand, the Budget Committee, with the full \nknowledge of the Budget Committee on the majority side and with the \nfull knowledge of the majority side, gave a savings instruction to the \nHELP Committee to save $750 million over 5 years, which is a lot of \nmoney, but under the Federal budgeting process actually is still an \nasterisk.\n  Why would the Budget Committee ask the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee to save $750 million over 5 years, when it asked no \nother committee in the Congress to save money in the entitlement \naccounts? None. No other committee was asked to discipline fiscal \nspending around here on entitlement accounts.\n  Well, because it was a ruse, a pure unadulterated ruse. The HELP \nCommittee, under the able and wily leadership of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, whom I greatly admire as one of the finer legislators in \nthis body, had identified a pool of money which they knew they could \ngrab, specifically subsidies which are paid by the Federal Government \nto lenders and which are unquestionably excessive--there is no debate \nabout that.\n  That pool of money had been identified by the wily chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He knew that if he \ncould get his hands on that money, he could then spend it. But he also \nknew he couldn't get his hands on that money without a reconciliation \ninstruction from the Budget Committee.\n\n  So what happened was we had this small, in the context of Federal \nspending around here, budget savings instruction of $750 million given \nto the HELP Committee by the Budget Committee, with reconciliation \nappended to it as a protection. What reconciliation protection means is \nthe bill comes to the floor, it has to be completed in 20 hours, and it \nonly takes 51 votes to pass it. That is a huge protection in the \nSenate--protection from the filibuster rule, protection from the \nstandard operating practice of the Senate with a lot of amendments \noccurring which could take up to weeks. It is an immense power to give \nto a bill to identify it as a reconciliation bill for the purposes of \npassage. So that bill, that power of reconciliation was attached to a \n$750 million instruction for savings.\n  Then the HELP Committee passed out that bill, the reconciliation \nbill. I believe it is a $19.7 billion bill--$19.75 billion, something \nlike that. What happened to the other $19 billion in savings? It is \nbeing spent.\n  This chart reflects it fairly well. The new spending, under expansion \nof programs under reconciliation, under this bill, will be $19 billion. \nThe actual savings under the bill will be making a farce of the concept \nof controlling the size of the Federal Government and Federal spending \nthrough the reconciliation process, inverting the process, to be quite \nhonest, at a rate of 1 to 20.\n  Ironically, when the budget left the Senate, it had an amendment in \nit which said--because I offered the amendment, so I am familiar with \nit and it was passed, which was even more surprising--which said that \nno reconciliation bill could spend more than 20 percent, which I \nthought was still too much, of the amount saved.\n  Had that amendment survived the conference process, this bill could \nnot have come to the floor because this bill spends $20 for every $1 it \nsaves. Under that amendment, not the reverse but a significantly \ndifferent approach would have had to have been taken. It would have had \nto save $5 for every $1 it spent.\n  This is a totally new practice. This is a historical use of \nreconciliation. We can see that deficit reduction over the years \nthrough reconciliation has occurred rather dramatically. But in this \nbill, in this budget, there was no deficit reduction through \nreconciliation.\n  More importantly--and this is the real essence of the problem--the \nspending under the Federal budget, the alleged reductions had no impact \non spending. Spending continues to go up dramatically because actually \nthe mechanisms that are supposed to be\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nused to reduce the size of spending or the rate of growth of spending--\nwe never actually reduce spending around here--reduce the rate of \ngrowth of spending and the rate of growth of a Federal program is a \nmechanism that is now being used to dramatically expand the rate of \ngrowth of spending of the Federal Government.\n  So the Budget Act, which has been under significant pressure to begin \nwith, and basically in 3 of the last 5 years we haven't even been able \nto pass a budget, has now essentially been emasculated as a concept of \ndisciplining spending and is now being used as a mechanism to expand \nthe size of the Federal Government and destroy the fundamental purpose \nof reconciliation.\n  Why is this a problem? Whether we like to admit to it, we have some \nhuge issues coming at us in the area of entitlement spending in this \ncountry. We have on the books $65 trillion--that is trillion with a T--\nof unfunded liability in the three major mandatory or entitlement \naccounts--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n  The only way, I suspect, that we are going to be able to manage some \nsort of disciplining of those programs so they are affordable for our \nchildren, so we don't pass on to our children a Government that \nbasically overwhelms their capacity to pay for it, is through using the \nreconciliation process. But that process has been, for all intents and \npurposes, run over. A new concept has been developed.\n  Reconciliation will no longer be used to control the rate of growth \nof the Federal Government. It will be used as a stalking horse for \nexpanding the rate of growth of the Federal Government. The great \nirony, of course, is it did not have to happen this way. The equities \nare on the side of the Senator from Massachusetts relative to the need \nto reduce the subsidy to lenders and, in fact, I proposed an idea which \nwould have probably seen a much bigger reduction in lender subsidies, \nwhich would be an outright auction so we could actually find what is \nthe market value of what should be paid for these accounts.\n  Even the administration wanted to take a fair percentage of those \nfunds that would be saved from lenders and move them into Pell grants. \nMy druthers, of course, but I am not in the majority and I suspect I \nwouldn't win this fight, would be to take a big chunk of the money and \nput it into Pell grants and a big chunk of money and put it into \ndeficit reduction so we start to pay down some of the problems we are \npresenting our children. But under any scenario, the protection of \nreconciliation was not necessary to accomplish this funding. In fact, \nit would have been good had reconciliation not been used because then \nwe would have tied to this bill the underlying policy of the Higher \nEducation Act, which should be passing the Senate at the same time this \nfunding mechanism is passing this Senate.\n\n  But, no, the choice was to go this cut-by-half proposal, which in the \nprocess has fundamentally harmed our capacity as Congress to discipline \nourselves and is using a vehicle meant to control the rate of growth of \nGovernment to expand the rate of growth of the Government.\n  I probably am the only person in this body frustrated by this \nsituation because I may be the last person in this body who believes we \nshould use reconciliation for fiscal discipline. But I thought the \npoint should be made as former chairman of the Budget Committee that we \nhave now, for all intents and purposes, as a body, abandoned any \nattempt--not any attempt but the one vehicle that gave us credibility \non the one issue of doing something about the most significant issue we \nconfront as a nation after the question of how we fight Islamic \nfundamentalists who wish to do us harm with weapons of mass \ndestruction. After that issue, which pervades all other issues, the \nmost significant issue is the fact that we are about to pass on to our \nchildren a government that under no circumstances can they afford \nbecause the cost of entitlement accounts is going to exceed their \ncapacity to pay for those accounts by huge numbers.\n  In fact, we had a study last week from CBO that said in order to pay \nfor the pending entitlement responsibilities of the baby boom \ngeneration--Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security--tax rates in this \ncountry will have to go to 92 percent--92 percent--of income. \nObviously, that is not a doable event. The one mechanism we had around \nhere to force action effectively has now been emasculated by the \nprocess which we are participating in on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention to offer an \namendment. As I understand, there needs to be a unanimous consent \nrequest prior to my doing so; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding time remaining for debate on the Kennedy substitute \namendment, an amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2329 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2329 to amendment 2327.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated for the college access \n                       partnership grant program)\n\n       On page 55, line 23, strike ``$25,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$113,000,000''.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are talking today about the Higher \nEducation Access Act. When we talk about higher education and the \nimportance of higher education in this country, it is all about access. \nWe can have incredible universities, we can have wonderful schools \nwithin our State systems, but if the students do not have access to \nthem due to financial constraints or whatever the limitations may be, \nwe have not truly provided for access, we have not truly provided for \nour young people to better themselves to the fullest extent possible.\n  There are many significant provisions contained within the Higher \nEducation Access Act. I am pleased to have been able to participate in \nthe good work of the chairman and the ranking member in moving this \nthrough the HELP Committee.\n  There is one provision contained within higher education that \nestablishes a provision called the College Access Partnership Grant \nProgram, again, speaking to how we truly provide for access to our \ncolleges.\n  The budget instructions directed the HELP Committee to save some $750 \nmillion for deficit reduction. This is what the Senator from New \nHampshire was referring to a moment ago. The Higher Education Access \nAct saves $930 million. This amendment, the amendment that I am \nproposing this afternoon, would redirect $176 million from deficit \nreduction to making sure that more American students, more of our young \npeople, are able to access and to succeed in college.\n\n  Think about how many initiatives we have on this Senate floor to \nprovide for a better America, a better country, to make us more \ncompetitive in the world market. How do we do it? We have been focusing \non our young people and providing them with the opportunities. We have \nbeen focusing on aspects of education, whether it is through an \nemphasis on accountability, such as we have seen in the No Child Left \nBehind, or the more recent focus we have made in focusing on science \nand engineering so that our young people are truly competitors in that \nworld market today. We need to be serious about investing in our \nchildren's education and truly in their future.\n  What this amendment would do is expand the borrower benefits that are \noffered to low-income students, the very students we know are not \ngraduating with college degrees. Our statistics don't lie to us. We \nknow those in the lower income category are not going into college in \nthe first place, so many of them, and then many who do are not\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nsuccessful in completion. Of the 75 percent of high school seniors who \ncontinue their studies, only 50 percent of them receive a degree 5 \nyears after enrolling in postsecondary education, and only 25 percent \nof them receive a bachelor's degree or higher. So we are not seeing \ncompletion. But for the lower income families, 21 percent who enroll in \ncollege complete a bachelor's degree as compared to 62 percent of \nhigher income students who enroll.\n  So what is the problem? What are we doing wrong? What are we not \ndoing enough of, need to do more of, and how can we truly provide this \ncollege education that for generation after generation has been what \nfamilies seek for their children--go on to college, go on and make \nyourself a better contributor to American society.\n  In my State of Alaska--unfortunately, I am not quite sure what our \nstatistics are now--when I was serving in the legislature we were \nseeing only about 30 percent of our high school graduates going on to \ncollege--only about 30 percent going on to college. Why are they not \ngoing? Part of it is due to finances.\n  As we all know, the cost of a college education is going through the \nroof. My husband and I are saving for our two boys, and with one of \nthem approaching his junior year in high school right now, it is a \nreality check for us as a family as to how we are going to make college \na reality for our children. I know across this country families \nstruggle with that.\n  So there is so much, again, in the Higher Education Access Act that \ndoes promote and does allow for benefits to the students. The funding \nwe are talking about in my amendment would expand the borrower benefits \ncurrently offered in States such as mine to low-income and to Pell-\neligible students in all the States. This is a college access \npartnership program. And what it would do is give the States the \nability to help more of their low-income students attend and to succeed \nin college. We don't want them to just get the help to get there and \nthen give it up after a year because the finances are hitting them or \nthey do not know where else to turn.\n  What does this college access partnership grant actually do? What we \nare attempting to do is provide for that outreach, provide for the \neducation not only to the students but to the families so that they \nknow what is available, they know what the financing options are to \nthem, and they are helped with the financial literacy and with debt \nmanagement. I don't know how many of you have had to go through a \ncollege application recently, but it can be a daunting task. And if you \nare perhaps from a family who hasn't had an opportunity to do this \nbefore, it may be so daunting that you are precluded from doing it.\n  Financial literacy: We all know that sometimes the language that is \ncontained in the application, just in understanding what it is that you \nneed to do to fill out the application, can be mind numbing. So it \nprovides the information.\n  The outreach activities: We need to make sure we are reaching out to \nthose students who may be at risk of not enrolling or, again, in not \ncompleting their postsecondary education. They need to know what their \noptions are. So we need to go to them, and we need to help them. We \nhave a program in Alaska called the Alaska Advantage Higher Education \nFinancial Aid Program. We try to go out and let the students know what \nis available and try to help them ahead of time.\n  This program would also provide for assistance in completion of the \nFree Application for Federal Student Aid, the FAFSA application. I \nunderstand that we are talking about an eight-page application. We have \neliminated some of, I guess, the complications, if you will, with that \napplication through the HEA legislation itself, but let's not let the \napplication be a barrier. Let's figure out ways to help the students \nfrom the very beginning; professional development for guidance \ncounselors at middle schools and secondary schools, and financial \nadministrators and college admissions counselors at institutions of \nhigher education, to improve their ability to assist the students and \nthe parents. I know from my personal situation that when you have a \ngood guidance counselor who can help you along the way, you are one of \nthe lucky ones. If you are one that is just kind of given the packet \nand told to go at it, kid, you may or may not feel that you have that \nsupport. We want to be able to provide for the support, that \nprofessional development to assist the students.\n  The program would also provide assistance in applying to institutions \nof higher education, applying for the Federal student financial \nassistance and other State, local, and private student financial \nassistance and scholarships. There is so much that is available out \nthere, if you know where to look. And sometimes you just are not quite \nsure which rocks you need to turn over in order to provide for your \nfinances for college. So this would, again, lay out the options and \nassist you with that.\n  It would also provide activities that increase the student's ability \nto successfully complete the course work required for a postsecondary \ndegree, including activities such as tutoring and mentoring. We need to \nrecognize that access to college is not just about getting in the door. \nIt is gaining the benefits that are afforded you through the college \nprogram, through that university program, through the programs that are \ngoing to benefit you. So our job is not done just with the successful \napplication. If individuals need that assistance in working through \nsome of the bureaucracy, let's try to help.\n\n  Finally, it provides for activities to improve secondary school \nstudents' preparedness for postsecondary entrance examinations. These \nare all things, in different areas, where we can make a difference with \nstudents in letting them know what is out there and what is available \nto them.\n  Mr. President, as we look to ways that we can truly help with access \nto higher education, we know we need to help students with the \nfinancial end of it, but we also need to provide some assistance with \nthe navigation, and this College Access Partnership Program does just \nthat. Through this amendment, we are providing for additional funding \nto be included into that program to make it meaningful to all of the 50 \nStates so that they can truly provide that help and assistance.\n  I would certainly urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wanted to just thank the Senator for her leadership in \nthis College Access Partnership Program, and I commend her amendment. \nAs she knows, and Senator Enzi understands, we tried to make an \nestimate in terms of the cost of the total legislation, and we ended up \nwith an excess of $176 million over the 5-year period. And the \namendment of the Senator from Alaska will take that money, those \nresources, and make it available to the States. They will be able to \nuse it with nonprofit organizations to help children have access to \ncollege. I commend her for that.\n  We have tried, as she knows, in this legislation, to deal with some \nof the financial aspects that have discouraged particularly students \nwho come from working families--middle-income, low-income families--\nfrom going on to college. The Senator mentioned the FAFSA application, \nwhich currently is a voluminous document, and through the solid good \njudgment of our friend from Wyoming, who has worked on that and has \nsimplified it in a very important and significant way, so that now the \napplication will not be so great an impediment.\n  Too often these young people do not have the knowledge, the \nencouragement, or the awareness of college opportunities, and the \nSenator's good amendment will make this funding available nationwide--\nnationwide--so that programs that reach out to children will be \navailable to help them be able to go on to college.\n  She has spoken eloquently about the challenges that her State faces \nas a rural State, and we have tried to work with her and will continue \nto work with her to meet that responsibility. In other areas, we can \nsee, in my own State of Massachusetts, how these resources can help \nsupport the nonprofit organizations, such as the Educational Resource \nInstitute, which supports and works with the GEAR-UP programs and the \nTRIO programs which have been enormously successful in our State.\n  So this is something that I know the Senator has cared very deeply \nabout,\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\nshe has spoken about it in our committee, and we had indicated we \nwanted to work with her. I can't think of how these resources--and they \nare not insignificant--but how these resources could be spent more \neffectively or better. So I thank the Senator, and I hope we will have \na chance to address this and vote on this amendment, and I would \ncertainly hope we get a very strong vote.\n  I thank her for her work, and I think the people in Alaska and in \nmany other States will benefit from this in a very important and \nsignificant way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself time. I also want to \ncongratulate the Senator from Alaska. This amendment continues to \nrecognize the unique role that many of our not-for-profit lenders have \nin providing information and services to students and to their \nfamilies. They conduct outreach to make college possible and assist in \ndebt management and default prevention. The not-for-profits focus on \ncommunities, and they serve students locally, and I am pleased the \nSenator from Alaska was able to continue to acknowledge the important \ncontribution that those entities make.\n  I do appreciate the emphasis she placed on how formidable it is to do \none of the FAFSA applications. Just as Senator Kennedy, I also have one \nof the applications, which we have now reduced to one page on two \nsides, as opposed to this on two sides. So it would not be quite as \nformidable, if we are able to pass this bill, as it has been in the \npast. So I appreciate the emphasis on that and congratulate the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to myself under Senator \nKennedy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Higher \nEducation Access Act of 2007, and I want to commend Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi for their great leadership on this measure.\n  This very important legislation, which I helped craft as a member of \nthe Senate Education Committee, makes a substantial Federal investment \nin need-based grant aid for low-income students and helps middle-class \nstudents and families pay down and manage their loan debt. It will be a \nsignificant contribution to the overall welfare of American families, \nand it will be the critical key, I believe, to opportunity in America.\n  Opportunity in America is a strong and direct function of education. \nIndeed, education is the engine that moves people forward. This \nlegislation renews our commitment to ensuring that all Americans with \nthe drive and talent to go to college are provided the financial means \nto do so. We understand how critical that is. A college education has \nnow become increasingly necessary. In the generation of my parents, \nvery few people went to college. It was seen as a special distinction, \nsomething that was, in some cases, unique. There was a society and an \neconomy then that could accommodate people who graduated from high \nschool who could then go on, with great dedication, diligence, and the \nskills they learned, to provide for their families and provide for \ntheir retirement.\n  Today, that has all changed. College is a necessity not only for the \nNation in terms of expanding our intellectual capital but for families \nin order to make their way, in order to provide for a decent living, in \norder to provide for their children and to provide for their \nretirement.\n\n  College graduates, on average, earn 62 percent more than high school \ngraduates. So college education pays off in the bottom line of American \nfamilies. And, indeed, over a lifetime, the difference in wages between \nthose with a high school diploma versus those with a bachelor's or \nhigher degree exceeds one million dollars.\n  What we are seeing now in this society is troubling to me because we \nall understand the importance of an education. One of the key hallmarks \nin America is opportunity. We pride ourselves, going all the way back \nto Horatio Alger, as being a place where anyone with a little pluck and \na little education can go a long way.\n  It turns out that recent research is showing that this opportunity is \ndecreasing. Prior to the 1990s, the correlation between a parents' \nincome and their children's income was approximately 20 percent, which \nis good because it means if you come from modest circumstances you have \nan 80-percent chance you will rise above your parents' income to the \nnext level of economic well-being in this country. Now that was before \nthe 1990s. In the 1990s, the number rose to 40 percent. So the \ndifference between your parents' income and your income was getting \ncloser and closer. You weren't rising as far above your parents. Today, \neconomists estimate that 60 percent of a son's income is determined by \nthe level of the income of his father.\n  So we are no longer a place in which you can far exceed your parents' \nincome with a little pluck and a little education. The way we rectify \nthat is to give more people the chance to obtain a higher education. As \nI have demonstrated with these statistics, that is the key to economic \nprogress in this country. But it is also the key to social progress and \nmaintaining the fabric of America.\n  As an individual moves through school, we hope they are not just \nlearning about technical skills and applying that to the economy, but \nthat they are also learning to be a good citizen and learning the \nvalues of America, values we hope will one day inspire the whole world \nin a very positive way.\n  To reverse this troubling trend, a trend in which opportunity is not \nas readily available in our society, we have to invest in education. I \nhave the particular privilege of being the successor to Senator \nClaiborne Pell. He recognized in the 1960s that education was the key. \nWe have named, and rightfully so, the Pell grant after Claiborne Pell. \nHe understood profoundly that if you let Americans with drive and \ntalent go on to college, and provide them with the financial resources \nto do so, they will do great things, and they will compel this country \nto do great things.\n  I would say that a lot of the great breakthroughs which have been \ntranslated into today's robust economy stem from the fact that 30 years \nago, beginning with my generation, young men and women with drive and \ntalent had a chance to go on to college. There are so many people today \nwho are captains of industry, there are so many people today who have \ninvented new products, who have deployed these products into the \ncommercial realm, and they have done so because they went to college \nand beyond. In another generation they might have had the talent but \nwould have ended up doing something much less educationally advanced \nbecause they didn't have a college education. That is a huge insight \nand a huge contribution to this country.\n  This legislation builds on Senator Pell's legacy and takes \nsignificant steps toward making college more affordable and ensuring \nthat students with talent go forth and get a college degree. I am \nparticularly pleased that under this legislation Rhode Island students \nwill be eligible for an additional $10 million in need-based grant aid \nnext year, and over $86 million in the next 5 years. That is a \ntremendous input of additional federal financial resources.\n  The effect of this bill's investment in need-based grant aid is to \nincrease the maximum grant for Pell-eligible students from $4,310 to \n$5,100 next year and to $5,400 by the year 2011. That increases the \naverage grant in Rhode Island from $430 in 2008 to $2,870.\n\n  I am also pleased, as has been discussed by my colleagues, that this \nlegislation includes provisions from my Financial Aid Form \nSimplification and Access Act, or FAFSA Act, to significantly increase \nthe number of students automatically eligible for the maximum Pell \ngrant and to reduce the penalty faced by students when they work in \norder to pay for college.\n  Specifically, the increase in the Auto-Zero Expected Family \nContribution ensures that all students from families with incomes of \n$30,000 or less will receive a maximum Pell grant. Currently, only \nfamilies making $20,000 or less automatically qualify for such grants. \nThis provision not only increases the number of low-income students \neligible for need-based aid, but also simplifies the financial aid \nprocess by providing such students with early\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\ninformation and assurances of financial aid for college.\n  Additionally, the income protection allowance protects students who \nhave to work during college so they can earn more without having it \ncount against their financial aid. This legislation doubles the income \nprotection allowance for dependent students from $3,000 to $6,000 over \n4 years, and increases the income protection allowance for independent \nstudents, including adult learners, veterans, and those students in \nfoster care, by 50 percent over 4 years.\n  We should reward work, not penalize it. We should recognize that, in \ntoday's economy, the price of going to school and of getting to school \nis going up and up. Many students have to work. As such, these \nincreases will help students and families better afford a college \neducation by stemming the perverse income protection limits that punish \nstudents and parents who must work one, two, or more jobs to pay for \ncollege.\n  I am also pleased that the legislation includes provisions to stem \nthe increasing numbers of middle-class families falling further and \nfurther into debt to finance a college education. In Rhode Island, 61 \npercent of students graduating from 4-year institutions in the 2004-\n2005 school year graduated with debt at an average of over $20,000 per \nstudent. The Higher Education Access Act will help students manage \ntheir debt by capping student loan payments at 15 percent of a \nborrower's discretionary income and forgiving all debt on such loans \nafter 25 years.\n  So as young people emerge from college with this debt, their payments \nwill be capped, and at some point their loans will be discharged. I \nthink that gives real incentives and real help to people coming out of \nschool, middle-class students who had to borrow money to go to school, \nand now they can go ahead and discharge those payments over many years \nat a rate they can afford.\n  It will also provide loan forgiveness for borrowers who continue in \npublic service careers for 10 years. This is an important aspect. There \nare so many talented people who want to go into teaching or health care \nprofessions, but with all this debt they literally cannot afford to. \nThis legislation gives them an opportunity not only to do what they \nwant to do but to serve their community without being penalized because \nthey have to borrow to get through their college education.\n  It also helps our military members and families by expanding loan \ndeferments for Active-Duty military service. Certainly there is no \ngroup of persons today who deserve that kind of consideration more than \nour military members and their families.\n  I hope we build on this legislation by promptly taking up the long \noverdue reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which passed the \nEducation Committee unanimously last month and includes provisions I \nauthored to simplify the financial aid process and forms; improve the \nLeveraging Education Assistance Partnership--or LEAP--Program and forge \ngreater state investments in need based grant aid; strengthen college \nteacher preparation programs; and provide loan forgiveness for \nlibrarians.\n  This is significant legislation. It is important for families in \nRhode Island and across the Nation. Let me again commend Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi for their excellent work on this bill. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this legislation \nbecomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. I rise today in support of the Higher Education Access \nAct. This legislation will give millions of students an opportunity to \nattend college. As Senator Reed said, it is helping those students with \ntalent get the opportunity to go to college that, in another \ngeneration, prior to the last three decades or so, they simply may not \nhave had. In too many cases, if you look at what has happened to \nstudents of working class families, they are not getting those \nopportunities now that they got a generation ago.\n  We all know what has happened to the cost of college in the last few \nyears. It has doubled since 1980, rising faster than inflation for 20 \nconsecutive years. College tuition has risen faster than the price of \nany other consumer item, including health care. In my home State of \nOhio, between 1981 and 2007, in a quarter of a century, tuition and \nfees have increased 231 percent at public universities and 94 percent \nin 2-year institutions. We know that is because government on the State \nlevel is simply not funding, in very many States, public higher \neducation the way they had in the past. Family incomes cannot keep up. \nThe median household income in Ohio increased just 3 percent between \n2000 and 2006, whereas tuition during that same period went up 53 \npercent in 4-year public institutions and 28 percent at 4-year \nprivate institutions.\n\n  Think about that. Income went up 3 percent for those families, all \nfamilies--including, obviously, families with students of college age--\nyet while income went up 3 percent the cost of education went up either \nby a quarter or a half, depending on what kind of school to which those \nparents sent their children.\n  Even after financial aid is taken into account, 42 percent of median \nfamily income in my State of Ohio is needed to pay for a year of \ncollege in a 4-year public college. A 2006 report by the National \nCenter for Public Policy and Higher Education gave Ohio an F in college \naffordability. Our students, our families, our economy are feeling the \nimpact.\n  Think again about what that means to a middle-class family. To so \nmany working families, college tuition has gone up 25, 50 percent over \na several-year period, while income has gone up only 2 or 3 or 4 \npercent for most of the students.\n  My wife was the first in her family to go to college. She grew up in \nAshtabula, OH. She went to Kent State University. It was difficult for \nher family, but in those days her dad held a union job. Her mother went \nto work about the time she went to school. Her mother was a home care \nworker. She didn't make very much money, but she had a decent union \njob. She had a lower paying job, but with grants and aid and all of \nthat, she was able to go to a State university, as were her three \nyounger siblings, two daughters and a son. So all four of them, the \nfirst four in their family to go to college, were able to do that. That \nwas in the 1970s and 1980s. This is a different era where, \nunfortunately, because of decisions made in the State government and, \nfrankly, because of a stinginess from the Federal Government, it has \nmade it that much harder for students to go to school.\n  More and more students are going out of State to attend college. Ohio \nstudents are. The ones who stay find they can't afford it. This is \nunacceptable. If we are asking our students to be competitive, we must \nmake the investment in them.\n  For students lucky enough to make it to college, they are rewarded \nnot only with a degree, we hope, but also saddled with crippling debt. \nSixty-six percent of students in Toledo and Dayton and Steubenville and \nYoungstown, Galion and Gallipolis, 66 percent of students graduating \nfrom 4-year institutions in the 2004-2005 school year graduated with \ndebt. Two-thirds of all students graduated with debt. Those students \nowed an average of $19,259. That affects their future. It affects the \njob they choose. It affects their ability to marry and have children \nand what they are able to face with the financial challenges and the \ndebt that they bear from the moment they graduate.\n  Even worse, the purchasing power of the Pell grant--Senator Reid \ntalked about that--the main source of grant income assisting lower \nincome students--has dropped dramatically. Students and parents are \nfinding it harder and harder to figure out a way to finance their \neducation.\n  Look back at this whole picture. Tuition has gone up 25 percent to 50 \npercent, depending on whether you go to a private or public college, \nover the last few years. Wages have gone up 3 or 4 percent. Students \nwho are able to go to college at all and face that get the grants and \nloans that can get them through their 2- or 4-year institution and end \nup with a debt--two-thirds of these students end up with a debt on the \naverage of $20,000. Think of what\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\nthat does. All this at a time when privately subsidized student lenders \nsuch as Sallie Mae are reporting record profits and raking in millions \nof dollars off the backs of the students.\n  The Presiding Officer and I and several Members of the freshman class \ntoday had a news conference decrying what has happened with the \nprivatization of parts of the military, what has happened with private \ncontractors, the kind of fraud they have committed, how it doesn't save \ntaxpayer dollars, how it doesn't make for a stronger military, how it \ndoesn't mean a more efficient government. What we are seeing, with the \nleadership of Senator Webb and Senator McCaskill, is the graft and \nfraud and inefficiency they are exposing in the Pentagon budget and in \nthe private contracting in the Pentagon. We also see that same kind of \nprivatization and the impact it has on Medicare, with the drug \ncompanies and the insurance companies rewarded at taxpayer expense. We \nsee it, obviously, in Social Security, where some in this institution \nwant to privatize Social Security. We see it in public education. We \nare having a big battle this week on No Child Left Behind, in the same \ncommittee Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi jointly run, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, Pension Committee. We will see that there, with some \nof the private education efforts on for-profit schools. We have seen it \nespecially in the student loan program where this kind of privatization \nmeans fewer dollars are available to go directly to students. Taxpayer \ndollars are wasted. It is less efficient. It leads in many cases to \nfraud and graft. It also leads, frankly, to political contributions for \nthose politicians who support these privatization efforts.\n  You can look at Halliburton, you can look at many of these \ncompanies--the drug industry which was rewarded on the Medicare bill \nwith literally $200 billion more because of that bill over a 10-year \nperiod than they would have had otherwise. Look at the Medicare bill \nand private insurance companies, how they were ``enticed'' is the word \nwe use around here; another more direct word might be ``bribed''--but \nthey were enticed to enter the Prescription Drug Program by Government \nsubsidies. Again, the money makes for less efficiency, more waste, more \nmoney lining the pockets of individual contributors, whether it is \nMedicare in a prescription drug benefit or students in a student loan \nbenefit and ultimately more costs for already overburdened taxpayers.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It will finally start \nto trim back as well as stop this privatization of our Government, stop \nthese companies from basically taking money that is public dollars and \nputting it into their pockets without providing the service they should \nprovide directly to the beneficiaries we have designated.\n  This legislation will finally start to trim back those bloated \nsubsidies to private lenders and focus those scarce dollars where they \nare needed most, to our students. It will begin to hold colleges \naccountable for rising costs and assure that students and parents have \nthe information they need to make informed decisions about what college \nto attend. It will raise the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year, \nincreasing to $5,400 by 2011. The average grant in Ohio will increase \n$430 next year to $2,850.16.\n  This Pell grant was stuck, in spite of the President's promises in \n2000 in his first Presidential campaign--the Pell grant had been stuck \nat that level for 5 years. Senator Kennedy's leadership, Senator Reid's \nleadership early in this session, increased the Pell grant in the \ncontinuing resolution back in January. We are increasing it again over \nthe next 3 years.\n  This bill will help nontraditional and community college students by \nmaking them eligible for Pell grants. It will help protect students by \nreforming a broken student loan system, a far too privatized student \nloan system that now provides too much in the way of subsidies to \nprivate lenders. It will make sure student interests are the motivating \nfactors behind college decisions to recommend lenders. This bill \npromotes innovative teacher preparation programs so our students are \nbetter prepared for college.\n  This bill doesn't do everything we need. We need to work to keep \ninterest rates down in the totally privatized student loan system, the \nmost rapidly growing part of the student loan system, because prices \nhave gone up so dramatically the Federal programs have not been able to \nkeep up. More students have to turn to totally private loans, and those \ntotally private loans have seen interest rates go as high as 18 \npercent.\n  Senator Kennedy is interested in that legislation. We have introduced \nseparate legislation to do that. That is something we hope to pursue \ndown the line. But this legislation begins to stop the privatization of \nstudent loans. This legislation we are voting on, the legislation \nSenator Kennedy brought to the floor, will begin to arrest the \nprivatization of this system, where too many people outside of the \nstudent and the Government have benefited from the privatization of \nthis system. It is time that taxpayer dollars go directly to students \nto create the opportunities so they can go to college so they can be \nproductive citizens.\n  That is what we did 30 years ago, in this institution, before many of \nus were here. Senator Kennedy was there. The leadership he showed 30 \nyears ago in making this system work to give opportunity to middle-\nclass kids, to working-class kids, to poor kids--this bill moves in \nthat direction.\n  All students, regardless of their family, regardless of their \nprivilege, regardless of who their parents are, should be able to \nafford college.\n  We still have so much to do. This legislation is a good step in the \nright direction.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would love to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend from Ohio for an \nexcellent statement. He has reminded us when we first, in the early \n1960s, had the national debate on whether there should be a Federal \nresponsibility to help students to go on to schools and colleges. We \nhad taken the step with the GI bill. We had taken some steps after \nSputnik. But the real, major step had been the GI bill after World War \nII. We made that judgment in the 1960s.\n  At the time, we were trying to find out how we were going to get the \nlending institutions involved. There was a real question about what \nkind of incentive they had to give to the lending institutions to get \nthem involved, to make sure that the program was going to work.\n  That is the issue we have been trying to address in this legislation. \nWe have taken some $18 billion out of the lenders and returned it to \nthe students. I think we will hear, probably later in this debate, that \nmight be too much. We will come back and demonstrate that, even the \nSallie Maes and the others are indicating even with this cut that they \nare expecting the profits in the years 2012 and 2013 to be in excess of \n$2 billion.\n  As the Senator points out, we know even with these Government \nprograms there is still a ways to go. We are making a downpayment, but \nI want to give assurances to the Senator from Ohio because he has been \nso concerned, this is a continuing, ongoing commitment certainly on my \npart.\n  The part I want to particularly mention is that we have seen this \nreal explosion in terms of the borrowing in the private sector at these \nextraordinary rates. We are attempting, with the Banking Committee, to \ntry to work that out, so that is going to be consistent with what we \nare trying to do, and that is to make sure that, for middle-income \nfamilies and working families, they are going to get the lowest \npossible costs.\n  I commend the Senator. I happen to believe we ought to do that \nthrough an auction system. I stated that, expressed it. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has. We have a very modest provision--up to 20 \npercent of the funding in this will be subject to the auction process. \nWe are doing a trial program with this. I think it will be very \nsuccessful. But I think he would agree that we auction off bombs for \nthe Federal Government every day--week, evidently. We auction off oil \nand gas leases. We auction off all kinds of different things.\n  I would think in the long run, to make it available to the greatest \nnumbers of students at the lowest possible costs, we ought to do it in \nthe old-fashioned way of competition. We are not there yet, but I would \nbe interested, if he is interested, in continuing to work\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\non this whole area as we move along. This is a reauthorization that we \nplan to get, but I think there is a lot we can do in these next few \nyears to continue to work on this.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank Chairman Kennedy for his leadership. It is clear \nto me, as it obviously is to him, that we made tremendous progress in \nthis legislation, with putting dollars that have gone into the excess \nprofits of a relatively small number of companies--putting those \ndollars either back in taxpayers' pockets or giving it directly to \nstudents through this loan program. There is more work to do, and I \nappreciate his interest in doing that.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from New \nJersey on his feet. I will yield him time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during today's session, when the Senate \nconsiders the amendment offered by Senator Murkowski and an amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy; that they be debated concurrently for as \nmuch time as they might consume; that no amendments be in order on \neither amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that on \nThursday, July 19, the Senate resume consideration of these amendments \nat 12 noon and there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation \nto each amendment under this agreement; that the Murkowski amendment be \nthe first vote in the sequence; that all debate time prior to the votes \nbe equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the bill on Thursday, there be 10 hours \nof debate remaining equally divided and controlled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withheld.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nNew Jersey should use on the bill.\n  I wished to thank the Senator from New Jersey. We had been meeting \nearlier in the afternoon with a Hispanic task force. Their priorities \nwere the areas of education, early education, No Child Left Behind, \naccess in terms of higher education.\n  Senator Menendez and Senator Salazar were leaders with that group. I \nam always moved by the Senator from New Jersey's own story, about the \nimportance of these Pell grants and the importance of loans, his own \nlife experience as well as those of his friends.\n  I hope he will at least share some of that with us this afternoon. It \nis an inspiring story. If there is any reason for the efforts we are \nmaking this afternoon, the Senator from New Jersey is an excellent \nexample.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Let me thank my distinguished colleague and the \nchairman of the committee from Massachusetts for his kind words. Above \nall, I wish to commend him for his incredible leadership, for standing \nup for the Nation's students, and for putting forth a bill that will \nmake a tremendous difference for students across the Nation who are \nstruggling to afford college.\n  I know in an era in which we lament the lack of bipartisanship, I \nalso wish to commend the ranking Republican on the committee, Senator \nEnzi. I was privileged to be sitting in the chair when he was talking \nabout this bill. I appreciate very much the same spirit he brings to \nthis legislation, the leadership he has also shown working with Senator \nKennedy to make the legislation that has come to the floor that I think \nshould receive the very broad support of the Senate.\n  Certainly, I wish to rise in strong support of the Higher Education \nAccess Act, which takes some critical steps to making higher education \nmore accessible and more affordable for our Nation's young people. In a \nworld that has been transformed by technology, in which the boundaries \nof mankind have largely been erased in the pursuit of human capital, \nfor the creation of a product and the delivery of a service, so that an \nengineer's report that is created in India and transmitted back to the \nUnited States for a fraction of the cost or a radiologist's report may \nhave been done in Pakistan and read by your doctor in your local \nhospital or if you have a problem with your credit card, as I recently \ndid, you end up with a call center in South Africa.\n  Well, in the pursuit of human capital, we are globally challenged. So \nfor America to continue to be the global economic leader, it needs to \nbe at the apex of the curve of intellect. That means the most highly \neducated generation of Americans the Nation has ever known. Of course, \nto achieve that, there must be both access and affordability for this \nnext generation of Americans to be able to be the scientists, the \nengineers, the mathematicians who can fuel our competitiveness in the \nworld.\n  This bill, in my mind, in addition to providing educational \nopportunities, is about meeting the Nation's challenge in this global \ncompetitive marketplace we are in.\n  The bill begins to right the imbalance that has plagued student \nfinancial aid. For far too long, students struggling to afford college \nhave seen their grants shrink, their loan rates go up, their debt \nexplode--their debt explode.\n  This bill turns that trend around, by increasing grant aid for the \nneediest students and making a $17 billion investment in student aid, \nthe largest since the passage of the GI bill.\n  We all know that education is the key--the key--that unlocks social \nmobility and economic empowerment and opportunity in this country. I \nknow that, as Senator Kennedy suggested, from my own personal \nexperience. I have said before, that as someone who is the first in his \nfamily to go to college, the reality is, but for the power of the \nFederal Government's financial assistance, without Pell grants, one of \nthe programs we are talking about today, I certainly would not have \nbeen able to afford college or go to law school, nor would I have had \naccess to opportunities that my college education afforded me, and I \ncertainly would not be here today as the junior Senator from New \nJersey, without that educational foundation and opportunity.\n  I am not alone. Millions of young people across this Nation have \ndreams of earning a college degree, of having access to that key that \nunlocks their own economic empowerment of fulfilling their God-given \npotential.\n  Some dream of building a successful career or going on to graduate \neducation or, as in my case, to be first in their family to graduate \nfrom college. The power of those dreams is why our students and their \nfamilies are making sacrifices to meet the high cost of college, why \nthey are scraping together what they can to finance education that will \nlet them fulfill their dreams.\n  That reality is becoming harder and harder in terms of achieving that \ngoal. Every year, nearly half of all college students, college-ready \nstudents, and families with incomes under $50,000 cannot go to a 4-year \ncollege, not because they do not have the ability, not because they did \nnot gain admission but because the cost is too much of a barrier.\n  Despite current aid, grants and money that students earn working, \nmany students face a growing gap between the aid they receive and the \ncost of college. As a matter of fact, lowest income students at a 4-\nyear college face almost a $6,000 gap in unmet needs.\n  I worked when I was going through college. I understand those \nchallenges. You are getting financial aid, you are working, and still \nyou have an unmet gap. That means debt. That means debt. The lowest \nincome students at 4-year colleges face roughly $5,800 in unmet needs \nafter a standard financial aid package, after their loans, and after \nthe amount their families contribute. The fact is that for the neediest \nstudents, current aid is simply not enough. The fact is students have \nbeen squeezed on two ends, one by declining Federal aid that has sent \nstudents the message they are on their own; and, two, by having to rely \nincreasingly on student loans, which in essence, is debt.\n\n  We are supposed to provide a needed boost to students but instead \nhave left them with deals that are not in their best interests. I am \nproud of this bill because it will put money where it is needed most, \nPell grants and other critical financial assistance that benefits our \nNation's students with the most need.\n  Instead of another empty promise to increase Pell grants--we have \nheard\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\nplenty of those--this bill will increase the maximum Pell grant to \n$5,100 next year, and beyond that, climbing to $5,400. There simply is \nno excuse for the fact that Pell grants have not increased by even $1 \nover the last 5 years.\n  Tell any family that is trying to have their child fulfill their \ndream. We have seen tuition rates go up. We are seeing costs again go \nup. But we have seen the Pell rate stagnant. That means, in terms of \nbuying power, that has even meant far less.\n  With this bill, we are ending the neglect of our Nation's neediest \nstudents. We also will expand who is automatically eligible for a Pell \ngrant. Currently, a student is eligible for Pell grants if their family \nmakes $20,000 per year. This bill increases the annual income limit to \n$30,000, so more students can be eligible to benefit from Pell grants.\n  That is the reality of having so many of our families be able to at \nleast get some assistance in this respect. This bill works to protect \nstudents working hard to stay in college by doubling the amount a \nstudent can earn but remain eligible for aid from $3,000 to $6,000. \nThis bill ensures a student will not lose their financial aid from \nsimply working to make extra money.\n  Let me tell you, when I went to college back in New Jersey at St. \nPeters College, for the first month I did not have the money to get to \nSt. Peters College, which was in a neighboring community from where I \nlived but a good several miles away.\n  For that first month, until I entered the work study program and \nstarted to earn money for transportation, I walked. Now, I was a lot \nleaner as a result of it, a lot thinner as a result of it. But the \nbottom line is that as a result of working, I was able to get the \ntransportation funds I needed.\n  But when we, in fact, say to a student: We want to reward work and we \nwant them also to have the sense that when they work there is a \nbenefit, not a punishment, in fact, that has worked to the contrary. So \nSenator Kennedy and the committee have done something that is \nexceptional. As someone who had to work in order to get to school, this \nactually incentivizes the opportunity to do so but does not penalize \nthem.\n  This bill also helps students who are struggling to pay back their \nFederal loans by capping the amount they will pay at 15 percent of \ntheir income. This helps ensure they are not paying back more than they \ncan afford. One of our challenges is that our students graduate under a \nmountain of debt. Then, as they try to fulfill their hopes and dreams, \nthey are squeezed even more in terms of the repayment process. This is \na critical step toward ensuring that loan repayments are affordable and \nnot overly burdensome for some recent graduates.\n  I also am extremely pleased this bill builds on a proposal I have \nsupported for a long time from my days in the House of Representatives, \nexpanding loan forgiveness for those who are working in jobs that serve \nthe public.\n  By providing some of the our most needed public servants, our \nteachers, police officers, early educators, social workers, school \nlibrarians the chance to have their loans forgiven after they have been \nworking hard to pay off those loans, we are sending a powerful message.\n  We have a whole new generation of teachers we are going to need in \nthis country. We have an explosion, a bubble that is about to burst of \nthose who are, in fact, going to be in the retirement age and will be \nretiring.\n  As I said earlier, in this global challenge, education is the key to \nbeing the continuing global leader in competitiveness; having the most \nhighly educated generation of Americans ever. That means having the \nfirm foundation to ultimately be able to achieve higher education. That \nmeans having a cadre of educators who are among the most highly skilled \nand educated professionals we have ever had.\n  This incentivizes people to head in that direction. We are sending a \npowerful message. We are saying: If you are willing to serve the \npublic, we will give back. If you make sacrifices in your daily job, we \nappreciate that sacrifice, and we want to lessen the financial burden. \nWe will help ensure that today's students do not shy away from a career \nin public service simply because they think they cannot afford it.\n  I am proud of the direction this legislation takes. This bill is \nsensible. It is reasonable. It is fair. It makes our priorities clear. \nInstead of subsidizing lenders, we should be putting every last dollar \npossible into the pockets of students.\n  In addition, we are providing $17 billion in new aid to students \nwithout charging taxpayers a dime. In this bill, we are actually also \nputting nearly $1 billion toward deficit reduction. As a member of the \nSenate Budget Committee, I am pleased to see this bill recognizes the \nresponsibilities we have, not just to our students but to future \ngenerations who do not deserve to be saddled with the Nation's rising \ndebt.\n  I look forward to, as a member of the Senate Banking Committee, \nworking with our chairman, Senator Dodd, to deal with these issues in \nthis bill. In my mind, this is integral to making higher education more \naccessible, more affordable for this next generation. It is a step \nforward to ensuring the student loan system works for students and \ntheir families; that is who it is supposed to work for, for students \nand their families.\n  It is a key to preserving the integrity of our Nation's higher \neducation system. It is a key to having a continuing ability to be the \nglobal economic leader. It is the key to fulfilling the American dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I use on \nthe bill.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey for his excellent \npresentation, particularly for his pointing out a number of features of \nthis legislation, one of which is that we increase the opportunity for \nyoung people who are going to school and college who are out there \nworking, we permit them to be able to earn some more without losing \ntheir need-based help and assistance in terms of education. That is an \nextremely important one.\n  As the Senator was pointing out, we are in a situation where a number \nof those individuals would go out and work and work hard and be able to \nget additional income and then risk their need-based assistance.\n  Secondly, the expansion for the eligibility for the Pell grants, \nwhich is enormously important. We have been attempting to do that for a \nnumber of years. That will open up the opportunity to more than 4 \nmillion children who are in Pell grant eligibility now. That is going \nto open up additional opportunity. This is incredibly important. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during today's session, \nwhen the Senate considers the amendment offered by Senator Murkowski \nand an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy, they be debated \nconcurrently for as much time as they might consume; that no amendments \nbe in order on either amendment prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment; that on Thursday, July 19, the Senate resume consideration \nof these amendments at 12 noon and there be 2 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote in relation to each amendment under this agreement; that the \nMurkowski amendment be the first vote in the sequence; that all debate \ntime prior to the votes be equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill on \nThursday, there be 10 hours of debate remaining, equally divided and \ncontrolled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, leadership has instructed me to say \nthere will be no further rollcall votes in light of the agreement.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2330 to Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Madam President, I call up my amendment that I believe is at the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2330 to amendment No. 2327.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the amounts appropriated for Promise Grants for \n                    fiscal years 2014 through 2017)\n\n       Strike subparagraph (G) of section 401B(e)(1) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965, as added by section 102(a) of the \n     Higher Education Access Act of 2007, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(G) $3,650,000,000 for fiscal year 2014;\n       ``(H) $3,850,000,000 for fiscal year 2015;\n       ``(I) $4,175,000,000 for fiscal year 2016; and\n       ``(J) $4,180,000,000 for fiscal year 2017.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have done a lot in this bill. We \nprovide $14 billion in additional grants to students, $3 billion in \ndebt relief, for a total of $17 billion in college aid to students. \nThis will open wider the doors of college for America's neediest \nfamilies and provide benefits for all students.\n  We have raised the maximum grant for Pell-eligible students to $5,100 \nnext year and $5,400 in 2011. But we need not stop there. We should \nallocate all available funds to continue adding to the need-based aid \nbeyond the increases we make in the next 5 years, and this amendment \nwill allow us to do that.\n  It allocates billions of additional dollars to extend the maximum \nneed-based grants between 2014 and 2017, continuing our promise to help \nmillions of needy students to pay for college. This is, I believe, a \nvery welcome reversal from the last 5 years, when the administration \nbasically broke its promise to increase the Pell grant year after year.\n  Now that policy has changed and shifted. We know what the stakes are \nwhen students are not able to afford college. Each year, over 400,000 \ntalented, qualified students do not attend a 4-year college. Twenty \nyears ago, the maximum Pell grant covered 55 percent of a 4-year \ncollege and today it only covers a third.\n  This amendment will continue what I consider the march of progress in \nterms of the outyears. We are addressing the first 5 years in the bill, \nbut obviously these programs will last beyond that. We have \ndemonstrated that this bill saves billions of dollars, and those \nresources will be devoted toward helping students, and that is \nenormously worthwhile.\n  Madam President, I yield time off the bill. The Senator from New \nJersey was talking about the importance of the Pell program and the \nstudent loan program and how important this is in terms of our \ncompetitiveness. It is worthwhile to point out that as I mentioned, \nspending under the GI bill, over a 6-year period, represented a third \nof the total Federal budget for 1951. That gives us some dimension of \nthe priority this country places on education. The GI Bill was \nresponsible, more than any other action, for helping create the great \nmiddle class of our country which has been such a pillar of strength \nfor our democracy, for our economic strength, and for our military \nstrength as well.\n  The GI bill, during that period of time, produced 67,000 doctors, \n91,000 scientists, 238,000 teachers, and 450,000 engineers. It also \nfunded the education of three Presidents, three Supreme Court Justices, \nand a dozen Senators who served in this very Chamber. Pretty good \ninvestment for this Nation, and it is the kind of investment we ought \nto continue for the young people of this country.\n  I wish to review one of the very important aspects of this \nlegislation. I again commend our colleagues. This was a bipartisan \neffort. I wish to indicate again one of the very compelling aspects of \nthis legislation is not only the historic increase in the need-based \ngrant aid, but it is the loan forgiveness for borrowers in public \nservice jobs.\n  I will give a few examples. What do we mean by loan forgiveness? We \nindicated the types of jobs that would be eligible for this program. I \nwill put that chart up in a minute. But certainly a public school \nteacher is a good example. This is the average salary for a starting \nteacher in my State--$35,000. The average loan debt is $18,000. This is \nabout the national average. Monthly payments today would be $209 and \nthe loan payment relief under this bill would be some $61 each month. \nThe yearly student loan payment relief under the new income-based \nrepayment plan, the annual relief they would receive would be $732. \nThat is not insignificant. If they remain a teacher for 10 years, they \nsave $10,000 of their $18,000 debt, effectively the remainder of their \ndebt is forgiven; $10,000 forgiven. Not insignificant.\n  Let me point out what jobs are included in this public service loan \nforgiveness program. Obviously, emergency management, public safety, \npublic law enforcement, public education, early childhood education, \nchildcare, public health and social work in public service agencies, \npublic services for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, \npublic interest legal services, public defenders, school librarians, \nschool-based service providers, teaching full time at a tribal college \nor university. All of those--and that is not exclusive, it is \ninclusive.\n  Let me show what this would be in another State. This is a social \nworker in North Carolina with one child with an annual salary of \n$37,000; loan debt, $16,000. They would save some $500 a year in what \nthey would be obligated to pay, and if they did this for 10 years, \n$7,300 would be forgiven. That gives us an idea of what happens with a \nteacher and what would happen with a social worker.\n  Let's look at how this bill will help a public school teacher in Iowa \nwhose annual salary is $27,000. They would save a yearly payment of \nsome $1,300. After 10 years, they would have $16,000 forgiven. This \ngives us a pretty good idea of what this program does. In this case, \nthat is almost half their total debt forgiven, and they have seen a \nreduction in both their monthly and annual payments. This makes a big \ndifference--a few hundred dollars here and a few hundred dollars \nthere--it makes an enormous difference.\n  Now this past year, tuition and fees increased just 4 percent at \nfour-year public colleges in Massachusetts--up just a couple hundred \ndollars. We have UMass Boston in our public university system, and \nabout 60 percent of the students there are first-generation \nindividuals. It is an extraordinary place and getting better and \nstronger. Needless to say, tuition has gone up a good deal there and at \ncolleges across the nation in recent years. This can be devastating to \nlow-income students, and especially to first-generation college \nstudents. In the UMass system, tuition and fees increased nearly 40 \npercent from 1996 to 2006. We know that a few hundred dollars makes a \nkey difference. It makes an extraordinary difference for these young \npeople, when they are making a judgment whether to go to school and \nwhether they are willing to take on the indebtedness. The idea that \nthey know when they get out of school they will be able to go into \nthese public service types of jobs and will be able to get relief is \nextraordinary.\n\n  One of the incredible phenomenons taking place at universities and \ncolleges today is volunteerism. The number who are volunteering at \nschools and colleges all over our country is enormously impressive. \nThis is incredibly encouraging.\n  There is a great willingness and desire to be a part of trying to \nmeet some of the Nation's challenges. So many of those opportunities \ninvolve some aspects of involvement in public employment. This \nlegislation gives young people a real opportunity, even if they come \nfrom homes with limited resources, that they can attend a fine college, \nand then they can go on to one of these public service jobs and make a \nreal difference in their community, in part because they get assistance \nin this legislation in terms of debt relief. That is what is included \nin this legislation.\n  There is a very significant expansion of the Pell grant, a very \nimportant innovative and I think creative concept in loan forgiveness \nfor those who are going to give something back to the country because \nof what the country has done for them. It provides important relief for \ntheir families in interest payments, the expansion, in terms of young \npeople who are working, to permit them to earn a little more without \nlosing their need-based assistance and the recognition that we ought to \nexpand that opportunity for families with children.\n  Thirty thousand dollars, that sounds like a lot, but we are looking \nat those individuals and families who are earning that amount. That is \na pretty hard-working family, needless to say, and they have children \nwho want to be a part of the whole American dream and contribute to \nthis country. They understand the importance of their continued \neducation.\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\n  This gives a pretty good idea about where we are on some of these \nprograms. It is important we understand these programs.\n  For those who are interested, we are still trying to work out a \nconsent agreement so we can consider the authorization as well. Senator \nEnzi and I have been communicating through the course of the day with \nour leadership and other members. We certainly hope that by tomorrow we \nhave some recommendations. Both of us understand the importance of \ndoing this. It has been mentioned over the course of the day the \nextraordinarily important ethical issues with the student loan \nindustry, as well as other significant provisions, included in that \nreauthorization legislation. The ethical issues is an important aspect \nof the bill, and we should address that aspect and our reauthorization \ndoes that.\n  The simplification of the application for federal aid is a key aspect \nin terms of accessibility to college. That is a key element.\n  There are some other provisions that have been added by members of \nthe committee that have been described. This is a very important \nreauthorization.\n  There is strong bipartisan support for the legislation. It is \nimportant we pass it. We urge our colleagues to work with us to see \nthat this is done at the earliest possible time.\n  My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, I know is on his way \nover here. We have had a good number of our colleagues who have spoken \non this legislation. Many on our committee have spoken. We are very \ngrateful to all of the members of the committee, as I mentioned \nearlier, for their involvement and assistance.\n  Senator Reed worked very closely with Senator Enzi on what we call EZ \nFAFSA, the application for student aid, and that is enormously \nimportant. He has spoken today. Many on our committee members have \ntalked about this legislation, and we are grateful for all of their \nefforts.\n  We have solid legislation. We are not looking for additional \namendments. But if that is the desire of our Members, we hope they will \ncommunicate that to us as quickly as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I again thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for his diligent work on this bill and for \nhis outstanding explanation of what is in the bill and ways it can \npositively affect kids across the Nation.\n  Our goal with this bill and the Higher Education Act that we hope to \nhave follow immediately is to make sure there is affordable access for \neverybody who wants to go to college. Even affordable access for those \nwho have other educational goals following high school, who have some \nother occupations they want to pursue that requires specialized \nschools, this bill will help in all of those aspects.\n  For those who may think some of these goals are unachievable, I wish \nto share briefly an experience I had last weekend because I was \nfortunate to have an opportunity to be a part of the Western Governors \nUniversity commencement. It was a very memorable day and brought back \nmemories of my own graduation and other graduation ceremonies I have \nbeen a part of over the years. This one will stick in my mind for a \nlong time to come because what makes the Western Governors University \nsuch a unique institution of higher learning can be reflected in the \neyes of those who were graduated.\n  The Western Governors University is a school without boundaries. It \nis a nonprofit school. It was founded and supported by 19 State \ngovernments. This is the only time the Governors of several States have \njoined together to create a university.\n  It is also supported by more than 20 leading U.S. corporations and \nfoundations. This may be important. It is self-sufficient. Of course, \nit is only self-sufficient because of some of the provisions we are \nproviding so kids have the opportunity to attend. I keep referring to \n``kids.'' But with this one, I should not be referring to ``kids'' \nbecause the average age of their students is 38.\n  I mention this to encourage everybody that if they want some other \njob opportunities, there are possibilities. This is one of the \npossibilities for a person to get some additional education and be \ncovered by what we have in this bill.\n  Western Governors University offers a competency-based, regionally \naccredited college program that is open to just about everybody. That \nmeans a student who proves his or her knowledge in a certain subject \narea does not have to put in seat time to relearn something they \nalready know. Their knowledge of a subject is measured through a series \nof assessments when they start, and that allows the university to \nindividualize each course and tailor each degree to meet the needs of \nthat particular student.\n  The courses are all online. There are no classrooms. It can be taken \nat the student's own convenience and speed. That is why I am mentioning \nthis university. Everybody does not have access, particularly in the \nrural areas of this country, to a university. But online, they have \naccess to this and other institutions.\n  Tuition is $5,600 a year, and Federal education aid and private \nscholarships are available. There are 20 corporations that provide \nquite a few scholarships in addition to that Federal education aid. \nThat makes a degree from Western Governors University one of the most \nreasonable college educations you can get, especially when you studying \nwhile holding down a job. In that situation, your room and board is \nprobably your home.\n  When a student is accepted by the university, they are assigned an \ninstructor, a mentor, a counselor who will work with them and help them \nmake their way through the studies. That individual stays with them the \nwhole time they are in the university and keeps in touch for a year \nbeyond their graduation to help with placement and problems they may \nexperience.\n  The course is designed so that those who have other obligations in \ntheir life--children, a job or other responsibilities that make a \ntraditional education impossible--can still get their undergraduate or \nmaster's degree while keeping true to their day-to-day obligations and \nresponsibilities. A lot of people have to hold down a job in order to \nfeed their family, yet would like to be able to improve their \nsituation. This college makes that possible.\n  When their studies are completed, their tests have been taken and the \ndegrees have been earned, the whole university comes together to honor \nthe graduating class. That is the ceremony I was a part of and a day I \nwill not forget. The university student body is quite diverse. The \ncampus stretches through all 50 States on the Internet. In addition, \nthe fact that the university serves Active-Duty military personnel \noverseas stretches this university without boundaries all around the \nworld.\n  The students I visited with on graduation day came from cities, \nsuburbs, and rural areas. The average age is 40, but they range from \nthe twenties to the sixties. The university makes it clear that you are \nnever too old to pursue a degree or return to college to get additional \neducation to get a better job or begin a new career.\n  In November 2000, Western Governors University graduated its first \nstudent. It is a new university. Since then, the university has grown \nand attracted more and more students to its programs. Now, a few years \nafter the first graduate earned a degree, WGU graduates more than 400 \nstudents each year in a growing number of degree programs.\n  The school keeps in touch with its graduates to check on how the \ndegrees they have earned have helped to improve their lives. They also \nhave a very active alumni association that helps former students to \ncontinue to achieve and set new goals in their careers and pick up \nadditional courses.\n  At each graduation ceremony I have attended, I have always found that \nwhat makes each school unique is its student body. Western Governors \nUniversity was no exception to the rule. I was greatly interested in \nthe remarks that were offered by four students who spoke at the \ngraduation representing their class.\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\n  I mention these again to emphasize there is a way in the United \nStates to get higher education no matter what your circumstances.\n  One of them wanted to be a teacher. It was a dream the university \nmade possible because their flexibility made her course schedule fit \ninto her life schedule. She already had a son and a job, and she spoke \nabout her work with the teaching program. She had to do student \nteaching, just like everybody does, and one day she told one of the \nstudents in her class how smart he was. He beamed and said, ``You know, \nI wasn't smart until you came.'' That is what sold her on a teaching \ncareer. She could see in his eyes he had come to believe in himself \nbecause someone else believed in him. She spoke of the importance of \nusing your gifts and talents to encourage others to be the best they \ncan be.\n  When it comes down to it, that is the sum of what an education is all \nabout, learning to reach out to others so we use all our gifts and \ntalents to make this a better world. Under this bill, there is the \ncapability, if you are dedicating yourself in these areas, to take \nadvantage of some special benefits that are available.\n  Another graduate spoke with pride at how hard he worked to earn his \ndegree and how every moment had been worth it. He too had a family. He \nmentioned the logic of an online university having a football team and \nsuggested that would truly be fantasy football. For him, one of the \nmost important parts of the experience had been the mentors who worked \nwith him, supported him, and shared his joy when he earned his degree. \nHe was certain his degree would open doors for him and change his life. \nHe was looking forward to getting involved in the alumni program so \neveryone in his class, and others, could keep in touch and follow each \nother's successes.\n  At traditional universities, that is an even more important part of \ncollege life, keeping in touch and following each other's successes.\n  Another speaker told of the difficulties we all face, and said, \n``Don't ever tell me you don't have time in your life or that it is too \ntough.'' Her philosophy reminded me of a favorite motto of my own \nfamily--TGAPA which stands for Trust in God and Push Ahead because that \nis exactly what she has done. Despite the problems she has had to face, \nwhich was the loss of two of her children and a husband who was facing \nseveral health problems, she forged ahead, worked at her own pace, and \nearned her degree.\n  Another speaker who had a message to share was Ngozika Ughanze from \nTexas--originally from Nigeria--who was one of 10 children. Her father \nwas very concerned about his children and the importance of their \nschooling so he sent all 10 to school to learn English. It started her \non the road to higher education that she has continued to follow all \nher life. In her words, ``The more I learn, the more I want to learn.'' \nShe left Nigeria with her husband in 1997 because they wanted to get \ntheir own piece of the cake. She said, ``I believe if you work hard, \nthen you are able to live here.''\n  The problem for her, as it was and is for so many, was finding the \ntime to get it done. The only way she could make any progress was to \ncut things out of her schedule. That meant giving up some of her \nfavorite things, such as television and shopping. It wasn't going to be \neasy to pursue a college education because of her obligations to her \nfamily--she has seven children--but she made it happen. She made it \nhappen despite having to relocate four times because of Hurricane \nKatrina. She made it happen despite missing some deadlines, which meant \nshe had to work harder to catch up, again because of Hurricane Katrina \nand Hurricane Rita, which also got involved in it. She made it happen \nbecause she refused to accept any other outcome.\n  She used her family time to study with her children. She enjoyed \ngetting them involved almost as much as her children loved being a part \nof their mommy's project. As she received her degree, three of her own \nchildren are attending college and one day will receive their own \ndegrees.\n  There were nearly 90 graduates in the hall, representing 29 States, \nbut the ones watching online and getting their diploma online represent \n42 States and 2 countries and ranged from 22 to 63 in age. A remarkable \ngroup of men and women. Although I have only noted the dreams of a few, \neach of them had their own story to tell about their degree, how they \nearned it, what they planned to do with it, and how they hoped to use \nwhat they learned to make the world a better place.\n  I was very pleased to be a part of that ceremony that honored such a \nspirited group for having laid the groundwork for a great life. They \nare all to be congratulated for earning their degrees and for making \nanother of their life's dreams come true. That is what we want for the \npeople of the United States, regardless of age. It doesn't matter \nwhether you are 22 or 18 or 63 or 94. I got to see a diploma given to a \nman this spring who was 94 and who was pleased to finally get his \ndegree. That is possible in America, and this bill helps to make that \ndream a reality in conjunction with the hard work of the students.\n  It isn't easy, and it is even more difficult if you are in situations \nwhere you have a family, you have a job, and you have to maintain those \nto maintain your family. So we are doing what is possible to make that \nburden as easy as possible, and we hope we will have a lot of support. \nWe would encourage people who have amendments to get those down here so \nwe can complete this in a timely manner so we can do the other 80 \npercent of higher education that also needs to be done and that we have \nbeen hoping to get done since last year.\n\n  So our work is cut out for us, but from these examples, you can see \nthe people out there are worth working for. We owe it to them. We have \nthe chance to do this, so let us do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9463-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Madam President, I rise today to honor Tad Dunbar, a \nNorthern Nevada institution. Tad has been a part of the newscast for \nKOLO-TV for over 35 years, and has been involved in broadcasting for \nover 48 years.\n  At the age of 15, Tad began his media career as a disc jockey for a \nradio station in Palestine, TX. He has been a broadcaster ever since, \nhoning his journalistic skills even as a high school and college \nstudent. His work attracted attention from broadcasters in Abilene, TX, \nwhere he landed his first job. Before he came to Nevada, he worked as a \nnewscaster in Midland, Laredo, and Corpus Christi.\n  In September of 1969, Tad moved to Reno and became an anchorman for \nNews Channel 8. For almost four decades, he has been a fixture on \ntelevisions throughout northern Nevada. Tad is a man of numerous \ntalents, and has tackled the roles of assignment editor, photographer, \nfilm editor, writer, and producer. During his time at Channel 8, Tad \nhas covered stories that captured the hearts and minds of all Nevadans, \nincluding the Kennedy assassination and the Priscilla Ford trial.\n  He recounts one of the most memorable moments of his tenure as when \nthe News Channel 8 studio ignited in flame a few years ago in the \nmiddle of his newscast. When asked about it later, KOLO station manager \nMatt James joked that ``that was probably one of the few newscasts \n[Tad] didn't get to finish.''\n  In addition to his daily duties as an anchorman, Tad has deeply \ninvolved himself in philanthropy throughout the years. He serves on \nadvisory boards for several nonprofit organizations, and has played an \nintegral role in ``Sheep-dip,'' an organization that raises money for \nscholarships at the University of Nevada. In addition, Tad is a devoted \nfamily man. He is married to his wonderful wife Minda, with whom he \nloves to cook and enjoy fine wine.\n  Tad is leaving KOLO-TV at the end of July. His unique journalistic \nstyle and his affable personality will be greatly missed. I know I join \nwith the entire northern Nevada community in wishing Tad the best on \nwell-earned retirement.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9464-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9464-S9465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN B. GAINES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of a \ndistinguished Kentuckian, Mr. John B. Gaines, president of the Bowling \nGreen Daily News. He passed away last week at the age of 92.\n  John came by his passion for reporting news and connecting with the \ncommunity quite honestly. He was born and raised in a newspaper family \nhis grandfather founded the Daily News, and his father ran the \nnewspaper until his passing in 1947 and for half a century, John served \nas the paper's publisher. When in Bowling Green, I always appreciated \nthe opportunity to sit down for a conversation with John.\n  I will miss John and wish to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the \nentire Gaines family--John Pipes Gaines and his wife Susan Leonard \nGaines, Mollie Gaines Smith and her husband, S. Russell Smith, Jr., \nMary Gaines Dunham and her husband, David Lee Dunham; and grandsons, \nJohn Scott Gaines, Stephen Wilson Gaines, S. Russell Smith III and John \nBrooken Smith and his wife, Katie. While the Bowling Green community \nhas lost a prominent voice, John's legacy will continue. The newspaper \nis in good hands under the leadership of his son, Pipes, and his \ngrandsons working there.\n  The paper he so loved and dedicated his life to paid tribute to him \non Sunday with an article titled ``Daily News president dies at 92.'' I \nask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record, \nand that the entire Senate join me in honoring the life of this beloved \nKentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, July 15, 2007]\n\n                    Daily News President Dies at 92\n\n                         (By Alicia Carmichael)\n\n       Daily News president and avid fisherman John B. Gaines \n     always told his childhood friend John Clagett ``he was going \n     to live until he got pulled under by a big fish at the age of \n     90,'' Clagett said Saturday.\n       On Friday at The Medical Center, 92-year-old Gaines died \n     quietly, surrounded by family, after a short illness.\n       ``The big fish got him,'' Clagett said sadly Saturday from \n     his home in Middleberry, VT.\n       Still, according to many of those who knew him well, Gaines \n     lived life to the fullest until his last days.\n       ``He had much difficulty getting around, walking, but he \n     came to church most every Sunday'' at Christ Episcopal \n     Church, said John Grider, who through the years did \n     bookkeeping, accounting and tax work for Gaines and served \n     with Gaines on the board of directors at Citizens National \n     Bank.\n       Ewing Hines, who worked for Gaines for 40 years as a Daily \n     News accountant, said Gaines was still talking about fishing \n     on Friday.\n       ``I called down at the hospital,'' Hines said. ``(His son) \n     Pipes took the phone, and I heard him say in the background, \n     'Tell him it's a good day to flyfish.' And I thought he was \n     getting better.''\n       Now Hines can't believe his ``best friend'' is gone.\n       ``This hurts me about as much as anything that has \n     happened,'' he said. ``He always had time to talk to me. He \n     was a great person.''\n       Michael G. Catlett, who was Gaines' financial consultant \n     and friend, said Gaines ``was a man who showed you personal \n     attention. He acted like he really cared for you when he was \n     talking to you.''\n       Gaines and Catlett often took walks through Bowling Green, \n     before walking became difficult for Gaines.\n       ``I used to tell him, `I enjoy our walks downtown because \n     it elevates my status in the community,' `` Catlett said. \n     ``He laughed about that.''\n       With Gaines' passing, Catlett said, Bowling Green has lost \n     a ``treasure . . . a great man of integrity, manners and \n     respect.''\n       Don Stringer, the former longtime managing editor at the \n     Daily News, also talked about Gaines' integrity.\n       ``He always stood behind us'' in the newsroom, Stringer \n     said, ``and he had no compunction, when we were right, about \n     saying, `That's what we're going to do.'''\n       With ``a wonderful dry sense of humor,'' Stringer said, \n     Gaines took the newspaper business's ups and downs in stride.\n       Daily News general manager Mark Van Patten said many often \n     overlooked Gaines' vivid wit because of his usually serious \n     demeanor.\n       But that demeanor came from his love for the newspaper, \n     which was started by his grandfather, also named John Gaines, \n     in 1882. The younger John Gaines, a graduate of the \n     University of Alabama, took over the running the Daily News \n     after his dad, Clarence M. Gaines, died in 1947. For half a \n     century, he was the paper's publisher.\n       ``He really loved the newspaper and loved this community,'' \n     Van Patten said, ``and that was always foremost in decisions \n     he made.'' Van Patten added he has ``never worked for a \n     publisher that had stronger ethics than Mr. Gaines,'' who \n     ``just loved newspaper and journalism and the business of \n     newspapers in general.''\n       Less than two weeks before he died, Gaines was in his Daily \n     News office, as he was nearly every work day when he wasn't \n     ill--or, in his later years, spending 6 weeks each winter in \n     Florida.\n       ``I could not believe it,'' Grider said of Gaines' devotion \n     to his work at a time of life when most have been retired for \n     decades.\n       Gaines' mind was kept sharp because of his work, Grider \n     thinks.\n       ``We had a lot of nice discussions,'' Grider said, ``and \n     for his age, his mental capacity was remarkable.''\n       Gregg K. Jones, who is co-publisher of The Greeneville Sun \n     in Tennessee, president of Jones Media Inc., past chairman of \n     the Newspaper Association of America--the largest newspaper \n     trade association in the United States--and a former \n     president of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association, \n     said Gaines was planning, as recently as two weeks ago, to \n     attend this year's SNPA meeting in West Virginia.\n       For two terms, Gaines was director of the association. He \n     also served as president of the Kentucky Press Association, \n     as his grandfather had once done, in 1962, and was the 1980 \n     recipient of the Edwards M. Templin Memorial Award, which was \n     presented by the Lexington Herald-Leader to the Kentucky \n     newspaper person who performed the most outstanding community \n     service.\n       ``He was revered in the Southern Newspaper Publishers \n     Association,'' Jones said, ``and people were always excited \n     to see him there, not only to hear what he had to say, but so \n     they could learn from him.''\n       Jones, whose family has owned The Greeneville Sun for \n     generations, said Gaines was as passionate about his family's \n     ownership of the Daily News as he was about the newspaper \n     industry in general.\n       ``He didn't like the idea of newspapers being owned by \n     impersonal public companies,'' Jones said. ``He cared so much \n     about his community. He made that very clear, and that's \n     something our families shared. We've always placed a very \n     high value on the bond between a newspaper and the community \n     it serves.''\n       Gaines especially loved helping small business people grow \n     their businesses, Jones said.\n       ``He considered his relationships with his advertisers and \n     readers to be partnerships,'' Jones said. ``So many people in \n     Bowling Green have built their businesses through (the) \n     newspaper in Bowling Green. He loved that and seeing people \n     succeed, and seeing Bowling Green progress.''\n       ``At the same time, John was a fiercely independent guy,'' \n     Jones said--a newsman who at one time was a member of the \n     Calendar Club literary group in Bowling Green, a former \n     member of the Bowling Green Noon Rotary Club, a member of the \n     Society of Professional Journalists and a charter member of \n     the Bowling Green-Warren County Jaycees.\n       Gaines was also chairman of the boards of News Publishing \n     LLC, which operates the Daily News, and the Daily News \n     Broadcasting Company, which operates WKCT-AM and WDNS-FM \n     radio stations in Bowling Green.\n       In his free time, Gaines loved fishing, dove hunting, \n     traveling both domestically and abroad, and good food, said \n     his grandson, Steve Gaines, who is editorial page editor at \n     the Daily News.\n       ``My fondest memories of my grandfather will always be \n     spending countless hours fishing next to him on the creek \n     beds or countless hours in the dove field, either shooting \n     doves or talking about Alabama football,'' Steve Gaines said.\n       John Gaines was also was loyal to his church, where he had \n     served on the vestry and was a trustee of the Delafield \n     Committee.\n       The Rev. Howard Surface, who was Gaines' pastor at Christ \n     Episcopal Church for four decades, said that for years, \n     Gaines came to the church several days a week.\n       ``For many, many years my office was in the front part of \n     the church on State Street,'' Surface said, ``and every day \n     around noon I would see John. He made a habit of walking up \n     State Street and he would stop at the church's prayer \n     chapel.''\n       Gaines' also was devoted to his family, Steve Gaines said.\n       ``My grandfather said many times the best thing he ever did \n     in life was marry Mabel Sharp Gaines, and he was right.''\n       Gaines and his wife raised three children: Pipes Gaines, \n     who is now publisher of the Daily News, Mary Gaines Dunham, \n     who is retired from her job as national advertising director \n     at the newspaper, and Mollie Gaines Smith, now of Louisville.\n       The couple also had several grandchildren, including Scott \n     Gaines, who is Steve Gaines' brother and works in the \n     business side of the Daily News.\n       Steve Gaines said he now takes solace in the fact that his \n     grandfather was surrounded by family when he died. He's also \n     comforted by the fact that his granddad knew the Daily News \n     would stay in the Gaines family after his death.\n       ``He wouldn't have wanted it any other way,'' he said.\n       Stringer said he now thinks one of Gaines' greatest \n     legacies has been passing down his sense of integrity to his \n     children, and gave Gaines what he considers ``the highest \n     compliment you can give'' in the newspaper business.\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\n       ``He was a hell of a good newspaper man,'' Stringer said, \n     ``and I think the community is going to miss him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9465-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS OF S. 1762\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 4, 2007, in Pearland, TX, Terry Mark Mangum brutally murdered \nKenneth Cummings, Jr., for being gay. Mangum says the two had drinks at \na Montrose-area club before returning to Cummings' home in Pearland. \nMangum confessed to having stabbed Cummings to death with a six-inch \nknife at Cummings' residence that night. He then burned the body and \nburied it at a 50-acre ranch owned by his grandfather. Mangum says he \nbelieved that Cummings was gay and allegedly had planned the killing \nfor 6 months prior to the murder.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9465-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MYRON PIERCE OF SOUTH PARIS, MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I pay tribute to Myron \nPierce of South Paris, ME, as he is honored by Joshua L. Chamberlain \nCamp No. 69--Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the American Legion and the Western Maine Veterans \nAdvisory Council. Through the years, Myron Pierce has demonstrated a \nselfless and stalwart commitment to his family, his community, and his \ncountry. Born in Bethel, ME, the oldest of eight children, Myron began \nhis military career at the age of 19, serving in the Army National \nGuard and was activated to full-time duty the following year stationed \nat Camp Blanding, FL. By 1942, he was a machine gunner with the 12th \nBomb Group and led night patrols that uncovered the presence of German \ntroops, earning him a Silver Star. From 1941 to 1945, he fought with \nthe 103rd Infantry of the 43rd Division, also known as Winged Victory, \nand was wounded in combat in North Africa. During the Korean War he \nrejoined the Maine Army National Guard. While in that theater, he led \n27 consecutive night combat patrols in Iron Triangle near Pork Chop \nHill, where a Chinese unit ambushed the 2nd Infantry Division and he \nendured grenade shrapnel. He and two others were the only survivors of \nthat fateful night. Through the remarkable span of his distinguished \n30-year military career, Myron received countless military medals and \nrose through the ranks from private to company commander, then to \noperation officer, and finally battalion commander. He also served as \nassistant commandant for the Army Reserve Officer School--all \ncommendable distinctions.\n  Upon retiring from the military, for the next 26 years, Myron focused \nhis dedication in the classroom as an educator. Never wavering on his \nsense of duty, he continued his service to his country by reaching out \nto students on matters of patriotism, flag etiquette, and the Voice of \nDemocracy. As a teacher at the Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School, \nhe spearheaded a local chapter of the Distributive Education Club of \nAmerican, DECA, a cooperative program working with local area \nbusinesses and high school students teaching them business and \nmarketing skills as well as how to be a contributing and productive \nmember of the community. Myron worked in conjunction with the State of \nMaine to construct a Veterans Home for the Oxford Hills area veterans. \nAs a tireless advocate on behalf of veterans, in July of 1995, he was \nsuccessful in his mission to bring the Western Maine Veterans Home to \nSouth Paris. Again, ever-vigilant in his contributions to his fellow \nveterans, he was appointed by Maine Gov. John R. McKernan to the board \nof trustees for Maine Veterans Homes and was reappointed to serve a \nsecond term by Gov. Angus King. A testament to his motto, ``We are here \nto service the community,'' in 2004, Myron Pierce was presented with \nthe well-deserved Oxford Hills Chamber of Commerce Community Service \nAward. I want to offer my heartfelt best wishes and deepest \nappreciation to Myron Pierce for his extraordinary service and \nsacrifice to his community and to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9465-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORIAM: CHARLES LANE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to honor a great \nCalifornian, Charles Lane, who passed away on July 9, 2007, at the age \nof 102.\n  Charles Lane was an American actor seen in hundreds of films and \ntelevision shows. At the time of his death, Mr. Lane was the oldest \nliving American actor. He appeared in many of Frank Capra's films, \nincluding ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' ``Arsenic and Old Lace,'' \nand ``It's a Wonderful Life.''\n  Lane was born Charles Gerstle Levison in San Francisco, CA, to Alice \nand Jacob Levison on January 26, 1905. In 1932, Lane married Ruth \nCovell, and they remained together for 70 years, until her death in \n2002. Until his recent passing, Charles Lane lived in the Brentwood, \nCA, home that he and Ruth bought in 1964.\n  Charles Lane began his acting career in 1929 at the suggestion of \nactor/director Irving Pichel, and in 1933 Lane became a founding member \nof the Screen Actors Guild. His final acting role was at the age of 101 \nin 2006's ``The Night Before Christmas.'' His last television \nappearance was at the age of 90 when he appeared in the 1995 Disney TV \nremake of its 1970 teen comedy ``The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes.''\n  Lane appeared in more than 250 films and hundreds of television \nprograms. On his busiest days, Lane sometimes played more than one \ncharacter, changing costumes and filming his two or three lines, then \ndashing off to another set for a different costume and a different \nrole. While Lane often portrayed stern and hard-hearted characters, his \nfriends and fellow actors remembered Lane as warm, funny, and kind.\n  Lane was not only found on the screen; he was found of the stage. In \n1928, he joined the company at the Pasadena Playhouse, which was known \nfor training actors for the movies, appearing in more than 100 \nproductions over three decades. He made his film debut as a hotel desk \nclerk in ``Smart Money'' in 1931 with Edward G. Robinson and James \nCagney.\n  In 2005, the TV Land Awards paid tribute to Lane by celebrating his \n100th birthday. After he was serenaded ``Happy Birthday'' by the \naudience and was presented his award, Lane remarked to the audience, \n``If you're interested, I'm still available.'' He was given a standing \novation.\n  Our Nation lost an amazing actor with the passing of Charles Lane, \nbut his legacy to film and television will be remembered as we continue \nto enjoy the many films and programs he made during his long \ncareer.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9466-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n                 RETIREMENT OF COLONEL PAUL JAMES SYKES\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing COL Paul James Sykes on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom the U.S. Air Force Reserve, USAFR. Since entering the Air Force in \n1975 with the 315th Military Airlift Wing, Charleston, SC, Colonel \nSykes has remained a dedicated reservist for his entire career.\n  After being commissioned through the USAFR Officers Training Program \nat the Citadel in 1974, Second Lieutenant Sykes began his military \ncareer flying the C-141A Starlifter. Over his 16 years of flying the C-\n141, Colonel Sykes held numerous squadron-level positions while \nsupporting an array of humanitarian efforts and military operations \nworldwide.\n  In 1993, Major Sykes was selected to make the historic delivery of \nthe first Globemaster III into Charleston AFB, SC, while accompanying \nthe Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Additionally, Major Sykes played \nan integral role as a member of the initial Crew Operations Review Team \nwhich was responsible for significant technological and operational \nupgrades to the C-17.\n  As a distinguished reservist, Major Sykes was selected as the Deputy \nCommander of the 315th Operations Group after previously being named \nSquadron Operations Officer for the 300 Airlift Squadron only months \nbefore. In 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Sykes was critical in ensuring that \nover 1,500 Reserve personnel were adequately prepared for their call to \nduty after the attacks of September 11th.\n  Two years later, Colonel Sykes deployed to Rhein Main AB, Germany, \nwhere he was responsible for the daily launching of over 35 flight \nmissions to move the more than 3,000 military personnel who were to \nsupport Operations Iraqi/Enduring Freedom. After returning from \noverseas in 2004, Colonel Sykes was selected as the Commander of the \n916th Air Refueling Wing at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC. As the Air Force \nReserve Command's only wing in North Carolina, Colonel Sykes was \ncharged to command over 950 reservists in support of the Air Force's \nglobal refueling mission.\n  During his tenure as Commander, the 916th Air Refueling Wing received \nnumerous awards and scored in the top 3 percent of AFRC units in the \nUnit Compliance Inspection. Furthermore, the Wing was awarded the \nprestigious Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its exceptional \nefforts and volunteer service.\n  A devoted patriot, Colonel Sykes formally retires on July 27, 2007, \nas a Command pilot with over 9,100 military flying hours. As a \ndecorated leader, his commitment to our country will be forever marked \nby his extraordinary vision and endless sacrifice. Throughout his \nentire career and to this day, Colonel Sykes has served as a model \nairman. Along with his wife Patricia, who has stood next to Colonel \nSykes with unwavering loyalty and shared sacrifice but comforted by the \nhumbling gift of serving one's country, I thank him for his service and \nwish him the very best in his retirement. I ask that the Senate join me \nin honoring him for his lifelong career of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9466-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING ``CATONSVILLE GOES COASTAL''\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to honor the \nexemplary service of a group of my constituents from Catonsville, MD, \nwho have recently returned from their week-long volunteer trip to Kiln, \nMS.\n  Led by high school seniors Justin Holmes and Sarah Dobson, \n``Catonsville Goes Coastal'' coordinated six work teams to rebuild \nhomes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Working with the local \nCamp Coastal Outpost, the group's 59 students and 14 adults worked on \neight works sites in Hancock County, where 80 percent of the structures \nwere destroyed by the storm. Through student-organized fundraisers and \ndonations from the local community, the volunteers raised over $55,000 \nthroughout the year to fund their trip and to buy $12,000 worth of \ndonations for Camp Coastal and for the families with whom they worked.\n  ``Catonsville Goes Coastal's'' efforts embody the global awareness, \ncommunity spirit, and civic responsibility that we as Americans should \nall strive to achieve. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing ``Catonsville Goes Coastal'' for their generosity and \ndedication to their fellow Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9466-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE PASSING OF WALTER NEVADA\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, on April 17, Walter Nevada, the \noldest living Shoshone-Bannock tribal elder and remaining original \nallottee on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation passed away. He was 101 \nyears old. Walter was a distinguished member of one of the oldest \ntribes in Idaho. He was a religious man of wisdom respected by his \npeople, a great teacher and leader.\n  The government of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes has existed for many \ngenerations. Traditional tribal government was based upon small bands \nof closely related families. Today the tribes are organized as a \nsovereign government, providing many services to tribal members and \nnon-Indians with revenues from agriculture, business enterprises, \ntourism and many other operations.\n  Even though thousands of years have passed, the Shoshone and Bannock \nTribes continue to leave an indelible mark on the ongoing history of \nNorth America and Idaho. One example is the recent successful endeavor \nof the Shoshone Bannocks to certify a tribal member as a Federal \ninspector of underground fuel storage tanks. This is the first time \nthat this collaboration between a tribe and the Environmental \nProtection Agency has occurred, and demonstrates the Shoshone Bannock \nTribes' commitment to working with the U.S. Government on the critical \nissue of ground water protection. Also, working in coordination with \nState and Federal agencies, the Shoshone Bannocks have an active air \nquality monitoring program. The tribe continues to successfully \npreserve its history and way of life, while recognizing and promoting \nits critical role in stewardship of the environment. I have been \npleased to work with them in the past, and look forward to doing so in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9466-4", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING GARY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

DR. OTIS MOSS, JR.\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I wish to honor and \ncongratulate my friend and long-time civil rights activist, the \nReverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr. The church which he currently pastors \nrecently celebrated 75 years of service to the Cleveland community. In \nJuly 2007, Reverend Moss will celebrate 32 years of pastoral service to \nthe Olivet congregation.\n  Reverend Moss pastors the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in the \nFairfax neighborhood of my hometown of Cleveland, OH. Since 1931, \nOlivet has been more than a place of worship and Christian fellowship \nin the African-American community. It has been dedicated to preaching, \nteaching, and practicing the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. And as \na centerpiece of the community, it has nurtured leaders who have \nchampioned civil rights and equality for the poor, and it has worked to \nincrease awareness about poverty, health care, employment, education, \nand human rights.\n  A native of Georgia, Otis Moss, Jr., was born on February 26, 1935, \nto Otis and Magnolia Moss. He earned his bachelor's degree from \nMorehouse College in 1956 and his master of divinity degree from the \nMorehouse School of Religion/Inter-denominational Theological Center in \n1959. He also completed special studies at the Inter-denominational \nTheological Center from 1960 to 1961 and earned his doctorate in \nministry from the United Theological Seminary in 1990.\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\n  Reverend Moss's tenure as pastor began in 1954 in LaGrange, GA at \nMount Olive Baptist Church. While leading Mount Olive, Moss also served \nas pastor of Atlanta's Providence Baptist Church from 1956 to 1959. He \nthen headed to Ohio, where he was the pastor for Mount Zion Baptist \nChurch in Lockland. In 1971, Reverend Moss served as copastor with the \nReverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in \nAtlanta. Olivet Institutional Baptist Church extended the invitation to \nReverend Moss to be their pastor in December 1974. He was installed as \npastor in 1975.\n  Reverend Moss has been involved in advocating civil and human rights \nand social justice issues for most of his adult life. Having been a \nstaff member for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he formerly served as a \nnational board member and trustee for the Martin Luther King, Jr. \nCenter for Non-Violent Social Change. His work in the international \ncommunity has taken him around the world to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, \nand Israel.\n  Moss is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Role Model of \nthe Year Award from the National Institute for Responsible Fatherhood \nand Family Development in 1992, the Leadership Award from the Cleveland \nchapter of the American Jewish Committee in 1996, and, most recently, \nhe was inducted into the 2007 Class of the International Civil Rights \nWalk of Fame located at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic \nSite in Atlanta. He also holds six honorary degrees from colleges and \nuniversities in Ohio, Georgia, and Arkansas.\n  His political and civic engagement runs deep. Moss has served as \nchairman of the board of trustees at Morehouse College and as a member \nof the board of trustees at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, \nOH. He was an advisor to former President Jimmy Carter at Camp David \nand was the special guest of President Bill Clinton at a peace treaty \nsigning between Israel and Jordan in 1994. Former Ohio Governor Richard \nCeleste awarded Moss the 1983 Governor's Award in Civil Rights, and I \nhad the honor of presenting Reverend Moss with the 1993 Governor's \nAward in Civil Rights.\n  His service to Ohio and the Nation has also been recognized by the \nOhio House of Representatives, Ebony Magazine, Cleveland Press, the \nBlack Professional Association of Cleveland, the American Red Cross of \nGreater Cleveland, Project Love: Remember the Children Foundation, The \nCleveland Jewish Committee, and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. He is \na life member of the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored Peoples, NAACP, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and Sigma Pi \nPhi, Boule, to name a few.\n  University Hospitals Health System honored Reverend Moss with a \nspecial medical center partnership bearing his name. In 1997, the Otis \nMoss Jr.-University Hospitals Medical Center was established in \nconjunction with the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church. The center \noffers a wide range of primary and specialty care medical services and \nfeatures an on-site laboratory.\n  Reverend Moss and I share a passion for helping our children reach \ntheir full potential and lead our Nation and world into the next \ncentury and beyond. In 2003, I had the privilege of touring and \nvisiting with Moss and his staff at the Medical Center to see how a \nprogram called ``Reach Out and Read'' is administered.\n  Reverend Moss enjoyed an abiding friendship with the late Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. In fact, Dr. King visited the pulpit of Olivet \nInstitutional Baptist Church on several occasions and performed the \nwedding ceremony for Reverend and Mrs. Moss.\n  Perhaps the greatest connection I share with Reverend Moss is the \nlove and appreciation we both have for our wives. Reverend Moss is \nmarried to the former Edwina Hudson Smith, who is accomplished in her \nown right and is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions. She \nis recognized for her outstanding commitment to service as a member of \nthe National Board of the American Red Cross. Their love is a model for \nus all. Sadly, Reverend Moss and I also share in the loss of a young \nchild.\n  As someone who has had the pleasure of knowing and working with \nReverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr., I have seen how far his works have reached \nand benefited others. He has made significant contributions to his \ncommunity, the State of Ohio, our Nation, and our world. Reverend Moss \nhas shown that he lives in accordance with his strong faith in God.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1793. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for property owners who remove lead-based paint hazards; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, lead poisoning is a serious, persistent, \nand entirely preventable threat to a child's health. Childhood lead \npoisoning has been linked to impaired growth and function of vital \norgans and problems with intellectual and behavioral development. At \nvery high levels, lead poisoning can cause seizures, comas, and even \ndeath; robbing a child of his or her future.\n  Lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat to \nchildren of color and low-income children in the U.S. African-American \nand Mexican-American children are 5 and 2 times more likely, \nrespectively, to have toxic blood lead levels than white children, \nwhile low-income children are 8 times more likely to develop lead \npoisoning than more affluent children. Compounding the problem is the \nfact that 77 percent of children eligible for lead screening under \nMedicaid are not screened for exposure to lead.\n  An estimated 500,000 American children under the age of 6 have enough \nlead in their blood to adversely affect their development. The most \ncommon source of lead exposure for children today is lead paint in \nolder housing, particularly when it contaminates dust and soil in and \naround residences. Furthermore, despite a ban on lead paint in 1978, \nthere are still over 24 million housing units in the U.S. that have \nlead paint hazards, with about 1.2 million units in New York State \nalone.\n  The good news is childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced \nby the abatement or reduction of lead-based hazards found in homes. \nToday, I am please to reintroduce legislation to provide a tax credit \nfor safely removing lead-based paint hazards from homes and rental \nunits. The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 offers much needed \nincentives for property owners to ensure homes are free of \nenvironmental dangers that can harm our children and will put America \ncloser to its goal of eliminating lead poisoning in children by the \nyear 2010.\n  This bill provides home owners and landlords with a 50 percent tax \ncredit for lead abatement cost for up to $3,000 and up to $1,000 \ninterim control measures. These interim control measures, including \nreplacement of windows, specialized maintenance, and safe repainting, \nare a cost-effective means of protecting the largest number of children \nfrom harmful lead exposure in the near term.\n  This legislation targets a tax credit to homes with children younger \nthan 6 years of age, women of childbearing age, low-income residents, \nand buildings constructed before 1960, as these include more than 96 \npercent of all units where lead-based paint is prevalent. Targeting \nthese tax credits has proven to be a successful way of eliminating \nchildhood lead poisoning. For example, a similar tax credit offered by \nthe State of Massachusetts helped reduce the number of new cases of \nchildhood lead poisoning within the State by almost two-thirds in a \ndecade.\n  I am glad the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers \neliminating lead poisoning to be a priority, and has established a \nnational goal of ending childhood lead poisoning by 2010: However, \ncurrent Federal lead abatement programs only have resources sufficient \nto make approximately 8,800 homes lead-safe each year. At this pace, we \nwill not be able to end childhood lead poisoning by 3010, let alone \n2010. The Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 would help homeowners \nmake over 80,000 homes safe from lead each year, nearly 10 times the \ncapacity of current Federal programs.\n  Every child deserves to grow up in a clean, healthy home environment. \nI am hopeful my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nto safeguard homes against environmental hazards that detrimentally \naffect the health and safety of our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Isakson, and Ms. Collins:\n  S. 1795. A bill to improve access to workers' compensation programs \nfor injured Federal employees; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when Congress passed the Federal \nEmployees Compensation Act 41 years ago, we made a basic promise to \nFederal workers that if they get hurt on the job, they will be taken \ncare of. Today, more than 2.5 million Federal workers rely on the act \nas a safety net in case of injury. These men and women are our \nGovernment at work in all its aspects, and they deserve a system that \nwill care for them when they are injured. The legislation which Senator \nIsakson and I are introducing will ensure that this promise is \nfulfilled for all Federal workers.\n  Today, many injured Federal workers find the treatment they need and \nthe compensation they deserve are out of reach. According to a \nCongressional Research Service report last year, one in five Americans \nlives in areas with a shortage of health care professionals. Citizens \nin such areas must often travel more than a hundred miles to see a \ndoctor. Seeing a primary care doctor is often impossible or \nexorbitantly expensive. To get immediate treatment, they often rely on \nthe expertise of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who are \nmore likely than doctors to practice in such areas.\n  These health care professionals fill a vital need, as the primary \nsource of medical care for many patients. Their practice is regulated \nin all 50 States\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nand the District of Columbia. They are licensed by State laws to write \nprescriptions and provide many of the services provided by primary care \nphysicians.\n  But Federal workers who turn to nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants for care are often denied compensation for their job \ninjuries under current law. This gap in the compensation system for \nFederal workers is unacceptable. No one with a serious injury should \nhave to make the impossible choice between driving a hundred miles to \nsee a doctor who can sign the paperwork for a Federal compensation \nclaim, or getting convenient and competent care from a local nurse \npractitioner or physician assistant, knowing he won't qualify for \nreimbursement for medical bills.\n  This bill will solve the dilemma for our Federal workers across the \nNation who seek care from nurse practitioners or physician assistants. \nIt makes a simple change to our Federal compensation program by \nallowing such cases to qualify for compensation. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill, so we can keep our promise of care for all \ninjured Federal workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cornyn, and \n        Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1798. A bill to establish grant programs to improve the health of \nborder area residents and for all hazards preparedness in the border \narea including bioterrorism in the border area including bioterrorism \nand infectious disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President today I am introducing a bill with \nSenators Hutchison, Cornyn, and Boxer entitled ``the Border Health \nSecurity Act of 2007.'' This bill addresses the tremendous health \nproblems confronting our Nation's southwestern border.\n  The U.S.-Mexico border region is defined in the U.S.-Mexico Border \nHealth Commission authorizing legislation as the area of land 100 \nkilometers, or 62.5 miles, north and south of the international \nboundary. It stretches 2,000 miles from California, through Arizona and \nNew Mexico to the southern tip of Texas and is estimated to have a \npopulation of 12 million residents.\n  The border region comprises 2 sovereign nations, 25 native american \ntribes, and 4 States in the U.S. and 6 States in Mexico.\n  Why should we provide some focus to this geographic region? In the \npast, we have recognized problems with other regions, through the \nDenali, Delta, and Appalachian commissions, and have provided targeted \nfunding to those areas. Yet, the situation along the border is among \nthe most dire in the country.\n  In the border region, 3 of the 10 poorest counties in the U.S. are \nlocated in the border area, 21 of the counties have been designated as \neconomically distressed, approximately 430,000 people live in 1,200 \ncolonias in Texas and New Mexico, which are unincorporated communities \nthat are characterized by substandard housing, unsafe public drinking \nwater, and wastewater systems, very high unemployment, and the lowest \nper capita income as a region in the Nation.\n  In a recent report by the U.S.-Mexico Border Counties Coalition, the \nCoalition found that, if the border were a State, it would rank second \nwith respect to the uninsured, last with respect to access to health \nprofessionals, including doctors, nurses and allied health \nprofessionals per capita; second with respect to tuberculosis, third \nwith respect to hepatitis; and fifth with respect to diabetes.\n  The result is a health system that confronts tremendous health \nproblems with few resources.\n  According to U.S. Census Bureau data reported in September 2005, for \nthe 3-year average of 2002 to 2004, the States of Texas and New Mexico \nrank first and second as the States with the highest uninsured rates in \nthe country with rates of 25.0 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively. \nCalifornia and Arizona are not much better and had uninsured rates of \n18.7 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.\n  However, the figures along the border are even worse, as the rates of \nuninsured are higher still than that in the four States overall. \nUninsured rates in many border counties are estimated to be above 30 \npercent and as high as 50 percent in certain communities. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau's small area health insurance estimates, SAHIE, \nthe three New Mexico border counties had an uninsured rate of 29.4 \npercent compared to the statewide average of 23.7 percent and more than \ntwice the U.S. rate of 14.2 percent.\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission notes:\n\n       The border is characterized by weaknesses in the border \n     health systems and infrastructure, lack of public financial \n     resources, poor distribution of physicians and other health \n     professionals and hospitals. Moreover, the low rates of \n     health insurance coverage and low incomes puts access to \n     health services out of reach for many border residents and \n     thus keeps the border communities at risk.\n\n  The U.S.-Mexico Border Commission has identified and approved of an \nagenda through its health border 2010 initiative, which seeks to, among \nother things: reduce by 25 percent the population lacking access to a \nprimary provider; reduce the female breast cancer death rate by 20 \npercent; reduce the cervical cancer death rate by 30 percent; reduce \ndeaths due to diabetes by 10 percent; reduce hospitalizations due to \ndiabetes by 25 percent; reduce the incidence of HIV cases by 50 \npercent; reduce the incidence tuberculosis cases by 50 percent; reduce \nthe incidence of hepatitis A and B cases by 50 percent; reduce the \ninfant mortality rate by 15 percent; and, increase initiation of \nprenatal care in the first trimester by 85 percent.\n  However, the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission lacks the resources that \nare needed to address those important goals. The bipartisan legislation \nI am introducing today with Senators Hutchison, Cornyn, and Boxer, \nwould address that problem by reauthorizing the U.S.-Mexico Border \nHealth Commission at $10 million and authorizing additional funding to \nimprove the infrastructure, access, and the delivery of health care \nservices along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n  These grants would be flexible and allow the individual communities \nto establish their own priorities about how to spend these funds for \nthe following range of purposes: maternal and child health, primary \ncare and preventative health, public health and public health \ninfrastructure, health promotion, oral health, behavioral and mental \nhealth, substance abuse, health conditions that have a high prevalence \nin the border region, medical and health services research, community \nhealth workers or promotoras, health care infrastructure, including \nplanning and construction grants, health disparities, environmental \nhealth; health education, and outreach and enrollment services with \nrespect to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP.\n  We would certainly expect that those grants will be used for the \npurpose of striving to achieve the measurable goals established by the \nhealth border 2010 initiative.\n  In addition, the bill contains authorization for $25 million for \nfunding to border communities to improve the infrastructure, \npreparedness, and education of health professionals along the U.S.-\nMexico border with respect to bioterrorism. This includes the \nestablishment of a health alert network to identify and communicate \ninformation quickly to health providers about emerging health care \nthreats.\n  On October 15, 2001, just 1 month after the September 11, 2001, \nattack on our Nation, Secretary Thompson spoke to the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder Health Commission and urged them to put together an application \nfor $25 million for bioterrorism and preparedness. The commission has \ndone so but has not seen targeted funding despite the vulnerability \nthat border communities have with respect to a bioterrorism attack. Our \nlegislation addresses the vulnerability of communities along the border \nand targets funding to those communities specifically to improve \ninfrastructure, training, and preparedness.\n  Our relationship with Mexico, like that with Canada, is a special \none. Those countries are our closest neighbors, and yet, we often and \nwrongly neglect our neighbor to the south and the much needed economic \ndevelopment needed in the region. Mexico is the United States' second \nlargest trading partner and the border is recognized as one of the \nbusiest ports of entry in the world. And yet the region is often \nneglected.\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission points out:\n\n       Without increases and sustained federal, state and local \n     governmental and private funding or health programs, \n     infrastructure and education, the border populations will \n     continue to lag behind the United States in these areas.\n\n  I would like to thank Senator Hutchison, who was an original \ncosponsor of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission legislation, \nPublic Law 103-400, that we passed in 1994 and is the lead cosponsor of \nthis legislation today. She has also been the lead senator in getting \nfunding for the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission since its \ninception.\n  I would also thank Senators Cornyn and Boxer for working with us on \nthis important legislation and for their constant support over the \nyears for the work of the Commission.\n  I urge the adoption of this bipartisan legislation by this Congress. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to apply \nrate parity to the excise tax on small cigars and small cigarettes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nenormous importance the health and safety of our children. Although we \nhave made great strides in recent years to combat youth cigarette \nsmoking, a few in the tobacco industry have found a loophole which \nallows them to classify certain cigarettes as ``small cigars'' thereby \navoiding higher cigarette taxes that\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nhave been implemented, at least in part, to deter children from \nsmoking.\n  The trend of small cigar use is growing at an alarming rate. Small \ncigar sales for 2006 were at the highest level ever reported and have \nincreased by more than 100 percent since 1998. This increase has \noccurred at the exact same time that cigarette usage has decreased. \nMore specifically, use of cigars among youth is rising. Multiple \nstudies over the last few years have shown that more and more high \nschool students are smoking cigar products while the percentage of high \nschool cigarette smokers is down.\n  What is the reason for this shift in tobacco consumption? It is my \nbelief and I am not alone that the emerging small cigar market has \nplayed a significant role in this problem. Tobacco products are self-\nclassified by the manufacturer and labeled as small cigars. As \ncigarette taxes have gone up in recent years, the flight to cigar \nclassification has become all the more tempting. As a result, there are \nan increasing number of manufacturers with products that look like \ncigarettes--the same size and shape as cigarettes--and smoke like \ncigarettes--many of them are filtered--being marketed and sold as \ncheaper alternatives to cigarettes simply because they are encased in \nbrown wrapping. Members of the tobacco industry even acknowledge that \nsmall cigars are ``a smoking alternative to cigarettes.''\n  Under current law, small cigars are taxed at significantly lower \nrates than cigarettes. This tax differential allows small cigars to \nprice themselves at about half of the usual cigarette shelf price. This \nmischaracterization is costing the Federal Treasury in revenues and, \nmore importantly, having the effect of enabling our children greater \naccess to tobacco products. In addition, these small cigar products are \noften sold in packs of five or eight, or sometimes even individually, \nmaking them even cheaper and more accessible to our children.\n  Research shows that increased tobacco product pricing reduces smoking \namong children. It is imperative that we implement policy to correct \nthe pricing disparity among similar tobacco products. We must ensure \nthat our laws intended to protect public health are not being \ncircumvented. The legislation I am introducing today would increase the \nFederal excise tax on small cigars to the same rates as cigarettes. \nThis will level the playing field to ensure that all tobacco products \nthat look like cigarettes and smoke like cigarettes are taxed like \ncigarettes. I ask my colleagues to join me in working to ensure this \nloophole is closed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require \nemergency contraception to be available at all military health care \ntreatment facilities; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, last year, the FDA made emergency \ncontraception, EC, available over the counter for women 18 years of age \nand older. Research shows that emergency contraception is safe and \neffective for preventing pregnancy. More than 70 major medical \norganizations, including the America Academy of Pediatrics, recommended \nthat Plan B be made available over the counter.\n  Senator Murray and I spent a great deal of time and effort tracking \nthe FDA's ``non-decision'' of whether emergency contraception should be \nmade available over the counter. We have come a long way in the fight \nfor access to EC.\n  Women deserve access to this medically approved drug and our \nservicewomen are no different. By providing access to emergency \ncontraception, up to 95 percent of those unintended pregnancies could \nbe prevented if emergency contraception is administered within the \nfirst 24 to 72 hours. For survivors of rape and incest, emergency \ncontraception offers hope for healing.\n  Current Department of Defense policy allows emergency contraception \nto be available at military health care facilities. Currently, it is \navailable at some facilities, but not others. The Compassionate Care \nfor Servicewomen Act would simply ensure broader access by including EC \non the basic core formulary, BCF, a list of medications stocked at all \nmilitary health care facilities.\n  Introduced as a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives by \nCongressmen Mike Michaud and Chris Shays, the Compassionate Care for \nServicewomen Act was written to implement exactly what the DOD's own \ncommittee charged with determining which drugs should be added to the \nbasic core formulary recommended in 2002.\n  Unfortunately, about a month later, DOD political appointees \noverruled their own experts' advice without any justification and \nremoved EC from the BCF. This bill restores what the DOD wanted to do \nbefore it was blocked by politics.\n  There is a real need for this legislation. According to the Pentagon, \nthe number of reported sexual assaults in the military increased \napproximately 24 percent in 2006 to nearly 3,000. We have reports from \nwomen and health providers in the military who have sought EC on an \nemergency basis and have been unable to obtain it quickly enough.\n  Ensuring that EC is more broadly available at military health care \nfacilities is a fair, commonsense step that everyone should be able to \nagree on.\n  It is my sincere hope that my colleagues join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation and I would like to express my thanks to my \ncolleagues who have already signed on.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1804. A bill to enhance the ability of the United States to \nprevent, prepare for, detect, and respond to agriculture and food \nemergencies; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \nAgriculture and Food Defense Act of 2007, which I introduced today \nalong with the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins. This bill will help \nthe Nation better prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from an \nagro-terror attack or deliberate food contamination. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine for her leadership on homeland \nsecurity issues and for her support of this important legislation.\n  Our agriculture and food system is an important part of our Nation's \neconomy and our national security. As we increase our dependence on \nagriculture not only to provide our food supply but to also produce \nenergy, we must ensure we can identify security vulnerabilities, fix \nthose vulnerabilities, respond to and recover from a deliberate attack \nor catastrophic accidental or natural contamination.\n  The Nation's agriculture and food system remains vulnerable. The \nsystem is open, complex, interconnected, and diverse, which makes it a \ntarget. Many farms are geographically isolated with few biosecurity \nmeasures in place. And livestock is frequently concentrated in confined \nspaces. For example, 80 to 90 percent of U.S. cattle production is \nconcentrated in less than 5 percent of the nation's feedlots. An attack \non just one part of the production process could set off a devastating \ndomino effect felt through our entire food system, causing economic \nloss and effects on human health.\n  Biological weapons and poisons in food and animals have been used in \nattacks in the past. During World War I, German operatives allegedly \ninfected horses with anthrax before they were shipped to Europe. In \n1984, a cult in Oregon spread salmonella in salad bars at restaurants \nto influence a local election. More recently, documents found in al \nQaeda hideouts in Afghanistan described how to make animal and plant \npoisons, evidence that agriculture and food continue to be prospective \ntargets for terrorist organizations.\n  We have two main concerns when contemplating a deliberate attack on \nour agriculture and food system, the potentially devastating economic \nimpacts, and the possible human health effects.\n  For example, studies show a single agro-terrorist attack on our \nlivestock industry could cost the U.S. economy $10 to $33 billion. The \nUnited Kingdom's Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak in 2001 caused \napproximately $5 billion in losses to the agriculture and food sector, \nand U.S. beef exports plunged when 119 countries instituted bans on \nAmerican beef after ``mad\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\ncow'' disease was found in a U.S. herd in 2003. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture estimates the annual cost to the country from premature \ndeaths caused by just one common food-borne illness, salmonella, is \nover $2 billion.\n  Many infectious diseases affect both humans and animals, and a \nsignificant number of those diseases cross over between the two \ndifferent populations. In fact, 75 percent of emerging diseases affect \nboth animals and humans, and 5 out of 6 agents of greatest concern for \nbioterrorism are ``zoonotic''. We are all aware of the global threat of \nH5Nl bird flu, a zoonotic disease that to date has infected 317 people, \nand killed 191. In order to protect the human and animal health of the \nUnited States, we must develop a unified human and veterinary approach \nagainst infectious disease that anticipates disease evolution and acts \nquickly.\n\n  In addition to transmissible diseases carried by animals, the health \nof U.S. citizens is vulnerable to an attack because food systems can \nbecome delivery mechanisms for diseases and poisonous agents, and a \nhighly contagious animal disease could seriously disrupt the food \nsupply. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 76 \nmillion Americans get sick each year, more than 300,000 are \nhospitalized, and 5,000 die from naturally occurring foodborne \nillnesses. A deliberate attack could be catastrophic.\n  In the National Agriculture and Food Defense Act of 2007, we take \nfive key actions to better prepare the nation for an attack on our \nagriculture and food system.\n  First, the bill puts someone in charge. Consistent with Homeland \nSecurity Presidential Directive 9, the Defense of the United States \nAgriculture and Food, issued by President Bush in January 2004, the \nbill identifies the Secretary of Homeland Security as the lead \ncoordinator of Federal Government efforts to protect critical \ninfrastructure and key resources, including the agriculture and food \nsystem in case of a national emergency. The Secretary of Agriculture \nremains responsible for agriculture, as well as meat, poultry, and egg \nfood products; and the Secretary of Health and Human Services is \nresponsible for food products other than meat, poultry, and egg \nproducts. The bill also establishes an Under Secretary for Protection, \nPreparedness, and Response position at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to lead and coordinate USDA activities relating to \nagriculture and food defense.\n  Second, the bill requires a coordinated national strategy for \nprotecting our agriculture and food system. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Health \nand Human Services are required to work together to develop a \ncoordinated national strategy for agriculture and food emergency \npreparedness, detection, response and recovery. This will ensure the \nFederal Government identifies specific achievable goals and constantly \nstrives to improve our preparedness.\n  Third, this legislation provides guidance, assistance, and financial \nsupport from the Federal Government to States by improving regional \nagriculture and food defense continuity of business planning; by \ntraining State personnel on food defense; and by improving \ncommunication and coordination between States and the Federal \nGovernment by hiring State agriculture and food defense liaison \nofficers.\n  Being from a large agriculture State, I know my State and many others \nare potential targets for a deliberate attack on our agriculture and \nfood system. At $68 billion in revenues each year, agriculture is North \nCarolina's largest industry. North Carolina is the second highest \nproducer of hogs and turkeys in the nation, and number five in \nbroilers. States, such as North Carolina, will benefit greatly from \nadditional resources, coordination and planning.\n  Federal, State, local governments and the private sector together \nhave a responsibility to defend and protect the agriculture and food \nsystem through a layered defense established at each level of \ngovernment. States are the first responders in the event of a suspected \nfood contamination, animal disease or plant pest outbreak, and the \nFederal Government must help States build the capabilities to prevent, \ndetect, respond to, and recover from a catastrophic animal disease \noutbreak or food contamination. It is important to note that this \nlegislation maintains the authority of States to oversee food and \nagriculture within their jurisdiction and to implement food safety \nstandards. The bill does not affect USDA or the Food and Drug \nAdministration's ability or authority to establish and enforce food \nsafety standards.\n  Fourth, the bill enhances public-private partnerships. The majority \nof our agriculture and food system is privately owned and operated. \nThis legislation authorizes Government and private sector coordinating \ncouncils to improve information sharing between Government and private \nsector partners.\n  Finally, the National Agriculture and Food Defense Act implements \nearly detection of, and rapid response to animal disease outbreaks and \nfood-related emergencies. The bill authorizes and integrates Nation-\nwide animal, plant, and food diagnostic laboratory networks, and \ndevelops onsite rapid diagnostic tools, to speed up the detection of \nanimal and food-related emergencies. To rapidly respond to infectious \ndiseases, the bill authorizes a stockpile of animal vaccines and drugs \nthat can be deployed to an outbreak within 24 hours.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Collins for sponsoring the National \nAgriculture and Food Defense Act with me. We Are taking a decisive step \nforward today towards improving and protecting the Nation's agriculture \nand food system. I would also like to thank all the experts from across \nthe country who worked with my staff to develop this legislation, \nparticularly the individuals in North Carolina who have dedicated their \nlives to this mission. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand I look forward to working with them on this important national \nsecurity issue.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nNational Agriculture and Food Defense Act of 2007 that my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Burr, and I are introducing today.\n  A decade ago, the General Accounting Office report illustrated the \ndanger of lapses in food safety, a single-year toll of millions of \ncases of food-borne illnesses and 9,100 food-related deaths. I \nconducted a series of investigative hearings in 1998 that confirmed \nAmerica faced significant risks from tainted food imports.\n  In 2003, I also chaired a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing \nthat pointed out new threats. I noted that al-Qaida had announced that \nthe U.S. economy was a target, that hundreds of U.S. agricultural \ndocuments had been found translated into Arabic, and that some of the \n9/11 terrorists had investigated using crop-dusting planes as weapons \nof agroterrorism.\n  Today, food security problems persist, and their potential for death \nand disruption has been greatly magnified by the terrorist threats \nagainst the United States. Ensuring the safety of our food must include \nconsiderations of homeland security.\n  We have all heard the recent news stories of contamination involving \nfood and toothpaste imported from China. But the concerns extend \nfar beyond anyone trading partner. Food and Drug Administration data \nfor 2006 show that hundreds of shipments from India, Mexico, Denmark, \nthe Dominican Republic, and other countries were impounded for defects \nor safety concerns. Considering that the vast majority of incoming food \nshipments are not inspected, these facts are troubling. Even more \ntroubling, we must consider how much worse the potential impacts could \nbe if large-scale deliberate contamination were attempted, whether by \nattacks on domestically produced food or imports or the distribution, \nproduction, and processing systems.\n\n  Congress has recognized the threats to our seaports, chemical \nfacilities, transportation, and critical infrastructure. We have acted \nto protect these vital systems that sustain our economy. We must also \nextend our homeland security vigilance to the food that sustains our \nvery lives.\n  The National Agriculture and Food Defense Act would integrate and \nstrengthen the federal government's ability to promote food security. \nWith the Department of Homeland Security in a directing role, and with \nsector-specific leadership roles for the Departments of Agriculture and \nHealth and Human Services, the bill would provide\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\na coherent National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy consistent \nwith our national emergency management plans.\n  As Congress has already provided in other areas, the national food \nsecurity strategy would address preparedness, mitigation, response, and \nrecovery. Its provisions for stockpiling veterinary supplies and \nestablishing a plant-disease recovery program would add vital new \nFederal capabilities. Coordination of Federal food security budget \nactivity and outreach State, local, and private sector stakeholders are \nalso important features of the bill.\n  In light of the gravity of the threat to our food security and this \nmeasure's thoughtful and promising response to that threat, I encourage \nmy colleagues to support expeditious action on this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Roberts):\n  S. 1806. A bill to restore to the judiciary the power to decide all \ntrademark and trade name cases arising under the laws and treaties of \nthe United States by repealing the prohibition on recognition by United \nStates courts of certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, \nand commercial names and impediments to registration of such marks, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to correct \na most unfortunate piece of legislation that was slipped into an \nappropriations bill several years ago, which will restore the Federal \ncourts to their proper position in considering certain trademark \nissues. I joined Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Roberts \non a version of this bill in the 109th Congress. That bill did not \nreach final passage, but its importance demands our renewed attention. \nTogether, we are reintroducing the Judicial Powers Restoration Act of \n2007.\n  We will repeal Section 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill of \n1999. Section 211 was slipped into that appropriations bill at the \neleventh hour, under the radar of most members of the Senate. It was \ndone in a way specifically intended to bypass the normal legislative \nprocess. Its intent was to affect the outcome of a dispute over the \n``Havana Club'' trademark for rum. Section 211 prohibits the \nregistration or renewal of registration of a trademark of a business \nthat was expropriated by the Cuban Government. It also disallows ``any \nassertion of rights'' by Cuban entities, or a foreign successor in \ninterest to a Cuban entity, with respect to trademarks of expropriated \nbusinesses. Finally, the provision states that no U.S. Court may \nrecognize the attempt by a Cuban entity or its successor in interest, \nfrom asserting treaty rights with respect to an expropriated mark \nunless the owner expressly consents.\n  I am not here to help out a liquor company. Rather, I am here to \nensure that intellectual property protections recognized by our laws \nare honored in our courts. I am here to ensure that U.S. courts may \nconsider trademark cases arising under U.S. laws. Most importantly, I \nam here because the legislative process needs to take place in the open \nand in front of the people, not under cover of darkness and behind \nclosed doors.\n  I have been working with Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nRoberts for more than three years on this issue, and I hope we can move \nquickly to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Judicial Powers Restoration \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to restore to the judiciary the \n     power to decide all trademark and trade name cases arising \n     under the laws and treaties of the United States by repealing \n     the prohibition on recognition by United States courts of \n     certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, and \n     commercial names and impediments to registration of such \n     marks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPORT ON CONTROL OF THE BROWN TREE SNAKE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), an invasive \n     species, is found in significant numbers on military \n     installations and in other areas on Guam, and constitutes a \n     serious threat to the ecology of Guam.\n       (2) If introduced into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States, \n     the brown tree snake would pose an immediate and serious \n     economic and ecological threat.\n       (3) The most probable vector for the introduction of the \n     brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States is \n     the movement from Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and \n     cargo, including the household goods of military personnel.\n       (4) It is probable that the movement of military aircraft, \n     personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of \n     military personnel, from Guam to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United \n     States will increase significantly coincident with the \n     increase in the number of military units and personnel \n     stationed on Guam.\n       (5) Current policies, programs, procedures, and dedicated \n     resources of the Department of Defense and of other \n     departments and agencies of the United States may not be \n     sufficient to adequately address the increasing threat of the \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report on the \n     following:\n       (1) The actions currently being taken (including the \n     resources being made available) by the Department of Defense \n     to control, and to develop new or existing techniques to \n     control, the brown tree snake on Guam and to ensure that the \n     brown tree snake is not introduced into Hawaii, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island, or the \n     continental United States as a result of the movement from \n     Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and cargo, including \n     the household goods of military personnel.\n       (2) Current plans for enhanced future actions, policies, \n     and procedures and increased levels of resources in order to \n     ensure that the projected increase of military personnel \n     stationed on Guam does not increase the threat of \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2282.

SENSE OF SENATE ON PROJECT COMPASSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the responsibility of every citizen of the United \n     States to honor the service and sacrifice of the veterans of \n     the United States, especially those who have made the \n     ultimate sacrifice.\n       (2) In the finest tradition of this sacred responsibility, \n     Kaziah M. Hancock, an artist\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n     from central Utah, founded a nonprofit organization called \n     Project Compassion, which endeavors to provide, without \n     charge, to the family of a member of the Armed Forces who has \n     fallen in active duty since the events of September 11, 2001, \n     a museum-quality original oil portrait of that member.\n       (3) To date, Kaziah M. Hancock, four volunteer professional \n     portrait artists, and those who have donated their time to \n     support Project Compassion have presented over 700 paintings \n     to the families of the fallen heroes of the United States.\n       (4) Kaziah M. Hancock and Project Compassion have been \n     honored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, \n     the Disabled American Veterans, and other organizations with \n     the highest public service awards on behalf of fallen members \n     of the Armed Forces and their families.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Kaziah M. Hancock and the members of Project Compassion \n     have demonstrated, and continue to demonstrate, extraordinary \n     patriotism and support for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and \n     Marines who have given their lives for the United States in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan and have done so without any expectation \n     of financial gain or recognition for these efforts;\n       (2) the people of the United States owe the deepest \n     gratitude to Kaziah M. Hancock and the members of Project \n     Compassion; and\n       (3) the Senate, on the behalf of the people of the United \n     States, commends Kaziah M. Hancock, the four other Project \n     Compassion volunteer professional portrait artists, and the \n     entire Project Compassion organization for their tireless \n     work in paying tribute to those members of the Armed Forces \n     who have fallen in the service of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9495-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1811. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to assess \nand reduce the levels of lead found in child-occupied facilities in the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Lead \nPoisoning Reduction Act.\n  Two weeks ago, the Washington Post featured an article on lead \nresearch by the economist Rick Nevin. Mr. Nevin's work demonstrates a \nstrong link between lead exposure and criminal activity in our country. \nSpecifically, he found that national spikes in rates of children with \nlead poisoning were significantly correlated with spikes in criminal \nactivity two decades later. Notably, this finding was not unique to the \nU.S., he found a similar association in 9 other countries, despite \ndifferences in economics, demographics, and values. Although many \nreaders, myself included, were surprised by Nevin's findings, the \nscientific community was not, having known for many years that lead \npoisoning leads to irrevocable, toxic effects on brain development of \nyoung children. These effects lead to changes such as impulsivity and \nimpaired cognition, which appear to contribute to criminal behavior in \nlater years.\n  Mr. Nevin's work underscores the critical importance of eliminating \nlead poisoning in children, which is completely preventable and has \ntragic consequences. In the U.S., over 300,000 children have blood lead \nlevels of 10\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nmicrograms or higher, the level traditionally considered to indicate \n``lead poisoning''. Yet, even this level is now considered unsafe as \nnewer research has indicated that lead-related damage starts at much \nlower levels. We must remain vigilant in tackling all sources of lead \nexposure, to save future generations of children from harm, and the \nLead Poisoning Reduction Act will help to do just that.\n  The major source of lead exposure among U.S. children is lead-based \npaint and lead-contaminated dust found in deteriorating buildings. The \nLead Poisoning Reduction Act will provide $42.6 million in grants to \ncommunities that wish to develop and implement lead amelioration \nprograms for their childcare facilities. It directs EPA to promulgate \nregulations within 18 months that require new child-occupied facilities \nto be certified lead-safe before opening for business. Additionally, \nEPA would also promulgate regulations within 5 years of enactment to \nrequire that all non-home-based childcare facilities be lead-safe. \nFurther, my bill requires EPA to conduct a study of State, tribal and \nlocal programs designed to protect children from lead exposure in \nchild-occupied facilities; to establish baseline studies, based on the \nresults of this study; and to create a model program, that can be \nadapted for use by State, tribal and community officials, for testing, \nabatement, and communication of risks of lead to children and parents.\n  Reducing lead hazards in our communities, especially in child-\noccupied facilities, is critical, with impact reaching beyond \nindividual children in preschools in any given city, to our society as \na whole. It is the right thing to do, and the smart thing to do, and it \nshould have been done years ago.\n  I call on my colleagues to support the Lead Protection Reduction Act, \nwhich will help to ensure that every child has access to safe, lead-\nfree childcare facilities in this Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Bayh):\n  S. 1812. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to strengthen mentoring programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, research indicates a caring adult can \nmake a difference in a child's future. Today, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will expand the mentoring programs found in the No \nChild Left Behind Act. If adopted, the Mentoring America's Children Act \nof 2007 would help close America's ``mentoring gap'' and match more at-\nrisk students with high-quality mentors. I thank my colleagues, \nSenators Kerry, Akaka, and Bayh, for joining me on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mentoring programs are a cost-effective way to expand a young \nperson's ability for success. Studies have shown young people with \nmentors perform better in school and are more likely to graduate and go \non to higher education. Mentors also play a role in improving the \nsocial and emotional well-being and reducing the negative behaviors of \nthe children they mentor.\n  Despite the positive effects of having a mentor, nearly 15 million \nyoung adults are still in need of mentoring. These young people \nencompass America's ``mentoring gap.'' That is why I have joined with \nmy colleagues to introduce the Mentoring America's Children Act of \n2007.\n  This legislation broadens the reach of mentoring to include specific \npopulations of young people who could particularly benefit from a \nmentor's involvement, including children in foster care and kids in \ncommunities with a high rate of youth suicides. It also provides much \nneeded training and technical assistance to grantees, tracks youth \noutcomes, strengthens research on the effects of mentoring, and \nimproves the sustainability of grant recipients. Finally, this bill \nallows students to gain professional skills while working with mentors \nby establishing internship programs during the school year.\n  Mentoring plays a key role in improving the learning environment for \na young person, as mentored youth have better attendance and are more \nconnected to their school, schoolwork, and teachers. Mentors serve as \nrole models, advisors, and advocates for the children they mentor. We \nmust work together to match even more high-quality mentors with our \nneediest children.\n  This legislation is supported by MENTOR/National Mentoring \nPartnership, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and the National \nCollaboration for Youth. I ask my colleagues to join me in approving \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our Nation's children are our greatest \nresource. They represent the future of this country and we should do \neverything we can to foster their growth and ensure they lead happy and \nproductive lives. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Mentoring \nAmerica's Children Act of 2007 which was introduced today by Senator \nClinton. This important legislation highlights the significant impact \nmentoring can have on a child.\n  Research has shown time and time again that mentoring is an important \ncomponent to a child's development. Often these children come from \nbroken homes or communities affected by violence. The relationship \nformed between a mentor and a child helps support their studies in \nschool, their relationships with their families at home, and gives them \nthe confidence they need to withstand the pressures they are faced \nwith. Our children are confronted with much more than some of us even \nrealize. By providing a mentor, parents and teachers have another line \nof defense in allowing our children to grow up in a safe nurturing \nenvironment.\n  The consequences of letting young people grow up without a support \nsystem are dire. In 2006 America's law enforcement officers arrested \napproximately 250 teens an hour, and it's estimated that 900,000 of our \nchildren are victims of abuse and neglect. Studies show that most teens \nthat use alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana do so before they are 14. \nThis is unacceptable. We must do more to foster these children so they \nstay in school, keep clean and out of trouble.\n  Mentoring can help improve the social and mental well being of a \nchild so they can deal with the myriad of challenges they face. \nMassachusetts has many notable mentoring programs that have affected \nthousands of children's lives. Strong Women, Strong Girls is a program \nstarted by a Harvard graduate that matches local university women with \ngirls in targeted communities to help create another generation of \nstrong women through mentoring. The Boys and Girls Club has a long and \nstoried history in my State as does the Big Brother Big Sister program. \nA study of Brother Big Sister showed that children that benefited from \ntheir program were 46 percent less likely to use drugs, 52 percent less \nlikely to skip school and have fewer conflicts with their families.\n  The Mentoring America's Children Act would help these programs and \nothers like them across the country. It builds on the mentoring \nprograms already put in place in the No Child Left Behind Act by \nensuring that they are as effective as possible. The bill provides for \nadditional training and technical resources as well as studies the \nefficacy of these various programs. More importantly, it widens the net \nof children that can be helped by mentors by focusing on children in \nthe foster care system and those that live in communities with high \nsuicide rates. We should be focusing our energies on helping the \nchildren most in need and providing them with mentors that can enrich \ntheir lives and help them succeed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1814. A bill to provide individuals with access to health \ninformation of which they are a subject, ensure personal privacy with \nrespect to health related information, promote the use of non-\nidentifiable information for health research, impose criminal and civil \npenalties for unauthorized use of protected health information, to \nprovide for the strong enforcement of these rights, and to protect \nStates' rights; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy, \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nPensions, in introducing the Health Information Privacy and Security \nAct of 2007, HIPSA. This comprehensive health privacy bill will ensure \nthe right to privacy with respect\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\nto health information for millions of Americans.\n  In America today, if you have a health record, you have a health \nprivacy problem. The explosion of electronic health records, digital \ndatabases and the Internet is fueling a growing supply and demand for \nAmericans' health information. The ability to easily access this \ninformation electronically, often by the click of a mouse, or a few key \nstrokes on a computer, can be very useful in providing more cost-\neffective health care. But, the use of advancing technologies to access \nand share health information can also lead to a loss of personal \nprivacy.\n  In the Information Age, the traditional right and expectation of \nconfidentiality between patient and doctor is at great risk. Without \nadequate safeguards to protect health privacy, many Americans will \nsimply not seek the medical treatment that they need, nor agree to \nparticipate in health research, because they fear that their sensitive \nhealth information will be disclosed without then consent or knowledge. \nAnd those who do seek medical treatment must assume the risk of the \nunauthorized disclosure of their health information due to a data \nsecurity breach or other privacy violation. The loss of health privacy \nis a growing threat to our national health care system that the \nCongress must address.\n  Senator Kennedy and I both firmly believe that a fear of a loss of \nprivacy cannot be allowed to deter Americans from seeking medical \ntreatment. We are introducing this legislation today to close the \nprivacy gap with respect to Americans' electronic health information.\n  A guiding principle in drafting our health privacy bill has been that \nthe American people will only support efforts to move toward health \ninformation technology if they are assured that their sensitive health \ninformation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure and from the \ngrowing dangers of identity crimes posed by data security breaches. The \nbill that we are introducing today takes several important steps to \nhonor this principle and to protect the health privacy of all \nAmericans.\n  First, our bill guarantees the right of every American to privacy and \nsecurity with respect to the use and disclosure of their health \ninformation. Under this legislation, every individual has the right to \ninspect and copy his or her own health records and to receive notice of \nthe privacy rights and practices of data brokers and others who store \nthis information in electronic databases. Our bill also ensures the \nsecurity of electronic health information by requiring that data \nbrokers establish safeguards to secure health information from data \nsecurity breaches and other unauthorized disclosures.\n\n  Second, our bill places meaningful restrictions on the disclosure of \nsensitive health information. The bill expressly prohibits the \ndisclosure or use of health information without a patient's \nauthorization and requires that any health information intended to be \nused for medical research first be stripped of personally identifying \ninformation to protect an individual's privacy. There are exceptions to \nthese restrictions for law enforcement, public safety and national \nsecurity purposes.\n  Our bill also requires that patients be notified of a data security \nbreach involving their health information within 15 days of discovery \nof the breach. The bill provides for important exceptions to this \nnotice requirement for law enforcement and national security reasons.\n  Thirdly, our bill addresses the growing fear of many Americans that \nthey will not be able to obtain important health information about a \nparent or child in situations involving a medical emergency, because of \nconfusion about the requirements of current health privacy laws. The \nNew York Times recently reported that many health care providers are \noverzealously applying health privacy laws, such as the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, thwarting the \nlegitimate efforts of family members, caretakers and even law \nenforcement to obtain critical health information about patients in \ntheir care. Our bill expressly allows health care providers to disclose \nhealth information to law enforcement for legitimate purposes and to a \npatient's next of kin, provided that the patient has been notified of \ntheir right to object to such disclosure. The bill also establishes a \nnational office of health information privacy within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to aid American consumers in learning about \ntheir health privacy rights.\n  Lastly, our bill contains meaningful civil and criminal enforcement \nprovisions to discourage and punish the wrongful disclosure of \nAmericans' sensitive health information. The bill makes it a Federal \ncrime to knowingly and intentionally disclose or use sensitive health \ninformation without an individual's consent. Violators of this \nprovision are subject to a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and up to \n10 years in prison, if the violation is committed with the intent to \nsell or use sensitive health information for economic gain. In \naddition, the bill authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil \naction in Federal district court to obtain civil penalties from \nentities that fail to adequately safeguard electronic health records, \nor to provide consumers with information about their health privacy \nrights.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have worked on this legislation for more than a \ndecade and we both understand the need to carefully balance the right \nto health privacy with the legitimate needs of health care providers, \nmedical researchers and public health and law enforcement officials. \nOur bill strikes the right balance between protecting privacy and \nensuring public safety.\n  We have also conferred extensively with the many stakeholders in the \nhealth care community in crafting this legislation and our bill is \nsupported by a wide range of public policy, consumer and health care \norganizations from across the political spectrum.\n  Senator Kennedy and I believe that the right to health privacy is of \nvital interest to all Americans. For this reason, and on behalf of the \nmillions of Americans who are currently at risk of either foregoing \nmedical treatment or losing their right to health privacy, I urge all \nSenators to join us in supporting this important privacy legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a copy of the \nJuly 3, 2007, the New York Times article entitled ``Keeping Patients' \nDetails Private, Even From Kin,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

\n     and\n       (2) an authorized Federal official for the conduct of \n     lawful intelligence, counter-intelligence, and other national \n     security activities authorized by the National Security Act \n     (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) and implementing authority (Executive \n     Order 12333), or otherwise by law.\n       (b) Requirements for Court Orders for Access to Protected \n     Health Information.--A court order for the disclosure of \n     protected health information under subsection (a)(1) may be \n     issued by any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction \n     and shall issue only if the investigative or law enforcement \n     officer submits a written application upon oath or equivalent \n     affirmation demonstrating that there is probable cause to \n     believe that--\n       (1) the protected health information sought is relevant and \n     material to an ongoing criminal investigation, except in the \n     case of a State government authority, such a court order \n     shall not issue if prohibited by the law of such State;\n       (2) the investigative or evidentiary needs of the \n     investigative or law enforcement officer cannot reasonably be \n     satisfied by de-identified health information or by any other \n     information;

The Attorney General may initiate \n     an action under this section by filing a complaint pursuant \n     to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       (b) Scope of Penalty.--In determining the amount or scope \n     of any penalty sought pursuant to section 321, the Attorney \n     General shall take into account--\n       (1) the nature of claims and the circumstances under which \n     they were presented;\n       (2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, \n     and financial condition of the person against whom the claim \n     is brought; and\n       (3) such other matters as justice may require.\n       (c) Recovery of Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--Civil money penalties imposed under this \n     section may be recovered in a civil action in the name of the \n     United States brought in United States district court for the \n     district where the claim was presented, or where the claimant \n     resides, as determined by the Attorney General. Amounts \n     recovered under this section shall be paid to the United \n     States and deposited as miscellaneous receipts of the \n     Treasury of the United States.\n       (2) Deduction from amounts owing.--The amount of any \n     penalty may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by \n     the United States or a State to the person against whom the \n     penalty has been assessed.\n       (d) Injunctive Relief.--Whenever the Attorney General in \n     consultation with the Secretary has reason to believe that \n     any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in \n     any activity which makes the person subject to a civil \n     monetary penalty under section 321, the Attorney General may \n     bring an action in an appropriate district court of the \n     United States (or, if applicable, a United States court of \n     any territory) to enjoin such activity, or to enjoin the \n     person from concealing, removing, encumbering, or disposing \n     of assets which may be required in order to pay a civil \n     monetary penalty if any such penalty were to be imposed or to \n     seek other appropriate relief.\n       (e) Agency.--A principal is jointly and severally liable \n     with the principal's agent for penalties under section 321 \n     for the actions of the principal's agent acting within the \n     scope of the agency.\n\n     SEC. 323.

Authorizations pursuant to section 202 shall \n     not be construed as a waiver of any such privilege.\n       (c) Certain Duties Under Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to preempt, supersede, or modify the operation of \n     any State law that--\n       (1) provides for the reporting of vital statistics such as \n     birth or death information;\n       (2) requires the reporting of abuse or neglect information \n     about any individual;\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\n       (3) regulates the disclosure or reporting of information \n     concerning an individual's mental health; or\n       (4) governs a minor's rights to access protected health \n     information or health care services.\n       (d) Federal Privacy Act.--\n       (1) Medical exemptions.--Section 552a of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(w) Certain Protected Health Information.--The head of an \n     agency that is a health care provider, health plan, health \n     oversight agency, employer, insurer, health or life insurer, \n     school or university, or other entity who receives protected \n     health information under section 218 of the Health \n     Information Privacy and Security Act shall promulgate rules, \n     in accordance with the requirements (including general \n     notice) of subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (c), (e) of \n     section 553 of this title, to exempt a system of records \n     within the agency, to the extent that the system of records \n     contains protected health information (as defined in section \n     4 of such Act), from all provisions of this section except \n     subsections (b)(6), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), subparagraphs (A) \n     through (C) and (E) through (I) of subsection (e)(4), and \n     subsections (e)(5), (e)(6), (e)(9), (e)(12), (l), (n), (o), \n     (p), (r), and (u).''.\n       (2) Technical amendment.--Section 552a(f)(3) of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``pertaining to \n     him,'' and all that follows through the semicolon and \n     inserting ``pertaining to the individual''.\n       (e) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.--\n     The standards governing the privacy and security of \n     individually identifiable health information promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services under sections \n     262(a) and 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 shall remain in effect to the \n     extent that they are consistent with this Act.

Another nurse \n     threatened Mr. Nussbaum with arrest for scanning his \n     relative's medical chart to prove to her that she was about \n     to administer a dangerous second round of sedatives.\n       The nurses who threatened him with eviction and arrest both \n     made the same claim, Mr. Nussbaum said: that access to his \n     father-in-law and his medical information were prohibited \n     under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \n     Act, or Hipaa, as the federal law is known.\n       Mr. Nussbaum, a health care and Hipaa consultant, knew \n     better and stood his ground. Nothing in the law prevented his \n     involvement. But the confrontation drove home the way Hipaa \n     is misunderstood by medical professionals, as well as the \n     frustration--and even peril--that comes in its wake.\n       Government studies released in the last few months show the \n     frustration is widespread, an unintended consequence of the \n     1996 law.\n       Hipaa was designed to allow Americans to take their health \n     insurance coverage with them when they changed jobs, with \n     provisions to keep medical information confidential. But new \n     studies have found that some health care providers apply \n     Hipaa regulations overzealously, leaving family members, \n     caretakers, public health and law enforcement authorities \n     stymied in their efforts to get information.\n       Experts say many providers do not understand the law, have \n     not trained their staff members to apply it judiciously, or \n     are fearful of the threat of fines and jail terms--although \n     no penalty has been levied in four years.\n       Some reports blame the language of the law itself, which \n     says health care providers may share information with others \n     unless the patient objects, but does not require them to do \n     so. Thus, disclosures are voluntary and health care providers \n     are left with broad discretion.\n       The unnecessary secrecy is a ``significant problem,'' said \n     Mark Rothstein, chairman of a privacy subcommittee that \n     advises the Department of Health and Human Services, which \n     administers Hipaa. ``It's drummed into them that there are \n     rules they have to follow without any perspective,'' he said \n     about health care providers. ``So, surprise, surprise, they \n     approach it in a defensive, somewhat arbitrary and \n     unreasonable way.''\n       Susan McAndrew, deputy director of health information \n     privacy at the Department of Health and Human Services, said \n     that problems were less frequent than they once had been but \n     that health care providers continued to hide behind the law. \n     ``Either innocently or purposefully, entities often use this \n     as an excuse,'' she said. ``They say `Hipaa made me do it' \n     when, in fact, they chose for other reasons not to make \n     the permitted disclosures.''\n       Mr. Rothstein, one of Hipaa's harshest critics, has led \n     years of hearings across the country. Transcripts of those \n     hearings, and accounts from hospital administrators, patient \n     advocates, lawyers, family members, and law enforcement \n     officials offer an anthology of Hipaa misinterpretations, \n     some alarming, some annoying:\n       Birthday parties in nursing homes in New York and Arizona \n     have been canceled for fear that revealing a resident's date \n     of birth could be a violation.\n       Patients were assigned code names in doctor's waiting \n     rooms--say, ``Zebra'' for a child in Newton, Mass., or \n     ``Elvis'' for an adult in Kansas City, Mo.--so they could be \n     summoned without identification.\n       Nurses in an emergency room at St. Elizabeth Health Center \n     in Youngstown, Ohio, refused to telephone parents of ailing \n     students themselves, insisting a friend do it, for fear of \n     passing out confidential information, the hospital's patient \n     advocate said.\n       State health departments throughout the country have been \n     slowed in their efforts to create immunization registries for \n     children, according to Dr. James J. Gibson, the director of \n     disease control in South Carolina, because information from \n     doctors no longer flows freely.\n       Teaching staff to protect records is easier than teaching \n     them to share them, said Robert N. Swidler, general counsel \n     for Northeast Health, a nonprofit network in Troy, N.Y., that \n     includes several hospitals.\n       ``Over time, the staff has become a little more flexible \n     and humane,'' Mr. Swidler said. ``But nurses aren't lawyers. \n     This is a hyper-technical law and it tells them they may \n     disclose but doesn't say they have to.''\n       Many experts, including critics like Mr. Rothstein and \n     proponents like Ms. McAndrew, distinguish different \n     categories of secrecy.\n       There are ``good faith nondisclosures,'' as when a floor \n     nurse takes a phone call from someone claiming to be a family \n     member but cannot verify that person's identity. Then there \n     are ``bad faith nondisclosures,'' like using Hipaa as an \n     excuse for not taking the time to gather records that public \n     health officials need to help child abuse investigators \n     trying to build a case.\n       Most common are seat-of-the-pants decisions made by \n     employees who feel safer saying ``no'' than ``yes'' in the \n     face of ambiguity.\n       That seemed to be what happened to his own mother, Mr. \n     Rothstein said, when she called her doctor's office to \n     discuss a problem. She was told by the receptionist that the \n     doctor was not available, Mr. Rothstein said, and then \n     inquired if the doctor was with a patient or out of the \n     office. ``I can't tell you because of Hipaa,'' came the \n     reply. In fact the doctor was home sick, which would have \n     been helpful information in deciding whether to wait for a \n     call back or head for the emergency room.\n       The law, medical professionals and privacy experts said, \n     has had the positive effect of making confidentiality a \n     priority as the nation moves toward fully computerized, \n     cradle-to-grave medical records.\n       But safeguarding electronic privacy required a tangle of \n     regulations issued in 2003, followed last year by 101 pages \n     of ``administrative simplification.''\n       Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a \n     sponsor of the original insurance portability law, was \n     dismayed by the ``bizarre hodgepodge'' of regulations layered \n     onto it, several staff members said, and by the department's \n     failure to provide ``adequate guidance on what is and is not \n     barred by the law.'' To that end, Mr. Kennedy, along with \n     Senator Patrick M. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, plans to \n     introduce legislation creating an office within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services dedicated to \n     interpreting and enforcing medical privacy.\n       ``In this electronic era it is essential to safeguard the \n     privacy of medical records while insuring our privacy laws do \n     not stifle the flow of information fundamental to effective \n     health care,'' Mr. Kennedy said.\n       This spring, the department revised its Web site, \n     www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa, in the interest of clarity. But Hipaa \n     continues to baffle even the experts.\n       Ms. McAndrew explained some of the do's and don'ts of \n     sharing information in a telephone interview:\n       Medical professionals can talk freely to family and \n     friends, unless the patient objects. No signed authorization \n     is necessary and the person receiving the information need \n     not have the legal standing of, say, a health care proxy or \n     power of attorney. As for public health authorities or those \n     investigating crimes like child abuse, Hipaa defers to state \n     laws, which often, though not always, require such \n     disclosure. Medical workers may not reveal confidential \n     information about a patient or case to reporters, but they \n     can discuss general health issues.\n       Ms. McAndrew said there was no way to know how often \n     information was withheld. Of the 27,778 privacy complaints \n     filed since 2003, the only cases investigated, she said, were \n     complaints filed by patients who were denied access to their \n     own information, the one unambiguous violation of the law.\n       Complaints not investigated include the plights of adult \n     children looking after their parents from afar. Experts say \n     family members frequently hear, ``I can't tell you that \n     because of Hipaa,'' when they call to check on the patient's \n     condition.\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\n       That is what happened to Nancy Banks, who drove from \n     Bartlesville, Okla., to her mother's bedside at Town and \n     Country Hospital in Tampa, Fla., last week because Ms. Banks \n     could not find out what she needed to know over the \n     telephone.\n       Her 82-year-old mother had had a stroke. When Ms. Banks \n     called her room she heard her mother ``screaming and yelling \n     and crying,'' but conversation was impossible. So Ms. Banks \n     tried the nursing station.\n       Whoever answered the phone was not helpful, so Ms. Banks \n     hit the road. Twenty-two hours later, she arrived at the \n     hospital.\n       But more of the same awaited her. She said her mother's \n     nurse told her that ``because of the Hipaa laws I can get in \n     trouble if I tell you anything.''\n       In the morning, she could speak to the doctor, she was \n     told.\n       The next day, Ms. Banks was finally informed that her \n     mother had had heart failure and that her kidneys were \n     shutting down.\n       ``I understand privacy laws, but this has gone too far,'' \n     Ms. Banks said. ``I'm her daughter. This isn't right.''\n       A hospital spokeswoman, Elena Mesa, was asked if nurses \n     were following Hipaa protocol when they denied adult children \n     information about their parents.\n       She could not answer the question, Ms. Mesa said, because \n     Hipaa prevented her from such discussions with the press.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my friend and \ncolleague Senator Leahy in introducing the Protection of Health \nInformation Privacy and Security Act of 2006. Protecting the privacy of \npatients' health information is a major priority in health reform, and \nI look forward to the enactment of this legislation to do so.\n  In 1996, the Senate enacted HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act, which I introduced with Senator Kassebaum. That \nlaw gave Americans the ability to continue their health insurance when \nthey changed jobs. It has become clear, however, that the privacy rules \nunder the act have not succeeded in protecting patients adequately.\n  Since HIPAA became law, numerous privacy bills to protect personal \nhealth information have been introduced in Congress, but none of them \nhas been enacted.\n  In fact, the HIPAA law required the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop privacy regulations if Congress failed to enact \nprivacy rules by August 1999. When Congress did not act, the Department \nof Health and Human Services prescribed privacy rules, but its \nauthority to do so under HIPAA was limited to regulating only the \nprivacy-related activities of three specific ``covered entities,'' \nhealth care providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Other entities, such \nas schools, employers, and health agencies, can be regulated only \nindirectly, as business associates of covered entities, even though \nmany of them also possess confidential health data.\n  This indirect oversight has made it very difficult to enforce \nimplementation of the Department's safeguards for entities other than \nthe three specifically listed in the HIPAA privacy rule. The result is \nthat Americans continue to be at risk of having their personal medical \nrecords and other confidential health information wrongly distributed \nand exposed without their authorization, and often even without their \nknowledge.\n  One common problem involves domestic and offshore outsourcing. HIPAA-\ncovered entities and business associates can hire outside companies, \neither in the U.S. or in other countries, to do work for them. The \ntasks of those outside companies may require them to obtain personal \nhealth information. There is widespread concern, however, that once \nthis private information leaves the original holder, the legitimacy of \nany subsequent disclosure of it becomes much more difficult to enforce.\n  Obviously, we need to revise our approach to health information \nprivacy in order to protect the rights of those who rely on their \ndoctors and their Government to safeguard their private information.\n  The pending health information technology bill, S. 1693, was the \nsubject of much discussion on this issue. Some feel that the bill \nshould include more extensive privacy regulations than it does. But \nthat measure is not the best vehicle to restructure health-information \nprivacy. Attempting to rewrite privacy rules through health IT \nlegislation would be a piecemeal approach to correcting the \nshortcomings of privacy protections. The Health Information Privacy and \nSecurity Act presents an opportunity to make comprehensive improvements \nto health privacy protections. Addressing health information privacy \nthrough this legislation will ensure the security of patients' \ninformation, in any form, electronic or otherwise.\n  The bill that Senator Leahy and I are introducing today corrects the \nlongstanding errors in the ways in which confidential patient \ninformation is handled and distributed. We live in a time when \nAmericans are increasingly aware of breaches of their privacy. It is \nessential for us to enact effective reforms to protect all Americans \nfrom further infringements on their health privacy.\n  The system now in place allows much of importance to fall through the \ncracks. Enforcement has been inadequate. The Office for Civil Rights of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for \nthe enforcement of HIPAA, has received more than 20,000 complaints, but \nit has not imposed any civil penalties in response. The Department of \nJustice has effectively prosecuted only four criminal violations of \nHIPAA.\n  A few examples illustrate the problem. In June 2006, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid reported that the health information of 17,000 \nAmericans whose insurance plans are provided by Humana, Inc. was at \nrisk because of unsecured computer data. Last September, the Government \nAccountability Office urged Medicare to implement stronger oversight \nover the transmission of private health records. A GAO survey had found \nthat almost half of all responding Medicare Advantage contractors \nadmitted to recent breaches of privacy of health records. In addition, \nthe number of health plan providers that identified themselves as \n``mostly compliant'' with HIPAA's privacy regulations decreased from 91 \npercent in 2005 to 85 percent in 2006. These findings demonstrate that \npatients' right to know and authorize who views their medical \ninformation is being neglected.\n  Americans live in a democracy where they believe, rightly, that they \nthemselves should have the power to decide when, and to whom, their \nhealth information is disclosed. The bill we are introducing today will \nbetter enable Federal privacy rules to fulfill that expectation.\n  This bill complements and strengthens Federal privacy regulations by \nadding more effective oversight and individuals' access to their own \npersonal information. It requires the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to revise the HIPAA Privacy Rule to make it \nconsistent with this act.\n  The bill gives each American the full ability to obtain and modify \nany of their health records, whether the records are carried by one of \nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule's three ``covered entities'' or by any other \nentity. Except in rare cases, authorization by an individual is \nrequired before any other person or entity can disclose, obtain, or use \nthat individual's protected health information.\n  The bill also addresses the existing outsourcing problem by improving \ntransparency. Any entity that entrusts outside agents or overseas \nproviders with personal health information must publish their names and \nensure that they abide by the required privacy and security measures.\n  The act requires all entities that deal with protected health \ninformation in any way to implement safeguards to protect that \ninformation. Such entities must also maintain safeguards that are up-\nto-date with current technology.\n  Any entity that possesses or obtains an individual's protected health \ninformation is required to give that individual a notice of privacy \nrights and practices, including the individual's right to be alerted if \na security breach concerning the information occurs. Individuals are \nalso promised a clear description of who will have access to their \npersonal health information and how the information will be used. In \nthis way, people will always be aware of what is going on with their \nprivate information. They will feel more secure about it, and be more \nsecure.\n  The bill also establishes a demonstration grant program to help those \nwho have low health literacy or limited english-language proficiency to \nexercise their privacy rights and avoid cultural or linguistic \nbarriers.\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\n  This Act also creates a new office in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the Office of Health Information Privacy, which will \noversee investigations of alleged violations and verify compliance with \nthe act. This office will also be responsible for establishing and \nimplementing standards and product certifications for systems and \nnetworks that handle protected health information. Until now, many \nentities have been confused about how to implement health privacy \nregulations. This new office will help them understand Federal privacy \nrules, so that they can conduct their business accordingly.\n  Federal privacy regulations now in place also make it difficult to \nprosecute illegal activities. The Office of Health Information Privacy \nwill be charged with resolving this problem. It will do so in part by \ninstituting penalties for wrongful sharing or use of private health \ninformation by any entity.\n  Overall, a delicate balance must be struck. On one hand, we must \nallow the sharing of information necessary for effective health care. \nAt the same time, however, we must protect Americans' right to have \ntheir health records and individual health information kept private. \nFor too long, the balance has been tilted too far against patient \nprivacy, and our bill is a needed effort to correct that imbalance.\n  Americans deserve stronger guarantees of patient privacy, more \nhelpful guidelines for security implementation, and more dependable \nenforcement and penalties for the misuse of protected health \ninformation. I look forward to the early enactment of this legislation \nto achieve these important goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/17/senate-section/article/S9514-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 274--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n                  COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF LEWIS V.
