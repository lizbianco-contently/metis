Mr. President, nearly an entire year has passed since \nthe nonpartisan Director of National Intelligence, ADM Mike McConnell, \nwarned Congress that America's electronic surveillance law was \ndangerously out of date and in critical need of repair. The old law was \ncausing us to miss substantial amounts of intelligence on terrorist \nsuspects overseas, and it needed to be fixed.\n  Yet nearly a year later the problem has still not been resolved. For \nno good reason, the dangers posed by the old law remain. The Senate has \ndone its part to correct the problem. Last month, we passed a broadly \nbipartisan bill that fixed the outdated FISA law as well as the \ntemporary bill that replaced it in August.\n  The only thing now standing in the way of intelligence officials \nhaving all the tools they need to monitor terrorists is the House \nDemocratic leadership which is blocking the will of its own majority by \nrefusing to vote on the Senate-passed version of the bill.\n  The House leadership's actions are quite irresponsible. Worse, they \nare dangerous. When a temporary 6-month revision of the FISA bill \nexpired last month, House leaders said they needed 15 days to \ndeliberate over a new revision that included legal protections for \nphone companies that stepped forward after 9/11 to help in the hunt for \nterrorists.\n  When those 15 days were up, House Democrats said they needed 3 more \nweeks. Then they left town for a vacation without acting, despite the \nurgent pleas of the Director of National Intelligence not to leave the \nbill undone.\n  Now, 3 weeks after House Democratic leaders said they needed 3 weeks \nto work out their concerns, they are ready to go on vacation without \nacting again, this time on a 2-week spring break. The patience of the \nAmerican people is wearing thin. It is long past time for the \nDemocratic leadership in the House to do its part.\n  They face a simple choice: Either take up the Senate-passed \nbipartisan bill that is guaranteed to pass their Chamber and be signed \ninto law or go on another vacation, leaving the intelligence agents \nwithout the tools they need and America more vulnerable to terrorist \nattack.\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n  Some cynics in the House think there is a third option: They want to \npass a new bill that sounds acceptable but which they know would not be \nsigned into law. This is a distinction without a difference. Passing a \nbill that will not become law is no better than passing no bill at all.\n  Some news reports, quoting senior Democratic aides, have suggested \nthat a stalemate on the surveillance issue is helpful to both sides \npolitically. This should offend anyone who takes America's security \nseriously. And it is refuted by the 68 Members of the Senate, \nDemocratic and Republican, who voted last month to put the \nrecommendation of the Director of National Intelligence into law.\n  The Senate's solid bipartisan action followed months of hard work \nbetween the two parties on the bill that met three basic criteria: It \nallowed intelligence professionals to gather information from \nterrorists overseas, it protected companies that stepped forward in a \ntime of urgent national need to cooperate in the hunt for terrorists, \nand it was guaranteed to be signed into law by the President.\n  If the House Democratic leadership acts responsibly, it will follow \nthe same three criteria by sending a good bill to the White House \nbefore the end of next week. The most efficient path to success is to \ntake up the Senate-passed bill which a majority of House Members, we \nalready know, support.\n  The time for action has long since passed. Democrats have had nearly \na year to address this problem. Again and again they have asked for \nextensions, then failed to act once the deadline ran out. They are akin \nto students who continually put off their homework then ask the teacher \nfor more time, hoping the final deadline will never come.\n  The acts of the House Democratic leadership make their purpose \nabundantly clear. If they had their way, an improved surveillance law \nwould never pass in the only manner that is acceptable to the Director \nof National Intelligence.\n  It is not too late for the House to do the right thing. They have a \nfull legislative week ahead to allow a simple up-or-down vote on the \nSenate bill. Our forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will not be \nleaving their units for spring break. The House should not recess for \ntheirs until they have voted on the Senate's bipartisan FISA reform \nlegislation; to do anything less would be grossly irresponsible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1720-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant George S. Rentschler\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a soldier from \nKentucky who was taken from his family, his friends, and his country \nmuch too soon. On April 7, 2004, SSG George S. Rentschler of \nLouisville, in my home State of Kentucky, was on a combat patrol in \nBaghdad when his vehicle was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. He \nwas 31 years old.\n  For the bravery Staff Sergeant Rentschler showed in uniform, he \nreceived numerous medals, awards and decorations, including the Army \nAchievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Purple Heart, and \nthe Bronze Star Medal.\n  Staff Sergeant Rentschler's loved ones will remember him as the \nfinest coach, the fastest friend, and the most caring husband and son \nthey ever knew. He loved to make people laugh. And he was, as his young \nson, Scott, succinctly puts it, the greatest dad you could have ever \nasked for.\n  An Army veteran of 10 years, Staff Sergeant Rentschler was raised in \nLouisville. As a kid he loved to play many sports, especially baseball \nand football. He enjoyed watching sports as well, particularly the \nUniversity of Louisville, and he enjoyed the Kentucky Derby as well.\n  Following in his father Gilbert's footsteps, George was also an avid \nDetroit Lions fan. George's love of sports went beyond watching or \nplaying, he was invested and actively encouraging others as a coach. \n``He coached his kids like crazy,'' says George's mother, Lillian.\n  George got involved with many youth leagues, coaching baseball and \nfootball. He even coached a baseball team while stationed at Fort Knox. \nMany of those boys came to pay their respects at George's funeral, \nwearing their baseball caps in honor of their coach who taught lessons \nboth on and off the field.\n  George went to Southern Middle School and Central High School and \ngraduated from Louisville Male High School. After high school George \njoined the Army. He served as a training officer at Fort Knox where he \nattended a noncommissioned officer's academy. He also saw duty at Ft. \nHood, Texas; Bosnia; and was stationed in Germany.\n  George's mother, Lillian, says he especially enjoyed his involvement \nwith U.N. missions because he liked going to other countries. ``There \nwasn't any talking him out of it because he loved doing what he was \ndoing,'' said Lillian. ``He loved his country.''\n  By the time he was deployed to Iraq, George was assigned to the \nArmy's 1st Battalion, 35th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored \nDivision, based out of Baumholder, Germany.\n  Before shipping overseas, George was lucky enough to meet Rachel, who \nwould become his wife. They met in a club in Louisville. Rachel noticed \nGeorge because she thought he had the best manners of anyone there. She \nwas so impressed, she got up and introduced herself.\n  George and Rachel married on September 11, 1998. Over their entire \nmarriage, she cannot remember him ever being in a bad mood. George and \nRachel raised two handsome sons, Scott and Brock. While George was \ndeployed to Iraq, Rachel and the boys lived in Germany.\n  Family time was important to George, and whether it was an elaborate \nfamily vacation or a casual trip to a University of Louisville ball \ngame, he always made time for Rachel, Scott, and Brock.\n  In George's many coaching endeavors, Rachel often wound up playing \nthe ``team mom.'' George told his family often how proud he was to \nserve in the military and that he loved the camaraderie of his fellow \nsoldiers. He earned their respect by volunteering for the tough jobs.\n  George's love of coaching, of bringing out the best in others, \ncarried over to his soldiering career. He talked about one day working \nin the Pentagon, to train and educate younger soldiers. And he was \nlooking forward to making coaching his profession after leaving active \nservice.\n  My prayers are with the Rentschler family today after their tragic \nloss. We are thinking of George's wife Rachel; his sons, Scott and \nBrock; his mother Lillian; and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  George was predeceased by his father Gilbert. Staff Sergeant \nRentschler's funeral service was held at the Carlisle Avenue Baptist \nChurch in Louisville, and he was buried in Sturgis, KY. At the funeral \nservice for her husband, Rachel said of George: ``He died doing what he \nloved.''\n  I want her and the Rentschler family to know George also died a hero, \nand this Senate honors SSG George S. Rentschler for his life of \nservice. And we honor the immense sacrifice he made on behalf of a \ngrateful nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1720-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the course of this past week, I have \ncome to the Senate floor every single\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\nday to sound an alarm about the misguided and potentially dangerous \ndecision to outsource a major piece of our aerospace industry to \nEurope.\n  I have talked about the dismay Boeing workers felt in my home State \nof Washington when they learned the Pentagon had decided to award a \ncontract to build the next generation of aerial refueling tankers not \nto Boeing but to a French company, Airbus.\n  I have talked about my shock that we would award Airbus this \ncontract, given the EU's lengthy history of subsidizing these planes in \norder to create European, not American, jobs.\n  I have talked about the fact that Airbus is being less than open \nabout how many U.S. jobs it will really create in this country.\n  All of these are reasons to be deeply troubled about this decision. \nBut today I want to address yet another concern; that is, the ability \nto control our national security once we have effectively turned over \ncontrol of our military capability and technology to a foreign \ngovernment. This is an issue we all need to take a good hard look at.\n  America's global military strength is built on our ability to use \nmilitary might anywhere in the world, at a moment's notice. Our aerial \nrefueling tankers are the critical link that allows the U.S. Air Force \nto stretch across the globe. From Fairchild Air Force Base in my home \nState of Washington to the Far East, from Andrews to Baghdad, our \nbombers and our fighters can fly farther and faster because our \ntankers, which supply fuel in midair, are always there to support them.\n  Tankers, in fact, are so important to our military that Army GEN Hugh \nShelton, who is the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, once said the \nmotto of the tanker and airlift forces should be: ``Try fighting \nwithout us.''\n  Until now, the technology that powered these critical planes rested \nin the hands of Boeing and its American workforce, who have been \nbuilding them for more than 50 years now.\n  Until now, our tankers have been built by manufacturers, by \ndesigners, and by engineers who have been able to pass on those skills \nand technology that 50 years of experience brings, and who are bound by \nlaw from selling that technology to countries that sponsor \nterrorism. Well, last Friday, that ended. Last Friday, the Air Force \nmade a decision that will enable a company that is controlled by a \nforeign government to develop and share that technology. Are we going \nto look back on this decision and say this is the moment when we threw \nopen the doors to our military technology? Are we going to allow our \ntankers, a linchpin of our national defense, to be the first domino to \nfall?\n\n  I have said this before. With one contract, we could wipe out what it \nhas taken our Nation 50 years to build up: an experienced and \nexceptional aerospace industry. Once it is gone, we are not going to \nget it back. We will not get it back. Once we lose the ability to \nproduce military technology right here at home, we begin to lose \ncontrol over our Nation's defense.\n  This decision effectively gives foreign governments control over \naspects of our own national security. In this case, we are giving up \ncontrol and $40 billion to the European Aeronautical Defense and Space \nCompany called EADS. That is the company that has made no secret of \ntheir desire to dismantle our American aerospace industry. In fact, \nthis decision can be seen as a $40 billion investment in the military \nresearch budget of EADS and Airbus.\n  So we are allowing Airbus to take over a cornerstone of our military \ntechnology, and we are actually paying them to do it. While that \ncertainly doesn't make sense, the fact that this deal could allow \nAirbus to share American technology with whomever they please is just \nplain dangerous.\n  The Air Force's decision means that American tanker technology, which \nhas been developed over the last 50 years, is now out on the free \nmarket, available to the highest bidder. Under American law, the law \nthat Boeing has to abide by, they are prohibited from selling \ntechnology to countries that sponsor terrorism. In other words, we have \ncontrol. We have control over where that technology goes right now. But \nEADS and Airbus don't have to follow those same restrictions. They have \nsaid so in the past, and they have demonstrated that they don't care \nabout giving technology to terrorists. They only care about their \nbottom line.\n  In fact, back in 2005, EADS was caught trying to sell military \nhelicopters to Iran. But if the company is so pro-American, as they are \nsaying right now, why was it ignoring U.S. policy to isolate Iran? \nWell, the answer to that question was simple to EADS Representative \nMichel Tripier. When he was asked about this back in 2005, his response \nwas:\n\n       As a European company, we are not supposed to take into \n     account embargoes from the U.S.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Here is what he said:\n\n       As a European company, we are not supposed to take into \n     account embargoes from the U.S.\n\n  In 2006, EADS, the parent company of Airbus, proved they meant it \nwhen they tried to sell transport and patrol planes to Venezuela. That \nis a circumvention of U.S. law.\n  What if in the years to come Airbus wants to sell their tanker \ntechnology to Pakistan, to China, or to Iran? I wish to remind my \ncolleagues that Russia now owns 5 percent of EADS, and it is pushing \nfor 10 percent more. The United Arab Emirates now controls 7.5 percent \nof EADS.\n  What the Air Force has done is extremely shortsighted. They have said \nit wasn't their responsibility to take our security or our industry \ninto account. Well, I say to my colleagues: Then Congress has to. \nCongress has to. We need to be more forward-looking than the Air Force \nwas last Friday.\n  What happens in 20 years if EADS is controlled by countries that \ndisagree with our policy on, say, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle \nEast or around the globe? What if they decide to slow down production \nof tankers, to put us at a strategic disadvantage? Right now, we have \nno way to prevent that.\n  Where do we go from here? What other aspect of our military \ntechnology are we Americans willing to part with? Our aerial tankers \nare the backbone of our military strength. But what about our other \ncritical military supplies? Are we going to outsource our tanks? Are we \ngoing to outsource our military satellites? What about the missiles \nthat are currently made in Alabama? Are we going to outsource those? \nWhat about the equipment that has to be delivered constantly to our \ntroops in the field? Are we going to outsource our meals ready to eat, \nour ammunition? I would not support that, and I know many of my \ncolleagues wouldn't either.\n  So I am here to ask all of us: Where do we draw the line? The Air \nForce said it wasn't their job to consider the future of our national \nsecurity and defense, but we as Senators have taken an oath to do that.\n  I urge all my colleagues to take pause and truly think about the \nconsequences of this shortsighted contract. The American people and our \nnational security are depending on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 2734 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, our Republican friends are at it again--\noffering simplistic and unworkable proposals in response to complex \nimmigration issues. Our immigration policies should not only be about \nsecurity and our economy, but they should reflect our humanity, \ndecency, and morality. We are a Nation of immigrants. Immigrants are \ndevoted to hard work, their families, their faith, and to America.\n  Mr. President, 70,000 immigrants served honorably in our Armed \nForces, and many have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those \nare the values that have built America and we should welcome them.\n  But you would never know it from the misplaced immigration priorities \nof my Republican colleagues. Rather than tackle the Nation's \npriorities, they continue to cater to the basest instincts of the far \nright fringe. For 7 years, Republicans have failed to fix\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\nthe broken immigration system, offering only divisive measures and \nempty rhetoric that subvert our values as a Nation of immigrants, \nundermine our national security, and leave American jobs unprotected.\n  It is time to get real. Approximately 12 million people are living in \nour country outside the system. That is more than the population of New \nYork City. Illegal immigrants are here because there are jobs, and \nthere are jobs because employers know they can get away with breaking \nthe law and abusing illegal workers. The past 7 years should have \ntaught the Republicans that deportation alone doesn't work.\n  Don't the Republicans get it? Deportation-only policies have failed \nspectacularly. Existing control efforts are unacceptably costly. We now \nspend over $10 billion on border and interior enforcement, and the \nsystem is more dysfunctional and lawless than ever.\n  These expenditures barely scratch the surface of the true costs \nenacted by our current policies. Heavy-handed enforcement hurts U.S. \ncitizens living in the border region. These communities bear the brunt \nof environmental degradation, noise and light pollution and surging \nborder-area violence. In spite of these escalating costs, illegal \nimmigration continues unchecked.\n  Even when Republicans are given the tools, they don't use them. Last \nyear, the Bush administration prosecuted only four employers for hiring \nillegal immigrants. It is time to stop coddling employers who break our \nlaws and undercut American workers. It is time to force bad actor \nemployers to respect our immigration and labor laws, to provide fair \nwages, to offer decent working conditions, to value the rights and \ncontributions of the workers they employ, including American workers. \nAnd it is time to punish those employers who don't.\n  Let it be known the Republican agenda isn't based on real solutions. \nInstead, they have been cynically using the immigration problem to stir \nup local resentment and fear. They have vilified and attacked \nimmigrants, especially Latinos. First, they proposed to criminalize \npriests and those who help immigrants. Remember the bill that passed \nthe House of Representatives under the Republican leadership that said \nyou have situations where we have several million children who are \nAmerican citizens; they have mothers who may be undocumented. Under \ntheir law, the mothers had to be deported. If a mother went and talked \nto a priest and asked: Where is my responsibility, to comply with the \nlaw or look after my child, if that priest were to suggest that her \nfirst responsibility was to look after that child, under the Republican \nlaw, that priest could have been indicted as an accessory after the \nfact. That was Cardinal Mahoney, the great cardinal from Los Angeles, \nwho spoke out on this issue with such credibility and outrage. Then \nthey opposed comprehensive immigration reform that we had on the floor \nof the Senate. Two-thirds of the Democrats said yes; two-thirds of the \nRepublicans said no. Now we have their proposal as introduced this \nweek.\n  What do the Republicans have against immigrants?\n  When immigrants are abused, all Americans suffer. Employers can get \naway with depressing our wages, neglecting working conditions for all \nworkers, immigrants, and citizens.\n  This isn't leadership and, sadly, it is not new. It is a continuation \nof a decades-old Republican strategy to scapegoat and marginalize \nvulnerable minority communities, to fan the flames of fear and divert \nattention away from their own inaction and failures.\n  The Republican leadership may not get it, but the American public \ndoes. Americans understand that reforming our immigration system is a \ncomplex challenge and requires a tough, fair and, above all, realistic \nsolution. They know it is time for change and time to find a way \nforward.\n  We need to require the 12 million undocumented immigrants in this \ncountry to register with the Government and get legal. This includes \npayment of appropriate fees and fines, submitting to extensive security \nand background checks, learning English, and paying any U.S. taxes they \nowe. We need to deport those who have committed serious crimes or \nrepresent a threat to our national security; to implement border \ncontrol that is well resourced, utilizes modern technology and is \neffective and humane at the same time; target and punish employers who \nflaunt the law by hiring those who are not authorized to work; assist \nStates and local communities that are affected by high rates of \nimmigration by helping to defray health, education, and criminal costs; \nand ensure that American workers are helped, not harmed, by U.S. \nimmigration policy.\n\n  Instead of embracing these goals, the Republicans want to deny local \ncommunities funding for community policing because such communities \nrecognize that earning the trust of immigrant communities helps to \ncombat crime. They would condemn victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence to a life of abuse, unable to come forward to report such \ncrimes.\n  They want to force all American workers to prove their eligibility to \nwork based on a database that is so flawed it will result in the denial \nof employment to millions of authorized workers, including American \nworkers and American citizens. This in a time when workers are \nstruggling to put food on the table, pay their bills, and hold onto \ntheir homes.\n  They want to subsidize sweetheart Government contracts with \ntaxpayers' money to build exorbitantly expensive fences that have shown \nlittle promise in stopping illegal immigration, and they want to take \nproperty away from American landowners to build these fences. These \nideas don't just hurt immigrants, they hurt Americans.\n  Senate Democrats have led an effort to fix our broken immigration \nsystem not once but twice. That legislation was pragmatic, recognizing \nit is impractical to deport 12 million illegal immigrants. That \nlegislation recognized the Government must seize control of our \nimmigration system and implement border enforcement that is both \neffective and humane, while aggressively going after and penalizing \nemployers that knowingly break the law and profit off illegal \nimmigrants. It also included a roadmap for future orderly immigration \nthat would uphold American values, support the American economy, and \nensure that immigration, first and foremost, serves the interests of \nAmericans.\n  The majority of Republicans turned their backs on workable solutions. \nThey chose instead to grandstand the issue and push a delusional \n``round 'em up and kick 'em out'' agenda. And here they are again in \nthis new political season playing the same old tired tune. This country \ndeserves better.\n  I challenge my Republican colleagues to demonstrate the courage and \nfortitude it will take to pass legislation that is tough, effective, \nworkable, and gives the American public what it deserves: an \nimmigration system that serves the economic, social, and security needs \nof 21st century America. Anything less is a disgraceful insult to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1722-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1722-S1724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CREDIT MARKET AND STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to discuss a \ngrowing problem for students and families struggling to pay for \ncollege.\n  Americans are anxious about their economic futures. They are seeing \nvolatile markets, disappearing jobs, home foreclosures, rising debt, \nand declining benefits. Now the crisis in the credit market, stemming \nfrom irresponsible lending practices in the mortgage industry, may \nimpact their ability to secure student loans at fair rates so their \nchildren can go to the college of their choice.\n  We all know that student loans are critical for millions of students \nand parents trying to pay for college. In the last 20 years, as the \ncost of college has tripled, more and more students are relying on \nstudents loans to afford a college education.\n  In 1993, less than half of all graduates had to take out loans, but \nin 2004, nearly two-thirds had to take out loans to finance their \neducation.\n  This chart shows how more students must take out loans to finance \ntheir education. In 1993, if you look at the students taking out loans, \nand then here in 2004, you can see that as the cost of college has \nrisen and grant aid has not kept pace, more and more students have to \nturn to loans. This difference has made students borrowing in the \nprivate sector--in many instances at exorbitant rates. It is this area, \nin\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\nthe private sector, that is at risk. The federal student loan system is \nnot affected in the same way. I will say more about that in my remarks.\n  Last year, we passed legislation that increased grant aid and ensured \nthat Federal loans were cheaper for students by cutting interest rates. \nWe also ensured that no graduate would have to pay more than 15 percent \nof their income in monthly loan payments and that those who enter \npublic service will have their loans forgiven. But these benefits will \nbe meaningless if these students cannot access the loans they need to \nbe able to afford the college of their choice.\n  In recent weeks, the credit market crisis has made it more difficult \nfor student lenders to secure capital. This has increased the cost of \nlending, causing some lenders to pull out of the student loan market \nand causing those operating outside the Federal loan program to cut \nback on lending to high-risk borrowers.\n  Due to the attractiveness of the Federal guarantee in the federally \nsubsidized program--so far--other lenders are stepping up to fill in \nthe gaps in that program. And the interest rates in that program are \ncapped so students are protected from inflated interest payments.\n\n  But students who need to go beyond the Federal loan program will have \na tougher time finding lenders, and their rates will go up in the fall. \nSchools are beginning to sound alarm bells and telling students to get \ntheir loans now because they may be less available in the fall.\n  We must take action to ensure that students have the resources they \nneed to attend college. We must ensure that the backstops built into \nthe Federal loan program, designed to protect students and parents from \nthe kind of credit market disruptions we are seeing today, are ready to \nbe implemented.\n  One of those backstops is the Direct Loan Program. It allows students \nand parents to borrow directly from the Federal Government without \ngoing through a bank. The Secretary of Education uses funds from the \nU.S. Treasury to make the loans. This program does not rely on capital \nfrom the private financial markets, so it is completely insulated from \nthe disruptions the market is experiencing today.\n  Current law allows the Secretary to advance capital to designated \nLenders-of-Last-Resort so they can step in if students are having \ntrouble finding loans through other banks.\n  These programs are already in the law. And nearly 2,000 colleges are \nalready either using or signed up to use the Direct Loan Program. Last \nweek, I wrote to Secretary Spellings urging her to take any necessary \naction to ensure that schools that rely solely on private banks can \neasily access the Direct Loan Program and to ensure that procedures are \nin place to set up lenders of last resort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to Secretary Spellings at the end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we must also ensure that students who are \nborrowing outside the Federal loan program are protected. A good first \nstep is to make sure parents and students are aware of their options. \nAccording to the Department of Education, many students who turn to \nprivate loans--high-cost loans that are not subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment--are not taking advantage of the grant aid and low-interest \nloans that they are eligible for under Federal programs. This is \nunacceptable. We need to make sure college financial aid advisers are \ngiving students the information they need to maximize student aid and \nget the best deals on their loans.\n  We are currently in conference with the House on the Higher Education \nAct. That bill will ensure that we do just that. It will help students \nmake the most of the college aid they are eligible for by requiring \nlenders to disclose--on private loan applications and the documents \nthey sign before a loan is made--that students may be eligible for \ngrants from the Federal Government, their State, and their college, as \nwell as lower-cost loans from the federally subsidized program. We also \nrequire additional counseling by the financial aid experts for students \nregarding their student aid options.\n  For families who need additional loans beyond the Federal loans while \nthey are in school, we must ensure they can access loans at affordable \nrates in the private markets. We are working with our colleagues in the \nBanking Committee, led by the committee's chair, Senator Dodd, on this \nissue. I also plan to offer legislation that will expand the \neligibility for low-cost Government loans for these students.\n  In the coming weeks, the Committee I chair, which deals with \neducation issues, will convene hearings so we can hear directly from \nthose affected. We will also continue to monitor the Department of \nEducation's efforts to implement the existing safeguards in the Federal \nprograms.\n  In today's uncertain economy, Congress has an obligation to provide a \nsteady hand and to shore up programs on which Americans depend. Nothing \ncan be more important than ensuring that families can afford a college \ndegree.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Margaret Spellings,\n     Secretary of Education, U.S. Department of Education, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Spellings: As you know, the U.S. capital \n     market has been experiencing stress as a result of the sub-\n     prime mortgage crisis and investor uncertainty about the \n     condition of the economy. Recently, certain student loan \n     lenders have encountered difficulties in accessing the \n     capital market to finance their lending activity. While these \n     disruptions have had an impact on some lenders, they so far \n     have not negatively affected students' ability to access \n     federal loans. Some lenders have expressed concern about \n     their ability to continue to make loans through the Federal \n     Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), but others are \n     anticipating increasing their student loan business in \n     response to changes in the FFEL marketplace. As you know, \n     there are several tools already in statute that protect \n     against any unforeseen disruptions in the private capital \n     markets. We urge you to take any steps necessary to ensure \n     that these options are readily available so that recent \n     activity in the credit markets does not adversely affect \n     students' ability to secure federal student loans in a timely \n     manner\n       Since the capital market disruptions began, we have been \n     closely monitoring the situation and its potential impact on \n     the Federal student loan programs. We and our staffs have \n     held in-depth discussions, and will continue meeting with, \n     the many stakeholders involved in delivering Federal college \n     loans to students and families, including schools, lenders, \n     guaranty agencies, secondary markets, investment bankers, and \n     officials of various Federal agencies, including the \n     Departments of Education and Treasury. Through these \n     discussions we have gained a detailed understanding of how \n     the current difficulties in the credit markets might affect \n     some segments of the FFELP industry, especially those lenders \n     that have relied on the auction rate securities market.\n       While we are hopeful that overall credit market conditions \n     will soon improve, subsequently easing the constraints some \n     in the FFELP industry currently face, it is only prudent to \n     prepare now to ensure that these conditions do not negatively \n     impact students' ability to access Federal student loans. As \n     we have seen far too often, shocks in the credit and \n     financial markets come as a surprise, leaving those affected \n     little time to react.\n       Having plans in place and operational now will help ensure \n     that all stakeholders, including institutions and the federal \n     government, can respond to any potential loan access problems \n     with the least possible delay for students, families, and \n     schools. More importantly, such plans will provide students \n     and families with the assurance that they will continue to be \n     able to obtain Federal student loans to finance their \n     education.\n       The Department of Education needs to be prepared to use the \n     tools the Congress has provided to ensure that all eligible \n     students continue to have uninterrupted and timely access to \n     Federal student loans, in the unlikely event that stress in \n     the credit market leads a significant number of lenders to \n     substantially reduce their activity in FFELP.\n       First, the Department of Education should update plans to \n     implement a lender-of-last resort program in the instance \n     that there are widespread student loan access problems and \n     take all available steps to ensure these plans can become \n     operational quickly, if necessary. As you know, under \n     existing law FFELP guaranty agencies are obligated to serve \n     as lenders-of-last resort to avert any possible problem in \n     access to student loans, thereby providing a nationwide \n     network of backstop lenders. Further, you have the authority \n     to advance federal funds to guaranty agencies to provide them \n     with loan capital if needed. While such a program has not \n     been previously implemented for the FFELP, the Department had \n     established such a plan in 1998, when some FFELP lenders were \n     then indicating that they might withdraw from the guaranteed \n     loan program. Updating\n\n[[Page S1724]]\n\n     these plans now will help ensure that deploying such a \n     contingency can he done at the first sign of any problems \n     experienced by schools or borrowers in obtaining Federal \n     student loans from a FFELP lender.\n       Second, the Department of Education should take action to \n     ensure that the Direct Loan program is fully prepared to \n     respond to any unanticipated increase in demand for the \n     program. As you know, the Direct Loan program does not rely \n     on private lenders and therefore will not be affected by the \n     changes in the credit market. Based on our discussions with \n     Department officials, financial aid officials from schools \n     currently participating in the Direct Loan program, and \n     others, we are confident that the program could help \n     alleviate any potential problem that borrowers or schools may \n     face should FFELP lenders continue to face difficulties and \n     withdraw from the program. The Department needs to take steps \n     to ensure its plans to facilitate and expedite a school's \n     transition from the FFELP to the Direct Loan program on \n     either a temporary or permanent basis can be immediately \n     executed, should a school so desire. In addition, it is \n     important for the Department to ensure that adequate capacity \n     exists to absorb any increases in additional loan volume.\n       Finally, we understand that you will soon be corresponding \n     with colleges about the state of the Federal student loan \n     programs. We request that in such correspondence you make \n     readily available information on the option of participating \n     in the Direct Loan program and on lender of last resort \n     procedures.\n       We are encouraged that the Department has begun to examine \n     these options, but we look forward to hearing about further \n     contingency plans that would allow the Department to act \n     immediately to ensure all students and families continue to \n     have access to federal student loans in a timely manner.\n       We stand ready to provide you with any needed assistance \n     that you believe will be necessary in undertaking the two \n     important steps outlined above.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n     George Miller,\n       Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto call again upon our colleagues in this chamber to move forward with \na package that addresses housing challenges we face here in America \ntoday.\n  The dream of American home ownership is very much at risk today. We \nare seeing a housing crisis and a financial crisis here in America that \nis unparalleled in recent times. In fact, when you speak to the home \nmortgage industry as well as the homebuilders, as well as the \nhomeowners, they will all tell you we have not seen anything like this \nin America since the Great Depression. The statistics and the facts are \nthere to demonstrate this, as well as the reality of people who are \nlosing their homes, and more than even those who are losing their \nhomes, who have to go through the pain and heartache of losing their \nhomes because they cannot afford to pay the adjusted rate mortgages \nwhich are putting them in a position where they cannot afford to stay \nin their homes. It is also a pain that spreads across to all homeowners \nof America because when you have the kind of foreclosure situation in \nwhich we find ourselves in America today, that pain is one that is felt \nby all of those who are homeowners.\n  This chart is a chart that was prepared by Moody's, a group of \neconomists that came up essentially to give us the facts and the \nstatistics that demonstrate, without equivocation, that this is an \nunprecedented housing downturn we are seeing. This is a worse downturn \nthan anything we saw in the 1990s and the 1980s, and, in fact, their \nconclusion is that we have never seen such a downturn since the Great \nDepression.\n  I wish to point out two things on this chart. The first is that the \nhousing prices are projected to decline overall across the Nation by \nnearly 16 percent. We know that most Americans, most middle-class \nAmericans in this country who are in a home have most of their equity, \ntheir value in life, tied up in their home. So when you have a decline \nin their home values by 16 percent, you are impacting the American \nhomeowners in a very significant way. That is why, when we talk about \nthe foreclosure crisis which is facing America, it is not about those \nwho are on the verge of losing their homes; it is about all American \nhomeowners because of the kind of price decline we are seeing in values \nin homes all across America.\n  A 16-percent decline in home values, I would suspect, is something \nthat is of grave concern to most Americans. I would think this Chamber, \nas well as our colleagues in the House of Representatives, as well as \nthe White House, should be saying that as part of an economic stimulus \npackage, we ought to pivot over to the housing issues that face America \nand do something to restore confidence in the housing markets of \nAmerica.\n  Another indicator from Moody's, as you see in this chart, is with \nrespect to housing starts. You look at the trough in housing starts in \nthe 1980s, where housing starts declined to about 58 percent. Well, the \neconomists are telling us now that given the high rates of foreclosure, \nwhat is happening is there is no end in sight. This red line has no end \nin sight, where you have a 60-percent decline in housing starts. We do \nnot know how far that is going to go. When you have that kind of \ndecline in housing starts, you are going to be affecting several \nhundred thousand Americans who are in the job market as part of the \nhousing industry.\n  So these statistics, which are national statistics out of Moody's, \nshould be telling us all that we should be doing something about the \nhousing crisis here in America.\n  I am certain the Presiding Officer from Ohio can paint a similar \npicture about the housing problems in Ohio because there is a problem \nin the Presiding Officer's State as well as Florida and Nevada and \nCalifornia and many other States around the country.\n  When I look at what the housing crisis means for the 5 million people \nin Colorado, it tells me we have a severe problem in my State as well. \nToday in Colorado, 1 out of every 376 homes is in foreclosure. That is \nthe highest rate of foreclosure we have seen in the history of the \nState. It is unprecedented. We are not yet at the point where we have \nhit bottom.\n  If you look at foreclosures that are expected to occur between 2008 \nand 2009 in Colorado, projections are that nearly 50,000 homes--\n49,923--will go into foreclosure. For a State with 5 million people, \nthat is a significant number. What will that mean in terms of the \nimpact on other homeowners around the State? About 748,000 homes are \ngoing to suffer a significant decline in value. That is about half of \nall the homes in the State of Colorado.\n  When Majority Leader Reid, now more than a week ago, came to the \nChamber and said what we ought to do is pivot off of the economic \nstimulus package, which we worked out with the President, and move \nforward to address some other ailments in the economy--and he said the \nfirst of those ailments is the housing crisis--he was right. This \nChamber should have moved forward and started to address the housing \ncrisis. Instead, we ended up in 1 of the now 73 filibusters we have had \nto address.\n  I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democratic, come back and say: \nNo, this is too serious an issue. It is something we have to address \nwith the 2008 Foreclosure Prevention Act which Majority Leader Reid had \nfiled at the desk and, with amendments, we can try to make sure we have \nan effective remedy for this ailment we are facing in America today.\n  When you pick up the newspapers of today, they show this is a problem \nthat continues to be at the highest level of attention for our people. \nUSA Today, in its headline, talks about how home equity is below the \n50-percent level. That is a figure that came out of the Federal Reserve \nBoard yesterday. It is the lowest home equity level since 1945. To me \nthat is another clarion call for this Congress to do something about \nthe housing issue.\n  Pick up the Wall Street Journal from today. It reads: ``Housing and \nBank\n\n[[Page S1725]]\n\nTroubles Deepen.'' The statistics are all there. We know we have a huge \nproblem on our hands in terms of this pillar of the economy ailing. We \nalso know this is causing pain to American homeowners, and the dream of \nAmerican home ownership is in jeopardy today.\n  I call on my colleagues in the Senate to move forward and address \nthis issue in a robust way. I am hopeful in succeeding weeks we are \nable to put together a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who say \nthat this housing crisis must be addressed now for the sake of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has now been 20 days since the law that \nallows us to collect foreign intelligence abroad has lapsed. We are \nwithout the authority we need to collect intelligence against our \nterrorist enemy. The law expired February 16. The Senate passed a bill, \na bipartisan bill, with 68 Senators voting yes, Democrats and \nRepublicans. It was fashioned by the Intelligence Committee which \npassed it 13 to 2, a wide bipartisan margin, clearly a consensus that \nthe United States must have authority for intelligence collection \nagainst our terrorist enemies. We passed that bill, sent it to the \nHouse of Representatives hoping that the House would act quickly, send \nit to the President for signature so we could get on with this \nimportant aspect of the war against terror. So far the House of \nRepresentatives leadership has not brought the bill to the floor of the \nHouse; this notwithstanding the fact that it clearly would pass. We \nknow, because of letters Members of the House of Representatives have \nwritten to their leadership, that Democrats and Republicans together \nhave more than enough votes to pass this legislation we in the Senate \npassed. Yet the House leadership sits on its hands.\n  Three weeks ago the House leadership said it needed 3 weeks to get \nthe job done. That 3 weeks expires Sunday. But the House is not even in \nsession now. So today I rise to urge our House colleagues and \nespecially the House leadership to step to the plate and pass this \nforeign intelligence surveillance act reauthorization to enable us to \ncollect intelligence.\n  I am going to, at the conclusion of my remarks, ask unanimous consent \nto put a variety of things in the Record. But I am going to refer to \nthem now and talk a little bit about why this is so important.\n  Let's start by stating the premise on which I think we all agree. \nThis is something that does not divide Democrats and Republicans. We \nhave some divisions about the war against terror. We have some \ndivisions about the war in Iraq. But all of us understand, first and \nforemost, you defeat terrorists with good intelligence. You find out \nwhat they are up to, and you are, therefore, better able to stop their \nplans before they are able to execute them.\n  Without this intelligence, bad things happen. We did not have the \nintelligence we needed before 9/11, and we all know what happened. \nSince then, a lot of changes have been made. Among other things, we \nhave made changes to the law that enables us to collect intelligence \nabroad. As a result of all of those changes, we have not had an attack \non the homeland.\n  God forbid we should have such an attack, but if we did, the new 9/11 \nCommission--whatever that would be called--would point the finger \ndirectly at the leadership of the House of Representatives for not \nreauthorizing this intelligence collection because every day that goes \nby we are losing important intelligence.\n  As we found out through the 9/11 Commission after that fateful day, \nwe failed to see things we could have known about that might have \nprevented us from suffering that attack on 9/11. But because of the law \nthat existed at the time, because of the wall that existed between the \nCIA and the FBI, for example, they were not able to share this \ninformation. As a result, we were not able to intercept two of the \nhijackers.\n  Well, now, today we have a situation where the law that enables us to \ncollect this foreign intelligence has expired. There are two problems \nwith that expiration. The first is that every day that goes by new \nintelligence is not being collected. You could have a terrorist in \nAfghanistan calling a terrorist in Germany, plotting some action \nagainst the United States, and because the call happened to be routed \nthrough a U.S. connection of some kind the law would not enable us to \ncollect that intelligence. So every day we are losing intelligence.\n  Secondly, because the telecommunications companies that help us in \nthis effort have been sued by trial lawyers, we need to provide \nprotection against these lawsuits. If we do not, there will come a \ntime, in my opinion, that it will be very difficult for these \ntelecommunications companies to continue to cooperate with the U.S. \nGovernment. Then, no matter what kind of law we passed, we would not \nhave the support of the only folks who can help us collect this \nintelligence. So we need this legislation, and the House of \nRepresentatives needs to act soon.\n  There was recently an op-ed that was written by Senator Kit Bond and \nRepresentatives Pete Hoekstra and Lamar Smith. It occurred in the Wall \nStreet Journal on February 26. They point out, in this op-ed, that the \nintercept of these terrorist communications ``requires the cooperation \nof our telecommunications companies. They're already being sued for \nhaving cooperated with the government after 9/11.'' They go on to say:\n\n       So without explicit protection for future actions (and \n     civil liability protection for the help they provided in the \n     past), those companies critical to collecting actionable \n     intelligence could be sidelined in the fight.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       It has already happened, briefly.\n\n  They quote Director of Intelligence Mike McConnell and Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey saying:\n\n       [W]e have lost intelligence information . . . as a direct \n     result of [this] uncertainty.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article, dated \nFebruary 26, 2008, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 26, 2008]\n\n                 In Case You Missed It: Hard of Hearing\n\n           (By Reps. Kit Bond, Pete Hoekstra and Lamar Smith)\n\n       Are Americans as safe today as they were before Congress \n     allowed the Protect America Act to expire on Feb. 16?\n       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats say we are. \n     They go so far as to say that the Protect America Act--put in \n     place last year to overcome obstacles in the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that make it harder to \n     intercept terrorist communications--was not even necessary. \n     In the Washington Post yesterday, Sens. Jay Rockefeller and \n     Patrick Leahy, and Reps. Silvestre Reyes and John Conyers, \n     wrote that our intelligence agencies can collect all the \n     intelligence they need under FISA.\n       That is simply false. We are less safe today and will \n     remain so until Congress clears up the legal uncertainty for \n     companies that assist in collecting intelligence for the \n     government--and until it gives explicit permission to our \n     intelligence agencies to intercept, without a warrant, \n     foreign communications that pass through the U.S. Here's why:\n       Intercepting terrorist communications requires the \n     cooperation of our telecommunications companies. They're \n     already being sued for having cooperated with the government \n     after 9/11. So without explicit protection for future actions \n     (and civil liability protection for the help they provided in \n     the past), those companies critical to collecting actionable \n     intelligence could be sidelined in the fight.\n       It has already happened, briefly. ``[W]e have lost \n     intelligence information this past week as a direct result of \n     the uncertainty created by Congress' failure to act,'' \n     Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and Attorney \n     General Michael Mukasey wrote in a letter dated Feb. 22 to \n     Mr. Reyes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n       The old FISA law does not adequately protect the U.S., \n     which is why it was revised by the Protect America Act last \n     summer. The problem is that, although it has a few work-\n     around-provisions, such as allowing intelligence agencies to \n     conduct surveillance for up to 72 hours without a warrant, \n     FISA ultimately requires those agencies to jump through too \n     many legal hurdles. Those include the Fourth Amendment's \n     ``probable\n\n[[Page S1726]]\n\n     cause'' requirements, protections never intended for \n     suspected terrorists' communications that are routed through \n     the U.S.\n       It is true that the FISA Court approves the vast majority \n     of warrants sought by intelligence agencies. This \n     demonstrates that our intelligence agencies are professional \n     and painstakingly provide all of the necessary evidence to \n     establish probable cause to the Court. But in the fast-paced \n     intelligence world, and when dealing with foreign \n     communications, we need our agencies to be able to intercept \n     a far greater number of comunications--notably those of \n     foreign terrorists--than can be justified under the Fourth \n     Amendment.\n       Telecommunications companies are for now, after intense \n     negotiations, cooperating with the government under the \n     assumption that protections granted to them under the Protect \n     America Act will be upheld in court, even though the law is \n     now defunct. But there is no guarantee that the courts will \n     do any such thing. There is also no guarantee that corporate \n     executives, under pressure from their legal counsels and \n     shareholders to limit liabilities, will continue to \n     cooperate.\n       The cooperation of the telecommunications companies is \n     limited to intercepting communications of terrorists \n     identified before the Protect America Act lapsed. Until \n     intelligence agencies can chase leads involving foreign \n     communications, the U.S. will not be as safe as it was just a \n     few weeks ago.\n       Further extending the Protect America Act is no way to \n     fight a war against a determined enemy that uses our \n     infrastructure against us. We need a long-term fix for FISA; \n     and that is what a bipartisan majority in the Senate tried to \n     accomplish earlier this month when it passed its FISA \n     modernization bill by a 68-29 margin.\n       The problem is in the House, where Democratic leaders \n     prefer to play an obstructionist role instead of constructing \n     the architecture we need to fight an intelligence-driven war. \n     Instead of voting on the Senate bill, even though a majority \n     of House members stand ready to pass it, Mrs. Pelosi is still \n     sitting on it. She is now pushing for a ``compromise'' that \n     would gut many of the provisions that secure the cooperation \n     of telecommunications companies.\n       Our troops collect intelligence in Iraq and Afghanistan on \n     a daily basis. We must exploit quickly the leads they turn \n     up. Court orders should not be necessary to engage foreign \n     targets in foreign countries. The Senate bill must be allowed \n     to come to a vote in the House of Representatives without \n     further delay.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, a letter was written to Congressman Hoekstra, the \nranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, and Lamar Smith, \nranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, dated March 6 \nof this year, signed by Attorney General Mukasey and Admiral McConnell, \nDirector of National Intelligence. I am going to quote a couple of \nlines from it:\n\n       We write in response to your letter of March 5 concerning \n     the core surveillance authorities needed in any modernization \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n       . . . As we have explained in prior correspondence, the \n     RESTORE Act--\n\n  Which is the bill that had been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives earlier--\n\n       . . . would seriously undermine these authorities and may \n     well reopen the gaps temporarily closed by the Protect \n     America Act. The RESTORE Act, or legislation similar to it, \n     is, in short, no substitute for the bipartisan Senate bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter of March 6, \nto which I just referred, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 6, 2008.\n     Hon. Pete Hoekstra,\n     Ranking Member, House Permanent Select Committee on \n         Intelligence, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Hoekstra and Congressman Smith: We write \n     in response to your letter of March 5 concerning the core \n     surveillance authorities needed in any modernization of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). We \n     appreciate the seriousness of Congress's engagement in this \n     critical issue. As you note, much of the recent discussion \n     concerning FISA reform has centered on liability protection \n     for electronic communication service providers who assisted \n     the Government in preventing another terrorist attack after \n     September 11, 2001. The liability protection provisions of \n     the Rockefeller-Bond FISA modernization bill, passed by a \n     strong bipartisan majority in the Senate and now pending in \n     the House of Representatives, provide precisely the \n     protection from civil suits that our national security \n     requires. Although liability protection is critical to any \n     FISA modernization proposal, equally if not more important to \n     our efforts to protect our nation from terrorist attack and \n     other foreign intelligence threats are the carefully drafted \n     authorities that modernize FISA for the technologies of the \n     21st century. These authorities address the operational \n     aspects of conducting surveillance of foreign terrorists and \n     other threats overseas, and we urge that they not be altered.\n       Over the past year, the Intelligence Community and the \n     Department of Justice have worked closely with Congress, \n     first to pass the Protect America Act last summer by a \n     bipartisan majority in both the House and Senate as a short-\n     term measure to enable us to close dangerous intelligence \n     gaps and then to create a long-term framework for foreign \n     intelligence surveillance of individuals outside the United \n     States. Those months of bipartisan effort and of careful \n     compromise are reflected in the bill passed by the Senate, a \n     bill that we believe would also enjoy the support of a \n     majority of the members of the House of Representatives. \n     Title I of the Senate bill would preserve the core \n     authorities of the Protect America Act--authorities that have \n     helped us to obtain exactly the type of information we need \n     to keep America safe. For example, the Senate bill would \n     allow the Government to continue collecting foreign \n     intelligence information against foreign terrorists and other \n     foreign intelligence targets located outside the United \n     States without obtaining prior court approval. Initiating \n     surveillance of individuals abroad without awaiting a court \n     order will ensure that we will keep closed the intelligence \n     gaps that existed before the passage of the Protect America \n     Act.\n       It is essential to our national security that any \n     legislation passed by the House of Representatives not weaken \n     the intelligence collection authorities provided in the \n     Protect America Act, which are preserved in Title I of the \n     Senate bill. As we have explained in prior correspondence, \n     the RESTORE Act, passed by the House last November, would \n     seriously undermine these authorities and may well reopen the \n     gaps temporarily closed by the Protect America Act. The \n     RESTORE Act, or legislation similar to it, is, in short, no \n     substitute for the bipartisan Senate bill. Even seemingly \n     small changes to the Senate bill may have serious operational \n     consequences. It is our firm belief that the Senate bill \n     provides our intelligence professionals the tools they need \n     to protect the country.\n       Title I of the Senate bill also protects the civil \n     liberties of Americans. In fact, the privacy protections for \n     Americans in the Senate bill exceed the protections contained \n     in both the Protect America Act and the RESTORE Act. For \n     example, the bill would require for the first time that a \n     court order be obtained to conduct foreign intelligence \n     surveillance of an American abroad. Historically, such \n     surveillance has been conducted pursuant to Executive Branch \n     procedures when, for example, a U.S. person was acting as an \n     agent of a foreign power, e.g., spying on behalf of a foreign \n     government. This change contained in the Senate bill is a \n     significant increase in the involvement of the FISA Court in \n     these surveillance activities. Other provisions of the bill \n     address concerns that some have voiced about the Protect \n     America Act, such as clarifying that the Government cannot \n     ``reverse target'' without a court order.\n       The bill substantially increases the role of the FISA Court \n     and of Congress in overseeing acquisitions of foreign \n     intelligence information from foreign terrorists and other \n     national security threats located outside the United States. \n     Under the Senate bill, the Court would review certifications \n     by the Attorney General and the Director of National \n     Intelligence relating to such acquisitions, the targeting \n     procedures used by the Government to conduct acquisitions \n     under the Act, and the minimization procedures used by the \n     Government to ensure that such acquisitions do not invade the \n     privacy of Americans. The bill would require the Attorney \n     General and the Director of National Intelligence to conduct \n     semiannual assessments of compliance with targeting \n     procedures and minimization procedures and to submit those \n     assessments to the FISA Court and to Congress. The FISA Court \n     and Congress would also receive annual reviews relating to \n     those acquisitions prepared by the heads of agencies that use \n     the authorities of the bill. In addition, the bill requires \n     the Attorney General to submit to Congress a report at least \n     semiannually concerning the implementation of the authorities \n     provided by the bill and would expand the categories of FISA-\n     related court documents that the Government must provide to \n     the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees.\n       We remain prepared to work with Congress towards the \n     passage of a long-term FISA modernization bill that would \n     strengthen the Nation's intelligence capabilities while \n     protecting the civil liberties of Americans, so that the \n     President can sign such a bill into law. Congress has such \n     legislation before it--the bipartisan Senate bill--and the \n     authorities provided in Title I of that bill strike a careful \n     balance and should not be altered.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Mukasey,\n       Attorney General.\n     J.M. McConnell,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The point of this letter, of course, is to urge the House to \nadopt the bill passed by the Senate.\n  The next item I would like to have printed in the Record is a note \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1727]]\n\nthe American Legion Commander, in which he urges, on February 25 of \nthis year, that Congress pass the bill passed by the Senate. He pointed \nout that ``the National Intelligence Estimate noted that the United \nStates will face a persistent and evolving threat over the next three \nyears, with the main threat coming from Islamic terrorist groups and \ncells.'' And he says:\n\n       It defies all common sense to give lawsuits a higher \n     priority than national security. The American people expect \n     Congress to protect America, not the lawsuit lobby. This \n     surveillance is aimed at terrorists who want to kill innocent \n     Americans. The government is not interested in phone calls \n     that you make to Aunt Sally.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that item be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    American Legion Commander to Congress: Pass Surveillance Law Now\n\n       Indianapolis (February 25, 2008).--Congress should put \n     America's national security ahead of frivolous lawsuits, \n     American Legion National Commander Marty Conatser said today. \n     The head of the nation's largest veterans organization sent a \n     letter to members of the House of Representatives, urging \n     them to pass an important intelligence-gathering law \n     immediately.\n       ``Since this war began, the Congress has done an exemplary \n     job of ensuring that the nation's fighting men and women are \n     the best-trained and best-equipped military ever in American \n     history,'' National Commander Marty Conatser wrote. ``Today, \n     The American Legion asks you to continue this precedent by \n     equipping the intelligence assets with the necessary tools \n     needed to provide these dedicated troops the very best \n     information available by timely enactment of S. 2248, The \n     Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA).''\n       The bill had bipartisan support in the Senate but is stuck \n     in the House because leaders there do not believe \n     telecommunications companies should be protected from \n     lawsuits that arise from cooperating with surveillance \n     requests.\n       Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Va., the Chairman of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, also supports the bill. \n     ``Unfortunately, much of the debate over this bill has \n     focused on liability protection for telecommunication \n     carriers, instead of the new civil liberties protections and \n     oversight mechanisms that have been included,'' Rockefeller \n     said in statement posted on his Senate web site. ``We should \n     not hold the carriers hostage to years of litigation for \n     stepping forward when the country asked for help and \n     providing assistance they believed to be legal and necessary. \n     The fact is, if we lose cooperation from these or other \n     private companies, our national security will suffer.''\n       Conatser pointed out to Representatives that the National \n     Intelligence Estimate noted that the United States will face \n     a persistent and evolving threat over the next three years, \n     with the main threat coming from Islamic terrorist groups and \n     cells.\n       ``It defies all common sense to give lawsuits a higher \n     priority than national security,'' Conatser said. ``The \n     American people expect Congress to protect America, not the \n     lawsuit lobby. This surveillance is aimed at terrorists who \n     want to kill innocent Americans. The government is not \n     interested in phone calls that you make to Aunt Sally.''\n       With a current membership of 2.7-million wartime veterans, \n     The American Legion, www.legion.org, was founded in 1919 on \n     the four pillars of a strong national security, veterans \n     affairs, Americanism, and patriotic youth programs. \n     Legionnaires work for the betterment of their communities \n     through more than 14,000 posts across the nation.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, a letter was written by a bipartisan group of 25 \nState attorneys general dated March 4, 2008. It is a letter directed to \nthe four leaders of the House of Representatives. Among other things, \nthese 25 Democratic and Republican attorneys general note the fact \nthat:\n\n       Passing [this legislation] S. 2248 would ensure our \n     intelligence experts are once again able to conduct real-time \n     surveillance. As you know, prompt access to intelligence data \n     is critical to the ongoing safety and security of our nation.\n       As Attorneys General, we are our states' chief law \n     enforcement officials and therefore responsible for taking \n     whatever action is necessary to keep our citizens safe. With \n     S. 2248 still pending in the House of Representatives, our \n     national security is in jeopardy.\n\n  They close by saying:\n\n       We therefore urge the House of Representatives to schedule \n     a vote and pass the FISA Amendments Act of 2007.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 4, 2008.\n     Re FISA Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248).\n\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi1,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt,\n     Minority Whip,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority \n     Leader Boehner and Minority Whip Blunt: We urge the House of \n     Representatives to schedule a vote and pass S. 2248, the FISA \n     Amendments Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation is \n     critical to the national security of the United States. Once \n     passed, S. 2248 will ensure intelligence officials have the \n     ability to collect vitally important information about \n     foreign terrorists operating overseas.\n       Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller \n     (D-WV) authored S. 2248 to solve a critical problem that \n     arose when the Protect America Act was allowed to lapse on \n     February 16, 12008. The root of the problem stems from a \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') Court order \n     that jeopardizes America's national security efforts. Under \n     that decision, U.S. intelligence agencies must obtain a FISA \n     warrant before initiating surveillance involving suspected \n     foreign terrorists located outside the United States.\n       The FISA Court's decision hinged on the fact that those \n     entirely foreign communications are frequently routed through \n     telecommunications facilities that happen to be located in \n     the United States. Because modem global communications \n     networks routinely route data through numerous facilities in \n     a myriad of countries, the nation in which the call \n     originates may be completely unrelated to the nation through \n     which that call is ultimately routed.\n       A bipartisan majority of the United States Senate recently \n     approved S. 2248. But until it is also passed by the House of \n     Representatives, intelligence officials must obtain FISA \n     warrants every time they attempt to monitor suspected \n     terrorists in overseas countries. Passing S. 2248 would \n     ensure our intelligence experts are once again able to \n     conduct real-time surveillance. As you know, prompt access to \n     intelligence data is critical to the ongoing safety and \n     security of our nation.\n       As Attorneys General, we are our states' chief law \n     enforcement officials and therefore responsible for taking \n     whatever action is necessary to keep our citizens safe. With \n     S. 2248 still pending in the House of Representatives, our \n     national security is in jeopardy. We therefore urge the House \n     of Representatives to schedule a vote and pass the FISA \n     Amendments Act of 2007.\n           Sincerely,\n         Hon. Greg Abbott, Attorney General of Texas; Hon. Roy \n           Cooper, Attorney General of North Carolina; Hon. W.A. \n           Drew Edmondson, Attorney General of Oklahoma; Hon. Bill \n           McCollum, Attorney General of Florida; Hon. Troy King, \n           Attorney General of Alabama; Hon. Talis Colberg, \n           Attorney General of Alaska; Hon. Dustin McDaniel, \n           Attorney General of Arkansas; Hon. John Suthers, \n           Attorney General of Colorado; Hon. Thurbert Baker, \n           Attorney General of Georgia; Hon. Lawrence Wasden, \n           Attorney General of Idaho; Hon. Steve Carter, Attorney \n           General of Indiana; Hon. Stephen Six, Attorney General \n           of Kansas; Hon. Doug Gansler, Attorney General of \n           Maryland.\n         Hon. Mike Cox, Attorney General of Michigan; Hon. Jon \n           Bruning, Attorney General of Nebraska; Hon. Kelly \n           Ayotte, Attorney General of New Hampshire; Hon. Wayne \n           Stenehjem, Attorney General of North Dakota; Hon. Tom \n           Corbett, Attorney General of Pennsylvania; Hon. Patrick \n           Lynch, Attorney General of Rhode Island; Hon. Henry \n           McMaster, Attorney General of South Carolina; Hon. \n           Larry Long, Attorney General of South Dakota; Hon. Mark \n           Shurtleff, Attorney General of Utah; Hon. Robert \n           McDonnell, Attorney General of Virginia; Hon. Rob \n           McKenna, Attorney General of Washington; Hon. Darrell \n           McGraw, Attorney General of West Virginia.\n\n  Mr. KYL. So in conclusion, the bottom line is, we have a bill passed \nby the Senate Intelligence Committee 13 to 2, passed by the Senate with \n68 affirmative votes. I believe it was 28 or 29 negative votes--\nclearly, a bipartisan effort. The President has indicated he would sign \nthis legislation. It has now been 19 days since it has been sent to the \nHouse of Representatives which said it needed 3 weeks to get the job \ndone.\n  During that period of time, we have lost intelligence--we do not know \nhow critical. We will never know because we will never gather it. The \nphone call was made yesterday or the day before or the day before that. \nIt is gone now, and we cannot go back and get it. But what we can do is \nensure that from now on we are going to collect that critical \nintelligence. Unless this legislation is\n\n[[Page S1728]]\n\npassed, the telecommunications companies that are critical to the \ncollection of this intelligence are less and less likely to support our \nefforts. That is why it is critical this legislation, rather than some \nother version of it, be passed.\n  Mr. President, I urge the House leadership to call up this \nlegislation. Next week is the last week it can be acted on before yet \nanother 2-week recess. The House recessed before without adopting it. \nIt would be absolutely a dereliction of responsibility, in my view, for \nthe Congress not to conclude its work on this matter and ensure that \nthe President can sign this important legislation into law before the \nEaster recess; that is to say, by the end of next week, 1 week from \nright now.\n  I urge our House colleagues to please--in fact, I implore them to \nunderstand the danger in which they have placed the American people by \nnot acting on this legislation--the fact that we are not collecting \nintelligence today because the authority has lapsed--and that according \nto the people who know best, the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence, it is no answer to say that warrants that have \npreviously been issued will continue in force. All that means is the \nactions that have been taken in the past can continue. It does not do \nanything about intelligence gathering today and tomorrow and the next \nday.

Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, it seems as \nthough every day in your State of Pennsylvania and my State of Ohio and \nacross the country the news brings us more evidence of the length and \nthe breadth of the housing crisis in this country.\n  Yesterday, the Mortgage Bankers Association released statistics on \nthe fourth quarter of 2007, and the news is grim. The rate of \nforeclosure starts and the percentage of loans in the foreclosure \npipeline are the highest ever.\n  My State set a record for foreclosures last year of more than 83,000 \nforeclosures, according to the Ohio Supreme Court. That is more than \n200 every day--Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, \nSunday--more than 200 every day, and more than 300 a day for every day \nthe courts are in session.\n  Every week, 1,500 families in Ohio--just in Ohio--lose their homes--\nweek in, week out. Four percent of home loans in Ohio are in \nforeclosure, the highest rate in the Nation. And the end is nowhere in \nsight. In Ohio, there are another 120,000 home loans that are \ndelinquent. Nationally, one of the ratings agencies is now predicting a \n50-percent--nationally, a 50-percent--default rate for subprime loans \nmade in the fourth quarter of 2006. That means the rates for those \nloans will reset in the fourth quarter of this year.\n  Think about that: One of every two subprime loans made in the fall of \n2006 will go bad. That is not lending; that is gambling with somebody \nelse's home.\n  The losses on these loans to lenders are substantial--on the order of \n40 percent nationwide and about 65 percent in my State. That means only \n35 cents on the dollar is preserved, if you will.\n  We have sheriffs' sales in Ohio that are attracting no bidders \nwhatsoever. And the trend lines have been straight down.\n  Congress must act in the face of this crisis. Majority Leader Reid, \nto his credit, brought legislation--of which the Presiding Officer is a \ncosponsor, and many others of us--before the Senate that would take \nseveral steps to help homeowners faced with foreclosure and the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  The needs of communities are critical because this crisis has an \nimpact far beyond just the people--as large a number as that is, as \ntragic as it is for them--an impact far beyond just the people who lose \ntheir homes. Whenever a home goes into foreclosure, the value of \nneighboring properties is reduced. It is not confined to our large \ncities or to our small towns. It is rural areas. It is inner ring \nsuburbs. It is outer ring suburbs.\n  In many areas, criminals move in quickly in these abandoned homes to \nstrip the copper pipe and aluminum siding from a home. A copper \nprocessor in northwest Ohio told me the other day that copper prices \nare now exceeding $3 a pound, which just encourages more and more \nvandalism of these homes.\n  Crime goes up just when property tax revenues are plunging and the \nresources of a city or town are stretched to the limit.\n  So Senator Reid's bill would include $4 billion in funding for the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program so communities that have been \nhit hard could renovate or rebuild or, in some cases, raze those \nproperties. This legislation would also provide another $200 million \nfor supporting the efforts of nonprofit agencies across the country to \ncounsel homeowners on how to work with a lender to stave off \nforeclosure. That part is so very important.\n\n  Senator Casey, the Presiding Officer, Senator Schumer, and I, a year \nago, on the Banking Committee, began to try to get money appropriated, \nwhich the President initially vetoed, to these counseling agencies, \nthese not-for-profit groups in our communities that help people stave \noff foreclosure--no bailout, no Federal dollars to pay the mortgages, \nbut simply to help them find a lender and trace their mortgage and help \nto restructure their payments so they can pay it off. This is no easy \ntask.\n  Once upon a time, you took out a loan with your local bank to buy a \nhome. You knew the people at the bank. They knew you. They had just as \nmuch interest in you paying off your loan as you did in paying off your \nloan and staying in your house. Today, especially for subprime loans, \nthat doesn't happen. So help in navigating this mortgage maze is \nessential.\n  Senator Reid's bill also provided bankruptcy judges the ability to \nmodify mortgage terms on a primary residence in the same way--get \nthis--that the judge today can modify a mortgage on an investment home \nor vacation property or a boat. I heard one of my Republican colleagues \ntoday talk about this whole issue of bankruptcy and how that is going \nto be a problem, and that is why they seem to oppose this bill--because \nof the bankruptcy provisions. But they never really answer the \nquestion: Why can't a judge modify a mortgage in bankruptcy for a home, \nfor a personal home, when under the law they can on a vacation home in \nFlorida or Arizona? They can on a boat, they can on an investment \nproperty.\n  Lenders and their servicers cannot keep up with the flood of \nforeclosures they are facing. Much has been made of the number of loans \nthat have been changed as a result of voluntary efforts. That is a good \nthing; I don't discount those efforts at all. But tacking late fees and \npenalties on the back end of a loan doesn't do much to help a family \nmake their monthly payment.\n  One woman who called my office recently reported a loan modification \nshe had gotten to reduce the interest rate on her loan from 11 percent \nto 10 percent. With the late fees and the penalties folded in, her \nmonthly payment barely changed.\n  Modifications such as these simply aren't going to help. It is \nessential that we permit bankruptcy courts to serve as a backstop.\n  So with the housing crisis spreading across the country and Senator \nReid's proposal before us, what did the Senate\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\ndo? My colleagues in the minority again chose to filibuster--filibuster \nagain and again. Fifteen hundred families in Ohio every week are losing \ntheir homes, and over 100,000 are facing foreclosure. Multiply this all \nover the country, and almost half the Senate chose to filibuster.\n  What could possibly be the reasoning for this decision? The \nadministration threatened a veto of the bill because it believed it was \ntoo costly and that the bankruptcy provisions were unwise. I don't \nagree, but can't we have a debate on that to make those decisions? I \nwould love to discuss why we can afford to spend $3 billion a week on \nthe war in Iraq--$3 billion on the war in Iraq--but we can't find $4 \nbillion in 1 year, $4 billion in 1 year to help the towns and the \ncities, including Burlington and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and \nCleveland and Steubenville and Erie--why we can't find $4 billion in 1 \nyear to help communities in this country that are being carpet-bombed \nby foreclosure. We can spend billions of dollars on Halliburton to \nrebuild Iraq, and we can't spend a few billion dollars on local \nbusinesses in my communities in Ohio to rebuild our communities.\n  My Republican colleagues apparently think it is OK for a bankruptcy \njudge to modify the mortgage on a multimillion-dollar vacation home, \nbut it is not OK to provide the same relief to a family facing \nbankruptcy in a $100,000 home. When lenders are recovering only 35 \ncents on the dollar in my State--the national average is higher but not \na lot higher--35 cents on the dollar on a foreclosed property, I don't \nthink they have anything to fear from an alternative process supervised \nby bankruptcy courts that may result in avoiding foreclosure. The \nbankruptcy provisions are a significant change in our law, to be sure, \nbut they are a responsible reaction to some extraordinarily \nirresponsible underwriting.\n  I understand the importance of protecting contract rights, but think \nfor a minute about the contracts that are in question. The vast \nmajority of subprime loans went to refinance homes, and they were \ndesigned to do three things: generate fees, strip out equity, and \nquickly become unaffordable. That is what they were designed to do. \nThat is why so many people were able to take the money and run--the \nmortgage brokers--and, unfortunately, that is what happened. Do we \nreally want to take the position that those contracts should be beyond \nthe reach of a bankruptcy judge?\n  I may have answered my earlier question. I guess maybe a filibuster \nwould be easier for my friends on the other side of the aisle than an \nactual debate on these issues. I know lenders want to avoid becoming \nreal estate owners, but they don't have the capacity to deal with the \nproblems that their lax underwriting standards have created. They are \nobviously not in the business of rebuilding the communities this crisis \nhas devastated. That is why Senator Reid's legislation is so important.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider \ntheir tactics and will allow us to proceed on the legislation the \nmajority leader has introduced and which I am proud to cosponsor. Maybe \nwe will not have the votes in this body. In a fair and full debate, \nmaybe we will not have the votes to maintain all of the provisions. \nMaybe there are alternative approaches. I am open to that. I want to \nsee this solved. But let's at least vote, and let's do it quickly. \nEvery day we delay, 200 people in my State--200 people--twice the \nmembership of this body--every single day 200 people in my State lose \ntheir homes. They deserve more from us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was impressed with what the Senator from \nOhio said, and I commend him for what he said. We talk about the cost \nof the President's war in Iraq and we have been in Iraq longer than we \nwere in World War II and the cost just in interest of the huge deficits \nand the tripling of the national debt under the Bush-Cheney \nadministration; if we take the money we pay on interest on the national \ndebt and the money we pay in Iraq, it comes to somewhere around $1 \nbillion a day, every single day of the year.\n  Think what we could do with that $365 billion a year: health care for \neverybody, dramatically improve our schools, research on Alzheimer's, \ndiabetes, AIDS, cancer, so many things. Instead, we are sending \ninterest payments overseas and money to Iraq.\n  So I commend the Senator from Ohio for speaking out as he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1729-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1729-S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate confirmed Mark \nFilip to be the Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice. \nThat is the person second in command at the Department. Yesterday, the \nJudiciary Committee reported four judicial nominations for lifetime \njudicial positions, and we reported three more executive nominations, \nincluding the nomination of Kevin O'Connor to be the Associate Attorney \nGeneral. That is the third highest ranking official at the Department \nof Justice.\n  These executive branch nominations would have been on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar sometime ago, but for some reason the Senate \nRepublicans did not cooperate to get them out of Committee. We were \ngoing to put them on the Senate Judiciary Committee's calendar--and \ndid--in mid-February. What happened? The Republicans effectively \nboycotted the meeting.\n  Now, some of them were out giving speeches saying: Why don't we have \nsome of these nominations go through? But they were effectively \nblocking the meeting. So we tried it a second time in February. Again, \na lack of a quorum. In fact, at the first, only one or two Republicans \nremained present. At the latter hearing, the ranking member, the senior \nRepublican on the committee, left before a quorum gathered.\n  We concluded the last session of this Congress by confirming each and \nevery judicial nomination that was reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nall 40. None were carried over into this new year. In February, the \nJudiciary Committee held two hearings for seven judicial nominees, \nincluding a circuit nominee. Despite my efforts, Republican members of \nthe Judiciary Committee effectively boycotted our business meetings \nlast month and obstructed our ability to report judicial nominations \nand high-ranking Justice Department nominations.\n  It is more than ironic--in fact, it is somewhat cynical--that the \nPresident and Senate Republicans simultaneously staged partisan media \nevents and complained that the Senate Democrats are not moving their \nnominations forward when the Republicans themselves prevented the \nJudiciary Committee from moving them forward. These complaints ring as \nhollow as the complaints that we heard again this morning about the \nexpiration of the so-called Protect America Act, which expired because \nthe White House and congressional Republicans refused to extend it. We \nfound out why they refused to extend it, which is because they wanted \nto blame their actions on Democrats. I know it is an election year, but \nthis kind of cynicism does not help the United States, and it is one of \nthe reasons so many Americans are upset with the whole political \nprocess and why I believe the President is at such a low rating in the \npolitical polls.\n  Their actions in blocking us from doing something and then asking why \ndidn't we do it remind me of the old saw that we former prosecutors \nused to talk about all the time, about the youngster who murdered his \nparents but then said to the court: Have mercy on me, I am an orphan. \nYou can't have it both ways.\n  Despite the partisan posturing by the President and Senate \nRepublicans, I have continued to move forward and sought to make \nprogress but, I must admit, my patience is wearing thin. Two weeks ago, \nduring the congressional recess, I chaired our third nominations \nhearing of the year. At that time, the committee considered three \njudicial nominations, including that of Catharina Haynes of Texas to be \na Circuit Judge on the Fifth Circuit. I knew that this nomination was \nimportant to Senator Cornyn. So in spite of her participation at the \nrecent partisan political rally and photo op at the White House, I \nmoved forward with that previously scheduled hearing. Instead of \nreceiving thanks for making the effort to hold a confirmation hearing \nduring the recess, I have actually been criticized by Republicans for \ndoing so.\n\n[[Page S1730]]\n\n  I commend the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for \nacknowledging the years of Republican pocket filibusters, when they \npocket-filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominations, as excess. Yes, I would agree it is excess. It had never \nbeen done by any party, Republican or Democratic, before. I have long \nsaid that what would help the process is a sincere, full acknowledgment \nby those Republican Senators who worked so hard to obstruct and pocket-\nfilibuster President Clinton's moderate and well-qualified judicial \nnominees of their excesses and mistakes. Hope springs eternal, and it \nwill probably be an eternity before that acknowledgment will be made by \nthe same people who created the problem and now complain about it.\n  I do not hold the senior Senator from Pennsylvania responsible for \nthose activities. He wasn't chairing the committee. He was not a member \nof the Republican leadership or even one of the more active \nparticipants in that effort. In fact, except for his vote to defeat the \nnomination of Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, a highly qualified \nAfrican American for the Federal judiciary, an action for which he \nsubsequently apologized, I cannot think of another judicial nominee he \nopposed.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked hard to turn \nthe other cheek. When I became chairman, I wanted to greatly improve on \nthe sorry treatment of reported nominees when the Republicans were in \ncontrol and considering President Clinton's nominees. During the 17 \nmonths I was chairman during President Bush's first term I tried to \nreverse that trend. I said we are not going to pocket-filibuster 60 \njudges in the way that the Republicans did to President Clinton. Let's \nmove these judges, even though a lot of the vacancies were created by \ntheir filibustering.\n  So we Democrats acted faster and more favorably on more of this \nPresident's judicial nominees than under either of the Republican \nchairmen who succeeded me as chairman. During those brief 17 months I \nwas chairman before, the Senate confirmed 100 judicial nominations. \nDuring the 2 years my friend from Pennsylvania was Chairman, the \nRepublicans confirmed just 54 judicial nominations. Granted, two were \nSupreme Court justices, but 54 in 2 years, and with strong help from \nthe Democrats, as compared to 100 during the 17 months I was chairman.\n  I was surprised earlier this week to hear the ranking member say that \nnominations were ``stymied'' when I became chairman. Complaints ring \nhollow under those circumstances, given the improvements I made in \nmaking the formerly secret process of checking the home State Senators \nas a matter of public record. Keep in mind that under the Republicans \nthey allowed secret holds. That is how they were able to block more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's nominations. Instead of the holds or \nblue slips, I made them public.\n  When I assumed the chairmanship last year, the committee and the \nSenate continued to make progress with the confirmation of 40 more \nlifetime appointments to our Federal courts. That is more than were \nconfirmed during any of the 3 preceding years under Republican \nleadership and more than were confirmed in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, \nwhen a Republican-led Senate was considering President Clinton's \nnominations. Thus, as chairman, I have worked to help the Senate act to \nconfirm 140 lifetime appointments in only 3 years, as compared to 158 \nunder 4 years of Republican control. Stymied?\n  Equally misleading is a Republican talking point that the Judiciary \nCommittee didn't hold a hearing for circuit nominations for 5 months. \nWhat they do not say is that as a result of the mass resignations at \nthe Justice Department in the wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era, \nincluding the resignation of the Attorney General himself following \nthose scandals, the committee was holding seven hearings on high-\nranking replacements to restock and restore the leadership of the \nDepartment of Justice between September of last year and last month, \nincluding confirmation hearings for a new Attorney General to replace \nthe disgraced Attorney General who was forced out, a new deputy \nAttorney General, a new associate Attorney General, and many others.\n  Because of the scandal of the Bush-Cheney administration and the \nJustice Department, there are all these vacancies. Of course, when they \nfinally got around to replacing these people, we felt the first \npriority was to hold hearings so there would be an Attorney General and \nsenior leadership at the Department of Justice. Of course those 5 \nmonths also include the December and holiday recesses and the break \nbetween sessions, so for many weeks we were not here. That is in \ncomparison to the first 6 months of 1999, when the Republican chairman \nrefused to schedule any judicial nomination hearings, in order to force \nthe White House to consider his pick for a judgeship in Utah.\n  The Republican whip urged committee attention to the President's \nnominations to fill the many vacancies resulting from the resignations \nof the Gonzales leadership group at the Justice Department. And when we \ndo, in fact, have those hearings and do that work and we make them a \npriority, we are criticized. It appears we are damned if we do and \ndamned if we don't.\n  We held a prompt 2-day hearing on the nomination of Michael Mukasey \nto be Attorney General, a hearing on the nomination of Judge Filip to \nbe Deputy Attorney General, a hearing on the nomination of Kevin \nO'Connor to be Associate Attorney General, and hearings on a number of \nkey assistant attorneys general and heads of Justice Department \noffices. But you would never know it from the self-serving Republican \ncomplaints. We get no credit for any of the good things we have done, \nfor any of our diligence or hard work.\n  When the Republican leader and others come to the floor and make \nthese accusations, I think it is because they don't want to have to \nexplain their roles in the 60 pocket filibusters of President Clinton's \nnominees. One of those people who was blocked and who they say was not \nqualified was picked as the dean of the Harvard Law School, a most \nprestigious position, where they produce hundreds of the brightest \nlawyers in the country. They picked her, a highly qualified woman, and \nAfrican-Americans, and Hispanics, who were all pocket filibustered by \nthe Republicans. Maybe they hope that in an election year people will \nnot remind them of that. During the 1996 session, the last of President \nClinton's first term, the Republican-led Senate did not confirm a \nsingle circuit court nomination. At the end of his Presidency, they \ntook 17 circuit court nominations that they pocket filibustered and \nrefused to act on them and sent them back to President Clinton, hoping \nto keep those seats vacant for a Republican President. Why was it that \nRepublicans chose to reverse course on the treatment accorded by \nDemocrats to nominations of Presidents Reagan and Bush in the \nPresidential election years of 1988 and 1992? Why were so many \nnominations pocket filibustered? Who is responsible? Why have they \nalways refused to make the blue slips of that era public? Why have they \nalways hidden who it was holding up these judges? Why did they want to \nkeep that secret? Why was Bonnie Campbell, the former attorney general \nof Iowa, who was supported by both Democratic Senator Tom Harkin and \nRepublican Senator Chuck Grassley, never allowed to be considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee or the Senate after a hearing? Why was she \npocket filibustered? They ought to answer some of these questions \nbefore they level any accusations. They have far too many skeletons in \ntheir closet to try to pick a bone with the Democratic side.\n  To any objective observer, the answer is clear: The Republicans chose \nto stall consideration of circuit nominees and maintain vacancies \nduring the Clinton administration in anticipation of a Republican \nPresidency. They took the Thurmond rule to a whole new stage by \nutilizing it over a 5-year period, instead of the seven or eight months \nthat normally takes place during a Presidential election year. Because \nof their irresponsible actions, vacancies in the courts rose to over a \nhundred. Circuit court vacancies doubled during the Clinton years \nbecause Republicans would not allow him to fill those vacancies.\n  In those years, Senator Hatch justified the slow progress by pointing \nto the judicial vacancy rate. When the vacancy rate stood at 7.2 \npercent, Senator Hatch declared that ``there is and has been no \njudicial vacancy crisis''\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\nand that this was a ``rather low percentage of vacancies that shows the \njudiciary is not suffering from an overwhelming number of vacancies.'' \nBecause of Republican inaction, the vacancy rate continued to rise, \nreaching nearly 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term. The \nnumber of circuit court vacancies rose to 32 with retirements of \nRepublican appointed circuit judges immediately after President Bush \ntook office.\n  But as soon as a Republican President was elected, they said: Why \ndon't we have judges in these vacancies? The sky is falling, the sky is \nfalling. Suddenly they said that things are coming to a halt in this \ncountry because we do not have enough judges. Of course they do not \nmention that these vacancies occurred because they pocket filibustered \nthose judges. They have been extraordinarily successful over the past \ndozen years. Currently, more than 60 percent of active judges on the \nFederal circuit courts were appointed by Republican Presidents. More \nthan 35 percent have been appointed by this President. We have cut the \nvacancy rate in half. Had we Democrats done to them what they did to \nus, we would still have a huge vacancy rate. But we try to be more \nresponsible, and we cut it in half. Another way to look at their \nsuccess is to observe that the Senate has already confirmed three-\nquarters of this President's circuit court nominees over the last 7 \nyears. Republicans only confirmed about half of President Clinton's.\n\n  Despite these efforts to pack the Federal courts and tilt them \nsharply to the right, one of my first acts when I took over as chairman \nin 2001 was to restore openness and accountability to the nominations \nprocess that had been abused when the Republican-controlled Senate \npocket-filibustered President Clinton's nominees with anonymous holds \nand without public opposition or explanation. In 2001, with a \nDemocratic-led Senate considering President Bush's nominees, we drew \nopen the curtains on the nominations process, making blue slips public \nfor the first time. Republicans, during the Clinton administration, \ncloaked their actions in secrecy and, to this day, will not explain \ntheir actions. I have not treated this President's nominees in that \nway. We have considered nominations openly and on the record. We have \nconsidered nominations I do not support, something that was never done \nby a Republican chairman.\n  I am puzzled that in his recent proposals, the ranking member has \nsuggested that the Senate bypass the committee's process for vetting \nnomination, and is also apparently calling for an end to the role of \nhome State Senators. He is now proposing rules for nominations that he \ndid not follow in the 2 years he served as chairman of the committee, \nfrom 2005 to 2006, and that he did not propose from 1995 to 2000 when \nRepublicans were in control of the consideration of President Clinton's \nnominees.\n  When he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter \nrespected the blue slip, which is the means by which home State \nSenators approve or disapprove of a nomination before consideration of \nthe nomination proceeds. Requiring the support of home State Senators \nis a traditional mechanism to encourage the White House to engage in \nmeaningful consultation with the Senate.\n  Many of the President's current nominees do not have the support of \ntheir home State Senators. That is why the nomination of Duncan \nGetchell, opposed by two of the most distinguished Senators in this \nChamber, Republican Senator John Warner and the distinguished \nDemocratic Senator Jim Webb, was finally withdrawn. That is why the \nnomination of Gene Pratter to the third circuit has not been \nconsidered, as well as six other circuit nominees including nominees to \nthe third circuit, the two current nominees to the sixth circuit, a \nnominee to the fourth circuit, and the nominee to the first circuit. Of \nthe 11 circuit court nominations that have been pending before the \nSenate this year, 8 have not had the support of their home State \nSenators. Indeed, nearly half of the 28 nominations listed by Senator \nSpecter in his recent letter to me do not currently have blue slips \nsignaling support from home State Senators. The reason we know this is \nthat unlike the Republican policy of keeping secret the so-called blue \nslips, I make them public knowledge.\n  You might ask why do we pay attention to home State Senators? It is \nbecause we are elected to represent our States. There is only one place \nin the United States where every State is equal, and that is here in \nthe Senate. Out of 300 million Americans, only 100 of us have the \nprivilege to serve here at any given time, two from every State. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer represents a great State, a wonderful \nState, a State that helped form this country. It is much larger than \nmine. My State was the 14th State in the Union. We have two Senators so \nthat we can keep the identity of our State. I think of one of President \nBush's circuit nominees for a circuit court judgeship representing one \nof our States, where the two Senators objected and so the nomination \ndid not go through. To this day, I get criticized by the Republicans \nbecause that nomination did not go through, even after the nominee was \ncharged with criminal fraud and convicted. They still criticized us for \nnot giving him a lifetime position on the circuit court. They ought to \nsay thank you to the two Senators who said do not put that nomination \nthrough.\n  Republican complaints about nominations ring hollow in light of the \nactual progress we have made and, quite frankly, their success. The \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate have worked to approve an \noverwhelming majority of President Bush's nominations for lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. The Senate has confirmed over 86 \npercent of President Bush's judicial nominations, compared to less than \n75 percent for President Clinton's nominations. As I have noted, the \nSenate has confirmed nearly three quarters of President Bush's \nnominations to influential circuit courts, compared to just over half \nof President Clinton's.\n  Earlier this week on the Senate floor, in a standard ploy in these \npartisan attacks, my words from 8 years ago were taken out of context. \nAt that time, I urged the Republican majority to abandon its use of \npocket filibusters. I urged them to make public their process and not \nkeep it secret, and do what we have done since I was first Chairman. I \neven urged then-Governor Bush, who was the Republican nominee for \nPresident, to intervene in a positive way. They rejected my efforts. \nThey continued to pocket filibuster nominees and maintain vacancies on \nthe court. They continued to do what they had done during the 1980 \nPresidential campaign, when President Reagan was running for President \nand Senator Thurmond, then in the Republican minority as ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee, instituted a policy to stall President \nCarter's nominations. That policy, known as the ``Thurmond Rule'', was \nput in when the Republicans were in the minority. It is a rule that we \nstill follow, and it will take effect very soon here.\n  For a number of years I have urged now President Bush to join with \nDemocrats and Republicans. Regrettably he continues to insist on \nnominating controversial nominees in the mold of Duncan Getchell and \nClaude Allen. I extended another olive branch to him by my letter last \nNovember. I have received no response. Despite urging the President to \nwork with us, 20 current judicial vacancies almost half have no \nnominee. In addition, many of the judicial nominations we have received \ndo not have the support of their home State Senators.\n  If the White House and Senate Republicans were serious about filling \nvacancies and not seeking to score partisan political points, the \nPresident would not make nominations that are opposed by home State \nSenators. If they were serious about filling vacancies, they would not \nspend the rest of the Bush Presidency fighting over a handful of \ncontroversial nominations, rather than working with us to make \nprogress. They would not keep criticizing us for not putting through a \nperson who was convicted of criminal fraud. If they were serious about \nfilling vacancies, the Republicans on the committee would attend \ncommittee meetings and help make a quorum to report nominations to the \nSenate.\n  I have consulted with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania and we had \nearlier exchanged letters. The former chairman knows from my January 22 \nletter what the situation is. He knows the history of the Thurmond \nrule, by\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\nwhich Republicans, then in the minority, insisted that judicial \nvacancies in the last year of a President's term remain vacant in order \nto be filled with the nominations of the next President. He understands \nthe dynamics in the last year of a President's term. And no modern \nPresident has been as divisive as this President on these issues.\n  This is the Senate. This is not Alice in Wonderland. I would rather \nsee us work with the President on his selection of nominees that the \nSenate can proceed to confirm than waste precious time fighting about \ncontroversial nominees. That is why I have urged the White House to \nwork with Senators Warner and Webb to send to the Senate without delay \nnominees to the Virginia vacancies on the fourth circuit.\n  Mr. President, you have had enormous experience in your own State. I \nask this of all Senators: If you have a highly respected Republican \nSenator and a highly respected Democratic Senator both saying we want \nthis person to be on a Federal circuit court, and they both vouch for \nhim or her, you know that person is going to go sailing through this \nplace.\n  I thank the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee this week \nfor not boycotting our meeting. As a result, we have seven nominations \non the Executive Calendar who would not be there if they continued the \nboycott.\n  I have urged the White House to work with all Senators from States \nwith vacancies on the Federal bench. We may still be able to make \nprogress before the Thurmond rule comes into effect but only with the \nfull cooperation of this President and of the Republican Members of \nthis Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, OPEC, is an international cartel. It limits the supply of \noil, which helps keep fuel prices high, and it is one of the major \ncauses of the relentless increase in oil prices.\n  This week, OPEC members met again. They refused to increase the \nsupply of oil. If such a meeting took place in almost any other \ncontext, the participants would likely be arrested for an illegal \nconspiracy in restraint of trade. Can you imagine somebody selling some \nother supplies such as medical equipment or items we need in this \nNation, electricity. Let's say the utilities all met like that and they \nsaid: We will hold back electricity so we can raise the prices. There \nwould be an antitrust suit, there would be an illegal-restraint-of-\ntrade suit brought immediately.\n  I wish the administration would join me and Senator Kohl and 68 other \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats alike--and 345 Members of the House \nof Representatives of both parties who have voted for NOPEC \nlegislation. This would hold accountable certain oil-producing nations \nfor their collusive behavior which has artificially reduced the supply \nand inflated the price of fuel.\n  In April 2004, when American consumers were paying $1.78 per gallon \nat the pump, I warned energy experts were predicting the price of gas \nmight rise to $2.50, to $3 a gallon. The administration did nothing. \nLast October, when American consumers were paying $2.87 per gallon at \nthe pump, I warned that oil might be on its way to over $100 a barrel, \nand the administration did nothing. This week, oil reached a record \n$104 a barrel and gas prices averaged $3.16 a gallon. So how much will \nfamilies in Vermont and across America have to pay to heat their homes \nin this long winter or to drive to work before the President takes \naction?\n  Further, at a news conference last week, the President was not even \naware--was not even aware as President of the United States--that many \nare predicting that gas prices will hit $3.50 or even $4 a gallon by \nspring. He simply was not aware of how crippling high prices really are \nfor Americans.\n  Two facts are painfully clear: Gas prices have more than doubled \nsince the President took office, and the President has no plan to \nprotect consumers and our economy. He promised the American people that \nwith his family's oil ties, he would effectively be able to jawbone \nOPEC into being nice to him and that they would raise production to \nlower prices if he asked them. It is now evident for all to see that it \nis just another unfulfilled commitment from the administration.\n  I said this before and I say it again today: The principal cause of \nthe relentless increase in oil prices is not just a natural supply \nissue but market manipulation by OPEC.\n  In January, the President's best attempt to increase the supply of \noil was to tell Saudi King Abdallah that paying more for gasoline hurt \nsome American families. Well, yes. It is a lot more than some families, \nit is most. I am pleased the administration acknowledges the effects of \nrising gas prices on Americans, but Saudi Arabia is a founding member \nof OPEC, and they have every incentive to limit output and keep prices \nartificially high. The futility of going to an OPEC member and pleading \nfor it to raise output is now obvious to all. Instead of President Bush \nholding hands with the oil cartel--literally and figuratively--the \nadministration should join us in trying to protect the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  It is important to emphasize again that if a meeting such as the OPEC \nmeeting that took place this week happened in almost any other context, \nthe participants would likely be arrested for an illegal conspiracy in \nrestraint of trade. Yet this President stood in front of the King of \nthe largest participant in the oil cartel and asked for relief instead \nof saying: It is an illegal activity, stop it.\n  If the administration truly acknowledges the impact artificially high \noil prices have on our Nation, he should join with this Congress and \nsupport NOPEC legislation. Instead of pleading for help, the next time \nthe President of the United States meets with members of the cartel, \nthe President should be able to explain that entities engaging in \nanticompetitive conduct that harms American consumers can expect an \ninvestigation and they can expect prosecution. When I was a prosecutor, \nit was not enough just to ask people: Don't break the law. You had to \noutright say: If you break the law, we will arrest you.\n  We cannot claim to be energy independent while we permit foreign \ngovernments to manipulate oil prices in an anticompetitive manner. It \nis wrong to let these members of OPEC off the hook just because their \nanticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of national \ngovernments.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Texas on the \nfloor.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his courtesy.\n  When the Senate debates the budget next week, we will hear a lot \nabout the tax gap. This is the name given to uncollected taxes which \nsome have said, if collected, could pay up to $300 billion in \nadditional revenue to the Federal Treasury. I wish to talk about this \nin a minute, first of all to ask the question why it is, \nnotwithstanding this so-called tax gap, we have not seen any money at \nall collected over the last year to fill that gap. But first I want to \ntalk about the intelligence gap. This has to do with the critical \ninformation the United States should be collecting in pursuit of \nradical Islamists but is not because of burdensome and unnecessary \nlegal restrictions--restrictions Congress has within its power to \nremove.\n  To the Senate's credit, in a bipartisan fashion, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee passed out a bill that I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will vote on soon. That same bill passed by a \nbipartisan majority of 68 Senators. That is not easy, but it does \ndemonstrate a bipartisan consensus in this body to make sure we have \nour eyes open and our ears open when it comes to foreign intelligence \nthat could detect, deter, and even defeat future terrorist attacks \nagainst the United States and our allies.\n  The intelligence gap is also closed not only by passing that \nimportant legislation which the House of Representatives has \ninexplicably sat on for the\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\nlast couple of weeks but also by providing protection against frivolous \nlitigation against communications providers that have assisted the \nNation in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on a voluntary basis.\n  It is no secret that the Director of National Intelligence has noted \nthat given this world of wireless communications, we need to adopt new \nmeans to intercept communications from foreign nationals to other \nforeign nationals which could well be directed through the \ninfrastructure in the United States and which, unless we pass this \nlegislation, we would not be able to intercept. The biggest problem we \nhave, of course, is that their cooperation is entirely voluntary, and \nunless we protect them under this bipartisan Senate legislation from \nfrivolous litigation, in the future not only will citizens--whether \nthey be individuals or corporate--not cooperate, but we will be left \nwith a fraction of the actionable intelligence necessary to detect, \ndeter, and defeat those whose sole wish is the murder of innocent \nAmericans.\n  I quote the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nwho said:\n\n       What people have to understand here is the quality of \n     intelligence we are going to receive is going to be degraded.\n\n  Those, of course, are not my remarks, and they are not the words of a \nmember of the Bush administration; those are the words of Jay \nRockefeller, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. That is why this legislation passed out of the Senate with a \nstrong bipartisan vote.\n  I don't know about the political implications of the Democratic House \nleadership's failure to act responsibly, and I am not here to talk \nabout politics, but I do know there are serious national security \ninterests that we face, and threats, and the majority of Democrats in \nthe House are not taking those threats seriously enough. So rather than \ntaking a vacation from their duties, it is past time for the House to \nact and to do the responsible thing. I hope Speaker Pelosi and Majority \nLeader Hoyer will call up this important bipartisan legislation and \nallow an up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate legislation that will \nmake this Nation safer from the terrorist threats we face.\n  Mr. President, I have other remarks I wish to make, but I see the \ndistinguished majority leader on the floor. I want to make sure--if he \nhas any housekeeping business he wants to take care of, I will be glad \nto defer to him for that purpose and then to reclaim the floor later \non. I do not want to have him necessarily have to wait.\n  I understand he is motioning for me to continue, and I will do that. \nI thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my friend from Texas \nallowing me to do that, but he should finish his statement, and I will \ndo some wrap-up when he finishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1733-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1733-S1734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I wish to now transition to talk about the issue that \nwill be in front of the Senate next week, and this has to do with the \nFederal budget.\n  This is so important across so many areas because not only does this \nbudget talk about what the tax burden of hard-working Americans will be \nin the coming year, it also has an impact on energy costs, on health \ninsurance costs, on the ability of Americans to buy homes. How do we \ncreate better schools for better jobs? How do we deal with the issue of \nrunaway lawsuits that threaten the business environment and have a \ndampening effect on job creation? How do we revive capital markets, \nrebuild our roads, bridges, railroads and airports? How do we provide a \nsimpler, fairer tax system than we have now? And How do we make sure \nAmericans retain the right to work in the job of their choosing without \nhaving to become part of a union when they don't want to?\n  The part of this budget that concerns me the most is not the proposed \n$1.2 trillion tax hike that is contemplated under this budget that \npassed strictly along party lines in the Budget Committee yesterday \nafternoon, although that is bad enough. It will hit family budgets \nhard. Mr. President, 43 million families will owe an average of $2,300 \nmore in 2009 in taxes as a result of this budget if it is adopted on \nthe Senate floor. I am also concerned about the spending increase under \nthis budget, some $211 billion in additional spending that is part of \nthis budget proposed from the Budget Committee that will be before the \nSenate this next week. That means, in fiscal year 2009, if adopted, a \n9-percent increase over what the Federal Government spent in fiscal \nyear 2008. Now, as bad as the higher taxes and higher spending is, I \nwish I could say that was the end of the story, but it goes on from \nthere and it doesn't get any better.\n\n  As a result of the increased spending and the increased taxes \ncontemplated under this budget, America will find itself $2 trillion \ndeeper in debt by the year 2013 if this budget is adopted. That is more \nthan $6,000 in extra debt for every American.\n  And I would say this budget also fails in another important respect. \nIt fails to deal with the impending crisis in entitlement spending and \nthe future insolvency of both Medicare and Social Security, two \nimportant safety net programs, and ones we have made a promise to fund \nand to make sure is there for not only present beneficiaries of these \nprograms but for our children and grandchildren as well. We know that \nunless something dramatic happens, we will not be able to keep that \ncommitment.\n  As a matter of fact, unless this Congress acts, there is $66 trillion \nin unfunded responsibilities under the current entitlement programs we \nneed to fix; that we need to take into account.\n  Now, there is an important piece of legislation I think we ought to \ntake up and that is the Conrad-Gregg task force to deal with this \ngathering storm of an entitlement crisis. It is a bipartisan bill by \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Budget Committee. But we are \nnot taking that up, as we should, as part of dealing with the Federal \nbudget. Because we know that if we don't do anything, there is going to \nbe a terrible financial catastrophe, and the people who will ultimately \nsuffer as a result of our failure to act will be future beneficiaries \nunder Social Security and Medicare--our children, our grandchildren, \nand future generations.\n  The last thing I wish to mention with regard to the budget is what \nthe Wall Street Journal has called the pay-go farce. You will recall \nthat pay-go was the name given to pay-as-you-go requirements under the \nbudget. Sounds good. That is what the family budget has to do. If there \nis no money coming in the front door, then you are not going to be able \nto spend yourself into debt. You pay as you go. That is the way most \nbusinesses operate but not the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment can continue to print money and spend money it doesn't have \nand pass the debt down to our children and grandchildren.\n  If you take into account this unfunded liability of $66 trillion \nbecause of the entitlement crisis--the gathering storm I mentioned a \nmoment ago--that boils down to about $175,000 per person--every man, \nwoman, and child--that we owe now for those unfunded liabilities unless \nwe take action now. But the pay-go farce the Wall Street Journal \narticle mentions--and the date of this article is December 10, 2007--\nquotes Speaker  Nancy Pelosi in remarks she made on December 12, 2006. \nShe said:\n\n       Democrats are committed to ending years of irresponsible \n     budget policies that have produced historic deficits. Instead \n     of compiling trillions of dollars of debt onto our children \n     and grandchildren, we will restore pay-as-you-go budget \n     discipline.\n\n  Now, I have to tell you, just taken at face value, that sounds pretty \ngood. We do need to take responsibility. We do need to do that on a \nbipartisan basis. But the pay-go promise made by this Congress looks \nlike Swiss cheese. There are so many holes in it that you could drive--\nnot to mix my metaphors--but you could drive a truck through it. And \nlet me explain why.\n  First of all, these pay-go rules that promise financial discipline do \nnot apply to discretionary spending. That is about $1 trillion a year. \nAnd it doesn't restrain spending increases under current law in \nentitlements,\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nsuch as Medicare or Medicaid, the programs I mentioned a moment ago. \nThe main goal, and this is a problem, is that it is designed to make \ntax relief for working families and small businesses almost impossible.\n  Now, we ran into this pay-go requirement when it came to relieving \nmiddle-class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax this last \nDecember. And I agree in that instance it was important to waive the \npay-go requirement. Because, frankly, if you will recall, the \nalternative minimum tax was never designed to hit the middle class. But \nbecause it was not indexed for inflation this last year, it covered 6 \nmillion taxpayers. If we hadn't acted, it would have hit 23 million \nmiddle-class taxpayers. So I agree it was appropriate not to require \npay-as-you-go principles for that alternative minimum tax that Congress \nnever intended the middle class to have to pay.\n  As a matter of fact, back in the 1960s, the alternative minimum tax \nwas adopted, as a result of a report issued by the Department of \nTreasury that said that 155 high-income taxpayers did not pay Federal \nincome tax because of other deductions. But as is typical in schemes \ndesigned to ``tax the rich,''--we have heard that before--eventually it \ngrows and grows and grows to cover the middle class. So be wary when \nCongress says: We are only going to tax the rich. That means we all \nneed to put our hand on our wallet because it eventually grows into a \nmiddle-class tax.\n  Another time Congress used the pay-go gimmick, which gives rise to \nthe title of this article called ``The Pay-go Farce,'' was on SCHIP. \nNow, you will recall that is the State Children's Health Insurance \nPlan, something we all support on a bipartisan basis. But the way it \nwas proposed by the leadership last year, to fund the 140-percent \nincrease in this program, was a joke. The SCHIP bill included a \nspending cliff that disguised its actual cost. It assumed spending \nwould rise to $14 billion by 2012, but then pretended the costs would \nfall to less than half in 2013, which just so happens to fall outside \nthe 5-year budget scoring window. Some $60 billion in spending over the \nnext 10 years were hidden through this ploy of creating a cliff in \nspending, suggesting that somehow Congress would cut this program in \nhalf and deny children access to health insurance, something we all \nknow would not happen.\n\n  So that is why the pay-go requirement has been called a farce and why \nI likened it to Swiss cheese. It has so many holes in it, it doesn't do \nwhat it has promised to do, which is to restore budget discipline; and \nit unfairly impacts the ability to provide tax relief to working \nfamilies in a way that can grow the economy and allow people to keep \nmore of what they earn--money they can use to pay for things like \neducation, health care, and transportation.\n  As a matter of fact, as a result of the 2001-2003 tax relief that \nthis Congress voted on and passed in the wake of 9/11, in the wake of \nthe stock market scandals, and with the recession at the beginning of \nthat decade, we saw more than 50 months of uninterrupted job growth in \nthe country, with 9 million new jobs being created. It should not be \nsurprising that tax relief ends up being one of the best stimulae we \ncould possibly give the economy. We saw Federal revenues at historic \nhighs and that is because more people working means more people paying \ntaxes and more revenue to the Federal Government; and thus the budget \ndeficit reduced from roughly 1.9 percent of the gross domestic product \nto about 1.2 last year.\n  So, in closing, I would say this debate we are going to have next \nweek is vitally important, and the question is: Are we going to wreck \nthe Federal budget or will we find ways to help families balance their \nbudget, especially with the economic challenges that they face? It is \nall about taxing, it is all about spending, it is all about whether we \nare going to increase the Federal debt, it is all about whether we are \ngoing to meet our responsibilities as elected officials to deal with \nthe impending entitlement crisis which threatens to act similar to a \ntsunami and engulf us in a huge wave of red ink.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the majority leader, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say a few words about a number of \nissues today. I think we have had a productive week. I did wish to say \na few words about the FISA bill--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct.\n  Both the House and the Senate have passed bills to strengthen the \n1978 FISA law. The House passed its bill in November, and we passed our \nbill several weeks ago. Since Senate passage, the chairmen of the \nSenate and House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees have been \nworking to resolve their differences between the two pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Democratic staffers have been meeting to work out a strong and \nbroadly supported final bill, but with the exception of Senator \nSpecter, Republicans have instructed their staffs not to participate in \nthese negotiations.\n  Today, the Republican leader asserted on the Senate floor once again \nthat the Senate bill should be jammed through the House. As my friend, \nthe Republican leader, knows, that is not how Congress works and never \nhas worked that way. The law-making process dictates the House pass a \nbill, the Senate then passes a bill, or vice versa, and then Members in \nboth Chambers work through their differences in a conference to see if \nthey can work out a compromise.\n  On numerous occasions, the Republican leader himself has insisted \nupon following that time-honored method of legislating. On issues such \nas the Children's Health Insurance, raising the minimum wage, and Iraq \nwar funding, Senator McConnell has refused to jam a House bill through \nthe Senate. But now, he insists we must jam a Senate bill through the \nHouse. Demanding the House of Representatives pass the Senate's FISA \nbill--as is--and refusing to sit down and talk to negotiate differences \naccomplishes nothing but needlessly delaying final passage of that \nbill.\n  I know my Republican colleagues are as serious about protecting the \nsafety and security of all American people as are Democrats. If the \nRepublican leader is interested, and I am sure he is, in getting this \ndone, I invite him to sit down anytime with House leadership and \ncommittee chairmen--and I will be happy to be there--to work out a \nfinal bill.\n  Will it be a painful discussion? No, it would not be. Would it take a \nlong time? No, it would not. It would not be a political exercise. It \nwould be an exercise in responsible lawmaking. That is how we have done \nit for 233 years.\n  We should be negotiating on a bipartisan basis. A new FISA law that \npasses with broad bipartisan support in both Houses will provide \ngreater certainty to the intelligence community to make our Nation \nstronger. That can only happen if Republicans take a seat at the table, \nand it can only happen if President Bush lays aside the overheated \nrhetoric and embraces bipartisan negotiations.\n  In order to facilitate these discussions, we have suggested a \ntemporary extension of the Protect America Act--that is what I just \ndid--that would ensure there are no gaps in our intelligence gathering \nwhile we work for a long-term solution. That is common sense. Even \nAdmiral McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, has testified an \nextension would be valuable. But President Bush has threatened to veto \nan extension, and our Republican\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\ncolleagues continue to follow his lead in lockstep.\n  The President can't have it both ways. He has said many times: Why \ndon't they extend the legislation? We tried to. He would not let us. So \nit simply is illogical as to what he is talking about.\n  Never in our Nation's history has national security succumbed to this \nkind of political posturing. It is time for my Republican colleagues to \nwithdraw their opposition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1735-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1735-S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MORNING NEWS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I usually listen to public radio. \nI am anxious to hear the news in the morning to see what has happened.\n  This morning, hearing the morning news was very distressing. It was a \nterrible day both at home and abroad in Iraq. A coordinated suicide \nbombing killed--we don't know how many at this stage--at last count, \nabout 70 and injured at least 120. We don't know how many, but 120 will \ndie. It happened in a crowded Baghdad shopping district.\n  A couple days ago, another attack killed 26.

This \ndoesn't take into consideration the kidnappings, the small bombings, \nand other acts of terror that take place in Iraq every day.\n  Although it may have receded from the front pages of our newspapers, \nthere is no doubt the Iraqi civil war wages on, with no end in sight.\n  There are 150,000 brave young Americans in that far-off land policing \nanother country's civil war. Our troops are shouldering an enormous \nburden of the war, but all Americans are suffering the consequences. We \nare now spending $12 billion a month on that war. That is more than \n$400 million every day, $17 million every hour. In my short remarks \nhere, we will wind up spending about $5 million in Iraq. Mr. President, \n$12 billion a month from a country, our country, that is staggering \neconomically; $12 billion a month to build roads in Iraq while our own \nroads crumble.\n  From where does this money come? It is all borrowed. President Bush \nalready burned through trillions of dollars prudently saved by the \nClinton administration and has spent trillions of dollars on tax \ngiveaways for big business and the superwealthy.\n  We are putting the cost of the war on credit cards. Who will pay the \nbill? My children, my children's children and my children's children's \nchildren will be paying this bill. Future generations will be burdened \nwith paying this bill, plus interest; meanwhile, the burden of an \neconomy that is spiraling downward every day.\n  This morning's news on the economy announced the U.S. economy lost \n63,000 jobs last month. When I first started listening to the news this \nmorning, they expected this report to come out that they expected 5,000 \njobs lost. They were 58,000 wrong; there were 63,000 jobs lost--the \nlargest monthly job loss in nearly 5 years. For the second month in a \nrow, our country has lost jobs. We also learned that the number of jobs \nlost in January was larger than previously reported. The number has \nbeen revised up to more than 20,000.\n  It comes as no surprise that the manufacturing and construction \nsectors were among the hardest hit. Manufacturing had 52,000 jobs lost; \nconstruction, 39,000 job losses. Homebuilders are laying off \nconstruction workers as new homes remain unsold. Today, we learned the \nfourth quarter of 2007 saw the highest level of homes having \nforeclosure in our history. And now the amount of equity Americans have \nin their homes has dropped to the lowest level since World War II.\n  Yesterday, oil went to more than $106 a barrel. We all remember when \nwe were concerned when it hit $50 a barrel. It was good news last night \nbecause it dropped to $105.47 a barrel.\n  The American people are already struggling under the enormous burden \nof skyrocketing prices for groceries, heat for their homes, gasoline.\n  I heard my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from Texas, say \nthat during the Bush administration 9 million jobs have been created. \nThat is nothing to brag about. During the Clinton 8 years--this \nPresident has been on the job 7 years and going on 3 months--President \nClinton created 23 million jobs.\n  By every indication, things are getting worse. President Bush said \nthis week that he does not believe our country is heading for a \nrecession. This morning, all signs say he is wrong. But regardless of \nwhat label we use, there is no doubt whatever that people in America \nare suffering. There is likewise no doubt that if we do not take \naction, things will get worse.\n  The economic stimulus bill we passed last month will help. I am \npleased Democrats were able to secure rebates for 21.5 million senior \ncitizens and 250,000 disabled American veterans in the bill that was \npassed. There is no doubt that an extra $600 will help Americans pay \nfor groceries, health, and gas. But no one thinks this economic \nstimulus is enough to turn our economy around. We must legislate the \ngrowing housing crisis--the eye of the economic storm.\n  President Bush, who does not think America is headed for a recession, \nresponded to the housing crisis by directing Secretary Paulson to \ncreate a voluntary program to encourage banks to work with homeowners \nfacing foreclosure. Do we need a directive from the President to tell \nbanks to work with homeowners who are facing foreclosure? I hope not.\n  This week, Secretary Paulson released data on the President's \nproposal. How did the voluntary approach work? Not very well. Just a \ndrop in the bucket. It helps hardly any; some say about 2 percent. For \nhundreds of thousands, the only thing this offer did was to add on the \namount of the missed payment to the amount due. That is not a \nmodification. That will do nothing to help struggling families keep \ntheir homes.\n  The voluntary efforts Secretary Paulson led have had a positive \nimpact but not much. Even one family saved from foreclosure is a good \nstep. But with millions at risk to lose their homes and the news \ngrowing worse every day, the Bush administration's voluntary program is \nnot the way to approach this.\n  Last week, we introduced a comprehensive housing stimulus bill that \nwould help hundreds of thousands of homeowners that the President's \nvoluntary program leaves behind. It has five points to help families \navoid foreclosure: First, by improving loan disclosures. Second, we \nhelp families avoid foreclosure by increasing preforeclosure counseling \nfunds. Third, we expand refinancing opportunities for homeowners stuck \nin bad loans. Fourth, we provide funds to help the highest need \ncommunities purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties. Fifth, we \namend the Bankruptcy Code to allow home loans on primary residences to \nbe modified.\n  How have our Republican colleagues responded to our responsible plan? \nThey blocked us from going forward, stopped us. The Republicans \nproposed an alternative plan consisting of four concepts. One of these \nwas to change the tort law. This is not the way to go. One of their \nother proposals was to lower taxes. This is not the way to go.\n  Just this week, Chairman Bernanke said the crisis demands a vigorous \nresponse. He said:\n\n       Reducing the rate of preventable foreclosures would promote \n     economic stability for households, neighborhood, and the \n     Nation as a whole. Although lenders and servicers have scaled \n     up their efforts and adopted a wider variety of loss-\n     mitigation techniques, more can, and should, be done.\n\n  Those are the words of Chairman Bernanke, a call for our legislation \nto pass. That is what we need to do. Voluntary programs will not work. \nWe have to move forward. We ask the Republicans to join with us in this \nmost important legislation and stop blocking our ability to stimulate \nthe economy as it relates to housing. They have to stop being beholden \nto the big banks and Wall Street and be beholden to the people who are \nin trouble--middle-class America.\n  We have a few things left here.\n  My friend from Montana, who has, at this stage of the year, probably \nthe most important job in the Senate, being chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--every problem we have, we go to the Finance Committee to see \nwhat we can do to work it out. So I appreciate the good work of my \nfriend from Montana. The people of Montana are fortunate to have this \ngood man as their Senator because we all know that\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\nwith Senator Baucus, Montana comes first, but we all know, all of us \nserving in the Senate, that he is a reservoir of good will, \nintelligence, and understanding, and he helps us all with our problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I speak today in tribute to a friend, \nLaurie Sullivan, who passed away late last month.\n  Laurie was a lawyer, a legislative advocate, and a business leader. I \nadmired Laurie professionally and personally. But I was not alone, \nbecause everyone admired Laurie.\n  Laurie was a cut above the rest. Washington is a place where people \ncan lose their way. Not Laurie. She was grounded. And she was centered.\n  Laurie stood out because she was in it for the right reasons. She \nbuilt a well-respected consulting firm, because she cared about good \npolicy. She cared about making Government work.\n  People admired Laurie for her intelligence, her wit, and her \ngraciousness. She was a breath of fresh air. A veteran of Capitol Hill, \nLaurie was confident enough to take her work seriously, but not so much \nthat she couldn't laugh or share a joke.\n  People were drawn to Laurie because she was the kind of person who \ngave energy. She didn't take it.\n  Nothing made Laurie happier than being with her family. She talked \nabout her nieces and nephews frequently. Her face lit up each time she \nmentioned their latest activities or accomplishments. She was proud of \nthem. And she treasured the time that she spent with them. She \ndescribed trips with her family as priceless memories.\n  Laurie was also a very generous person. And her generosity was not \nlimited to her family. She gave generously of her time and resources to \nher community and her friends.\n  She worked with a local mentoring program focusing on teenagers who \nhad experienced a death in the family. She hired a student from the \nUniversity of Virginia at Wise. The student worked at her firm for the \nsummer. Laurie gave him a laptop computer. She helped him pay his \ncollege bills.\n  Laurie also gave advice. She counseled her nieces and nephews. She \ncounseled the students whom she mentored. She recommended strategies \nfor her clients. And she counseled women who were starting a business.\n  She gave her views on healthcare and politics to me and other \nSenators who were lucky enough to be part of her circle of friends. Her \nadvice was always solid.\n  When her nieces and nephews followed her advice, they prospered. \nLaurie's business grew, because her clients learned that she was right. \nThe students she mentored succeeded in college.\n  Laurie was truly a wonderful person. She knew what was most important \nin this world. And she made the most of it while she was with us. We \nshould all be so lucky as to live that way.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1736-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL AFTERSCHOOL ASSOCIATION 20TH ANNIVERSARY CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, next week, members of the afterschool \ncommunity will be gathering for the 20th anniversary of the National \nAfterSchool Association Conference. The initial conference held two \ndecades ago marked the first formal meeting of afterschool \nprofessionals under their own organization to discuss and develop \nsolutions to address the needs of school-age children during their \nhours out of school.\n  Of course, back then we didn't call it afterschool. Instead, we \ntalked about ``latchkey'' programs for ``latchkey kids.'' At the \noutset, these programs replaced the need for latchkeys around the neck \nwith welcoming, safe, and nurturing environments; they were a prime \nfactor in the creation of the Act for Better Child Care.\n  As pioneers in the school-age movement, this passionate, dedicated \ngroup of leaders recognized that the needs of these students were \ndistinct from those of early childhood. Their movement helped school-\nage providers network and share resources, culminating in the creation \nof the National School-Age Care Alliance, which later became the \nNational Afterschool Association, NAA. Over time, 36 State affiliates \nwere established.\n  In the past two decades, the field has evolved and NAA with it. \nParents wanted more opportunities for their children, and the need for \nassuring quality programming became evident. In collaboration with the \nSchool Age Child Project at Wellesley College, NAA developed national \nquality standards and a national accreditation process for afterschool \nprograms. These standards became the foundation for other groups' \nguidelines for programs for school-age children.\n  The NAA continues to be a leading voice in the afterschool community \nwith almost 10,000 members nationally and internationally. The \nprofessionals who make up NAA's membership supply a critical component \nof quality programs, providing children with high-quality programming \nand positive relationships with adult mentors. The NAA has worked on \nbehalf of the afterschool workforce to improve its quality and ensure \nthat the profession's voice is heard. Today, their annual conference \nremains a key way for the afterschool community to share and network.\n  Afterschool has grown by leaps and bounds and now includes a \ndiversity of programs providing a wide array of opportunities for young \npeople. These programs tackle a variety of issues including bolstering \nacademic performance, preventing childhood obesity, and exposing \nchildren to the arts and music. Through time, the NAA has always \nmaintained its commitment to supporting quality programs with well-\ntrained staff dedicated to helping children grow to the best of their \nabilities. Because of the NAA, parents can more successfully balance \ntheir work and home life and millions of American children have safe \nplaces to grow and develop when the school day ends.\n  I am proud to join with those in attendance at this milestone NAA \nconference celebrating the journey of the past 20 years. I congratulate \nthe members of the afterschool community on this special anniversary \nand thank them for their hard work creating safe and engaging \nenvironments for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1736-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COSPONSORS OF S. 2716\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize March 8, 2008, \nas Suddenly Sleepy Saturday--A Day of Narcolepsy Awareness, part of \nNational Sleep Awareness Week. Sleep is an integral part of health and \noverall well-being, and its importance cannot be stressed enough. Sleep \ndisorders present a chronic health threat that can compromise normal \nphysical, mental, and emotional functioning. There are an estimated \n135,000 Americans suffering from narcolepsy, and half of that total \nremains undiagnosed.\n  Narcolepsy is a chronic disorder, which causes excessive daytime \nsleepiness, irresistible sleep attacks, and cataplexy--a loss of muscle \ntone, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted \nnighttime sleep in women, men, and children of all ethnic backgrounds. \nSymptoms often begin in the teen years and increase over time. \nUndiagnosed narcolepsy can impair educational goals, relationships, \ncareer success, and even one's independence.\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\n  Suddenly Sleepy Saturday is an effort to lead the estimated 65,000 \nAmericans who are living with undiagnosed narcolepsy to a proper \ndiagnosis and treatment. This day of awareness will allow for expanding \nknowledge of life with narcolepsy and will allow participating \ncommunities to better support people who struggle with the challenges \nof this chronic neurological disorder. I am pleased that many South \nDakotans, including those in Aberdeen, SD, will be commemorating \nSuddenly Sleepy Saturday and raising awareness of narcolepsy.\n  I urge all citizens to support the search for the cause, cure, and \nprevention of narcolepsy and assist those individuals and families who \ndeal with this devastating disorder on a daily basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1737-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on March 8 we will commemorate \nInternational Women's Day, which, since 1911, has given us an \nopportunity to pause and assess the status of women worldwide. Since \nthat time, we have seen great achievements by women in many parts of \nthe world. The last century began with women in the United States \nfighting for the right to vote, while today we see the first real \nchance that a woman will be elected President.\n  While substantial progress has been made here and in other countries, \nmillions of women around the world continue to live in poverty and \nfear. Women are denied decent health care, denied economic \nopportunities, denied education, and denied security for themselves and \ntheir children. Women face epidemic levels of violence. One in three \nwomen worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. \nIn some countries, that is true for 70 percent of women. No country is \nimmune. From the trafficking of women in Eastern Europe, to ``honor'' \nkillings in the Middle East, to the use of rape as a weapon of war in \nDarfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, violence against women \nand girls crosses all borders and affects women in all social groups, \nreligions and socioeconomic classes.\n  A recently released survey of 1,500 women in Iraq by Women for Women \nInternational indicates that women there are suffering high levels of \nviolence. The survey found that 63.9 percent of those surveyed believe \nthat violence against women is increasing for reasons including lack of \nrespect for women's rights and a worsening economy. The report quotes a \npolice chief in the southern city of Basra who says that ``[r]eligious \nvigilantes have killed at least 40 women this year . . . because of how \nthey dressed, their mutilated bodies found with notes warning against \n`violating Islamic teachings.' ''\n  Violence has a profound impact on the health and development of \ncountries worldwide. Violence against women and girls violates their \nbasic human rights. It impedes women's full and active participation in \ntheir communities and societies. And it limits our effort to foster \ndevelopment around the world. Violence prevents girls from going to \nschool, stops women from holding jobs, and limits access to critical \nhealth care for women and their children. We can't eradicate poverty \nand disease unless we prevent and respond to the violence women face in \ntheir own homes and communities. And we can't empower women to become \nactive in civic life and promote peace, prosperity and democracy unless \nthey personally are free from fear of violence. It is no surprise, \nthen, that at this year's World Economic Forum, Secretary Rice stated \nthat if she could focus on one thing in developing countries, it would \nbe the empowerment of women.\n  Violence against women is a global health crisis, not just because so \nmany women and girls are injured and die but also because the violence \ninterferes with efforts to save the lives of pregnant women and babies. \nRape increases vulnerability to HIV-AIDS transmission. In sub-Saharan \nAfrica alone, women account for close to three-quarters of those living \nwith HIV-AIDS between the ages 18 and 24.\n  The picture is grim and can be discouraging. But the good news is \nthat local organizations are working in communities around the world \nwith courage, sensitivity, and success to help women overcome violence \nat home, in school, and at work. Governments are bringing together all \nsectors of their country to try to prevent and end abuse. But they need \nour help.\n  We have made tremendous progress in reducing violence against women \nhere in the United States since we passed the Violence Against Women \nAct, VAWA, in 1994. It is time to throw our weight and leadership \nbehind efforts to help women and their families worldwide lead safer, \nhealthier lives. Stopping gender-based violence isn't just the moral \nthing to do; it is also smart diplomacy since violence contributes to \nthe poverty, inequality, and instability that threaten our security.\n  Last fall, Senator Lugar and I introduced S. 2279, the International \nViolence Against Women Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation \nwould ensure that our foreign assistance programs include efforts to \nend gender-based violence.\n  We would accomplish this goal in three ways:\n  First, we propose to reorganize and rejuvenate the gender-related \nefforts of the State Department by creating one central office--the \nOffice for Women's Global Initiatives, directed by a Senate-confirmed \nAmbassador who reports directly to the Secretary of State. The \ncoordinator will monitor and coordinate all U.S. resources, programs, \nand aid abroad that deal with women's issues, including gender-based \nviolence. This centralization will ensure the most efficient use of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Second, we mandate a 5-year, comprehensive strategy to combat \nviolence against women in 10 to 20 targeted countries. We would \nallocate $175 million a year to support programs dealing with violence \nagainst women in five areas: the criminal and civil justice system, \nhealth care, access to education and school safety, women's economic \nempowerment, and public awareness campaigns that change social norms.\n  Third, we know through terrible experience that women and girls are \nespecially vulnerable to violence in humanitarian crises and in \nconflict and postconflict situations. Reports of refugee women being \nraped while collecting firewood, soldiers sexually abusing girls \nthrough bribery with token food items, or women subjected to torture as \na tool of war are horrific. The act requires training for workers and \npeacekeeping forces and establishes reporting mechanisms and other \nemergency measures.\n  The issue of violence against women and girls is complex, and our \nlegislation is ambitious. We are mindful that no country has a perfect \nrecord or all the answers. Yet Congress has a long and proud history of \ntackling complex international problems, most recently the epidemic of \nHIV-AIDS and the crime of human trafficking.\n  Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``Violence \nagainst women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And \nit is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, \nculture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be \nmaking real progress towards equity, development and peace.'' We could \nnot agree more. Our International Violence Against Women Act brings \ntogether, for the first time, coordinated American resources and \nleadership to this global issue.\n  We believe the time is now for the United States to get actively \nengaged in the fight for women's lives and girls' futures. There is no \nbetter way to commemorate International Women's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1737-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1737-S1739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my complete support for H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Reform Act, which passed the Senate yesterday with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority. Regrettably, I was unable to vote on \nfinal passage of H.R. 4040, as I had a previous commitment that \nprevented me from being there. However, I believe so strongly in the \nGovernment's responsibility to maintain the highest level of product \nsafety that I wanted the Congressional Record to reflect how pleased I \nam that the Senate passed H.R. 4040, after substituting the text of S. \n2663 as amended, and to extend my congratulations to the bill's \nprincipal\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nsponsors, Senator Mark Pryor and Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Throughout the past few years, our Nation has experienced an \nunfortunately large number of recalls on products that have been \nimported into our country. Of particular concern to me, and to many of \nmy colleagues, as well as to parents and all citizens across the \ncountry are the millions of children's toys that were recalled due to \ndangerous levels of lead and other toxins or dangerously defective \nproduct design or manufacture. These recalls left many parents \nwondering whether any of the toys they purchased for their children \nwere safe. It was time for the Senate to work together to protect \nAmerica's consumers and children, and with the passage of H.R. 4040, we \nhave done that and, I believe, done it well.\n  Much blame has been placed on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, CPSC, for failing to adequately protect consumers from \ndangerous products entering the United States. Whether this was being \ntoo lax with regard to negligible product safety standards for toys and \nother items produced abroad, or ineffective and often toothless \noversight of the manufacturing and design process wherever the toys \nwere made, there is more than enough blame to spread around. While I \ncertainly recognize the important contributions of the dedicated career \nemployees at the CPSC, it is clear that the CPSC lacks the adequate \nresources, and political will, to combat this growing problem.\n  With the passage of H.R. 4040, the Senate has taken a very good step \ntoward addressing many of the problems we have seen in recent years by \nincreasing funding for the CPSC, increasing penalties for manufacturers \nthat violate consumer protection laws, reducing the levels of lead in \nchildren's products, requiring labeling so that parents can know when \ntheir children's toys have been recalled, and allowing State attorneys \ngeneral to help enforce Federal consumer protection laws for the \nbenefit of citizens throughout West Virginia and across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, again I would like to express my support for H.R. \n4040, as amended by the remark on March 6, 2008, and thank my \ncolleagues for all of their hard work to pass legislation that will \nbetter protect consumers and children from dangerous products.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate passed S. 2663, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act, by an overwhelming \nmargin of 79 to 13. This significant legislation has the potential to \nbenefit every consumer and, most notably, protect America's children.\n  Imagine the heartbroken look on a child's face when a favorite toy is \nconfiscated because it's unsafe.\n  Then try to imagine the much greater pain felt by a parent whose \nchild has been poisoned or injured or even killed by an unsafe toy.\n  So far this year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, has \nissued no fewer than six toy recalls just due to lead paint safety \nviolations. These recalls affect over 75,000 toys. There were 473 \nrecalls last year. In fact, as a few of my distinguished colleagues \nhave noted, one of the ``must-have'' toys last year, AquaDots, was \nrecalled just prior to the holidays--and for good reason. The Dots \ncontained a potentially coma-inducing toxic coating.\n  American consumers have the right to expect that the products they \nbuy are safe. The CPSC should be able to provide that assurance. \nUnfortunately, in recent years, we have seen numerous examples when the \nCPSC has not been up to the job.\n  The CPSC has suffered from the antiregulatory zeal that has been \npopular in recent years. Products under the Commission's jurisdiction \ncause more than 28,000 deaths and 33.6 million injuries each year, but \nfunding for CPSC has been slashed and the staff is half the size it was \n30 years ago.\n  The bill the Senate has passed will strengthen the CPSC by giving it \nthe staff, enforcement powers, and other resources it needs to monitor \na rapidly changing and ever-expanding global marketplace. S. 2663 will \ngive American consumers--89 percent of whom are aware of the recent \nrecalls--greater peace of mind.\n  S. 2663 provides critical budget and staffing resources necessary to \nprovide for increased safety monitoring. The bill bans lead from \nchildren's products and subjects all toys to comprehensive hazard \ntesting. And it mandates independent testing of many children's \nproducts. But all the increased testing and regulations in the world \nare only as good as the ability to back them up with meaningful \npenalties for violators. So S. 2663 increases the per-violation civil \npenalties cap to help deter violations.\n  I am grateful to the bill managers for including my amendment--No. \n4103--to address the issue of training standards for safety inspectors. \nS. 2663 nearly doubles current funding levels over the next 7 years--\nwhich I think is a good idea. And it increases the CPSC staff to at \nleast 500 by 2013--which I also think is a good idea. But if there is \ngoing to be a rapid expansion of the staff, I think it would be useful \nfor the CPSC to develop training standards for product safety \ninspectors and technical staff and to consult with a broad range of \nconsumer product safety organizations in developing those standards. My \namendment merely directs the CPSC to develop such standards--again, in \nconsultation with groups that have expertise in such matters--within \n180 days of enactment and to submit a report to Congress on the \nstandards.\n  I am also grateful the bill managers included an amendment, No. 4113, \nSenator Obama and I introduced to clarify, expand, and standardize the \ninformation contained in recall notices.\n  We have passed a bill that will help keep dangerous products off \nstore shelves, out of our homes, and out of the hands of our children \nand grandchildren. We have passed a bill that will help restore \nconsumer confidence in product safety. I am proud the Senate has passed \nthis legislation, and I congratulate the bill managers--Senators Pryor, \nStevens, Inouye and Collins--for crafting it and bringing it to the \nfloor with such broad, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission Reform Bill, which the Senate passed earlier today. I \nwas pleased to cast my vote in support of this important bipartisan \nbill, and I thank Senators Pryor and Stevens for their hard work in \nbringing this measure to the floor.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, is one of our \nNation's most important Federal agencies. The Commission's principal \nresponsibility entails protecting Americans from risks associated with \nproducts sold in the United States. Each year, it develops and enforces \nsafety standards for thousands of goods. These goods range from toys to \nhouse-wares.\n  We live in an age of increasing global trade. Consequently, the \nactivities of the CPSC here become more important, as Americans \npurchase and consume a greater number of products manufactured in \nforeign nations. In order to meet these expanded responsibilities, the \nCPSC requires enhanced resources and authorities. I am pleased that the \nbill passed today provides these enhanced resources and authorities.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission reform bill includes new \nsafety standards for a variety of products, including cigarette \nlighters, furniture, swimming pools, equestrian helmets, portable \ngasoline containers, strollers, and cribs. It strengthens the \ncertification of safety-standard compliance, establishes more stringent \nstandards on lead in paint, reforms third-party testing for product \nsafety and compliance, and increases civil and/or criminal penalties \nfor noncompliance. The bill also increases CPSC personnel in major \nports-of-entry, prohibits CPSC personnel from taking industry-sponsored \ntravel, prohibits the sale of products that are the subject of a \nrecall, expands jurisdiction of the CPSC to cover amusement park rides \nat a fixed site, and fosters greater coordination among the various \nagencies involved in consumer safety issues.\n  Further, the legislation doubles the current CPSC authorization level \nfor fiscal year 2009 to $88,500,000, and increases the level to \n$155,900,000 by fiscal year 2015. This bill also authorizes $40 million \nfor fiscal year 2009 for the improvement of the Commission's research, \ndevelopment, and testing facilities, and also provides $1 million for \nfiscal year 2009 for research into safety issues related to the use of \nnanotechnology in consumer products.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill contains two provisions that \nI\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\nworked to advance regarding new CPSC safety standards for swimming pool \ndrains and equestrian helmets. These standards are vital towards \nprotecting children against accidental drowning and horse-related \ninjuries respectively. I was pleased to work with my colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee in drafting these standards and incorporating them \ninto the bill.\n  In closing, I believe the Consumer Product Safety Commission reform \nbill will allow the CPSC to fulfill its responsibility of protecting \nAmericans more effectively, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on future such legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1739-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING EVE CARSON\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Miss Eve Carson, \nstudent body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. Miss Carson's life was tragically cut short on Wednesday morning.\n  I send my deepest condolences to Eve's family, the Chapel Hill \ncommunity, and all those who came to know of her service and compassion \nfor others.\n  Eve Marie Carson was born to Bob Carson and Teresa Bethke in Athens, \nGeorgia, on November 19, 1985. She attended Clarke Central High School, \nwhere she served as student body president.\n  Eve enrolled at UNC in the fall of 2004 as a recipient of the \nprestigious Morehead Scholarship. Miss Carson left an indelible mark on \nthe university and its community during her 3\\1/2\\ years in college.\n  Eve excelled as a student at the University of North Carolina. She \nwas a political science and biology major and hoped to attend medical \nschool next year. Miss Carson was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor \nsociety and served as a North Carolina Fellow.\n  Eve was dedicated to helping those around her. She taught science at \nFrank Porter Graham Elementary School in Chapel Hill and tutored kids \nat Githens Middle School in Durham.\n  She served as cochair of Nourish International, a hunger-relief \ngroup, and an assistant coach in the Girls on the Run of the Triangle, \na character-building program.\n  She studied abroad in Cuba and spent her summers helping others in \nEcuador, Egypt, and Ghana. Her compassion and hard work seemed to know \nno bounds.\n  Mr. President, Eve Carson was a special woman who will be missed. Her \npassing leaves a void in a community who knew her as an intelligent, \nhard-working, compassionate leader who loved helping others.\n  Again, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Eve's family, friends, and \nall those who benefitted from her compassion and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1739-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1739-S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues the \nwinners of the 2007-2008 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Farm Bureau \nInsurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for 8th grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. I, along with my friends at \nthe Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Insurance Companies, am pleased \nwith the annual response to this contest and the quality of the essays \nreceived over the years.\n  I congratulate Jansen Hight, of Owen County, and Leah Lahue, of \nCrawford County, as winners of this year's contest, and I ask that the \ncomplete text of their respective essays be printed in the Record. \nLikewise, I would like to have printed in the Record the names of all \nof the district and county winners of the 2007-2008 Dick Lugar/Indiana \nFarm Bureau/Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.\n  The material follows.\n\n                    Energy Aware--Energy Independent\n\n                           (By Jansen Hight)\n\n       Today our world runs mainly on fossil fuels. Therefore, \n     what are we going to do when all the fossil fuels are gone? \n     This limit of non-renewable fuel resources is why we should \n     start considering the use of alternative energy sources. Some \n     of the best-known alternative fuels include biodiesel, \n     butanol, ethanol, chemically-stored electricity, methane, \n     biomass, hydrogen, natural gas, vegetable oil, and peanut oil \n     (just to name a few).\n       A wide variety of alternative energy sources are being \n     developed to aid our rural economies and our nation's \n     security. With nearly 60 percent of our oil resources coming \n     from other countries, it is important that we develop our own \n     dependable sources of energy. Due to the lack of resources to \n     produce substantial amounts of energy from other sources such \n     as solar and wind power, biofuels are the best resource for \n     Indiana to pursue energy independence.\n       With Indiana being a strong agricultural state, Indiana has \n     the ability to be a leader in the production and use of \n     domestic renewable fuels including biodiesel, ethanol, and \n     fuels made from cellulosic biomass. Regardless of the type of \n     alternative fuels being produced by Indiana farmers, one \n     common advantage these fuels have is they improve our energy \n     resources since they all can be made from sources other than \n     imported petroleum. By using home-grown sources for fuel, \n     this would also increase the local demand for Indiana \n     soybeans and corn, leading to a better profit for the farmer. \n     This profit can then be circulated back into the local \n     community.\n       Indiana does have the agricultural resources to be a leader \n     in developing a strong biofuels industry. With the \n     cooperative efforts of biofuel users, petroleum companies, \n     and the government, our Indiana farmers can lead the way for \n     a sustainable energy future that supports rural economies and \n     aids our nation's security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                Untitled\n\n                            (By Leah Lahue)\n\n       Alternative energy sources include: solar, water, wind, \n     geo-thermal, and bio-fuels. Alternative energy use reduces \n     the dependence on foreign oil, reduces harmful emissions, and \n     uses renewable resources. Protecting our environment and \n     slowing the use of non-renewable petroleum reserves are good \n     choices for everyone.\n       Bio-fuels are produced directly from plants or indirectly \n     from organic industrial, commercial, domestic, or \n     agricultural wastes. Three ways to make bio-fuels are burning \n     dry organic waste, using fast growing trees, and fermenting \n     wet materials. Partly digested cellulose and carbohydrates--\n     animal manure can be burnt in dry form or processed into \n     biogas. Bio-fuel comes from corn, sugarcane, wheat, rice, \n     sorghum, sunflowers, potatoes, and sugar beets. One bushel of \n     corn produces 2.8 gallons of ethanol. Bio-fuel, a renewable \n     resource, reduces dependence on foreign oil and carbon \n     dioxide emissions. With 20 parts bio-diesel and 80 parts \n     petroleum, bio-diesel is environmentally safer. Critics are \n     concerned that the major use of grain as bio-fuels may \n     increase food prices. Unused croplands and continually \n     improving farm methods can meet increased demands without \n     food price increases. Food prices are driven up more by \n     increased gas prices than prices paid to farmers.\n       Solar energy, waterpower and wind energy are clean, nature-\n     provided alternative energy sources, especially for \n     electricity. Solar energy, collected by solar panels, which \n     may be placed on cars and buildings and in open spaces, can \n     be used for heat and to power batteries and other equipment. \n     Falling water and wind turn turbines and electrical \n     equipment. The energy from the turbines can be stored and \n     used as electricity and as a heat source. Alternative energy \n     sources, especially bio-fuels, are good choices. Farmers can \n     raise the crops used to produce bio-fuels in mass quantities. \n     Renewable alternative energy sources are generally cleaner, \n     reduce emissions, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \n     keeping our financial resources in America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2007-2008 District Essay Winners\n\n\n                               District 1\n\n       Schuyler Awald, Walkerton;

Mr. President, I wish to speak in honor and pay \ntribute to a fallen paramedic from my State, Palm Beach County Fire-\nRescue Lieutenant Rafael Vazquez.\n  Rafael's life ended prematurely this week; he died at the very young \nage of 42. But the memory of his dedication, hard work, and commitment \nto public service will live on for many lifetimes.\n  Rafael Vazquez led a life committed to public service. For the past 7 \nyears, he worked at Station 28 in Royal Palm Beach, and this January he \nwas promoted to the rank of rescue lieutenant. The men and women he \nsupervised speak about him with great pride--describing him as a hard \nworker, a man with a sense of humor, and a loving father. This was a \nman whom they respected and considered a friend; they simply called him \n``Ray.''\n  Rafael's coworkers knew him as someone who loved his Puerto Rican \nheritage. He often cooked Latin food for his colleagues. And even \nthough he was born in Brooklyn, NY, after Rafael moved to Florida, as \nis our tradition in the Sunshine State, he immediately became a \nFloridian.\n  Rafael was also a family man--a devoted father and husband. He met \nhis wife Michele while working at American Medical Response and cared \nfor her deeply. In a recent news account, Rafael's wife Michele \nremembered her husband as, ``. . . a jokester with a quick wit and an \ninfectious smile who would help anyone in need.'' Michele added, ``I \nthank God every day for giving me the 13 years that I had with him.'' \nThe couple had a young son together and four children from previous \nrelationships.\n  Floridians receive rapid medical care in times of emergency because \nof people like Rafael Vazquez. He loved his work and his contribution \nwill be missed.\n  On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I thank and \nhonor rescue lieutenant Rafael Vazquez for his service to his community \nand the safety he helped to promote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1740-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1740-S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF ELLEN PANEOK\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life \nof Ellen Paneok, who left us last Sunday, March 2, at the age of 48. So \nlittle time on this Earth, but Ellen made so much of it. The State of \nAlaska is much the better for all that she has accomplished.\n  How to characterize Ellen? I could speak of her work for Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters of Southcentral Alaska. Or her work to promote aviation \nsafety at the FAA and as a volunteer in the general aviation community.\n  I could speak of the inspiring articles she has published. I could \ntell you that Ellen was a highly respected Inupiat artist working in \nivory and scrimshaw.\n  I could speak of that fact that Ellen offered herself freely as a \nrole model for Native young people.\n  I could speak to the kindness and loyalty she gave to her friends, \nincluding Pat Heller, a very special friend of Ellen's and mine. \nEllen's friends returned that kindness and loyalty as they took \nresponsibility for Ellen's care in her final days.\n  And I could speak of the fact that Ellen was one of the first women--\nnot to mention one of the first Alaska Native women--to pursue the \ncareer of Alaska bush pilot. Careers just don't get more adventurous \nthan that. And it was her achievements in the field of aviation that \nearned Ellen a place in our Nation's history.\n  Ellen started flying in 1976. She flew primarily out of Barrow \ncarrying mail and supplies to the Native villages of northern Alaska.\n  Her life story was chronicled in the ``Women in Flight'' exhibit at \nthe National Air and Space Museum in the nineties. Ellen was one of 37 \nwomen in aviation who were part of that exhibit.\n  On September 11, 1997, she delighted museum goers with stories about \nchasing polar bears off the runway before\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\nshe could land, flying in Alaska's extreme weather conditions and \nrestoring airplanes.\n  Some of her experiences were delightful, others were not. Like July \n10, 1980, the day that the engine in Ellen's Piper Twin Pacer quit \nsomewhere between Farewell and McGrath. The plane fell like a brick and \ncrashed into a stand of trees. A day and a half later, after making a \nsmoke fire from brush and engine oil to call attention to the downed \naircraft, she was rescued.\n  That incident gave Ellen a new nickname, ``the survivor.'' The \nchapter devoted to Ellen in Sandi Sumner's book ``Women Pilots of \nAlaska'' is entitled ``The Survivor.'' But it goes on to note that \nsurviving the July 1980 crash in the Alaska bush was one of many crises \nin Ellen's life from which she grew and thrived.\n  Ellen was born in Kotzebue, AK, a relatively large community, in \nAlaska's bush. Ellen's parents divorced when she was age 5. Her father \nleft the picture following the divorce. Her mother was never around. \nThe family moved from Kotzebue to the big city of Anchorage.\n  Ellen took on the role of mother to her two sisters at the age of 9 \nand carried on until the age of 12 when the State moved the children \ninto foster homes, splitting the family up to Ellen's protestations. By \n14 Ellen was living in a detention facility. She looked at a magazine \nwith airplanes on the cover and said, ``This is going to change my \nlife.''\n  Indeed, it did. At age 16, holding a dividend check from Cook Inlet \nRegion, one of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act regional \ncorporations created by Congress, Ellen went to Merrill Field, the \ngeneral aviation aircraft in Anchorage, to take flying lessons. The \nrest is history.\n  When Ellen spoke to groups of at-risk kids, she could relate from her \npersonal experience. She told them:\n\n       I was just like you. I got no encouragement. When you \n     decide to do something don't let anyone or anything \n     discourage you. It's up to you.\n\n  In aviation as in life, attitude influences altitude. With an \nattitude like this it is no wonder that Ellen will be remembered as a \n``heroine in aviation.'' That was the name of an exhibit sponsored by \nthe Chicago Airport System which also chronicled Ellen's extraordinary \nlife adventure.\n  On March 15, a celebration of Ellen's life will take place at the \nAlaska Aviation Heritage Museum in Anchorage. I regret that I will not \nbe able to attend this event to commemorate the achievements of this \ntruly Renaissance woman. So I am taking a few minutes of the Senate's \ntime today to pay tribute to this individual who I so deeply respect.\n  I thank the Senate for allowing me to take a few moments today to \nspeak of Ellen Paneok, one of many Alaskans whose contributions to the \nmaking of my home State will be repeated again and again in the run-up \nto the 50th anniversary of Alaska's statehood next January.\n  Sadly, Ellen will not be with us in person to celebrate that 50th \nanniversary, yet her inspiring life will not be forgotten. It is \nforever a part of Alaska's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1741-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 1084.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2009 \nthrough 2013 to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV/\nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senators Lugar, \nKennedy, and Sununu in introducing legislation to reauthorize our \nGovernment's effort to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria \noverseas. Entitled the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States \nGlobal Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nReauthorization Act of 2008--in recognition of the great service to \nthis issue by our recently departed friends from the House of \nRepresentatives--the bill would continue and expand the revolutionary \npublic health program begun 5 years ago at the initiative of President \nBush.\n  In his State of the Union address in 2003, the President announced a \ndramatic proposal--to spend $15 billion over 5 years to combat HIV/AIDS \nglobally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been hardest \nhit by the pandemic. Congress responded promptly, authorizing the full \namount requested by the President just a few months later.\n  In the last 5 years, the work of the U.S. Government and its \nimplementing partners around the world has been nothing short of \nmiraculous. Well over a million people have been saved from almost \ncertain death by the provision of anti-retroviral drugs. Mr. President, \n150,000 babies have been born without HIV because of efforts to prevent \nthe transmission of the disease from mothers who were so infected. \nMillions of people suffering from AIDS have received treatment and \ncare. Over two million orphans and vulnerable children have received \ncare, education and support. Across Africa, in communities large and \nsmall, we have given millions of people hope for a better and longer \nlife.\n  Even the most optimistic among us would not have predicted these \ndramatic results. History will record that this was President Bush's \nfinest hour--he challenged our Government, and the governments in \nAfrica, to respond to one of the most profound crises of our time. They \nhave met and exceeded that challenge. While implementation of the \nprogram has not been problem-free, it has proceeded at a pace and scale \nthat was unimaginable to most of us. The credit for this success goes \nto thousands of dedicated people serving here and abroad, and to the \nAmerican people, for their generosity in supporting this program.\n  We cannot, however, rest on this success. We have made progress, but \nthe disease is still winning. Thousands of new infections occur every \nday. For every person enrolled in a treatment program last year, six \nmore became infected.\n  Last spring, the President challenged us again--to reauthorize the \nprogram at a level of $30 billion over the next 5 years. In the course \nof last summer and fall, the Committee on Foreign Relations has closely \nreviewed the President's request and the operation of our current \nprograms. To review the programs in the field, teams of committee staff \ntraveled to most of the 15 ``focus'' countries that have received the \nbulk of the funding. They visited dozens of clinics, hospitals, and \ncare centers. They talked to hundreds of government officials, \ncommunity members and health staff working against the disease, people \nliving with HIV/AIDS, and children orphaned by the disease. We have \nlearned what is working--and more important, what is not working. Last \nfall, the committee held formal hearings to take testimony from experts \nfrom within and without the Government. The committee has also closely \nreviewed numerous studies performed by government agencies and \nnongovernmental organizations working in this field.\n\n  The Congress is now ready to act, and we are ready to respond to the \nPresident's call. The bill that we introduce today will reauthorize the \nGlobal HIV/AIDS programs for the next 5 fiscal years. It will provide \nauthorization of appropriations of $50 billion over this period, of \nwhich $9 billion is devoted to fighting malaria and tuberculosis, two \ndiseases that are also major causes of death in the developing world. \nThis higher figure is justified because the President's figure of $30 \nbillion is too low--it will barely keep pace with inflation, as we are \nalready funding current programs at a rate above $6 billion a year. \nAdditionally, the President's request dealt only with HIV/AIDS, \nalthough the initial legislation in 2003 covered all three deadly \ndiseases.\n  The bill that we introduce will keep the basic framework of the \nprogram intact, but makes important adjustments based on lessons \nlearned over the past 5 years. First, the bill removes most earmarks in \nthe original law that delineated the percentages that should be devoted \nto treatment, to care, and to prevention. A major, congressionally \nmandated study by the Institute of Medicine, as well as one by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, concluded that these earmarks unduly \nlimit flexibility for the people implementing the programs. We need to \nlift these restrictions in order to let our Government and local \nofficials tailor their responses to local conditions. The only earmark \nthat is retained is a 10 percent allocation for orphans and vulnerable \nchildren, for which there appears to be universal support.\n  The bill also seeks to coordinate our HIV/AIDS programs with other \nhealth and development programs. The disease does not exist in a \nvacuum. Across the\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\ndeveloping world, people afflicted with HIV/AIDS face many other health \nand economic challenges. We need to better coordinate all of our health \nprograms to promote efficiencies and expand the number of people we \nreach. Nutrition is the best example of how we could positively affect \npeople's lives by improving our coordination. The bill promotes local \nhealth capacity--an enormous challenge in Africa in combating this \ndisease. Further, the bill pushes the U.S. Government to plan for the \nlong-term. We need to move from responding to an emergency toward \nbuilding sustainability--so our local partners that have the resources \ncan take over this effort, with our technical assistance.\n  Perhaps most important, this legislation attempts to put major \nemphasis on prevention. Simply put, we cannot win the fight against \nHIV/AIDS unless we expand and improve efforts to prevent its spread. \nSuch efforts must include the so-called ``ABC'' approach--abstinence, \nbeing faithful, and proper use of condoms. But they must involve much \nmore; in some places successful prevention will require major societal \nand cultural change that must be initiated and led by local governments \nand leaders.\n  Last week, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a \nreauthorization bill on a bipartisan basis. The legislation was \nsponsored by the acting chairman, Mr. Berman, and the ranking member, \nMs. Ros-Lehtinen. It is endorsed by the President, who, having just \nreturned from visiting Africa, personally urged several of us to act \nquickly on the reauthorization bill. The bill that we introduce today \nmirrors the compromise in the House in several major respects, which \nwill facilitate a prompt conference with the other body.\n  In partnership with Senator Lugar, who chaired our committee when the \noriginal legislation was approved in 2003, I have scheduled a markup in \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations next week. I am hopeful of strong \nsupport to report the bill, and that the full Senate will act on the \nbill soon after the Easter recess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Dole, \n        Mr. McConnell, Mr. Allard, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Craig, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Stevens, Ms. Murkowski, and \n        Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 2734. A bill to aid families and neighborhoods facing home \nforeclosure and address the subprime mortgage crisis; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I described last Friday, too many \nfamilies in Missouri and across the Nation are feeling the pain of this \nHousing crisis, and they need our help now. We have 57,000 people in \nMissouri delinquent on their mortgages, with 20 percent of Missouri \nsubprime borrowers behind on their payments. These families, \nunfortunately, similar to many across America in I imagine almost every \nState, can least afford higher housing costs as they are being hit with \nhigher heating bills, higher health care costs, and more pain at the \ngas pump.\n  That is why today I, in partnership with Senator Isakson, Senator \nColeman, and several other Republican colleagues, will proudly \nintroduce the Security Against Foreclosure and Education, or SAFE, Act \nof 2008. This bill focuses solely on the housing needs of our families \nand neighborhoods.\n  A growing economy free of excess litigation and cumbersome regulation \nwill help the most people find the most good-paying jobs and the relief \nthey need. The HOME Act we introduced last week on our side included \nboth housing relief provisions as well as tax relief for American \nfamilies, litigation reform, and capital markets reform.\n  However, we do not want Congress to lose sight of the housing crisis \nthat too many American people are facing and the help they need right \nnow. Therefore, we are introducing this measure today to focus solely \non the housing help our families and neighborhoods need.\n  Last week, I spoke about one person in need, suffering in the current \nsubprime mortgage meltdown. That was Willie Clay of Kansas City, MO, a \nVietnam vet unable to meet rising variable mortgage payments. \nUnfortunately, there are many more like him.\n  Today I share with my colleagues the story of Katherine Gwinn of St. \nLouis, MO. Her story appeared in the St. Louis Dispatch last year. She \nis a disabled 53 year old living on Social Security and disability \npayments. Mrs. Gwinn refinanced her home three times to get lower \npayments and help pay off debt. Her subprime loan's initial fixed rate \nexpired after 1 year. Since then, her payments have gone up 40 percent, \nnow taking a large chunk of her $916 monthly income.\n  Ms. Gwinn said the last time she refinanced, her mortgage broker \nfast-talked her into a subprime loan with provisions she did not \nunderstand. The result is her variable rate payments are now at $566 \nper month. As I said earlier, Ms. Gwinn's monthly income of Social \nSecurity and disability payments is only $916 per month. How many of us \ncould pay for food, gas, medicine, and heating bills on the remaining \n$350 per month? That is why I believe so strongly that we need to help \nfolks such as Katherine Gwinn across the Nation.\n  First, the Republican SAFE Act will help folks such as Katherine \nGwinn and Willie Clay with $10 billion to State housing finance \nauthorities to refinance distressed subprime mortgages. Our proposal \nwould authorize the State housing finance agencies to issue $10 billion \nin tax-exempt bonds and use the proceeds to help refinance subprime \nmortgages, refinancing them at or near the original level which they \ncould afford.\n  Secondly, in order to help families avoid foreclosure and keep them \nin their homes, we propose to expedite the delivery of $180 million \napproved by Congress in December to assure counseling help to families \nin distress. As I announced last week, the first block of these funds \nhas gone out, and we will ensure that remaining funds are delivered as \nquickly as possible after we can confirm that counseling is having the \ndesired effect. This counseling is important because borrowers need to \nknow and lenders need to know the best way to get out of this crisis is \nnot to have foreclosures that throw families out of their homes. That \nnot only hurts the family, it hurts the lender because they have to \nspend money on foreclosures, and it drives down the price of housing \nthat is in their stock. In addition, it hurts communities, because when \nyou have a community with significant numbers of foreclosures, you put \na blanket of debt and hopelessness on communities which cannot remain \nviable.\n  Thirdly, we support helping struggling neighborhoods by providing \n$15,000 in tax credits available over 3 years for purchasing a home in \nor approaching foreclosure. This provision, initially proposed by \nSenator Isakson, will help neighbors take down foreclosure signs and \nstop the slide in property values. We also support the so-called net \noperating loss carryback tax provisions to help firms that suffered \noperating losses lower their tax burden, so we enable homebuilders to \nget through this crisis.\n  Our proposal includes no new loan disclosure requirements for \nprominent and plain English explanation of key loan conditions. Anybody \nwho has purchased a house recently knows you are confronted with a \nstack of papers a half a foot high, with all kinds of legal \ngobbledygook and with provisions, if you looked hard enough, that may \ntell  you what is going to happen to you if you borrow the money. Most \nof it is legalese that we as lawyers--and I admit to having been one--\nlike to put in to cover every possible contingency. What borrowers need \nto see is in big type: ``Teaser, introductory rates,'' their payments, \nand when it expires. They need to know that if they are agreeing to an \nadjustable rate, what that rate could be and how much the new payment \npenalty will be or if there is going to be a repayment penalty. That \ninformation needs to be portrayed on the first page so you can see on \nthe first page what you are getting into and how much it would cost you \nto get out. They will be reminded that there is no guarantee they will \nbe able to refinance their loan before the introductory rate expires.\n\n  These are the very things Katherine Gwinn and Willie Clay and \nthousands of borrowers did not understand when they agreed to their \nloans. We hope this will protect future families who want their share \nof the American dream.\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\n  I also believe that providing the tax credit will help many first-\ntime homeowners get into a house and give them the extra cash they need \nto be able to meet their mortgage payments.\n  Now, there are two new provisions added to our measure that we did \nnot introduce last week. Senator Coleman provided language to give \nreturning war veterans more time to avoid home foreclosure. Currently, \nthey have a 3-month window from their return to the private sector to \nwork out any mortgage difficulties they may have. That may not be \nenough time for a vet newly returned from the war zone and dealing with \na host of family and financial problems. Our proposal would extend the \nreturned war veteran protection against foreclosure to 6 months after \nthey return.\n  We have also introduced provisions of the Federal Housing Act reform \nbill that passed the Senate 93 to 1 last year. That bipartisan, near \nunanimous reform bill deserves to become law, and it will assist the \nFHA in stepping up to the plate in many areas where that agency can \nprovide the kind of help and assistance we initially intended it to \nprovide.\n  Now, in contrast to the housing proposal introduced on the other \nside, Republicans will avoid making home ownership more expensive, \nespecially for low-income families, through harmful bankruptcy changes \nthat increase the cost of borrowing or encourage costly litigation.\n  If we put in law the fact that bankruptcy judges will be able to cram \ndown on lenders' onerous terms that were not included in the initial \nmortgage, they will find that mortgage companies may increase their \nrates by 1.5 to 2 percent. That could mean at least 6 million Americans \nwould no longer be able to afford a mortgage to buy the home they need.\n  Also, we will oppose plowing billions of dollars into big Government \nprograms that will not help our neediest families now. We will also \noppose adding more dollars to programs that are still flush with funds \nthat were given them in December.\n  Together, these housing proposals will help families such as those of \nKatherine Gwinn and Willie Clay and neighborhoods across the country \nget through this crisis. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I \ninvite all colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with us to see \nif we cannot pass something that will provide relief now for the many \nfamilies across this Nation who are suffering because of the subprime \nmortgage meltdown and the resulting financial pressures it puts on the \nlending industry and, through them, to the families themselves.\n  This is the time. Now is the time for congressional action. I hope \nthat with a broad coalition of my colleagues, we will be able to make \nthese additions and provide assistance to suffering American families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 2735. A bill to establish the Council on Healthy Housing, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce, along with Senator Hagel, the \nHealthy Housing Council Act of 2008. This legislation would establish \nan independent interagency Council on Healthy Housing in the executive \nbranch. The bill would improve the coordination of existing but \nfragmented programs, so that families can access Government programs \nand services in a more efficient and effective manner.\n  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, more \nthan 6 million households live in housing with moderate or severe \nheating, plumbing, or electric hazards. This count of moderate or \nsevere physical problems does not even include significant lead-based \npaint hazards, which persist in 24 million, or approximately four times \nas many, households.\n  Low-income and minority individuals and families are \ndisproportionately affected by housing-related health hazards. We know \nthat residents of poorly designed, constructed, or maintained housing \nare at greater risk for serious illnesses and injuries, including \ncancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, \nchildhood lead poisoning, and asthma. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican-\nAmericans are three times as likely to have elevated blood-lead levels, \ncompared to non-Hispanic whites. About 1.2 million housing units with \nsignificant lead-based paint hazards house low-income families with \nchildren under 6 years of age.\n  If the disease and injury toll taken on our Nation's individuals and \nfamilies, particularly our children, is not enough to demonstrate the \nneed for coordinated Federal Government action on housing-related \nhealth hazards, consider some of the annual costs.\n  According to research at the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental \nHealth Center, annual costs for environmentally attributable childhood \ndiseases in the U.S. total an estimated $54.9 billion. That number is \napproximately 3 percent of total health care costs.\n  The good news is that low-cost preventative measures can have \ndramatic effects. For example, properly installing and maintaining a \nsmoke alarm can cut the risk of fire death in half. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention estimates that providing healthy housing \nto American families will help prevent 20 million asthma cases, 240,000 \nincidents of elevated blood-lead levels in young children, 14,000 burn \ninjuries, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths.\n  While there are many programs in place to address housing-related \nhealth hazards, these programs are fragmented and spread across many \nagencies, making it difficult for at-risk families to access assistance \nor to receive the comprehensive information they need. It is time for \nbetter coordination.\n  This bill authorizes $750,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 to 2013 \nfor an independent Council on Healthy Housing, which would bring \nFederal, State, and local government representatives, as well as \nindustry and nonprofit representatives, to the table at least once a \nyear.\n  The council would review, monitor, and evaluate existing housing, \nhealth, energy, and environmental programs. The council would then make \nrecommendations to reduce duplication, ensure collaboration, identify \nbest practices, and develop a comprehensive healthy housing research \nagenda.\n  In order to ensure that members of the public are informed of and \nbenefit from the council's activities, the council would hold biannual \nstakeholder meetings, keep an updated Web site, and work towards \nunified healthy housing data collection and maintenance.\n  While there is a growing consensus on ways to help communities make \nhousing healthier, there is also a lack of coordinated programs and \ninformation, which has made it difficult for the public to access \nresearch and data. By creating this council, we can provide a sorely \nneeded forum for otherwise disparate health and housing experts, \nwhether in the Government, private, or nonprofit sector, to share their \nexperiences, successes, and agendas for the future.\n  The Healthy Housing Council Act will help us start working towards a \ntime when an affordable, decent, and healthy home will be not just the \nAmerican dream, but the American promise. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me and Senator Hagel in supporting this bipartisan bill and other \nhealthy housing efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Housing Council Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the United States--\n       (A) 6,000,000 households live in homes with moderate or \n     severe physical hazards;\n       (B) 24,000,000 homes have significant lead-based paint \n     hazards;\n       (C) 11,000,000 homes have had leaks in the last 12 months;\n       (D) 6,000,000 homes have had signs of mice in the last 3 \n     months; and\n       (E) 1 in 15 homes have dangerous levels of radon.\n       (2) Residents of housing that is poorly designed, \n     constructed, or maintained are at risk for cancer, carbon \n     monoxide poisoning,\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\n     burns, falls, rodent bites, childhood lead poisoning, asthma, \n     and other illnesses and injuries. Vulnerable subpopulations, \n     such as children and the elderly, are at elevated risk for \n     housing-related illnesses and injuries.\n       (3) Because substandard housing typically poses the \n     greatest risks, the disparities in the distribution of \n     housing-related health hazards are striking. 1,200,000 \n     housing units with significant lead-based paint hazards house \n     low-income families with children under 6 years of age.\n       (4) Minority populations also tend to be disproportionately \n     affected by housing-related illnesses, including lead \n     poisoning and asthma. According to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican \n     Americans are approximately 3 times as likely to have \n     elevated blood-lead levels, compared to non-Hispanic whites. \n     The non-Hispanic black population has an asthma mortality \n     rate 3 times greater than the rate for the non-Hispanic white \n     population.\n       (5) The annual costs for environmentally attributable \n     childhood diseases in the United States, including lead \n     poisoning, asthma, and cancer, total $54,900,000,000. This \n     amount is approximately 3 percent of total health care costs.\n       (6) Appropriate housing design, construction, and \n     maintenance, timely correction of deficiencies, planning \n     efforts, and low-cost preventative measures can reduce the \n     incidence of serious injury or death, improve the ability of \n     residents to survive in the event of a major catastrophe, and \n     contribute to overall well-being and mental health. Housing \n     units that are kept lead-safe are approximately 25 percent \n     less likely to have another child with elevated blood lead \n     levels. Properly installed and maintained smoke alarms reduce \n     the risk of fire deaths by 50 percent.\n       (7) Providing healthy housing to families and individuals \n     in the United States will help prevent an estimated 240,000 \n     elevated blood lead levels in young children, 11,000 \n     unintentional injury deaths, 12,000,000 nonfatal injuries, \n     3,000 deaths in house fires, 14,000 burn injuries, and 21,000 \n     radon-associated lung cancer deaths that occur in United \n     States housing each year, as well as 20,000,000 asthma cases \n     and 14,000,000 missed school days.\n       (8) While there are many programs in place to address \n     housing-related health hazards, these programs are fragmented \n     and spread across many agencies, making it difficult for at-\n     risk families and individuals to access assistance or to \n     receive comprehensive information.\n       (9) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that families and individuals can access government \n     programs and services in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 476\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming a representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas, during World War II, Greece played a major role in \n     the struggle to protect freedom and democracy by bravely\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n     fighting the historic Battle of Crete, giving the Axis powers \n     their first major setback in the land war, and setting off a \n     chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas Greece paid a high price for defending the common \n     values of Greece and the United States in the deaths of \n     hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, outside the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day in 2002, said, ``Greece and America have \n     been firm allies in the great struggles for liberty. . . . \n     Americans will always remember Greek heroism and Greek \n     sacrifice for the sake of freedom. . . . [and a]s the 21st \n     century dawns, Greece and America once again stand united; \n     this time in the fight against terrorism. . . . The United \n     States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the \n     war against terror. . . . America and Greece are strong \n     allies, and we're strategic partners.'';\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for 3 decades of terrorist attacks \n     underscore the important contributions Greece is making to \n     the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, investing over \n     $20,000,000,000, creating over 200,000 new jobs, and \n     contributing over $750,000,000 in development aid to the \n     region;\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests \n     by the United States during the war in Iraq, immediately \n     granting the United States unlimited access to Greece's \n     airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many United States \n     ships that delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were \n     refueled in Greece;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to \n     Athens, Greece, the land in which the games began 2,500 years \n     ago and the city in which the games were revived in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of more than \n     14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with famous Greek hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the \n     first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of \n     more than $1,390,000,000 and the assignment of more than \n     70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an \n     8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group that included the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region in which Christianity \n     mixes with Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations \n     with Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary \n     success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural \n     understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and \n     Turkey, as seen most recently with the January 2008 visit to \n     Turkey by the Prime Minister of Greece, Kostas Karamanlis, \n     the first official visit to Turkey by a Prime Minister of \n     Greece in 49 years;\n       Whereas Greece is a key energy security hub that delivers \n     gas to Europe via the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector;\n       Whereas Greece is a world leader in the assimilation of \n     immigrants, with immigrants having grown to more than 10 \n     percent of people employed in Greece;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort to advance freedom, democracy, peace, \n     stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between the governments and the peoples of Greece and the \n     United States;\n       Whereas March 25, 2008, marks the 187th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the people of Greece \n     from the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the people of the \n     United States to celebrate this anniversary with the people \n     of Greece and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which both Greece and the United States were born: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2008, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy'';

Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n       (g) Effectiveness.--This section shall not apply to any \n     provision constituting a change in a mandatory program in \n     appropriations legislation if such provision has been enacted \n     in each of the 3 fiscal years prior to the budget year.\n\n     SEC. 214.

BAN ON CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS CONTAINING LEAD; LEAD \n                   PAINT RULE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, any children's product (as \n     defined in section 14(e) of the Consumer Product Safety Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 2063(e))) that contains lead shall be treated as a \n     banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous \n     Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.).\n       (b) Trace Amounts of Lead.--\n       (1) Initial standard.--For purposes of subsection (a), a \n     children's product shall be considered to contain lead if any \n     part of the product contains lead or lead compounds and the \n     lead content of such part (calculated as lead metal) is \n     greater than 0.03 percent by weight of the total weight of \n     such part (or such lesser amount as may be established by the \n     Commission by regulation).\n       (2) Reduced threshold.--\n       (A) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 3 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, paragraph (1) shall \n     be applied by substituting ``0.01 percent'' for ``0.03 \n     percent'' unless the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     determines that a standard of 0.01 percent is not\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\n     technologically feasible. The Commission may make such a \n     determination only after notice and a hearing and after \n     analyzing the public health protections associated with \n     substantially reducing lead in children's products.\n       (B) Alternative reduction.--If the Commission determines \n     under subparagraph (A) that the 0.01 percent standard is not \n     technologically feasible, the Commission shall, by \n     regulation, establish a lesser amount that is the lowest \n     amount of lead, lower than 0.03 percent by weight, the \n     Commission determines to be technologically feasible to \n     achieve. The amount of lead established by the Commission \n     under the preceding sentence shall be substituted for the \n     0.03 percent standard under paragraph (1) beginning on the \n     date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Inaccessible components.--\n       (A) In general.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a \n     component of a children's product that is not accessible to a \n     child because it is not physically exposed by reason of a \n     sealed covering or casing and will not become physically \n     exposed through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and \n     abuse of the product.\n       (B) Inaccessibility proceeding.--Within 2 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall \n     promulgate a rule providing guidance with respect to what \n     product components, or classes of components, will be \n     considered to be inaccessible for purposes of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (C) Application pending cpsc guidance.--Until the \n     Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to subparagraph (B), \n     the determination of whether a product component is \n     inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the \n     requirements of subparagraph (A) for considering a component \n     to be inaccessible to a child.\n       (D) Certain barriers disqualified.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, paint, coatings, or electroplating may not be \n     considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the \n     substrate inaccessible to a child through normal and \n     reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.\n       (2) Electronics.--If the Commission determines that it is \n     not feasible for certain electronic devices, including \n     batteries, to comply with subsection (a) at the time the \n     regulations take effect, the Commission shall, by \n     regulation--\n       (A) issue standards to reduce the exposure of and \n     accessibility to lead in such electronic devices; and\n       (B) establish a schedule by which such electronic devices \n     shall be in full compliance with the regulations prescribed \n     under subsection (a).\n       (3) Lead crystal.--The Commission may by rule provide that \n     subsection (a) does not apply to lead crystal if the \n     Commission determines, after notice and a hearing, that the \n     lead content in lead crystal will neither--\n       (A) result in the absorption of lead into the human body; \n     nor\n       (B) have an adverse impact on public health and safety.\n       (d) Regulations.--Notwithstanding the provisions of \n     subsection (b), the Commission may by regulation establish \n     such lower thresholds for lead content in children's products \n     than those set forth in subsection (b) as the Commission \n     finds to be technologically feasible.\n       (e) Paint Standard for All Products.--Effective on the date \n     that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission shall modify section \n     1303.1 of its regulations (16 C.F.R. 1303.1) by substituting \n     ``0.009 percent'' for ``0.06 percent'' in subsection (a) of \n     that section.\n       (f) Application With ASTM F963.--To the extent that any \n     standard or rule promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission under this section (or any section of the Consumer \n     Product Safety Act or any other Act enforced by the \n     Commission, as such Acts are affected by this section) is \n     inconsistent with the ASTM F963 standard, such promulgated \n     standard or rule shall supersede the ASTM F963 standard to \n     the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n     SEC. 23. ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF LEAD CONTENT.\n\n       The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with \n     the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute \n     of Standards and Technology, shall study the feasibility of \n     establishing a measurement standard based on a units-of-mass-\n     per-area standard (similar to existing measurement standards \n     used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and \n     the Environmental Protection Agency to measure for metals in \n     household paint and soil, respectively) that is statistically \n     comparable to the parts-per-million measurement standard \n     currently used in laboratory analysis.\n\n     SEC. 24. STUDY OF PREVENTABLE INJURIES AND DEATHS OF MINORITY \n                   CHILDREN RELATED TO CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Within 90 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Government Accountability Office shall \n     initiate a study to assess disparities in the risks and \n     incidence of preventable injuries and deaths among children \n     of minority populations, including Black, Hispanic, American \n     Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, and Asian/Pacific \n     Islander children in the United States.\n       (b) Requirements.--The study shall examine the racial \n     disparities of the rates of preventable injuries and deaths \n     related to suffocation, poisonings, and drowning including \n     those associated with the use of cribs, mattresses and \n     bedding materials, swimming pools and spas, and toys and \n     other products intended for use by children.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall report \n     the findings to the Senate Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation Committee and the House of Representatives \n     Energy and Commerce Committee. The report shall include--\n       (1) the Government Accountability Office's findings on the \n     incidence of preventable risks of injury and death among \n     children of minority populations and recommendations for \n     minimizing such increased risks;\n       (2) recommendations for public outreach, awareness, and \n     prevention campaigns specifically aimed at racial minority \n     populations; and\n       (3) recommendations for education initiatives that may \n     reduce current statistical disparities.\n\n     SEC. 25.

Res. 476\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming a representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas, during World War II, Greece played a major role in \n     the struggle to protect freedom and democracy by bravely \n     fighting the historic Battle of Crete, giving the Axis powers \n     their first major setback in the land war, and setting off a \n     chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas Greece paid a high price for defending the common \n     values of Greece and the United States in the deaths of \n     hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, outside the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day in 2002, said, ``Greece and America have \n     been firm allies in the great struggles for liberty. . . . \n     Americans will always remember Greek heroism and Greek \n     sacrifice for the sake of freedom. . . . [and a]s the 21st \n     century dawns, Greece and America once again stand united; \n     this time in the fight against terrorism. . . . The United \n     States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the \n     war against terror. . . . America and Greece are strong \n     allies, and we're strategic partners.'';\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's successful \n     ``law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for 3 decades of terrorist attacks \n     underscore the important contributions Greece is making to \n     the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, investing over \n     $20,000,000,000, creating over 200,000 new jobs, and \n     contributing over $750,000,000 in development aid to the \n     region;\n       Whereas Greece was extraordinarily responsive to requests \n     by the United States during the war in Iraq, immediately \n     granting the United States unlimited access to Greece's \n     airspace and the base in Souda Bay, and many United States \n     ships that delivered troops, cargo, and supplies to Iraq were \n     refueled in Greece;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Olympic games came home to \n     Athens, Greece, the land in which the games began 2,500 years \n     ago and the city in which the games were revived in 1896;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympics of more than \n     14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with famous Greek hospitality;\n       Whereas the unprecedented security effort in Greece for the \n     first Olympics after the attacks on the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, included a record-setting expenditure of \n     more than $1,390,000,000 and the assignment of more than \n     70,000 security personnel, as well as the utilization of an \n     8-country Olympic Security Advisory Group that included the \n     United States;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region in which Christianity \n     mixes with Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations \n     with Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has had extraordinary \n     success in recent years in furthering cross-cultural \n     understanding and reducing tensions between Greece and \n     Turkey, as seen most recently with the January 2008 visit to \n     Turkey by the Prime Minister of Greece, Kostas Karamanlis, \n     the first official visit to Turkey by a Prime Minister of \n     Greece in 49 years;\n       Whereas Greece is a key energy security hub that delivers \n     gas to Europe via the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector;\n       Whereas Greece is a world leader in the assimilation of \n     immigrants, with immigrants having grown to more than 10 \n     percent of people employed in Greece;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort to advance freedom, democracy, peace, \n     stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between the governments and the peoples of Greece and the \n     United States;\n       Whereas March 25, 2008, marks the 187th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the people of Greece \n     from the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the people of the \n     United States to celebrate this anniversary with the people \n     of Greece and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which both Greece and the United States were born: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2008, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/07/senate-section/article/S1782-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
