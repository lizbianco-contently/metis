Mr. President, Americans are probably wondering why \nthe rebate checks we have been talking about now for almost a month are \nstill being debated on the floor of the Senate, and we owe them an \nanswer.\n  Two weeks ago they saw what looked like a bipartisan agreement \nbetween Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the White House over \nthe details of a deal. They saw Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner, to \ntheir great credit, resist the temptation to add pet projects that they \nknew would only slow the package down--and rob it of its stimulative \neffect. They heard a chorus of pleas from economists, trade groups, and \nMembers of both parties in both Chambers endorsing this approach. This \npackage had to be targeted and it had to be timely, or it wouldn't work \nat all.\n  So most days we find ourselves trying to explain to people why it \ntakes so long to do things in the Senate. But this time was going to be \ndifferent. Here was that rare situation when both parties agreed to put \npolitics and individual interests aside and come together for the good \nof the people.\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\n  But then the stimulus bullet train turned into a rickety stage coach \nhere in the Senate. When it got right down to it, Senate Democrats \ncouldn't do what House Democrats had done. They couldn't resist--not \neven one time--a chance to play politics.\n  If Americans are wondering why their checks aren't in the mail, they \ncan find it in last week's news clips. Of particular interest is an AP \nstory entitled ``Politics Creeps into Stimulus Package.'' Democrats are \nholding onto the stimulus bill, the article said, not to speed up the \nrebate checks, but to try to make Republicans look bad in November. \nAsked about the amendments we were expecting to take up this week, the \nsenior Senator from New York said, ``It's tough votes for them.'' It's \ntough votes for them.\n  Now, the same AP article also helpfully points out that the senior \nSenator from New York is no sideline observer in this debate. It notes \nthat he moonlights as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee. For people outside the beltway, that means he is in charge \nof recruiting and helping Democrat candidates for the Senate--which, \nthis week, according to the AP, evidently involves holding up the \nstimulus bill over votes he thinks will help his candidates against \nRepublicans in November.\n  Now I don't know if the thrust of this article was entirely accurate. \nBut if it was, these are precisely the kind of shenanigans Americans \nhad been hoping we could get past this year. And, frankly, Senate \nRepublicans were hopeful after the speed with which the House approved \nits version of the growth package that Senate Democrats would also see \nthe wisdom in coming together to deliver relief in a timely manner.\n  It's disappointing that politics would come to play a part in a deal \nthat seemed refreshingly free from it for a change. But unfortunately, \nit seems the never-ending campaign that tainted so much of last year's \nSenate business has carried over to this year.\n  Last night, my good friend the majority leader suggested that \nRepublicans were delaying action on the stimulus plan because we asked \nfor some time to review his latest proposal--a full 4 days after he \nsaid he would deliver it. Never mind that passage of the Senate \nDemocrats' bill forces a conference, worsening an already-prolonged \nprocess. Never mind that once we did take a look, we noticed an extra \n$1 billion in spending, which I think most Americans would consider a \nsignificant addition. And never mind that our friends on the other side \nhad no intention of voting on the package today anyway.\n  We could have disposed of this stimulus package a week ago, but our \nDemocratic colleagues wanted, as they said, to put their ``stamp'' on \nit.\n  Mr. President, I don't think Americans care one bit whether this bill \nhas a Republican or a Democratic stamp on it. They are completely fed \nup with political gotcha. Americans want--and deserve--results.\n  Taxpayers will get their rebate checks and businesses will get their \nmuch-needed relief, but not without having to watch a show here for a \nfew more days or a week--put on for the sake of a depressingly familiar \npolitical circus.\n  That is unacceptable to Republicans. I presume it is unacceptable to \nthe 385 Democrats and Republicans who voted the stimulus package out of \nthe House.\n  It is unacceptable to the more than 100 million American families who \nare probably still wondering why we are talking about this bill at all.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S614-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S614-S615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have seen here on the Senate floor \nthis morning is very much in keeping with what has happened in the last \n7 years with the Bush administration. The Bush administration is \nOrwellian. It says something that means something else. The President \ncomes to town and wants to be a ``uniter'' and not a divider. The \nAmerican people know how disingenuous that has been.\n  The President had the ceremony on an aircraft carrier. He had his \nflight suit on, with a big banner up saying ``Mission Accomplished.'' \nThat was almost 5 years ago. Since that time, 3,000 American soldiers \nhave been killed, and more than 20,000 have been wounded. Is that \nOrwellian? I think so.\n  What has taken place here on the Senate floor today is in keeping \nwith this Bush situation.\n  By the way, the Bush White House--for the first time in more than 130 \nyears--has someone working in the White House who is indicted and \nconvicted of a crime. The same White House had someone in charge of \nbudgeting and taking care of Government contracts who is now in prison, \nMr. Safavian. This is the same President who presided over a House \nmajority leader who had two ethics convictions. What did he do to avoid \nany penalties? He changed the rules in the House until he was indicted \nby the State of Texas. Now, a number of House Members' staff who dealt \nwith that are in prison, and others are planning on going there.\n  Mr. President, what we have heard today here on the Senate floor is \nas Orwellian as anything could be. Two weeks ago, the House passed a \nbipartisan bill. Sure, they did. They sent it over here for us. Under \nthe Constitution, we have an obligation to consider that. It is an \ninsult to the bipartisan bill that came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to call this matter which is now before the Senate \n``Senators' pet projects.''\n  We have millions of people who are out of work and others who are \nlooking at being out of work. We have in our bill a ``pet project'' \ncalling for extending unemployment benefits. That is our ``pet \nproject.'' I have to stand accused, and I am guilty of that because I \nsupport that.\n  As we speak, we have some people--even though in Washington it is \nfairly warm and the low last night was 41, other people are cold. We \nhave a ``pet project'' in the bill dealing with giving them assistance \nso they can pay their heating bills. They will spend that money very \nquickly.\n  We have another ``pet project'' that was supported on a bipartisan \nbasis in the bill to give homeowners relief. One of the ``pet \nprojects'' in this bill was talked about by the President in his State \nof the Union Message. When we heard him say it, we all knew he probably \ndidn't really mean it, but he talked about doing something to refinance \nhomes that are in default. We took the President's word, and one of our \n``pet projects'' is what the President wanted and which is in this \nSenate stimulus package.\n  To talk about the timely nature of this, a rebate check, even under \nthe most generous timeframe, cannot come until after the income tax \nreturns are filed in April of this year. So we are moving this as \nquickly as we should.\n  One of the ``pet projects'' we have in this bill is to take care of \nabout 250,000 disabled veterans--American veterans who, in the course \nof their duties serving this country, have become disabled. We, as one \nof our ``pet projects,'' decided it would be nice--if everyone else was \ngetting a rebate check, shouldn't a disabled veteran get one? So that \nis a ``pet project.'' I support it, and I think it is very important.\n  One of the ``pet projects'' we support--and I think there is \nbipartisan support for it--is to take care of 21.5 million seniors who, \nwith the House-passed bill, get a big goose egg--nothing. I have not \ncriticized the House bill. It was a good start. But even Speaker \nPelosi, my dear friend, recognizes that what they did is inadequate and \nthat what we are going to do is much better. We are going to give 21.5 \nmillion seniors a rebate. What does that mean? They will spend it and \nstimulate the economy.\n  Mr. President, to say they need time to read this gargantuan bill we \nhave--it was best summarized by the Senator from California; she did it \nlast night. Senator Boxer brought to the Senate floor the addition to \nthe bill that they are still reading. It is a page and a half long.

Mr. President, tomorrow, Wednesday, February 6, at Camp \nPendleton in my home State of California, one of the true heroes of our \ncountry will receive a rare and distinguished honor. On what would have \nbeen his 25th birthday, Marine Cpl Sean Andrew Stokes--and I show you \nthat beautiful face in this picture--will be awarded the Silver Star \nfor heroic actions performed in the line of duty during Operation \nPhantom Fury in Fallujah, Iraq.\n  From November 9 through November 18 of 2004, then-Private Stokes took \nthe position of ``point'' in his platoon. That means he was the first \nMarine to enter a building and the first Marine to encounter whatever \nand whoever was inside. Bullets, grenades, and rockets were around \nevery corner. For 9 days and nights, Sean fought insurgents in hand-to-\nhand combat, in house after house, in building after building.\n  Most of us would lose our sanity in such a place, but Sean kept his \nsanity with a simple prayer of thanks after coming out of each house \nalive.\n  Word of Sean's actions over those days quickly spread. The History \nChannel made a documentary about the battle of Fallujah, and Sean's \nheroic actions were prominently featured.\n  Embedded in Sean's platoon was Pat O'Donnell, a historian who wrote a \ncritically acclaimed book, ``We Were One: Shoulder to Shoulder with the \nMarines Who Took Fallujah.'' Mr. O'Donnell has said Sean hid his wounds \non more than one occasion so he could stay with his Marine brothers \nrather than take the mandatory medical evacuation. He said:\n\n       Sean always put others first before himself.\n\n  Sean will be receiving the Silver Star tomorrow for his actions on \nhis first tour. His father Gary conducted research, and as best as he \ncan tell, Sean is the first Marine to be awarded the Silver Star for \nactions while a private since two Marine privates received such an \nhonor during the Vietnam war.\n  In September 2005, Sean returned to Iraq, once again at the front of \nhis platoon, where he distinguished himself and was eventually promoted \nto corporal.\n  Sean could have left the Marine Corps at the end of that tour. His \nfather urged him to get out, but Sean said: What about everybody else? \nHe felt the need to stick by his buddies who had stood by his side \nevery single day in Iraq.\n  In April of 2007, Sean went back for his third deployment. Sean's \nfather wrote:\n\n       He went back to Iraq to protect his best friend, Bradley \n     Adams, and because he wanted to be a Marine more than \n     anything else in life.\n\n  Sean, along with Bradley, was assigned to the battalion commander's \npersonal security detachment, a position reserved for elite and combat-\nseasoned warriors. The two managed to eventually maneuver their way \ninto the lead vehicle, once again taking point, which earned Sean the \nnickname ``Pathfinder.''\n  That battalion commander told Gary Stokes his son had saved his life \non numerous occasions, including on July 30, 2007, the day Sean Stokes \ndied from an improvised explosive device attack while on patrol in Al \nAnbar Province.\n  Over 820 men and women who were either from California or based in \nCalifornia have died in Iraq. This young and heroic Marine is one of \nthem.\n  Sean Stokes represented the best of the Marine Corps, the best of the \nUnited States, the best of California. He was born 25 years ago \nWednesday in Fremont, CA. He grew up in the gold country of California \nin the town of Auburn.\n  He was into cars and his dad says he had lots of them. When he \nreturned from his first tour in Iraq, the people of Auburn learned he \nwanted to fix up his Honda Prelude, so they, the people of the town, \nput on some new rims, spruced it up, and made it look good--all free of \ncharge--for Sean.\n  He attended Bear River High School, where he played linebacker on the \nfootball team and the outfield on the baseball team.\n  Upon learning that Sean died, Bear River retired his No. 51 football \njersey, the first time the school has ever retired a number.\n  Of his baseball ability, Sean's dad draws a parallel to a great home-\nrun hitter also born on Wednesday--Babe Ruth. He said it is no \ncoincidence that he was the only kid on the all-star team to hit the \nball out of Babe Ruth Baseball Park onto the nearby road, not once but \nthree times.\n  Sean's dad also says he was quite popular and had lots of \ngirlfriends. But he had found true love and was engaged to Nicole \nBesier, a beautiful young girl who is also a Marine.\n  Gary Stokes wrote to me about his son:\n\n       Sean turned out to be a great fisherman and from the time \n     he was a little guy, he loved to fish. I remember taking Sean \n     camping, and that is all he wanted to do the entire time \n     during our camping trips and other outings and vacations. \n     Even though I understand that the Tigris River was polluted \n     and at times surrounded by terrorists, I would be surprised \n     if Sean did not throw in a fishing line a few times during \n     one of his three tours in Iraq.\n\n  ``Sean, like his brother Kevin, is a great son,'' his father writes. \nWe do have a photo, I believe, of Kevin. We are going to get out the \nphoto to show the brothers together.\n\n       Sean, like his brother Kevin, is a great son, and we always \n     would make sure to make time to do fun things together as \n     much as possible, like golf, fishing, or camping.\n\n  This is a picture of Sean and his brother.\n  His father continues:\n\n       Sean and I made the commitment years ago to not be like the \n     father and son in the song ``Cats in the Cradle.'' Sean has \n     touched many lives during his short life and he was loved and \n     was respected by everyone whom he met.\n       Sean's life was short, but it was full and he always gave \n     it his all in everything he did.\n\n  Tomorrow's ceremony at Camp Pendleton honors the heroism and the \nbravery of Sean Stokes. Similar to the other Marines out at Camp \nPendleton and the rest of the men and women in uniform around the \nworld, he volunteered to carry the burden of protecting our beloved \nNation.\n  He fought for the man next to him and for the troops behind him, and \nhe died in service to them. We owe him our gratitude. And we owe his \nfamily our gratitude and we owe the families of all the men and women \nwho serve in harm's way our gratitude. We can never forget what they \nhave sacrificed.\n  I conclude as the Senator from California, we have lost so many. As a \nmother, as a grandmother, I will do everything, along with my \ncolleagues, to bring our troops home and to spare others the deep grief \nthis family has endured.\n  I again thank Senator Kyl for his graciousness in allowing me to have \nthis opportunity to pay tribute to Sean.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her \nremarks about Sean and his service to this country. He clearly \nrepresents all those marines, soldiers, and others who have given their \nlives and the many others who have been casualties of conflicts on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  We do, indeed, owe them our debt of gratitude and we, as \npolicymakers, in the country owe them decisionmaking which ensures that \ntheir sacrifices will not have been in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S616-S619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to turn to the business at hand, which \nis the so-called economic stimulus package. I have not had an \nopportunity to offer my personal views on this issue.\n  I do not believe that tax rebate checks and an extension of \nunemployment benefits will boost the economy. Of course, Americans \ndeserve to keep more of their hard-earned dollars and Washington should \nspend less of them. But giving people tax rebates and telling them to \ngo shopping will do virtually nothing to grow our economy. Our economy \ngrows--GDP increases--when new goods and services are produced. A one-\ntime shopping spree is not going to encourage a business to hire one \nadditional worker or invest in one additional machine. Only a permanent \nreduction in tax rates will do that.\n  Gross domestic product increased by just 0.6 percent in the fourth \nquarter of 2007. While most economists do not forecast that the U.S. \neconomy will enter recession this year, they do estimate it will enter \na period of below-trend growth in the first half of 2008, with growth \nrecovering in the third and fourth quarters.\n  The current unemployment rate is 4.9 percent; down from 5 percent in \nDecember. The drop is due to an upward revision in the number of jobs \ncreated in December.\n  The preliminary estimate is that the number of jobs created in \nJanuary fell by 17,000--the first decline in many months. But note that \na very small increase in December job creation was revised upward to \n82,000 new jobs. Also, the initial August 2007 jobs reading showed a \n4,000 job decline, but it too was revised upward substantially. The \nJanuary figure could well be revised upward.\n  Over the past 30 years, from 1977 to 2007, personal consumption has \ngrown steadily and strongly and has not fallen off during economic \ndownturns.\n  In contrast, during times of economic weakness, private investment \ndeclines significantly. We are seeing this very thing happen during \nthis economic downturn as well.\n  The Treasury Secretary negotiated an agreement with the bipartisan \nHouse leadership. That agreement was fairly simple:\n  It provides a rebate of $600 for individuals and $1,200 for married \nfilers, and gives parents another $300 for each child. The rebate is \nphased out for individuals with adjusted gross income of more than \n$75,000, and couples with adjusted gross income. of $150,000.\n  It also expands the ability of small businesses to expense new \nequipment purchases for 2008 and gives businesses of all sizes the \nability to write off 50 percent the cost of many new depreciable assets \nplaced in service in 2008.\n  The House bill was passed on January 29 by a vote of 385 to 35.\n  The administration predicts that the proposal would boost the economy \nby about 0.7 percent. In reality, that ``growth'' would be borrowed \nfrom the future. It would not create new growth.\n  While I disagree with the central premise of the House-passed bill--\nthat we need to stimulate consumer spending--I am impressed that the \nbill was very narrowly focused and that it generally did not include \nnew spending.\n  While the House bill was not the bill I would have written, I feared \nthat it would become far worse in the Senate. It has.\n  The bill passed out of the Finance Committee dedicates $10 billion to \nextend unemployment benefits. Our current unemployment rate is 4.9 \npercent. Congress has never before extended unemployment benefits when \nthe rate is this low. Because extending unemployment benefits has the \neffect of lengthening the traditional spell of unemployment by 1 to 2 \nweeks, this provision effectively eliminates any possible stimulative \neffect of the bill.\n  It also included a slightly smaller tax rebate--$500 per individual, \n$1,000 per couple, $300 per child. Unlike the House bill, the rebate \nwould be available to senior citizens and disabled veterans who \notherwise have no earned income. While I generally oppose the idea of \nrebate checks, this change from the House bill is probably one on which \nwe can agree. But we should understand that fully 42 percent of the \nrebate approved by the Finance Committee is classified as ``spending'' \nbecause it would go to individuals with no tax liability.\n  The Finance bill also seeks to ensure that illegal immigrants cannot \nlegally obtain tax rebates, something we all support.\n  The Finance package also includes the same business tax breaks as the \nHouse bill but adds a 5-year carryback for net operating losses. This \nis an important provision that I helped to have included in the Finance \nbill and I would support adding it to the House bill.\n  From this point, the Finance Committee bill really becomes a \nChristmas tree. All kinds of legislative ornaments have been attached:\n  $3 billion for utilities wind and solar energy production;\n  $1.6 billion for energy-efficient homes, not particularly wise, given \nthe glut of new homes on the markets;\n  $323 million for manufacturers of energy-efficient appliances;\n  $247 million for tax breaks for wealthier investors in marginal oil \nand gas wells;\n  $153 million to for energy-efficient commercial buildings; and\n  $100 million for coal companies owed interest by the Federal \ngovernment from a court case.\n  Interestingly, the committee defeated an amendment I offered to patch \nthe AMT for 2008.\n  The committee defeated an amendment offered by Senator Ensign to \nprovide another repatriation window, during which companies could bring \nback overseas earnings at a much-reduced tax rate.\n  The committee also denied me an opportunity to offer a package of \nindividual and business tax provisions that expired at the end of 2007 \nand other provisions that expire at the end of this year, including:\n  the teacher tax deduction,\n  the tuition deduction,\n  the R tax credit,\n  accelerated depreciation for leaseholds and restaurants, and\n  extending foreign tax changes that help U.S. multinationals compete--\nactive financing and the CFC look-through.\n  At best, proposals for short-term, demand-side stimulus will borrow \neconomic growth and consumer spending from the future, and will appear \nto create a small boost for the economy.\n  My real worry is that we are doing a disservice to all Americans if \nwe tell them that increasing consumer spending is a panacea to our \neconomic problems.\n  We would be far wiser to recognize that our short-term challenge now \nis deflated home values and a glut of housing, along with insufficient \nliquidity in the capital markets--none of which will be fixed by this, \nor the House-passed, stimulus bill.\n  The only viable remedy is to focus on policies that encourage \nsustainable economic growth by encouraging work, investment, and \nentrepreneurship.\n  We are scheduled to see across-the-board hikes in income tax rates \nand investment tax rates, as the current rates automatically expire, \nreverting to the pre-2001 and pre-2003 higher rates--and we know from \neconomists that the only way to encourage sustainable economic growth \nis to encourage work, savings, and investment through lower marginal \nrates.\n  No one is willing to see the child tax credit cut in half, the \nmarriage penalty spring back to life, or a host of other popular \nprovisions disappear.\n  Washington is slowly coming to the realization that our corporate tax \nrate of 35 percent hurts American competitiveness. Only one OECD \ncountry--Japan--has a higher rate.\n  In fact, I filed an amendment to cut the corporate rate to 25 percent \nwhen the Finance Committee considered the economic stimulus bill. Larry \nKudlow had this to say about my amendment:\n\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\n\n       In my view, this would be the single best pro-growth \n     measure that Washington could take. It would help create \n     healthy businesses, create jobs, and raise real wages. It \n     also would boost the dollar. The minute such a bill is \n     signed--the very minute--the incentive effects would take \n     place.\n\n  Last year, the Treasury Department released a study of American \ncompetitiveness and determined that our high corporate tax rate is in \nfact a barrier to encouraging businesses to locate in the U.S.\n  Also in 2007, Charlie Rangel, the chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, unveiled a comprehensive tax reform proposal which \nincluded a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 30 percent. There \nseems to be a growing consensus across party lines that our corporate \ntax rate should be reduced.\n  Another idea that has been gaining traction is reducing the corporate \ncapital gains rate. This would have a tremendous ``unlocking effect.'' \nIt simply makes no sense to tax corporate capital gains at 35 percent; \nsuch a high tax rate only encourages companies to hold on to \nunproductive assets.\n  For years and years, investors and Government officials have debated \nwhether the Treasury Department has the necessary authority to index \ncapital gains for inflation without Congress needing to act \nlegislatively. I believe there is a case to be made that Treasury does \nhave the authority, and I hope the President will take this bold step \nin his final year.\n  Forty-two percent of the cost of the Senate Finance Committee \neconomic stimulus ``rebate'' goes to Americans with no tax liability.\n  The percentage of Americans who actually pay taxes continues to \nshrink and our ability to raise revenue by increasing taxes on ``the \nwealthy'' is a losing proposition.\n  In 2004, 37 percent of all Federal personal income taxes were paid by \nthe top 1 percent of taxpayers; the bottom half of taxpayers, by \nadjusted gross income, pay just 3.3 percent of Federal personal income \ntaxes. We run the very real risk of developing a system whereby a \nmajority of Americans do not have a stake in limiting the size of our \nFederal Government because they do not have to pay for it.\n  Congress should consider some research explained in a recent Wall \nStreet Journal column by Art Laffer. Art Laffer explains that the \nhighest income earners are the most sensitive to tax increases and the \nmost likely to plan to avoid tax increases. He found that over the last \n25 years, as the top income tax rates fell, the share of income taxes \nand the dollar-value of taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers \nincreased dramatically. Over that same period, as income tax rates fell \nfor the bottom 75 percent of taxpayers, both the share of Federal \nincome taxes paid and the dollar amount of income taxes paid fell too.\n  Laffer points out that the temptation to cut taxes in the lower \nbrackets--or only retain the current rate structure for the lower \nbrackets--while raising taxes for taxpayers in the top brackets is \ncompletely counterproductive. The only tax cuts that seem to result in \nincreased revenues are those that affect the wealthiest taxpayers \nbecause they have the ability to defer income, invest in tax deferred \naccounts, invest in tax-exempt bonds, and otherwise plan around taxes.\n  Art Laffer closes his article with this statement:\n\n       Mark my words: If the Democrats succeed in implementing \n     their plan to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle and \n     lower income earners, this country will experience a fiscal \n     crisis of serious proportions that will last for years and \n     years. . .\n\n  While Congress is focusing on stimulating consumer spending and \nshort-term economic fixes, we must remember that it makes far better \nsense to plan for long-term, sustainable economic growth. We must not \nlet this deviation into Keynesian economics become an excuse for \nmassive increases in government spending, tax policies geared toward \nshort-term consumer spending; we must not ignore the importance of \nlong-term savings and investment and we must remember to reward hard \nwork with permanently low income tax rates.\n  As George Melloan wrote recently:\n\n       Ironically, even the brilliant John Maynard Keynes disowned \n     [Keynesian Economics]. After meeting with a group of \n     Washington ``Keynesians'' in 1944, he said he was the only \n     non-Keynesian in the room. His brainchild . . . had been \n     converted from its originally intended limited application to \n     an all-purpose economic panacea by politicians, academics, \n     and journalists.\n\n   I wish to summarize, in 3 or 4 minutes, what I think is at work \nhere.\n  My view, contrary to the President and to some others in my party, is \nthat tax rebate checks and extension of unemployment benefits will not \nboost the economy. Obviously, Americans deserve to keep more of their \nhard-earned dollars, and obviously Washington should spend less of \nthem, but giving people tax rebates and telling them to go shopping \nwill do virtually nothing to grow our economy.\n  Our economy grows; that is to say, the gross domestic product \nincreases, when new goods and services are produced. A one-time \nshopping spree is not going to encourage business to hire one \nadditional employee or invest in one additional machine. Only a \npermanent reduction in tax rates will do that.\n  I will share a couple statistics relating to the state of our economy \nnow, particularly as it relates to unemployment.\n  The current unemployment rate is 4.9 percent. That is down from 5 \npercent in December. The drop is due to an upward revision of the \nnumber of jobs created in December. The preliminary estimate is that \nthe number of jobs created in January fell by 17,000, which is the \nfirst decline in months. But note that a very small increase in \nDecember job creation was revised upward to 82,000 new jobs, and the \ninitial August 2007 jobs reading showed a 4,000-job decline, but it \nalso was revised substantially upward. So the January figure could also \nbe revised upward.\n  The point is unemployment is at a relatively low level in this \ncountry, and it would be a huge mistake for us to exacerbate the \nunemployment situation by extending unemployment benefits, as the \nSenate Finance Committee does.\n  In addition, personal consumption is growing strongly and steadily, \nas it has over the last 30 years. It has not fallen off at all. What \nhas fallen off, and this happens during times of economic weakness, is \nprivate investment, which has declined significantly, and that is what \nshould be addressed but is not addressed, in the so-called stimulus \npackage. Rather, what is addressed in the stimulus package is, of \ncourse, consumer spending which, in this case, is not the solution to \nthe problem.\n  At best, proposals for short-term, demand-side stimulus will borrow \neconomic growth and consumer spending from the future and will appear \nto create a small boost to the economy right now, but they are \nborrowing it from the future. Of course, we are also borrowing $150 \nbillion in order to accomplish this result.\n  My worry is we are doing a disservice to all Americans if we tell \nthem an increase in consumer spending is a panacea to our economic \nproblems. It is not. We would be far wiser to recognize our short-term \nchallenge now is depleted home values, a glut of housing, along with \ninsufficient liquidity in the capital markets, and none of this is \nfixed by the stimulus bill before us. The only viable remedy is to \nfocus on policies that encourage sustainable economic growth by \nencouraging work, investment, and entrepreneurship.\n  One of the first things we have to address is to make sure we do not \nsuffer a tax increase. That would be the worst thing that would happen, \nand we are headed for that if Congress does not take action to take \nthat from taking place, which is automatically built into our tax laws. \nIn 2 years, unless Congress does something, we will have the largest \ntax increase in the history of the country. So we should be signaling \nright now that is not going to happen.\n  We should also get in line with the other countries in the world and \nreduce our corporate income tax rate which, except for Japan, is the \nhighest in the world. That would do something immediately to help.\n  We should also index taxes, such as the capital gains tax, for \ninflation. For years, investors and Government officials have debated \nwhether the Treasury Department has the authority to do this. I believe \nit does have the authority to do it administratively and that we ought \nto do it. But if the administration doesn't do it, then the Congress \nought to do it.\n\n  The bottom line is there is a variety of things we could do to \nactually stimulate economic growth to provide for\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nthe long-term productivity increases in capital expansion and job \ncreation that provide that kind of economic growth. That is what will \nsolve the problem, not a one-time rebate for people who would far \nrather have a job than a $500 check. So while we are focusing on \nstimulating consumer spending and the short-term economic fixes, my \nview is it would make far better sense to plan for the long term and to \ndo those things which provide for actual sustainable growth.\n  We cannot let this deviation into so-called Keynesian economics \nbecome an excuse for massive tax increases and Government spending or \ntax policies geared toward short-term consumer spending. We must not \nignore the importance of long-term savings and investment, and we must \nremember to reward hard work with permanently low income tax rates. As \nGeorge Melloan recently wrote:\n\n       Ironically, even the brilliant John Maynard Keynes disowned \n     Keynesian Economics. After meeting with a group of Washington \n     ``Keynesians'' in 1944, he said he was the only non-Keynesian \n     in the room. His brainchild had been converted from its \n     originally intended limited application to an all-purpose \n     economic panacea by politicians, academics, and journalists.\n\n  I hope we will not fall into the same trap this year, in 2008, but \nrecognize there are some significant things we could do to stimulate \nthe economy to ensure that the average American family is not burdened \nwith increasing taxes. The first step in that direction is not to go \nanother $150 billion in debt by offering people rebate checks and an \nextension of unemployment compensation but, rather, by signaling to \nthem we are serious about ensuring there will not be a big tax increase \nin this country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when I returned after the Christmas \nrecess, along with all my colleagues, it was with high hopes that we \nwould be able to work together to solve America's problems in a \nbipartisan way. There were some promising indications that would indeed \nbe possible when the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \nRepublican leader in the House and the President of the United States \ncame together to deal with one of the emerging crises in our country, \nwhich is the economic downturn caused by the subprime lending crisis \nand a downturn in the housing markets.\n  Unfortunately, we have begun to see that bipartisan cooperation \nfraying and some downright foot-dragging that causes me a lot of \nconcern. I can't help but think if I am concerned, there are a lot of \nother people, not only in this body but across the country, who are \nconcerned by the contradiction between what Members of Congress \nsometimes say and what actually happens. Sometimes we can get caught up \nin the Senate rules regarding cloture and how the amendment process \nworks, and that is the kind of thing Senators and our staff like and we \nlive with. Frankly, the one thing the American people can sense from a \nhundred miles off is hypocrisy--saying one thing and then doing \nanother.\n  I heard it suggested one time that the opposite of the definition of \nprogress must be Congress. It sounds to me like something Mark Twain or \nWill Rogers might say, to say that Congress is the opposite of \nprogress. But we have had two examples of important legislation we \nshould be acting upon in a timely way that have been dragged down by \ninexplicable delay, and I think it is important that we focus on that.\n  We have heard from the Republican leader this morning regarding his \nconcerns that the bipartisan stimulus package, which, as Speaker Pelosi \nsaid, needed to be targeted, timely, and temporary, has now gotten \nbogged down in an attempt to add additional spending on that bill in a \nway that invites additional amendments on the floor of the Senate. That \nmeans further delay. Add to that a conference committee, which will \nthen delay it even further, and that means the American people, who \nwere expecting rebate checks on their taxes, will have to wait longer, \nand the chances that this stimulus will in fact be effective in helping \nto avert a recession makes it much less likely that it will have any \nimpact whatsoever. So delay is costly in terms of our chances for \nhaving a positive impact on averting this recession.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Another area I want to talk about briefly has to do with our national \nsecurity and our ability to listen to al-Qaida terrorists talk to each \nother either on the telephone or by e-mail or text messages. Last week, \nwe spent an entire 3 days basically doing nothing while we tried to get \nthe FISA reauthorization bill--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct bill--passed on a bipartisan basis. Now you would think this is \nsomething we ought to be able to come together on in a bipartisan way. \nThe bill that came out of the Intelligence Committee passed by a \nbipartisan vote of 13 to 2. But then it comes to the floor of the \nSenate and it becomes locked down in attempts to block this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  There has been the suggestion that we haven't had enough time to \nconsider this legislation. Well, I think it is worth noting, as this \nchart does, the history of this important legislation.\n  You will remember that it was April of 2007 that the Director of \nNational Intelligence suggested we needed significant reforms in our \nability to listen in to conversations between terrorists overseas who \nwere determined and committed to trying to kill innocent Americans and \nour allies. So the Director of National Intelligence last April said we \nneed an update in this important law to make sure we aren't deaf to the \nthreat or blind to the threat in a way that will endanger American \nlives.\n  In May of 2007, there was a significant decision made by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court which suggested that phone calls \nbetween two foreign nationals, circuited through the United States, had \nto get an order through a lengthy application process in order to \nlisten in. The Director of National Intelligence suggested to us that \nwe were missing as much as two-thirds of the actionable intelligence \nnecessary to listen in to our enemies in order to detect, deter, and \nhopefully prevent terrorist attacks on our soil and against our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In July of 2007, the Director of National Intelligence briefed \nCongress on the urgent need to update this law in light of these gaps. \nTo its credit, the Senate did get together on a bipartisan basis, at \nleast for a while, in August of 2007 to pass a 6-month piece of \nlegislation. Why it was 6 months, I don't know. It should have been \npermanent. That legislation was the Protect America Act, which would \nhave expired February 1 but for a 2-week extension that was recently \nagreed to. So the Senate can get its act together and do what it knows \nwe have to do to protect American lives and to keep our Nation secure.\n  In October of 2007, the Intelligence Committee, as I noted earlier--\nthe committee that is given the responsibility of oversight of our \nintelligence community and for keeping our intelligence laws up to \ndate--passed a strong bipartisan bill supported by the Director of \nNational Intelligence that would give the intelligence community all \nthe tools consistent with our laws that it needed in order to keep \nAmerica safe. It passed by 13 to 2--strong bipartisan support.\n  The Judiciary Committee then, in November of 2007, a committee on \nwhich I sit, unfortunately passed an alternative piece of legislation \nstrictly along partisan lines that was designed to be a substitute. In \nDecember 2007, we tried to take up this issue because, again, it was \ngoing to expire, and we saw that our Democratic friends basically \nblocked the Intelligence Committee bill in December of 2007.\n  On January 23, after we returned from the Christmas holidays and the \nNew Year's break, we returned to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct legislation with the knowledge, as I said, that it was going to \nexpire by February 1 if we didn't act. Well, frankly, because of the \nmeltdown here in the Senate and our inability to pass basic legislation \nthat is necessary to keep America safe, because of the gamesmanship \nthat is going on, we had to pass a temporary extension which is now set \nto expire February 15.\n  I don't understand why it is that the Senate seems to be incapable of \ngetting its business taken care of. When we come back with such high \nhopes that we are going to see a change in attitude and that we will be \nworking together in a bipartisan way to solve the problems that \nconfront our country--whether it is our economy or national\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nsecurity--it seems to last about as long as a winter snow on a warm \nday. It sounds good and looks good 1 day, and then melts away the next \nday. We need to stop squandering these opportunities to work together. \nWe need to get some work done.\n  Last night, even though the majority leader had previously told us we \nwould not be voting on either Monday or Tuesday, in light of the big \nelection vote that was going to occur today, he changed his mind, and \nit is his prerogative to do so, so we had a vote on the economic \nstimulus package that the House passed, and which the Republican leader \nsaid we should take up and pass in a bipartisan way in order to \nexpedite that legislation. The motion we voted on last night passed \noverwhelmingly in support of that House legislation by 80 to 4--80 to \n4.\n  So why it is we can't, in a similar fashion, take up that legislation \nand pass it without slowing it down by adding on a lot of extraneous \nspending by people viewing this as a Christmas tree on which they want \nto hang their favorite ornament as a way to fund their pet projects; \nWhy it is we can't resist that temptation and expedite passage of this \nimportant legislation is, frankly, beyond me. I wish we would take care \nof the Nation's business. Unfortunately, the majority leader handed us \nhis alternative legislation last night, a 70-plus-page bill that is \ncompletely different both from the Finance Committee bill that was \npassed out of the Senate and the House bill that has been negotiated \nbetween the Speaker and the White House and the Republican leader in \nthe House.\n  I think we ought to be aware of high-pressure tactics, and that was \ncertainly a high-pressure tactic to try to come up with a brandnew bill \nthat nobody has looked at and insist we pass that bill without an \nadequate time to review it and to see what goodies have been inserted \nin this piece of legislation that some of us may object to. So it is my \nsincere hope we will not continue to squander the opportunities we have \nbeen presented with to work together to pass this economic stimulus \npackage on a bipartisan basis, or this Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act reauthorization which has been on the radar for the \nSenate since at least April of 2007. There is simply no excuse for not \nacting on a timely basis to deal with both of these issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask if the Chair would advise me as to the current \nstatus of morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was on the floor earlier this morning \nwhen Senator McConnell came and made a little statement I would like to \naddress at this moment because it seems to me Senator McConnell said a \nfew things which bear repeating.\n  He was critical of the bill which we passed in the Senate Finance \nCommittee to try to get the American economy back on its feet. The \neconomy is struggling now. We had troubling unemployment figures last \nweek. We know the President said repeatedly we are moving toward a \nrecession. We know a recession means high unemployment, business \nfailures, and lost opportunities for Americans and American business.\n  So we certainly want to do everything we can to stop that. One of the \nthings that has been done by the Federal Reserve is to cut interest \nrates in the hope that people will be encouraged to borrow money \nresponsibly for purchases such as cars and homes and the like and that \nthose purchases will breathe some life into the economy.\n  Then there is the other side of the ledger when it comes to our \neconomy, what we can do in Congress and with the President. What we try \nto do is to give Americans more spending power. Right now there is less \nconsumer confidence. People are worried about bills they have to pay, \nhealth insurance that has gone up dramatically over the last 7 years, \nthe cost of gasoline which many in my home State of Illinois, \nparticularly downstate, know very well personally has increased in cost \ndramatically.\n  We also understand people putting their kids through college have \nseen tremendous increases in the cost of college education. The \nincrease in the cost of food, that sort of thing, has led a number of \npeople to be worried about whether they should make a big expenditure. \nSo one of the things we are considering is something to stimulate the \neconomy, an economic stimulus package, what can we do, how can we put \nspending power and confidence back in the hands of American families.\n  The President met with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and \nthe Republican leader, John Boehner, and worked out at least the \nbeginning of that stimulus approach. What they suggested was they would \nsend checks of about $600 to individual taxpayers across America within \ncertain income limits and $1,200 for a family and extra for those with \nchildren.\n  That money would go directly to a lot of people who will spend it \nbecause there are folks who are struggling month to month, paycheck to \npaycheck. That is a good thing to do. It is a group that has often been \noverlooked recently, that the tax cuts in Washington, under this \nadministration, have not focused on giving helping hands to working \nfamilies as much as giving a helping hand to those who do not need it, \nthe wealthiest in our country.\n  So this idea of an economic stimulus, which finally focuses our \nattention on struggling families, is a good thing. The House passed its \nversion in a bipartisan fashion, sent it over to the Senate to \nconsider. Senator Max Baucus, Chairman of the Finance Committee, met \nwith that committee, and worked on ways to change it or improve it that \nthey think would be helpful.\n  At the end of the day, the proposal by the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhich passed with a bipartisan vote, three Republicans joining the \nDemocrats in voting for it, is one that I think is a better package, a \nbetter approach.\n  The House's is good. I like the House stimulus approach, but I think \nthe Senate stimulus package is better.\n  This morning McConnell came to the floor, the Republican Senate \nleader. He was very critical of what the Senate Finance Committee \npassed on a bipartisan basis. He was critical of their measure, which \npassed with the support of Republican Senators.\n  He used phrases and terms in describing it that I think are worth \nlooking into. Senator McConnell suggested we were involved in pet \nprojects in this Senate stimulus package.\n  Well, I have taken a look at it. I am curious as to what pet projects \nhe is talking about. I find it hard to believe the Republicans feel 21 \nmillion seniors who will receive a helping hand with the Senate Finance \nCommittee are somehow superfluous, not important, they are pet \nprojects.\n  Well, I have to concede that point. The seniors of America are a pet \nproject of mine and most Senators. We know many of them live on fixed \nincomes, struggle from month to month to get by, worry about paying \ntheir utility bills and making sure they can pay for their prescription \ndrugs.\n  So giving them a helping hand, as we do in the Senate Finance bill, \nis a good thing. Good for them. Good for our economy. Senator McConnell \nwas obviously very critical of that. He hasn't said directly, but I \nwish he would go on record: Does he or does he not support providing an \neconomic rebate check for 21 million Americans, those seniors who \notherwise would not get a helping hand?\n  So when Senator McConnell returns to the floor, will he sign up for \nour pet project to help 21 million Americans or is he against it? I am \nsure the voters of Kentucky would love to know.\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\n  Then there is another pet project in the bill, 250,000, one-quarter \nof a million disabled veterans, many of them just returning from the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have met many of them. I am sure \nSenator McConnell has met many of them. To think adding them to the \nbill is something that would be negative in the eyes of Senator \nMcConnell is hard for me to understand.\n  These are men and women who risked their lives and came back injured \nfrom the war; many of them had to fight the bureaucracy of our \nGovernment to get the basic care we promised them. In the Senate \nFinance bill, we provide a helping hand for a quarter of a million \nveterans, which the House bill does not. Is Senator McConnell opposed \nto that?\n  Well, when he comes to the floor and states whether he is for \nproviding assistance to 21 million seniors, I hope he will also state \nwhether he is for providing a rebate check for a quarter of a million \nof our veterans.\n  We also have in the Senate bill a helping hand for those who are on \nunemployment. Unfortunately, the economy as it goes south has \ncasualties, and they include millions of Americans. We know those \npeople who have lost a job are looking for another one, scrape by with \nan unemployment check. And sometimes, even within the 26 weeks of \nunemployment, they cannot find a job they are looking for. So we \nsuggested extending that for another 13 weeks. That is not a radical \nidea. It is a traditional way of helping people in a poor economy. It \nhas been done over and over under Democrats and Republicans. We include \nthat in the Senate bill.\n  So the obvious question for Senator McConnell and the Republicans, \nwhen he comes to the floor to tell us where he stands on helping \nseniors and helping disabled veterans, is does he think unemployed \npeople in Kentucky, for example, need a helping hand? If he says no, \nthen it is a matter of record. If he says it is a pet product, a \nproject we should vote against, then it will be on the record. I did \nnot hear that this morning. I was listening for it.\n  Then there is this whole thing about the mystery and challenge of \nthis bill. Senator McConnell and Senator Kyl are learned men. I have \nserved with them in the Senate. I respect them very much. I know they \nhave a great capacity for understanding complex issues. But they have \nsaid the trouble with this bill is they cannot seem to get their arms \naround it. It is, oh, so hard for them to understand the new provision \nin the bill. The new provision in the bill is less than a page and a \nhalf in length. The new provision in the bill can be described quite \nsimply as about $1 billion to a program called LIHEAP.\n  LIHEAP is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It is a \nprogram which provides help to Arizona, primarily in the summer months \nbut to Kentucky in the cold winter months, so poor people, elderly, and \nothers will have a helping hand to pay their heating bills.\n  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been a big leader on this \nissue. It has always been a bipartisan program. So I have to ask \nSenator McConnell and the Republican leadership: Is this another one of \nthose pet projects you cannot stand, something you think we should \nignore when we talk about getting this economy on its feet? I think it \nis a matter that these Senators need to consider personally. Do they \nwant to go home to Kentucky, for example, and tell those low-income \nindividuals, struggling to pay their heating bills, that is a pet \nproject we cannot afford at this point? I hope not. But at least let \nthem be on the record by the end of the day.\n  The interesting thing is we could be having a real full-scale debate \non the economic stimulus bill, but the Republicans have refused. They \nhave told us they need more time to absorb the page and a half that was \nadded to this bill. They need to think this one through. They need to \nstudy these words.\n  Well, it has been about 12 or 15 hours now that they have had to read \nthis page and a half. I know they are up to it. I know they can do \nthis. I know they can read that and understand it, even without the \nhelp of a Democrat.\n  When they do, maybe they will come to the floor, change their mind, \nand allow us to finally debate this bill. You see this is an empty \nChamber. Sadly, it will be largely empty most of the day because the \nRepublicans want to kill this day in the Senate. They do not want us to \nmake any progress on the economic stimulus bill, nor on another \nimportant bill which is pending.\n  Senator Reid, our Democratic majority leader, came to the floor \nyesterday and begged them again: Let us return and do some real \nbusiness today. They said: No. Today, the Senate will stand around, it \nwill not roll up its sleeves and do anything. We will not consider the \nIndian health reform bill Senator Dorgan of North Dakota has been \nworking on, long overdue, 6 or 7 years. Some of the poorest people in \nAmerica have not received the kind of health care which we would all \nlike to have for our families. Senator Dorgan is trying to do something \nabout it. They will not give him the time to finish the bill. This is a \nperfect day to do it. The Republicans will not give him an opportunity \nto do it.\n  Then there is another bill which has energy and water projects which \nhave been needed all around our country. They have been held up by the \nobjection of the Republican side. We have asked to return to them. \nAgain, they have refused. We could do that today.\n  Then, of course, the economic stimulus package, which Senator \nMcConnell spoke of and then left the floor. I wish he would return. \nLet's have a real debate on it. Let's find out where he stands on \nhelping seniors, disabled veterans, and others.\n  Then, of course, there is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \nThat is a bill we have been working on literally for weeks. We sat \naround for 3 days last week trying to come to some agreement about what \nwould be in that bill, and we finally reached agreement.\n  Now we are ready to go. Several amendments have been debated and are \nnear a vote. We have several more. Let's get going. Let's earn our pay \naround here instead of killing time and making speeches. We could \nactually consider debate. The Senate used to have that. It is a great \nSenate tradition. Senators with opposing views would come to the floor \nand respectfully disagree and argue their point of view and ask for a \nrollcall. I know some people who follow C-SPAN are wondering, when did \nthat last occur? Was it in the last century? No, it has happened here \nfrom time to time. In the time I have been in the Senate, we have come \nperilously close to debate on at least a half dozen occasions. We can \ndo that again. It would be a great return to Senate tradition. But it \nwon't happen if the Republicans continue to filibuster, continue to \nobstruct, and continue to refuse to let us debate the important issues \nof our time.\n  Why wouldn't we want to debate today the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act? The President has told us over and over again it is \ncritical. We need it. It is timely. We have to move on it. Yet when we \nwant to call it on the floor, Senate Republicans refuse. They oppose \nus.\n  The day is not over. Senator Reid will be on the floor a little later \nin an attempt to finally try to get us back to business. It is long \noverdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S620-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S620-S622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the President's budget is often described \nas ``dead on arrival.'' In fairness to this President and others, we \nshould look at it in a different way. This is the President's proposal \nfor the budget for the next fiscal year. It is a fiscal year for which \nthis President will not be here. The year begins on October 1. He will \nend his term in office January 20. So most of this budget will affect \nthe next administration, the next President. This is pure speculation \non his part about where America should be in the next year as the \nPresident leaves office.\n  The folks at the Office of Management and Budget must have worked up \nto the last minute, because when they posted the President's proposed \nbudget on line yesterday, two of the first 15 words were misspelled. \nFar worse than misspellings, however, many of the priorities in the \nPresident's budget are misplaced. The President has proposed the first \n$3 trillion budget in American history; $3 trillion. Yet with all that \nmoney, the President, with his priorities, continues to cut education \nand health care, energy conservation and\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nindependence, affordable housing, veterans programs, and many national \npriorities. Seven years ago, President Bush came to town as one of the \nluckiest Presidents in modern history. As some might say, using an \nanalogy from Ann Richards in a speech she once gave to a Democratic \nconvention, President Bush started his administration, in economic \nterms, on second base. Things had been done to improve America's \neconomy and its budget, and they were given to this President to \ncontinue.\n  President Bush inherited the largest budget surplus in America's \nhistory. In his first budget address in 2001, he promised to use that \nsurplus to fund our priorities, strengthen our economy, and even pay \ndown the national debt. He said after all that was done, he would have \nenough money left over for tax cuts. Today, 7 years later, after \nPresident Bush and Vice President Cheney have been in the White House \nworking with a Congress largely under Republican control, America's \neconomy is in trouble. Federal spending during their term has increased \n53 percent. Our deficit is expected to hit $410 billion this year, $407 \nbillion next year. Instead of paying down the national debt, this \nPresident, who inherited a surplus, has piled record amounts of new \ndebt for America and for generations to come. Under George Bush the \nnational debt has increased by more than $3 trillion. We are going \naround the country, hat in hand, borrowing and begging from China, the \nMiddle East oil states, Korea, Japan, about any other country that will \npay our bills, because this President has been unable to. Now the \nPresident is demanding, nevertheless, that his tax cut ideas become \npermanent law.\n  How much would President Bush's tax cuts for wealthy people cost us \nif they were made permanent? Mr. President, $4.3 trillion over the next \n10 years, tax cuts primarily for people who weren't even asking for \nthem. That is not all. While the President claims to oppose tax \nincreases, he is about to impose one of the largest tax increases in \nAmerica's history on more than 25 million working middle-class \nfamilies. He refuses to patch and reform the alternative minimum tax \nbeyond next year. That is a $119 billion tax increase in 2010 alone.\n  The President continues to argue that we need to stay in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. His budget, nevertheless, cuts off funding for the troops \nafter the spring of next year. What is that all about? The President \nsays we have to stay the course. Senator John McCain said it could last \nas long as 100 years. President Bush in his budget cuts off spending \nfor the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the spring of next year. He \nhasn't told us that the war is going to end then. I certainly hope it \ndoes. But he better get his story straight.\n  With the economy failing and time running out on this Presidency, one \nmight think the President would change his approach and accept new \nideas. Unfortunately, he is stuck in the same old program and the same \nold message. Nine million more Americans are uninsured today than when \nPresident Bush took office. Half of those 9 million Americans lost \ntheir health insurance in the last 2 years. It is getting worse and at \na pace most American families can't keep up with. What does the \nPresident say about that? He wants to cut the Medicare Program, a \nprogram for the elderly and the disabled. In Medicaid, he wants to make \ncuts, a program for those in lower income categories, many of whom have \nlost their jobs. He wants to cut other parts of America's health care \nsafety net. His budget singles out health care for the heaviest cuts \nwhile continuing to provide large overpayments to many private \ninsurance companies.\n  In Illinois, more than 1.5 million people depend on Medicare, more \nthan 2 million depend on Medicaid. Under the President's budget, \nIllinois would receive $123 million less in Federal Medicaid funds. \nStroger Hospital in the city of Chicago is a public hospital of which I \nthink very highly. They have a very competent medical staff. They treat \nthe poorest of the poor, not just in Chicago and Cook County but for \nmany surrounding counties. Over half the people who come to that \nhospital have no way to pay for their care. At Holy Cross Hospital in \nMarquette Park, 25 percent of those who are treated cannot pay for \nanything. Yet the President says we should cut the Federal Government's \nreimbursement to these hospitals? It doesn't make sense. We know what \nis going to happen. There will be an awful lot of Americans who will \nhave no place to turn and won't have the professional medical care \nwhich we all want for our families.\n\n  When will this administration understand that Medicare is there to \nhelp our seniors, not to line the pockets of corporations? The \nPresident should fund Medicare.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President also called on \nCongress to reauthorize No Child Left Behind. Yet once again, this \nPresident has underfunded his own law. The Department of Education \nestimates the President's budget will provide $588 million in title I \nfunding in Illinois. That is just over half the amount promised under \nNo Child Left Behind. As a result, 120,000 Illinois children will be \nleft without full title I services. It is one thing to ask kids to take \ntests to figure out whether they are making progress or falling behind. \nBut once they need a helping hand, how can this President repeatedly \nrefuse to come up with Federal funds to fund the very mandates he has \ncreated? The President also siphons away $300 million from public \nschools to pay for vouchers for private and religious schools. Those \nvouchers come at the expense of 48 programs, including a lot of \nessential programs for students such as Perkins loans that help \nstudents go to college. I am not opposed to private and religious \nschools. I am a product of religious school education. They have a \nvaluable place in our society. But the first obligation of the \nGovernment is to the public education system. The President, \nunfortunately, is not going to meet that obligation.\n  When it comes to homeland security, again the President refuses to \nput money in the COPS Program, the single most practical and effective \nway to provide men and women in uniform so they are there when we need \nthem. This year he slashes funding for State and local law enforcement \nassistance, such as the COPS Program and the Byrne grants.\n  On energy and global warming, the President's budget is, \nunfortunately, unresponsive to the real national and global emergency \nwe face. Record high oil prices are harming the economy, record \nemissions and pollution threatening our globe and its climate. We ought \nto be investing aggressively in developing renewable energy options. \nInstead, the President's budget proposes a 7-percent reduction in solar \nenergy research, a 27-percent reduction in energy efficiency programs, \nand a 79-percent cut in weatherization programs to help families trying \nto keep their homes warm and cool. The President's budget cuts LIHEAP \nby 22 percent. As a result, 15,000 Illinois families would lose \nassistance.\n  It also proposes to eliminate what was once the centerpiece of coal \nenergy research in America, the FutureGen plant in Mattoon, IL. This is \none near and dear to my heart. For 5 years, I worked with a bipartisan \ndelegation--Congressman Tim Johnson, Republican of Illinois, Senator \nObama, and others--to win this plant for our State. Governor \nBlagojevich, local officials, everybody pitched in. We were announced \nto be the winners in the middle of December. Last week the Secretary of \nEnergy pulled the plug and said: We are not going to fund this project. \nHow can this President walk away from a zero-emission coal energy plant \nthat has been something he has bragged about for so many years?\n  The subprime mortgage crisis has plunged America into our worst \nhousing crisis, some experts say, since the Great Depression.\n  Two million families are likely to lose their homes to foreclosure \nover the next 2 years. There is a dramatic need for affordable housing \nall across America, from big cities to small rural communities.\n  Yet the President wants to slash or even eliminate programs that help \nrural communities build affordable housing and help families own their \nown homes, like the multi-family housing direct loans, self-help \nhousing grants and single family housing direct loans.\n  The President also wants to eliminate the HOPE IV program, which \nhelps cities restore public housing, and the section 108 loan program, \nwhich helps families rehab their homes.\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\n  The President's budget cuts community development block grants by \n$650 million. Illinois would lose $40 million for police officers, \nimproved street lighting and sewer lines, upgrading low income housing, \nreconstructing problem roadways and operating substance abuse programs \nand homeless shelters.\n  Amtrak is vitally important to Illinois and all of America. \nUnfortunately, the President and his administration are once again \nattempting to privatize and eventually eliminate Amtrak rail service.\n  The President's budget cuts the Airport Improvement Program funding \nby $764 million.\n  Illinois would lose $25 million, threatening a critical source of \nfunding for new runway construction at O'Hare, and improvements at \nairports such as Waukegan, Marion, Peoria, Springfield and many other \nIllinois airports.\n  Once again the President has refused to include funding for the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan in his budget. After 6 years of fighting, this \nadministration continues to skirt the rules and avoid accountability \nand openness.\n  Continuing to fund the war through supplemental funding is one way \nthe administration tries to mask the full cost of these wars. Another \nway is by underfunding veterans health and other services our veterans \nhave earned and need.\n  The President is requesting $41.2 billion for the VA health care \nsystem--$1.6 billion below the independent budget's recommendation.\n  His budget shortfalls mean that there will likely be little relief \nfor Illinois's nearly 70,000 veterans, who must still wait for an \naverage of nearly 5 months to have their disability claims processed.\n  More than 76,000 farm families in Illinois produce crops and \nlivestock that feed families all over the world.\n  Agriculture research is vitally important to Illinois farm families \nand to our national economy. The President's budget would cut \nagriculture research by $330 million, which could jeopardize promising \nresearch at the ARS lab in Peoria and the University of Illinois \nextension services.\n  In addition, the President proposes sharp cuts in rural broadband \nprograms, rural housing, and rural business development.\n  In Illinois, which receives the second-highest total of USDA rural \ndevelopment assistance in the Nation, the President's cuts would all \nbut eliminate popular grant programs that support innovative rural \nbusinesses, community facilities, and broadband networks.\n  President Bush is proposing the largest cut to the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting in its 40-year history--a 56-percent reduction in \nfunding.\n  America's 1,100 public radio and TV stations are an indispensible \nsource of education, information for enrichment. The President's cuts \nwould cripple them.\n  Illinois's 30 public radio stations would lose at least $6.5 million \nin total support and lose all of their digital transition funding and \nculture for sources, civic education, and special local content to \ncommunities.\n  Finally, in foreign affairs, the President's budget cuts the U.S. \ncontribution to the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria by $341 million--funds that could provide lifesaving AIDS drugs \nfor 37,500 more people, treat more than 272,000 people for TB, and \nprovide more than 2.1 million bed nets to prevent for malaria.\n  As the world's wealthiest and most powerful Nation, our actions \nencourage other donor nations to step up and devote additional \nresources to fight the global AIDS pandemic. Keeping our commitments to \nthe global AIDS fight can help to restore goodwill for America in \nAfrica and around the world.\n  Someone at the White House corrected those misspelled words in the \nfirst draft of the President's budget. It is up to Congress to replace \nthe misplaced priorities in the President's plan and agree on a budget \nplan that meets the needs of America's families and businesses and \ncommunities and puts our economy back on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Senate will hopefully begin \ndebate on an economic stimulus package. Front and center in the debate \nwill be how we balance the need to get our economy going while once \nagain addressing issues that revolve around the national debt. I hope \nthere is one thing this body will agree on unanimously, that we must \nnot forget America's disabled veterans in the debate. Earlier today I \nheard Members on the floor talk about pet projects. Veterans issues are \nan important project to me, and I will not forget about disabled vets \nas we move forward with this economic stimulus package.\n  There are about 2.8 million vets who receive some form of disability \nthrough the VA. The good news is that most of these folks hold down \nother employment and would get a tax rebate through the House's \neconomic stimulus bill. But for another 250,000 disabled vets who have \nno other income other than their veterans disability benefit and maybe \na Social Security disability check, they would get absolutely nothing \nfrom the House bill, not one red cent.\n  Let me say that again: The bill proposed by the House and by \nPresident Bush would not give a quarter of a million disabled veterans \none nickel. That is simply wrong.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Baucus, the Senate Finance package \ncorrects that error. It would ensure that the folks who were injured in \nthe cause of defending our freedom are able to get something back.\n\n  I assure my colleagues that these veterans feel the pinch of higher \ngas prices, heating costs, and everything else in between, just as much \nas any other household struggling on a fixed income. The difference is \nthat these folks have worn the colors of our country. They have \ndefended this country. The way we treat those who have fought for our \nfreedom and our Nation says a great deal about our society because when \nit comes to veterans, we are not talking about a handout, we are \ntalking about a country honoring our promise we have made to our \nservice men and women.\n  I wish to take a minute to read a letter I received recently from \nWarren Matte, a veteran from Harlem, MT. Here is what he says:\n\n       For those of us who are combat veterans and poor people, we \n     are now and have been in a recession for a good numbers of \n     years. We are on the bottom rung of the ladder, and it looks \n     like we will always be there. Some of us are surviving on VA \n     benefits and Social Security. The long distances we have to \n     travel here in Montana and the high cost of living is keeping \n     us in poverty. There are 500,000 homeless veterans in this \n     great Nation and no one cares. We put our lives on the line \n     so everyone can be free and live the good life, and no one \n     cares what happens to us and our families.\n\n  When our combat veterans are using phrases such as ``the bottom rung \nof the ladder,'' I think we can do better than that. When disabled \nveterans worry that ``no one cares,'' we must do better than that.\n  This Finance Committee bill is a step in the right direction. So I \nurge my colleagues, no matter what else you may think of the stimulus \npackage, do not forget about the Warren Mattes of the world. Do not \nforget about our disabled veterans.\n  I have been in this body for a little over 1 year. I can tell my \ncolleagues that from my perspective, the Senate is an easy place to \nstop things. If you choose, you can stop any piece of legislation from \nmoving forward.\n  I think the House stimulus package is a good stimulus package, but it \ncan be made a whole lot better, and we need to make it a whole lot \nbetter. For the 250,000 disabled vets, for the 2.5 million seniors, for \nthose folks who need unemployment benefits, for those folks who need \nassistance with their heating bills, we need to make it better.\n  I am not sure this economic stimulus bill will get us out of the \neconomic stresses we feel right now in this country, but I can tell my \ncolleagues one thing: If we don't address the issues that revolve \naround the people I just talked about--the disabled vets, the seniors, \nthe folks who need help with their heating, the folks who need \nunemployment benefits--we are making a huge mistake.\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\n  We ought not to be stopping with this bill. We ought to be making it \nbetter in the Senate and passing it on for the President to sign it. We \nought to be stamping it with our approval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S623-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday and again this morning we heard \nsome remarkable statements from our Republican colleagues that matters \nwithin the stimulus package are pet projects. Later, after that \nstatement was made, we had another Senator come and say that they were \nChristmas tree ornaments. Then we had another Republican come this \nmorning and say the stimulus package is certainly not needed. One of \nthe Senators said unemployment benefits are totally unnecessary and \nthat all it will do is increase unemployment. I am not making this up. \nThis is what they said.\n  Now, we heard the distinguished minority leader, Senator McConnell, \ncome to the floor with a statement that is simply untrue. He said:\n\n       If Americans are wondering why their checks aren't in the \n     mail, they can find it in last week's news clips.\n\n  Everyone knows--if they don't, they should know--that no matter how \nthe debate turns out, no one's check is going to be held up. Any \nstimulus plan--whether it is the House version standing alone as it now \nexists or the Senate Finance Committee version, which I favor strongly, \nor a combination of the two--would calculate rebate checks on the 2007 \nincome tax returns. That is basically the only way you can do it. Taxes \nare not due until April 15. That is the way it always is. That is more \nthan 2 months from today. So everyone should know that the checks \naren't in the mail tomorrow. The only way it can be done is based upon \nthe 2007 return, except for some people, and that is a very small \nminority. So let's not confuse or concern the American people with \nclaims that aren't based on facts. Perhaps the Republicans don't \nunderstand the timeframe of the stimulus package. If they do, it should \nbe clarified.\n\n  Now, what are some of the other things we have heard from our \nRepublican colleagues? One suggested that we ought not to do anything \nto stimulate the economy. I talked about that. He said we shouldn't \nprovide any help at all to the millions of Americans struggling to pay \ntheir bills and feed their families. Republican Senators have suggested \nthat sending stimulus checks to 21.5 million seniors on fixed incomes \nis a pet project, a Christmas tree ornament; that providing assistance \nto help struggling Americans pay their heating bills through the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program is a pet project or a Christmas \ntree ornament. I believe many Republicans--Republicans--could not \ndisagree more strongly with those statements.\n  The stimulus package sent to us by the House of Representatives last \nweek, as we have said from the very beginning, is a good start. I was \npart of a program to suggest the House should go first. There was some \ntalk that we should try to get the two bodies together and do that. The \nway the Senate works, it would have taken too much time. Their rules \nare different from ours. So I said to go ahead and do it, and when they \ncompleted it, I gave them all the applause I could. I thought it was an \nimportant thing that they did that. But our job is to take the bill \nfrom the House and make it stronger.\n  The Republican leader and others have said this morning that working \non bipartisan improvements is ``playing politics.'' I believe it is our \nconstitutional obligation. It is how the Founding Fathers envisioned \nthis country working. It is how they envisioned the legislative branch \nworking.\n  But soon, Senators will have a chance to vote on the Senate Finance \nCommittee's bipartisan plan. It will either be tomorrow, or it will be \nThursday. Based on the House plan, it makes several improvements, the \nBaucus-Grassley package.\n  The Finance Committee package sends stimulus checks to roughly 21.5 \nmillion senior citizens who would get nothing at all from the House \nbill. Give them the money, and they will spend it.\n  The Finance Committee package sends checks to 250,000 disabled \nveterans who were left out of the House plan. Give them the money, and \nthey will spend it.\n  The Finance Committee package extends unemployment benefits for those \nwho have lost their jobs in the economy. To suggest, as has been done \nhere on the floor, that extending unemployment benefits will make \nunemployment worse? We have people who are no longer counted as being \nunemployed because they have been off the rolls so long. The House bill \ndoesn't take care of unemployment benefits. Economists tell us that it \nis the single most effective way to stimulate the economy.\n  The Finance Committee package is business-friendly. It gives small \nbusinesses greater ability to immediately write off purchases of \nmachinery or equipment. It helps larger businesses with ``bonus'' \ndepreciation or an extended carryback period for past losses to recoup \ncash for future investments. It gives them a tax break, and they will \nspend it.\n  Realtors are in town. They come every year. Homebuilders don't come \nusually this time of year, but they are here now because this provision \nis so special to them.\n  Without exaggeration, the States of California, Florida, Nevada, and \nMichigan are in big trouble. Other States are in trouble also because \nof their housing crisis. The Finance Committee package addresses the \nhousing crisis in a number of ways, but one is including mortgage \nrevenue bonds to be used by the States to refinance subprime mortgages. \nThat is very important. That is why the homebuilders are here en masse \ntoday.\n  The Finance Committee package includes an extension of energy \nefficiency and renewable energy incentives to create jobs, expand the \nclean energy industry, save consumers money on their energy bills, and \nhelp begin to stem the tide of global warming.\n  I will also offer an amendment that we can and should all support. \nFirst, the House-passed bill's language on housing will be included in \nthis package that we will vote on. I don't know who could object to \nthat.\n  This amendment will increase the conforming loan limits for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, as well as the loan limits for FHA-backed \nmortgages, which will allow more homeowners to refinance and will \nreduce mortgage interest rates in virtually every part of the country.\n  Second, there is money to help low-income Americans heat their homes, \nthrough the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. \nThis is important because it allows people to not have to choose \nbetween food, medicine or heat. So let's--while we are talking about \nheat--leave the overheated rhetoric aside and work on passing this \nlegislation. This is important. We should do this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the amendment to H.R. 5140, which I have described, \nwhich contains the Finance Committee language on LIHEAP funding, occur \non Wednesday, February 6 at 3 p.m., with the hour prior to that time \nequally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it has \nnever been our desire to delay consideration\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\nof the House-passed stimulus package. The other side has made it clear \nthey will have some package of changes. Those changes were discussed \nlast week and, evidently, there was a decision to put a different \npackage together. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we got that \npackage last night. It was, apparently, a work in progress.\n  What I am going to do is ask the leader to modify his request. I know \nthe senior Senator from Illinois said earlier today--or suggested that \nmaybe people on this side don't support seniors or disabled veterans. \nSo I will offer a request of the majority leader to modify his request \nso we do not have further delay.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's \nunanimous consent request be modified so that we proceed to the bill \ntoday--not tomorrow or Thursday but today--and that we have a cloture \nvote today on the amendment we received last night--the one to which \nthe leader's request refers; further, if cloture is not invoked, that \nwe proceed immediately to a vote on the Republican amendment that we \nwill file at the desk; finally, that the Senate then proceed to a vote \non passage of the House bill, as amended, if amended.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I hope \neveryone within the sound of my voice understands how unfair and \nsenseless the request is by my friend. We had discussions on the floor \nyesterday. The minority whip recognized that Senator McCain, Senator \nObama, and Senator Clinton are not going to be here today. It has been \nvery clear that I told them I needed an evening to get them here. If I \ntell them they have to be here tomorrow, they will be here tomorrow. \nEverybody knows this request by my friend is without foundation.\n  The Republicans--all 49 of them--are going to have to vote on the \nSenate stimulus package. They have to vote on that. Therefore, I \nobject.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the things I have the ability to do \nis to try to move the process forward, and that is what this vote was \nall about. Members came, we have had some conversations, and hopefully \nit will help move the process forward.\n  We are going to file cloture sometime today on the Senate stimulus \npackage. That is the one reported out of the committee, as we have \ntalked about the last 24 hours. So we will have a vote on that. Unless \nthere is an agreement reached beforehand, we will have a vote on that \nan hour after we come to work on Thursday. That will be on the Senate \nstimulus package as we have brought it here to the floor. Of course, \nwith consent, we could have it tomorrow. I would rather do it tomorrow \nso we can do some other things on Thursday, but it is up to the \nminority as to what we do.\n  I hope we all understand that the vote we just had was, as I have \nsaid before, an effort to try to move the process forward, a wake-up \ncall, especially for my Republican colleagues, that we need to now \nstart legislating. There is no reason in the world we should not finish \nFISA soon--work today on FISA.\n  We have other amendments Senators want to offer. We have 6 hours \ndealing with title II alone--one by Senators Dodd and Feinstein on \nimmunity; we have the Whitehouse-Specter dealing with substitution; and \nwe have one with Feinstein dealing with exclusivity. Two hours on each \none of those, the time equally divided, is 6 hours. There is no reason \nwe shouldn't do that debate today. I want to vote on the four \namendments already pending on FISA. We have those three I talked about \nand then, after that, there are four more with very limited time.\n  I think it is a little unusual here that we have an insistence we \nmove forward and work on the stimulus package, yet we have had trouble \ndoing that; and then we have been told, the latest on last Saturday, \nthe President is talking about how important it is to do the stimulus \npackage, and also he has talked incessantly about the need to complete \nFISA, but the Republicans have blocked our efforts to do that.\n  I don't want to always have to stand here and talk about unpleasant \nthings, such as obstructionism and filibusters, but sometimes that is \nall there is to talk about. It is clear to me that once again the \nRepublican minority seems to be more committed to obstruction than what \nit takes to make America stronger. We remain committed to giving our \nintelligence professionals the tools they need to make America more \nsecure. With Republican cooperation, we can start doing that today. \nToday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume the \nFISA legislation and debate all remaining amendments in order; that any \nvotes in relation to these amendments occur at a time to be determined \nby me, after consulting with the Republican leader; that all time \nconsumed during this debate count postcloture to this matter we are on \nnow dealing with the House stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nit is\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nperfectly apparent to everyone who is observing this process that these \ntwo issues are interconnected in terms of how we fairly go forward, and \nI think the point has been well made by the 49 Republican Senators over \nthe last year or so that our rights are going to be respected; that we \nare going to move forward on bipartisan bills, such as both of these, \nin a way that is respectful to both sides, and as soon as we have an \nunderstanding about how we are going to go forward on the stimulus \npackage, then we will be able to make progress on this bill. I am \noptimistic we are going to be able to do both.\n  Ironically, I share the goal of the majority leader, which is to \nfinish both these issues this week. You would think that was not the \ncase for all the sparring and finger-pointing that has gone on the past \nfew days, but I have the same goal he does, to finish FISA and the \nstimulus package. Both of them, at the end of the day, are going to \npass on a strong bipartisan basis. But the process for dealing with \nthem is not irrelevant, and that is what we have been discussing off \nand on for the past couple days. Hopefully, we will make some progress \nand be able to get going on FISA later today.\n  For the moment, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, ``1984'' was a book written by George \nOrwell. He wrote the book many years before 1984, but he was trying to \nlook into the future and talk about what he thought America would be \nlike in 1984. It was a very interesting, compelling book, a best \nseller, and it made George Orwell a famous man for all generations of \ntime. But the one thing you got out of reading that book is that there \nwould come a time when people said one thing, and while they were \nsaying it, they meant something else. That is what we had here just now \nwith my friend, the Republican leader. We are going to move forward, \nget things done, there is no reason we can't finish things this week. \nWhy in the world can't we do the FISA legislation today? I will tell \nyou the reason. It is Orwellian talk from the other side. They want to \nstall the FISA legislation as long as they can--and they have done a \npretty good job--because they want this legislation to be completed at \nthe last minute to give the House and Senate conferees little time to \nwork.\n  The Record should reflect how hard we have tried to pass the FISA \nlegislation law, and the Record should reflect there is going to come a \ntime when the FISA legislation will run out and the President will be \nsaying things, as he has for 7 years, to scare the American people--the \nDemocrats don't care; they do not care. Well, Mr. President, we care \nevery bit as much as any Republican about protecting the American \npeople. We believe there is a need in this modern world for \neavesdropping on certain conversations, but we have the old-fashioned \nidea that it should be done in keeping with our Constitution. That is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  I repeat for the third time here in the last few minutes that the \nRecord should reflect we have been willing to legislate on FISA for \nsome time now and we have been stymied every time. We need to go back \nno further than yesterday. Yesterday we wanted to have amendments \noffered. And I appreciated very much Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Cardin coming and offering amendments. We should \nhave voted on those last night. But, no, the Republicans wouldn't let \nus. Can we vote on them this morning? No.\n\n  Well, if they are not going to let us vote on the amendments, can we \nat least use up some of the time for debate on amendments that are \ngoing to be offered by other Democratic Senators, and we have one \nbipartisan amendment that will be offered by Senators Whitehouse and \nSpecter? Nope, can't do that. We can do two things at one time, we can \ndo one thing at one time, is all I am asking we do.\n  It is very clear that the stall we had all last year is now in place \nagain and we are going to be prevented from doing the work today. We \nare not going to be able to vote or offer amendments. We are going to \nstand here and look at each other until shortly before midnight tonight \nwhen I will offer to file the cloture motion. I can file it at any \ntime. I don't have to wait until just before midnight. But that is when \nthe time runs out. And we will have the vote Thursday, unless we work \nsomething out. But it is a shame, a shame for the Senate and for the \nAmerican people, to waste all this time. It is time wasted.\n  Last year, as I indicated--and other Senators have talked about \nthis--we had 64 filibusters where cloture had to be filed. For my \nfriend to say all he wants, that all the Republicans want is to be \ntreated fairly, we only have to take the block of time in the last 2 \ndays. How much more fairly can they be treated? We say: OK, you are not \ngoing to let us vote; let us at least offer amendments and use up some \nof that time. Nope, we can't do that. Can we set a time to vote on the \nstimulus package? No. Are we going to have to use all that time \npostcloture? Yes, because we have to read the amendment.\n  The package from the Senate Finance Committee passed out of that \ncommittee a long time ago. We did add something to that. It is a page \nand a half long. Certainly 24 hours should be enough to read that one \npage or that page and a half. But I understand, we all understand, and \nthe American people understand that we are living in the Senate in the \nrealm of ``1984.'' When my friend from Kentucky comes here and says we \nwant to move forward, all we want to do is be treated fairly, remember \nwhat George Orwell said. It is the direct opposite of what he said. \nWhat he is saying, in ``1984'' language, is we are stalling this as \nlong as we can. And as long as we can is probably going to run out \nsometime tomorrow or Thursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is a little like deja vu all over \nagain, which I suppose was said by Yogi Berra. This is the same \ndiscussion we have had for the last couple of days.\n  Setting aside all of the finger pointing and the parliamentary \nnuances, what we know for sure is that we have a Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act measure that came out of the Intelligence Committee \nwith a vote of 13 to 2--the Rockefeller-Bond bill--which the President \nwill sign. Certainly it is not within the realm of possibility that \nMembers of my party don't want to finish this bill soon. It is \nsupported by a Republican President, Republican Senators, and we tried \nto get votes on it Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of last week, to no \navail. In fact, the last vote we had last week was on Monday afternoon, \nand then for 3 days it was sparring over that. I don't think anybody \nseriously believes the Republican minority does not want the FISA bill \nto pass.\n  With regard to the stimulus package, we have not been given \nprocedural assurances. The majority leader is in a position to deny the \nminority the opportunity to offer anything, to fill up the tree and \nfile cloture, and we have been given no assurances that we will be able \nto offer an alternative. It strikes me that the majority is in the \nabsurd position of having argued the House bill is inferior. If the \nFinance Committee bill, plus additions, was not successful, why would \nit not be appropriate to give the minority assurances that an amendment \nto adjust the House bill, which the majority has been insisting for a \nweek is not adequate, would not be appropriate?\n  These are the discussions we have been having off the floor. It is \nprobably difficult to follow, for those who are watching it on \ntelevision, because there are a whole lot of parliamentary nuances \ninvolved. But stepping back from the parliamentary part of it, we know \nfor a fact the following: There is overwhelming bipartisan support for \nthe FISA legislation, and the President will sign it. It was the \nPresident and the Democratic Speaker of the House and the Republican \nleader of the House who came together on a bipartisan stimulus package. \nWe know there was overwhelming bipartisan support for doing a stimulus \npackage.\n  I think we are going to get all this resolved and approve both these \nmeasures this week, but we are going to insist on doing it in a way \nthat is fair to the minority.\n  That basically sums up my views on where we are at the moment, and we \nwill keep talking about it off the floor and, hopefully, be able to \nhave some meaningful votes here later.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee is a \ngreat committee. I served on that committee. I wanted to have a chance \nto have a dialog here with the Senator from Kentucky, the leader on the \nRepublican side. He continues to overlook the obvious. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act bill is the product of two committees--\nnot one but two.\n  He says, well, he likes the Intelligence Committee version, and \ncertainly it was a version that passed with an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote. But the fact is that the Senate Judiciary Committee also passed \ntheir version of the bill relating to specific elements that are \nequally important to the Intelligence Committee work, and what Senator \nReid, on the Democratic side, has tried to do is to give us a chance on \nthe floor to vote on some of the key issues raised by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In fact, we reached an agreement on how we were going to do it. It \ntook us a week or more to craft a unanimous consent request to lay out \nthe specific amendments we were going to, with understandings about how \nmuch time would be devoted to each and what the vote would be. I can \ntell you, I was involved in some preliminary parts of it, Senator Reid \nstuck with it to the bitter end, and we did reach an agreement.\n  So what is stopping us? What is stopping us, for reasons I can't \nexplain, is that the Republican side, which refused to yield for a \nquestion, wants to blame us for slowing down a bill which they are \nstopping us from calling.\n  That is what it boils down to, in the simplest terms. They want to \nblame the Democratic majority for not passing FISA. Yet they refuse to \nallow us to bring it to the floor and consider the amendment so that we \ncan have a vote and bring it to final passage, take it to conference, \nand send it to the President. They cannot have it both ways. They \ncannot blame us for holding up a bill that they are holding up.\n  Secondly, let me say a word about the stimulus package. I would like \nthe Republican leader, who tantalizes us with bits of information when \nhe comes to the floor, to really spell it out. What is it in the Senate \nFinance Committee bill, this bipartisan bill, this Baucus-Grassley \nbill, what is it they object to? The so-called Christmas tree argument, \nthe goodies, the pet projects? Let's be very specific about it.\n  Do the Republicans, the Senator from Kentucky and others, object to \nproviding an additional few weeks of unemployment insurance for those \nwho are out of work? If that is the case, say it. Do the Republicans \nobject to the idea that we are going to try to deal with the housing \ncrisis in America and put some provisions in to deal with that in an \nhonest way? If so, say it. Do they object to Senator Cantwell of \nWashington who is pushing for energy tax credits--an innovative, \nconstructive part of our economy--that will help businesses get started \ncreating jobs and keep America in the forefront of this research? If \nthe Republicans object, say it. They are walking and dancing around, \nand they just will not come forward and say it.\n  We think the Baucus-Grassley bill, a bipartisan bill, is a good bill. \nWe want to vote on that bill. We want the Republicans to go on record.\n  If they believe the homebuilders across America do not deserve some \nsort of tax benefits in one of the roughest times they have had to face \nin modern memory, then, for goodness' sake, be on the record and say \nit. But they come to the floor and tell us: Maybe we do not need a \nstimulus package. They argue that unemployment benefits aggravate \nunemployment. They do all of those backward arguments. It is no wonder \nthat Senator Reid continues to reference George Orwell; it really is \nimpossible to follow their logic on the floor. But I think the American \npeople know the outcome. The outcome is that we will do little or \nnothing today because the Republicans insist that little or nothing be \ndone today, and then tomorrow they will come to the floor, and they \nwill complain that nothing was done today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I would \nlike to direct a question through you to him. I have not had a chance \nto speak to the distinguished Democratic assistant leader, the whip, \nabout this.\n  Are you aware that this perfect package the President has been \ntalking about keeping together, the great bipartisan effort with the \nHouse and his people, are you aware that this package which we have \nbeen pushed and pushed to ``take it just as it is,'' are you aware that \nthe Secretary of the Treasury today testified and made a statement that \nhe thinks it is a pretty good idea to have seniors and disabled \nveterans included? Are you aware of that? So this perfect package may \nnot be as perfect as they thought it was.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would respond to the majority leader by saying that \nobviously the notion of a bicameral Congress has been tested and \nproven. I am glad Senator Robert C. Byrd is on the floor here to \nwitness that statement, with which I am sure he will agree.\n  The fact is, as good as the House package might have been, we are \ndoing our best to improve it. And now, as I understand it, two so-\ncalled pet projects--helping 20 million seniors and a quarter of a \nmillion disabled veterans--are now becoming pet projects of the \nadministration. It would be great, and I hope the Republican side will \njoin us in the rest of our bipartisan package.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct another question to my \nfriend. You are aware that the 49 Republicans--I should say 46 because \n3 already voted courageously in the Finance Committee, so 46 \nRepublicans are going to have to make a decision. They are not going to \nbe able to pick and choose whether seniors are more important than \npeople with no heat in their homes, more important than people with no \njobs, more important than people who are having their homes foreclosed \nupon. The distinguished Democratic whip understands that they are going \nto have to vote for the stimulus package out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, not pick and choose which is more important, whether senior \nAmericans are more important than the unemployed or the people with no \nheat in their homes or the people losing their homes? Does the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois understand that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would respond to the Senator from Nevada, our majority \nleader, that I hope the Republicans understand that the package we \nbring to the floor is the result of Finance Committee deliberation and \nvotes and a bipartisan rollcall in support. It is not as if we were \nimposing our will here. We are bringing to the floor the measure that \npassed the Senate Finance Committee. And when was the last time a bill \ncame to the floor which you agreed with in all of its different \nsections? There are usually one or two things in there I wish were \nwritten differently.\n  I would say to my friends on the Republican side that if they believe \nwe should say no to families in Kentucky, to families in States around \nthe Nation who are struggling with heating bills, then they have to \nunderstand that has been part of the bipartisanship package brought to \nthe floor, and they will be voting against those people and voting \nagainst the unemployed, and that will be the record they can carry home \nfrom this debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S626-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S626-S627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF \n                        2008--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first express my disappointment \nthat we are not able to vote on the economic stimulus package. That \npackage was reported out of the Senate Finance Committee last \nWednesday. Each of us had plenty of opportunity to review the report \nfrom the Finance Committee and the provisions they added to the House \npackage. For reasons I cannot understand, the Republican leadership is \ndenying us the opportunity to act quickly on the package.\n  One of the major criteria for the economic stimulus package is it \nmust be timely. The House took it up, passed it. Now it is our turn. We \nare ready to act. We have the bipartisan recommendations from the \nSenate Finance Committee. Now it is time for us to take action.\n  These are very difficult times. Let me review some of the most recent \neconomic news. It is not good. The stock market is 11 percent lower \nthan it was last October when it reached its peak. The price of oil has \nreached $100 a barrel. That is causing hardships for many families. \nLast month we saw job loss, an actual decline in employment for the \nfirst time in 4 years, a shrinking workforce. The President submitted \nhis budget. He is showing the deficit, by his own numbers, increasing \nfrom $162 billion to $410 billion. That debt does not include the use \nof Social Security surpluses. It does not include such things as paying \nfor the alternative minimum tax that we know we will have to deal with. \nWe have tough economic times.\n  When one looks at the housing market, there is reason to be \nconcerned. In 2007, home sales were down by 13 percent over 2006. There \nare over 4 million properties currently in inventory, a very high level \nof homes that can't seem to move off the market. We are all concerned \nabout the subprime foreclosure rates. It is estimated now that we could \nhave as many as 2 million subprime foreclosures by the end of next \nyear. There are many ripple effects to what is happening in the \neconomy. I was talking to some people in Baltimore, where we have the \nGeneral Motors transmission plant. They were telling me that their \nsales of light trucks are down because of the housing industry, because \nso many of the people who work in the housing industry need light \ntrucks. We have lost jobs in Baltimore as a result of what is happening \nin the housing market.\n  Another interesting fact, it is affecting local governments. It is \nnow estimated that as a result of the decline in housing values, local \ngovernments will lose close to a billion dollars in property tax \nrevenues. There is a real ripple effect to what is happening in our \neconomy.\n  We have a responsibility to act. I congratulate the Federal Reserve \nfor taking action on the prime rate. That was helpful. It was directly \nhelpful in reducing interest rates, but it was also a clear signal that \nthe Fed is going to operate to help the economy. So should we. For us \nto be effective, we must be timely. To be timely, we must vote on this \nbill. I am extremely disappointed that we can't use the time we have \navailable today to take the necessary votes so each Member can cast \ntheir vote as to whether they agree with the Finance Committee, and \nthen we can move on and send this bill back to the House and hopefully \nto the President within a short period.\n  I am pleased with the work of the Finance package. Another major \npoint about a successful economic stimulus package is that it should be \ntargeted to those programs that will help create job opportunities \nimmediately. It is short term so it needs to be targeted. The Senate \nFinance package incorporates what the other body did in rebates to \ntaxpayers, providing business relief through expensing and \ndepreciation, but it goes further with some relatively modest changes \nin the total dollar amount but extremely important, if we want to make \nsure the economic stimulus package is targeted to those who need it and \nwill help our economy. It also should be targeted to be fair, looking \nafter the people who need help, the people who have been disadvantaged \nby a downturn in the economy.\n  The Finance Committee is recommending that we include low-income \nseniors. Low-income seniors are hurting today. They don't know where \nthey are going to get the money to buy food or pay utility bills or \nmedical expenses. There is a misconception that seniors have this \nwonderful health care system called Medicare. Seniors as an age group \nhave the highest amount of out-of-pocket health care costs of any age \ngroup. Seniors are being hurt by the high cost of fuel. Seniors need \nhelp. Why should we leave them out of the package? Certainly, if we \nwant to target it to those who will spend some money to generate \neconomic activity, low-income seniors should be high on the list. \nLooking at it from the point of view of fairness, we should want to \ninclude low-income seniors. Quite frankly, I believe it was an \noversight by the other body. I don't think this is controversial. It \nshould not be controversial. That should be clearly added to the \npackage. I congratulate the Finance Committee for including low-income \nseniors.\n  The Finance Committee also included disabled veterans. Those \nreceiving disability benefits would qualify for a rebate. Let me talk \nabout a matter of fairness. We are talking about men and women who \nanswered our Nation's call who are now receiving disability benefits. \nThat, again, was an oversight by the other body. They clearly wanted to \ninclude disabled veterans in the tax rebates we are putting forward. I \ndon't believe this is a controversial issue. It is a matter of \nfairness, a matter of people who will help our economy, targeting the \neconomic stimulus properly.\n  The Senate Finance Committee package also included an extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits. I want Members to concentrate on this \none. When you have economic downturn, people lose their jobs. When they \nlose their jobs, in many cases their sole source of income becomes \nunemployment insurance compensation. The money we give as a safety net \ninto which they paid through employment taxes--it is their money--is an \ninsurance program. When we go through an economic downturn, it is more \ndifficult for someone who has lost a job to find a job, because there \nare less jobs available. Historically we have extended the traditional \n26 weeks of unemployment benefits beyond that, when we have an economic \ndownturn. The Finance Committee said, as a matter of fairness, we \nshould extend those benefits by an additional 13 weeks. For those \nStates that have high levels of unemployment, we should go to 26 weeks \nof additional benefits. That is certainly the fair thing to do, because \nthey are the people mostly hurt by the downturn in the economy. If our \ncriteria is to target money into people's hands who are going to spend \nit if that is their source of income, we know that is going to get back \ninto the economy. So it will help our economy to extend unemployment \nbenefits.\n\n  The Finance package also includes an energy package to provide \nincentives for businesses to move toward more efficient energy sources \nand more environmentally friendly energy sources. It would include a \npackage that will allow us to energize the economic sector for what we \ncall green jobs. We know we need to change our energy policy. We know \nwe need to be more sensitive to the environment. We need to be energy \nindependent for national security so we don't depend upon other \ncountries who are unfriendly toward us for our energy needs. We need to \ndo that in order to deal with the problems\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\nof greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. We need to get \non with an energy policy for our economy. We can't sustain abrupt \nincreases in energy costs because of the whim of oil producing \ncountries. For all those reasons, we need to be energy independent. We \nall agree--and I have talked to my colleagues from around the country \non both sides of the aisle--that we have to unleash the creativity of \nAmerica's businesses and the creativity of our free market. This \npackage coming out of the Finance Committee provides the tools so \nAmerican businesses can respond to the needs we have on creating \nalternative energy sources and a greener and more friendly \nenvironmental energy policy.\n  The package also includes the net operating loss so businesses that \nhave lost money can benefit from this economy and can stay in business \nand can try to help our economy. It also includes a very important \nprovision that Senator Kerry offered dealing with mortgage revenue \nbonds. Part of the problem we have in the housing market today is what \nwe call a credit crunch. We also have people who are suffering from \nsubprime mortgages and need some help as far as refinancing. The \nrevenue bonding authority to local governments will help in both cases. \nIt allows local governments to buy these mortgages. In many cases they \nwill be below par. They will buy them for their value, but then they \ncan refinance the property so people who are living in these homes can \nstay in them and are not going to be subjected to potential \nforeclosure. It is certainly in our interest to provide that help. It \nwill also help with the credit crunch because the more money out there, \nthe more dollars that will be available.\n  As I think I related earlier stories I have heard from the State of \nMaryland, I can tell you about homeowners in Salisbury trying to sell \ntheir homes, but they can't because the buyers can't get a mortgage. \nEverybody is being affected. So the package that includes the mortgage \nrevenue bonds is important. The problem in our economy was triggered by \nthe housing market. It wasn't caused by the housing market. There are a \nlot of problems out there, and it was certainly not the cause, but it \nwas triggered by the housing market. So our stimulus package should try \nto deal with that. The Finance Committee package deals with it.\n  I thank the majority leader for adding one substantial change to the \nFinance package. He did that because there was bipartisan agreement. We \nhave had Senators on both sides of the aisle urging that the package \ninclude help for LIHEAP, low-income energy assistance for families who \ncan't afford their utility bills. The package will include some help \nfor that group. There is consensus that we need to do that, but it is \nalso part of the economic downturn, families who cannot afford and have \nto make the decision between food and energy. This will help them a \nlittle bit. The money will get right back into the economy, helping to \nstimulate the economy and helping us make this downturn as brief as \npossible so we can grow our economy.\n  This is a short-term economic stimulus package. It is important for \nus to act quickly. I am disappointed that we are being stalled by the \nRepublican leadership and not having a chance to vote on it as promptly \nas we should. We are ready to vote. We know what is in the package. We \nshould be voting on it and getting it back to the House so we can get \nto it conference and to the President as quickly as possible. It is \nshort term. It will help stimulate the economy.\n  Then I hope we will see the same type of bipartisan cooperation \nbetween the White House and the Democratic leadership in the House to \ndeal with deep problems we have in our economy. These are more long \nterm. We are not going to reverse it overnight. These are not \nappropriate to be included in the short-term economic stimulus package \nthat is on the floor. But these are issues that need to be dealt with. \nQuite frankly, I don't think they can wait until a national election. \nWe need to work on them this year. We are in business. Let's get some \nwork done. Let's work together, Democrats and Republicans. Let's stop \nstalling. Let's use the time this year to work on the problems of \nenergy independence. We could take a major step forward. I have heard \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about how, if we would \nmake a Manhattan type commitment or a commitment as we did to put a \nperson on the Moon, we could become energy independent in a relatively \nshort period of time. We have to start on that.\n  In 2007, we passed an energy bill that was a good bill. But it \ncertainly didn't move as far as most of us wish to see us move. Let's \nmove forward on that proposal. There is a proposal coming out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that contains a step forward on \nAmerica being a leader on dealing with global climate change that the \nPresiding Officer worked on. So this is a bill that I think is very \nimportant that we move forward on. We can get it done this year. Let's \nnot wait. Let's use the spirit of cooperation and understanding. This \neconomic downturn occurred because we didn't pay as much attention as \nwe should to the underlying problems of our country.\n\n  Let's get on with health care. Let's get a bill to the floor that \nwill at least help start to deal with those who are uninsured, take on \nsome of the major cost issues in our health care system, whether it is \nthe high cost of prescription drugs or the high cost we pay because \npeople don't have insurance so they go to emergency rooms or the need \nfor medical technology so we have a more efficient system, a better use \nof preventive health care so people can get the care in a less costly \nway.\n  Let's move on in 2008. Let's not lose that opportunity, because it is \ngoing to take us years to accomplish those goals. We are not going to \naccomplish them overnight, but we need to get it done.\n  By the way, let's also take a look at this budget that was sent to \nus. I am glad to see my colleagues on both sides of the aisle raise \nvery serious problems with the President's budget. Let us this year \ncome together on a budget that starts to bring us into balance. We \nstarted with this administration 7 years ago with a budget that was in \nsurplus. I was proud to be a part of the Congress that brought that \nbudget into balance. We are going to have to do that again, but let's \nstart in 2008. We don't have to wait until 2009. Let us start to get \nthese problems resolved. If we do, we will be on a much sounder \neconomic basis and we would not have to worry about another trigger \ncoming along that causes us to go through another economic downturn \nwith people being hurt.\n  But our responsibility at this moment is to deal with the short-term \neconomic stimulus package. That is the opportunity we have that we can \nget done this week. That bill we can get to the President this week. \nEvery day is important. I know I speak for most of the Members of this \nbody that we want to get it done now. The choice is clear. We have the \npackage, the bipartisan package from the Senate Finance Committee. \nLet's bring it up and vote on it and let's move forward. I would urge \nmy colleagues to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, yesterday, we received the President's \nbudget for this year and for the next 5 years. I wish to take a few \nmoments to comment on that and then on the need for a stimulus package \ngiven what is happening in the economy.\n  First, I wish to indicate that we have seen under the President's \nleadership a dramatic deterioration in the budget circumstance for the \ncountry. Last year, the deficit was about $160 billion. They are now \nforecasting, the administration is forecasting that under its budget \nproposal, the deficit for this year will reach $410 billion, the second \nbiggest deficit in dollar terms in our Nation's history, and for next \nyear, again a deficit of more than $400 billion.\n  This does not tell the whole story. This is the deficit story. The \ndebt story is far more serious. As I have been saying for a number of \nyears, the debt is the threat. However, we will never hear the word \n``debt'' leave the lips of this President. Never. We will never hear \nhim talk about the growth of the debt.\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\nWe will never hear him discuss the threat of the debt. We will never \nhear him discuss a plan to deal with the debt. It is as though the debt \nof the country for this President does not exist. Why? Well, perhaps \nbecause the debt is growing far more rapidly than the deficit.\n  (Mrs. McCASKILL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the President says the deficit for 2008 \nwill be $410 billion. If you look at his proposals, you see the debt \nwill increase under his plan by more than $700 billion. Let me repeat \nthat. Under the President's plan, the debt will not increase by the \nadvertised deficit of $410 billion; the debt will increase by more than \n$700 billion.\n  Why the big difference? The biggest reason is that, under the \nPresident's plan, nearly $200 billion in Social Security money is being \ntaken to pay other bills. If you were doing that in the private sector, \nif you were taking retirement funds of your employees to pay operating \nexpenses, you would be on your way to a Federal institution. But it \nwould not be the House of Representatives or the White House; you would \nbe on your way to the ``big house'' because that is a violation of \nFederal law. But here the President can propose a budget that does it. \nIn fact, that is what he has done the entire time he has been in \noffice. He has taken trillions of dollars in Social Security money and \nused it to pay other bills. The problem with that, of course, is that \nwhile none of it is counted in the deficit calculation, it all gets \nadded to the debt. The result is that here is what is happening to the \ngross debt of the United States. At the end of the President's first \nyear--and we don't hold him responsible for that year because he \ninherited a budget from the previous administration--the debt was $5.8 \ntrillion, the entire debt of the U.S. Government, the Federal \nGovernment. We now see that at the end of 2009, which is the last year \nhe will be responsible for, the debt will be $10.4 trillion. So he will \nhave increased the debt of this country by 80 percent in 8 years. What \na disastrous legacy this is. He has us on course to have more than $13 \ntrillion in debt by 2013. This is before the baby boomers retire. We \ncannot pay our bills now. Can you imagine what is going to happen when \nwe double, in very short order, the number of people eligible for \nMedicare and Social Security?\n  Madam President, perhaps of even greater concern is what this \nPresident has done to foreign holdings of our debt. It took all of \nthese Presidents pictured here on this chart--all of the 42 previous \nPresidents--224 years to run up a trillion dollars of U.S. debt held \nabroad. This President has more than doubled that amount in just 7 \nyears. He has added over $1.3 trillion of foreign-held debt in his 7 \nyears. That means we now owe the Japanese nearly $600 billion; we owe \nthe Chinese a sum approaching $400 billion; we owe the British over \n$300 billion; we owe the Koreans over $40 billion. That is the legacy \nof this administration.\n  Now the President comes with his budget, and says he is going to \nstart doing something about the spending side of this equation. He \nsaid: I want to cut Medicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years by \n$600 billion. No, I didn't misspeak. That is what is in the President's \nbudget. He wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid $600 billion over the \nnext 10 years. That is health care for those who are Medicare \neligible--largely the senior citizens of this country. The President \nwants to cut that by $600 billion.\n  At the same time, in the same breath, in the same budget, he says: \nWhile we are doing that, let's cut taxes another $2.2 trillion. Let's \ndig the hole even deeper and add more to the deficit and debt. Let's go \nmore in hock to the Chinese, the Japanese, and anybody else who will \nloan us money.\n  Madam President, these numbers of the President substantially \nunderstate how serious it is. Why? Because, magically, he has just left \nthings out. On the war, the President has no costs beyond the first \nhalf of 2009. The President said there should be no timetable on Iraq. \nHe has just provided the timetable, hasn't he? He provided the \ntimetable for withdrawal in his budget because he says there is going \nto only be funding for next year. The President, who said he is against \na timetable for withdrawal, just wrote one. His timetable is provided \nin his budget. He says that after 4 months of next year, there is not \ngoing to be any funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. How much \nwill be spent for the wars in 2010? He says zero. Next year, it is $70 \nbillion, after spending nearly $200 billion this year. This budget \ncharitably can be called a great work of fiction because it bears no \nrelationship to any reality.\n  In addition, regarding the alternative minimum tax, which everybody \nsays has to be fixed, he has the money to fix it for 1 year. He doesn't \nhave a dime to fix it for any of the next 4 years after that. So we are \ntalking about hundreds of billions of dollars that are not in this \nbudget.\n  Finally, for the fourth year in a row, for the first time in any \nadministration's history, the President provides no spending details \npast this coming year. So he has the cuts in there, but he doesn't tell \nyou how they are going to be done. More make believe, more fantasy, and \nmore fiction--that is what this budget is all about.\n  Madam President, the war cost $193 billion this year. Next year, it \nwill only cost $70 billion--that is what the President says. That is in \nthis budget. Can anybody believe it? I have not found anybody who \ndoes--not if the President's policy is pursued.\n  In terms of the priorities of this budget, they are also subject to \nserious question because if you look at the relative priorities of what \nthe President has proposed, here is what you see.\n  For those who earn over $1 million a year, the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts for that category of earners will cost $51 billion \nin 2009 alone. Let me repeat that. The cost of the tax cuts for those \nearning over $1 million a year will be $51 billion in 1 year alone. On \nthe other hand, the President says we have to cut low-income heating \nassistance by $400 million. So you don't have $400 million for low-\nincome heating assistance, but you do have $51 billion for tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest among us.\n\n  The priorities continue in that same vein. It would take $826 million \nto restore the cuts to education that are in this President's budget--\n$826 million for 1 year. Again, the President says, no, it is far more \nimportant--if you do the math, he is saying it is more than 60 times as \nimportant to provide additional tax cuts for those earning over a \nmillion dollars a year, because the tax cuts for that category--the \ncost of the tax cuts are over $51 billion for next year.\n  The same is true in law enforcement. In many ways, this is the most \nstartling. The President says eliminate the COPS Program, which has put \nmore than 100,000 police officers on the street. The President says \nforget it, cut it 100 percent. No additional police on the street. What \nsense does that make when crime is rising? He doesn't say cut it; he \nsays eliminate it. It would cost $596 million for 1 year to restore \nthat program. Again, the cost of the President's tax cuts for those \nearning over $1 million a year is $51 billion. That is almost 100 times \nas much as restoring funding for police.\n  If we look at specific proposals by the President in this budget, we \nsee he proposes cutting the COPS Program, as I have indicated, by 100 \npercent; weatherization assistance, cut that 100 percent; first \nresponders--the aid to our firemen and our emergency personnel--he says \ncut that 78 percent; clean water grants, cut that 21 percent; community \ndevelopment block grants which help our cities--and every mayor will \ntell you these are the most flexible funds they get from the Federal \nGovernment--cut that 20 percent; cut low-income energy assistance 17 \npercent.\n  Madam President, that brings me to the subject of the need for a \nstimulus package. Economic growth, we are seeing, has slowed \ndramatically. The Congressional Budget Office says economic growth is \ngoing to slow to 1.5 percent this year.\n  By the way, all of the numbers I used, and the President's budget--do \nyou know what economic growth number he used? He didn't use 1.5 \npercent, which comes from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \nHe says the economy will grow at 2.7 percent. So all those numbers I \nshowed are the best-case scenario, because he has a rosy scenario with \nrespect to what economic growth will look like. If we look at the last \nquarter of last year, what\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\nhappened to economic growth? It slowed to six-tenths of 1 percent. That \nshould be a tipoff that we have a problem.\n  Here is what is happening to the housing industry. They are not in a \nrecession; they are in a depression. Here is what happened to new home \nbuilding. It has gone from a peak in 2006, and it has virtually \ncollapsed. We just met with the homebuilding industry. They say this is \nthe worst downturn since the Great Depression. That ought to get \nsomebody's attention.\n  Energy costs are spiking. We know what happened to fuel prices, \nfertilizer prices, home heating fuel, gasoline, and diesel. As a result \nof that, consumer confidence has taken an enormous hit.\n  Here is the index of consumer confidence, which was down very \ndramatically as we went through the months of last year and into the \nearly part of this year. This is what signals that we are in serious \nterritory and that the economy is seriously at risk.\n  The unemployment rate has risen sharply over the past year. We saw in \nthe last jobs report that we actually lost 17,000 jobs. This was \nstunning to most economists, who were forecasting there would continue \nto be slow but modest job growth. Instead, it appears the economy hit a \nwall.\n  Madam President, this is what the Federal Reserve Chairman told us on \nJanuary 17:\n\n       Any stimulus program should be explicitly temporary, both \n     to avoid unwanted stimulus beyond the near term horizon and, \n     importantly, to preclude an increase in the Federal \n     Government's structural budget deficit.\n\n  He went on to say about an effective stimulus:\n\n       There is good evidence that cash that goes to low and \n     moderate income people is more likely to be spent in the near \n     term. . . . Getting money to people quickly is good, and \n     getting money to low and moderate income people is good, in \n     the sense of getting bang for the buck.\n\n  Here are the elements that represent improvements in the Senate \nstimulus package. We cover 20 million seniors who were not covered in \nthe House package, and 250,000 disabled veterans are included in the \nSenate package but not in the House's. We have higher rebates for low-\nincome households--$500 versus $300. It extends unemployment insurance \nbenefits, which gives us the biggest bang for the buck. We prohibit \nillegal aliens from receiving rebates. That was not brought to their \nattention in an effective way, so, unfortunately, it is conceivable \nthat illegal aliens could get rebates under the House package. We have \nprevented that in the Senate package. We also have better targeted \nbusiness provisions, especially the net operating loss carryback. I am \nproud to have authored an amendment that losses in 2008 could be \ncarried back to profitable years, so that companies that are in this \ndepression--those in the homebuilding industry--will qualify for \nassistance to prevent them from having even steeper layoffs and cuts.\n  Finally, we encourage investment in alternative energy. Let me just \npoint out that some say, in terms of incentives, that the extension for \n1 year, for example, of the wind energy tax incentives, that is not \nstimulative. Really?\n  Tell that to the company in North Dakota that makes the big blades \nfor wind turbines. They have told me, if the wind energy tax provision \nis not extended, they are going to start laying off people. They employ \nhundreds of people in my State. When people say the energy package is \nnot stimulative, I tell you in my State it is because we have \nmanufacturing facilities that make the giant blades for the wind \nturbines.\n  I have commented on the President's budget because the President is \ngoing to dump a debt bomb on the desk of the next President. That is \nwhat is going to occur. He has nearly doubled the national debt. He has \nit going up at a rate of $800 billion a year, not the $400 billion of \ndeficit we read about in the paper. The debt is going up twice as much, \n$800 billion a year, after this next year when it is going up $700 \nbillion.\n  The next President is walking into a fiscal meltdown of historic \nproportion. This President has been the most wildly irresponsible \nfiscal steward in this country's history. That is a fact. The next \nPresident and the next Congress better get ready because they are \nwalking into an absolute fiscal quagmire.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, the Senator from Michigan be given 10 minutes, the Senator \nfrom Colorado 10 minutes, and if any Republicans come to the floor \nseeking recognition, that they be intervening between the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, first, I thank our budget Chair, \nSenator Conrad, for presenting to us what has been given to Congress to \nconsider from the President and the White House concerning our budget. \nI, too, am here this afternoon to talk about President Bush's proposed \nbudget because, as we all know, we began debating it in our Budget \nCommittee today. We have all had a look at this proposal now, and I \nthink many of my colleagues on the Budget Committee agreed we could say \nit was nothing short of being dishonest and irresponsible and, frankly, \nunacceptable to many of us.\n  We are facing some pretty serious problems in this country today, but \nthe budget President Bush sent to us on Monday fails to take any of \nthose challenges into consideration. We are out here trying to pass an \neconomic stimulus package in response to the fact that more than 1 \nmillion workers lost their jobs last year in this country. Across the \ncountry, we are seeing unemployment claims rise. People are very \nconcerned about what is happening to their paychecks. They are worried \nabout whether they are going to be able to pay for food or their \nmortgages in the future.\n  On top of that, we see as many as 2 million Americans who are losing \ntheir homes because of the current subprime mortgage crisis. Economists \nnow are telling us that problem is going to get worse before it gets \nbetter.\n  So here we are, and the President sends his budget to us on Monday. \nIt is his eighth and final budget request. He had a chance to send us a \nbudget that would set us off on a fiscally responsible path, one that \nwould help us strengthen this economy, invest in our country's future, \nand help those families who are struggling today to keep their homes \nand pay their bills. But instead, the President gave us more of the \nsame, more of what we have seen for the last 7 years. Instead of taking \nsteps in his final budget to help American families get back on their \nfeet, he cut programs, such as heating assistance and job training. Can \nyou imagine how that feels if you are worried about how you are going \nto pay your home heating bill or if you just lost your job?\n  Instead of laying the groundwork to reduce our debt, which the \nchairman of our Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, has repeatedly told \nus is a huge issue facing us, instead of dealing with that, he gave us \na dishonest budget that fails to state the true cost of war. He sent us \na budget that put out a blueprint of $70 billion. He is asking $190 \nbillion or $200 billion for this year alone. Does that mean the \nPresident is going to bring our troops home? No. He is simply being \ndishonest about what his programs and his proposals cost. The budget he \nsent us is going to require us to borrow billions from foreign \ngovernments to meet our expenses. I think that is irresponsible.\n  Over the last 7 years, America has paid dearly for the investments \nthis President has failed to make, and this year in his budget we see \nnothing different. The Bush budget that was sent to us cuts critical \nprograms at the Veterans' Administration, including medical research. \nWhen we have veterans coming home today who have post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, who have traumatic brain injury, who have lost their limbs, \nwho are suffering from very debilitating issues, he cuts the medical \nresearch budget. He cuts funding for extended care facilities, even \nthough we know the number of troops coming home who will need extended \ncare is growing. And he asks the next generation of combat veterans to \nrisk their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and then says to them they are \ngoing to have to pay for part of the cost of their health care as a \nresult of their serving this country.\n  The budget proposal he sent us cuts $484 million from critical \nworkforce training programs right at the time that 7.7 million people \nare out of work\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\nand asking: How can I get trained for the next job out there?\n  The budget he sent to us, as Senator Conrad talked about, freezes \nMedicare reimbursement levels for our hospitals, for our hospices, for \nambulance services, and long-term care facilities, even though it \nthreatens access to facilities that are already stretched to the limit. \nThis is going to affect every one of us who will need access to our \nhospitals, long-term health care facilities for ourselves and our \nparents in the coming years.\n  And for the fourth year in a row, amazingly, the President is \nproposing deep cuts to community development block grants. These are \nprograms that every mayor in every city has told us are the most \nflexible dollars the Federal Government sends to them that helps them \ncreate jobs right at a time when they are facing these tough economic \ntimes.\n  Sadly, the President is slashing funding for section 8 and other low-\nincome housing programs, even as more of our families are set to lose \ntheir homes than at any time since the Great Depression.\n  In the last 7 years, we have gone from a budget surplus to a record \ndeficit, our roads and our bridges are crumbling, and we are paying for \na misguided war on the backs of our grandchildren. People desperately \nwant to see leadership that invests in those priorities and helps begin \nto turn this economy around.\n  People at home say to me: Invest in our future at home. But sadly, I \nthink the legacy of this administration is going to be red ink and \nbroken promises.\n  We have some hard work ahead of us as we try to repair the economy \nand build a budget in the Congress that matches our country's real \npriorities. That was pretty obvious today at our first hearing of the \nBudget Committee.\n  During that hearing, we listened to our OMB Director, Mr. Nussle. He \ntalked a good game about wanting to work with Congress on his budget. \nBut when we began to ask him critical questions, it was pretty clear \nhow little President Bush and his Cabinet understand the priorities of \nthe American people today. It was clear when I asked Director Nussle \nabout why the President is proposing deep cuts to the Veterans' \nAdministration construction budget when thousands of new veterans are \nentering the system every year.\n  We all remember what happened at Walter Reed a year ago, when it \nexposed the deplorable conditions at our VA facilities across this \nNation, where we are sending those Iraqi war veterans and veterans from \nprevious wars in horrible conditions. He stood with us and said we are \ngoing to fix this situation. Yet today, we get a budget that cuts the \nconstruction budget. How are we going to rebuild those facilities and \nmake them into a place Americans can be proud of if the President \ndoesn't ask for the money to do it? It was clear when Mr. Nussle \nrefused to estimate the full cost of the Iraq war even for this year \nthat they were not serious about this budget.\n  Just like any American family that is sitting down to balance its own \ncheckbook, we are going to have some pretty tough decisions ahead in \nthis Congress. We have to do it now. We have to be honest about what \nour obligations are and the expenses we face. It is time we take stock \nof our finances and get our books back in order. We have to invest in \nthe priorities of America's families, and it is going to take a true \ncommitment, but that is certainly something the President's budget \nfailed to do.\n  We need an economic plan that works for everyone in this country. We \nneed the economic stimulus package that we are trying to get passed \nthat the Finance Committee did an excellent job in the Senate to put \nforward that will help provide short-term economic stimulus that is \ndramatically needed. Beyond that, we need a budget that invests in the \nAmerican people and their priorities so our families can begin to feel \nstrong once again. That is how we are going to get this economy moving.\n  It is time for a change, and I am looking forward to getting it \nstarted now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I first lend my voice to that of the \nSenator from Washington and the Senator from North Dakota, our \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I, too, am a member of \nthe Budget Committee and am extremely disappointed that the President's \nbudget this year is simply more of the same, in some cases worse--\nhigher deficits, more cuts in a number of areas, and certainly the \nwrong priorities for families in America. It takes us in exactly the \nwrong direction from where we need to be going.\n  We are going to do what we have done in other years, which is put \nforward a very different vision for America, one that focuses on paying \ndown the debt rather than increasing the debt, focuses on health care \nand education and investing in areas that will clean our water and our \nair and protect our lands and focus on the economy and good-paying jobs \nfor middle-class families who are being hurt all across this country.\n  We heard today a larger number than I have even been using about what \nis being spent on this war. The number now is $16 billion a month, $4 \nbillion a week on this war, and yet at the same time, the President \nbelieves we should eliminate funding for the COPS Program for local \npolice officers and firefighters, makes dramatic cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid, health care programs, cuts 48 different educational programs, \nand the list goes on and on.\n  I am looking forward, as a member of the Budget Committee, to put \nforward a very different vision. We intend to change the priorities of \nthis country and put them back on those priorities that directly affect \nmiddle-class families and help them survive and thrive in an economy \nthat is having a very tough time, where they are being hit on all sides \nwith increased costs.\n  I wish to take a moment to speak about the stimulus package. As a \nmember of the Finance Committee, I am very pleased with what we have \nbeen able to do working together on a bipartisan basis to come forward, \nagain, with something that reflects a stimulus in the short run and \nfocuses on critical areas, and we make sure a number of folks who were \nleft out of the House package are not left out.\n  We start with 20 million seniors. I should also say we are going to \nhave in this body two votes: a vote on whether to include 20 million \nseniors or a vote on whether to leave them out. That is the reality. \nUnfortunately, seniors on fixed incomes, whose only income is Social \nSecurity, have been left out of the House package. We, on a bipartisan \nbasis, have put it into the Senate package.\n  So the question will be: Do my colleagues support and join with AARP \nand all the senior organizations that have been pushing and advocating \nand sending cards and letters and phone calls and urging us not to \nforget them, will you join with them, 20 million seniors, or will they \nbe left out? We also want to make sure our disabled veterans are not \nleft out.\n\n  I am proud of the fact that we, in this new majority, this Democratic \nmajority, have put veterans health care at the top and last year \nincluded real improvements in health care funding for the first time \nsince that war began--the largest funding increases to support our \nveterans since the war began. This is another step in supporting our \nveterans. Two hundred and fifty thousand disabled veterans will be left \nout if the House bill is passed.\n  So we have a choice when we vote. We vote yes on 250,000 veterans--\nour disabled veterans, who have given more than I will give or most of \nus will give for our country--250,000 disabled veterans get the rebates \nand are part of the stimulus or they are not. The Senate package puts \nthem in, the House package leaves them out.\n  There is another very important piece of this package, and that goes \nto the question of millions of middle-class Americans, who, through no \nfault of their own, have found themselves in a situation without a job. \nI have spoken many other times on the floor about the reasons for \nthat--from not enforcing our trade policies and not investing in the \ntechnologies and the infrastructure and the things that we need to be \ndoing to grow a 21st century manufacturing base and to be able to keep \nmanufacturing jobs, middle-class jobs, all across this country.\n  There are many reasons for the fact that we have millions of people \nwho are\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\ncurrently unemployed, but the fact is we do. We have middle-class \nAmericans who find themselves on unemployment insurance, which pays \nabout 40 percent of the normal wage, while they are trying to keep the \nhouse, keep up the mortgage payment, put food on the table, keep the \nlights on, pay for the kids' clothes that they need, and to put gas in \nthe car so they can survive until they can get that next job.\n  Now, some have said, well, it is not that bad. I come from a State \nwith the highest unemployment in the country. We have about 7.6 percent \nunemployment, and we are seeing not only in Michigan and a few States \naround the country that have been hit first, that this unemployment \nsituation is beginning to creep out into millions of people, millions \nof middle-class families all across the country. So we are now hearing \nfrom Goldman Sachs and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that while, \nas of January of this year, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, by \nnext year the prediction is 6.5 percent. That is not Michigan, that is \nnationally. That is national unemployment.\n  So one of the things that is important about the Senate package is \nthat instead of being behind the curve--and economists talk about our \nbeing behind the curve on a stimulus--we actually are putting in place \na way to respond quickly to be ahead of the curve; to be there to \nextend unemployment compensation for 13 weeks and an additional 13 \nweeks if you hit this 6.5-percent unemployment, which, unfortunately, \ntoo many are saying we will reach. I hope they are wrong. I hope it \ngoes in this direction. I certainly hope it goes in this direction for \nthe great men and women in Michigan who have been working so hard. But \nthe reality is it is most likely to be going in the direction of the \n6.5 percent.\n  So for millions of middle-class families that have done nothing but \nplay by the rules, care about their families, working for the American \ndream, proud to be Americans, sending their children or husbands and \nwives off to war, this package in the Senate will give them the dignity \nof knowing they can keep the household together while they are looking \nfor their next job.\n  Now, a lot of folks say, well, this is going to discourage--in fact, \nI heard this from the Secretary of the Treasury this morning in the \nFinance Committee--that this may discourage people from looking for a \njob. Well, let us look at the reality of this. Let us look at the \nreality of what is happening right now in an economy where we have not \nfocused on making sure we have a strong middle class, where we have not \nfocused on enforcing our trade laws, where we are exporting jobs, not \njust products. Let us look at what is happening right now.\n  We have 7.7 million Americans--7.7 million Americans--competing for 4 \nmillion jobs. That is the reality in America today. So when we talk \nabout the need to support and to help those 7.7 million Americans, this \nbecomes absolutely critical as we look at our economy. The good news is \nthat every economist, from the most liberal to the most conservative, \nas well as the Congressional Budget Office and so many others, has said \nthat one of the best ways to stimulate this economy, in the short run, \nis to extend unemployment benefits. For every $1 in benefits, you \ngenerate $1.64. For every $1 that you put into unemployment benefits. \nWhy? Because if you are unemployed, you don't have the option of \nsaving. You are going to spend every single nickel you get.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. So when we look at this package, we have a choice \nbetween including or excluding 20 million seniors, excluding or \nincluding 250,000 disabled veterans, including or excluding millions of \nmiddle-class Americans looking for a job and, in addition to that, \ncreate jobs through alternative energy production and efforts to help \nthe home-building industry, which is at the heart of what has been \nhappening in terms of our economy. I am very pleased we have addressed \nthose businesses that have operating losses now, to help them through \nthe tax system and be able to keep going and not find themselves in a \nvice this year in terms of having fire sales to eliminate their \ninventory. I am pleased we have been able to include a $10 million \nrevolving loan fund for States and local governments to help with \nrefinancing of subprime loans.\n  We have a number of very important provisions, and it is very \nexciting to see the broad coalition that has come together, from \nbusiness to labor, to seniors, to the environmentalists, to those \ncreating energy jobs, to those in the housing workplace; and from \nhomebuilders to those who are involved with State and local \ngovernments, and millions and millions of middle-class families all \nacross this country who are counting on us to do more than provide a \ncheck but to create the ability for investments and for jobs that will \ngrow the economy.\n  So I am very hopeful we will come together with the necessary votes \nto stop the filibuster that is happening here. I wish we could simply \nhave an up-or-down vote on this. We certainly have the votes. But \nbecause of the situation we are in, because of the Republican \nfilibuster, it is necessary to get 60 votes to be able to stop the \nfilibuster. So I am very hopeful we will have enough colleagues joining \ntogether on a bipartisan basis in order to be able to do that.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nMichigan for her great leadership on the Finance and Budget Committees \nand raising these issues that are so important to America. I think \nparticularly when you come from a State such as her State of Michigan, \nwhere they have an unemployment rate that is knocking on the door of 8 \npercent, she knows how hard it is for families in Michigan and the \nfamilies across America as they see our economy spiraling downward and \ngoing into a ditch, which essentially makes what we are trying to do in \nthe Senate today more important than at any other time.\n  Madam President, I wish to start first by asking unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to speak on the Finance Committee stimulus package \nfor such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I wish to first comment on the Finance \nCommittee and the way that committee works.\n  First, we are on the floor of the Senate with a Finance Committee \npackage in large part because we have two great Senators who have been \na part of this Chamber, a part of this institution for a very long time \nand who make it their priority to get results. They transcend partisan \npolitics for the public purpose for which they were elected.\n  It is in that vein that time and time again the packages we have \nbrought forth from the Finance Committee have had both Democratic and \nRepublican support as we have tried to move forward to confront the \nchallenges that face our country today. This economic stimulus package \nthat is before us today is no exception. It was voted out of the \nFinance Committee, a committee I am very proud to be a part of, with a \nbipartisan vote, in a bipartisan spirit, and with the sense that we \nneeded to give a flu shot to this economy before it gets sicker; and \nwith the sense that we need to help this economy go into a positive \ndirection as opposed to getting further and further stuck in the ditch \nof disrepair, where it has been headed for the last several months.\n  So this is a very important package that comes before the Senate \ntoday, and we must remember its genesis in the Finance Committee is in \nfact a bipartisan genesis to respond to what the President has asked \nthe Congress to do, not only in his State of the Union speech but even \nbefore that, when he said we need to have a stimulus package to help \nget our economy back on track. Well, we have done our level best to try \nto put together that package in the Finance Committee. I am proud to \nsupport it, and I hope that when we get to a vote on the Finance \nCommittee package tomorrow, we are able to get Republicans and \nDemocrats to stand together in a resounding positive vote for moving \nforward with this Finance Committee package. I hope the vote is not \njust a vote that gets us to 60 but hopefully gets us to 70 or 75.\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\n  Now, why is it important that we move forward and jump-start our \neconomy? Well, it is important for the American families whose lives \nare very much affected by the actions we take on the floor of the \nSenate. It is important to embrace what the President and the House of \nRepresentatives have done, which is to say we ought to put money back \ninto the pockets of the American consumer so they can spend that money \nwhich then helps create jobs in America and helps to stabilize our \neconomy. But what the White House and the House of Representatives did \nin their negotiations with Secretary Paulson and others is something \nthat can be improved on, and certainly the bipartisan work of the great \nteam on the Finance Committee, which includes the staff of that \ncommittee, has brought forth what is a significantly improved package \nover what came out of the House of Representatives.\n  The first of those improvements has to do with dealing with those \nAmericans who were left out: 20 million elders, 20 million seniors, 20 \nmillion people who have given their lives to give us the opportunities \nwe have in America today. I am speaking about those who came before us \nand who now depend on Social Security. The package out of the House \nexcluded 20 million seniors because it says you have to have earned \nincome in order to qualify for this tax check that is going to go out \nfrom the Government to the people of America. Why should we exclude \nthese 20 million seniors who are receiving Social Security? Because \nSocial Security is not earned income. Therefore, they are excluded \nunder the provisions that came out of the House bill.\n  So if we are to honor what I believe is one of the fundamental values \nof America--that is to honor our elders, to respect our seniors--then \nit is important for us to make sure we change the package to include \nthe 20 million seniors of America.\n  The one thing we do know, from what all the economists have told us, \nis that if you put this money into the pockets of 20 million elder \nAmericans, those 20 million elder Americans are going to spend that \nmoney, which means it is going to help stimulate our economy. So that \nis one improvement.\n  Are there other improvements that could be made to this economic \nstimulus package? Well, the fact is there are other improvements that \ncan be made. A second improvement we made in this package that we \ndeliberated and worked out in the Finance Committee has to do with our \ndisabled veterans. We have 250,000 disabled veterans in America today; \n250,000 disabled veterans. Many of these veterans are veterans from \nWorld War II, some of them from the Korean conflict, some of them from \nthe Korean war, and some of them are part of the 1.5 million veterans \nwho have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Why should these 250,000 veterans not receive the benefits we are \nproviding all the rest of America today? It makes no sense, in my view, \nif we are trying to stimulate the economy. We put, probably for a \nfamily of four, $1,600 checks into their pockets. They are going to \nspend this money to help stimulate the economy. It is the right thing \nto do for us to uphold the American values and to support our veterans \nhere in America. It is absolutely the right thing to do.\n  It is also the right thing to do in terms of one of the objectives \nwhich we have, which is to help stimulate our economy. Third, when I \nask the question, can we improve this bill--yes, we can improve it by \nadding 20 million seniors. We can improve it by adding the 250,000 \ndisabled veterans. But we can also deal with the reality of \nunemployment.\n  Maybe some people around here have not dealt with families that have \nbeen unemployed. But when you lose your job, you lose everything that \ncreates a quality of life for you. Because you cannot take care of your \nfamily, you cannot take care of making your mortgage payment, you \ncannot take care of buying medicine for your children. And, yes, we \nhave now States in America that are reaching an unemployment rate of 8 \npercent, and the economists are saying there are a number of States \nthat are going to be up into 6 to 7 percent before too long. So \nextending unemployment benefits is also an important improvement in \nthis package.\n  But it is not that we can take care only of seniors and disabled \nveterans and extend unemployment benefits; there are other things, I \nbelieve, we can do to help make sure that we improve upon the stimulus \npackage for America we are considering here today, and that is to help \nthe business community of America, make sure that business community \nremains in a way where it can continue to create jobs for the people of \nthis country.\n  The incentive we have created in this legislation with the expensing \nprovisions relating to small business, with bonus depreciation for \nbusinesses that expend money on equipment, will help keep America \nstrong. Without those businesses creating jobs for America, we are \ngoing to continue to spiral downward. It is important that we do that.\n  I want to point out one provision relating to our efforts to try to \nsupport the business community of America here today, and it has to do \nwith housing. The other day when we heard from the many economists who \nhave come before the Finance Committee, one thing was very clear. One \nof my colleagues, Senator Baucus, talked about how the housing crisis \nitself was a canary in the coal mine. It is a signal to us that our \neconomy is in trouble. The housing sector of our economy demonstrates \nthat perhaps in a way that very few other sectors of the economy do. So \nit is important that we do something for the housing issues facing our \ncountry today.\n  The chart that is here by me demonstrates what is happening with \nhousing across America. You look at what Moody's said would happen in \nterms of what they forecast to be, where we will end up as we move \nforward into these difficult economic times with respect to the housing \nmarket.\n  They predict that housing prices will decline by 15 percent before we \nsee bottom. How many people in America own a house, and how many people \nin America have most of their value tied up in that house? When you see \nthese times of declines in housing values, you know the people of \nAmerica, the people who are watching us debate here on the Senate \nfloor, know there is pain in the economy here in America today. When \nyou lose 15 percent of what is your most valuable asset, you know there \nis a major issue with the economy. So it is important that we address \nthe housing issues of America, and we are doing that partially in this \nlegislation by including revenue bonds. There are other things we are \ngoing that have to do with the housing crisis we face here in America.\n  It is my hope one of the things we are able to do is to come back and \naddress the housing issues, along with energy, along with the farm \nbill, in a chapter 2 of our economic agenda in the Senate. But it is \nalso important, as you look at this chart, to look at what is happening \nwith housing starts in America. We are in the worst shape today in \nhousing starts in America than we have ever been. In fact, those who \nare associated with the home building industry will tell you we are in \nworse shape today than we have ever been since the Great Depression. \nThere is no end in sight when this housing crisis is going to end with \nrespect to the decline in housing starts that we see.\n  The economists out of Moody's project that housing starts are down 60 \npercent, at the bottom of this trough, with no end in sight. Who knows \nhow far that will go down?\n  What we have done, spearheaded by Senator Conrad and with the help of \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Smith, is included in this legislation \nthat will address the operating loss carryback provisions that apply to \nthe housing industry. That economic injection will help the housing \nindustry continue to stay afloat to weather the very troubled times \nahead. Now, some people will say: Why are you bailing out the housing \nindustry? Well, we are not bailing out the housing industry, we are \ntrying to keep one of the sectors that is pivotal to a successful \neconomy alive here in the United States of America.\n  Across my State, I know how many people work in the housing industry, \nfrom the roofers to the plumbers to those who put up the drywall. We \nknow how many of them work. There are 300,000 people in America who are \nworking in the housing industry today. So if the housing industry \ncontinues to go downward, if it continues to spiral\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\ndownward, we are going to see the bankrupting of one of the most \nimportant industries today.\n  This stimulus package does include some legislation that will allow \nthem to take their carryback losses in a manner that makes sense for \nthem economically so that they will not be forced into the halls of the \nbankruptcy court.\n  For a lot of reasons, I believe this stimulus package which is before \nus is a solid package. It is very significantly improved from what we \nwere seeing come over from the House of Representatives. I would hope \nthat the President of the United States, his Cabinet, Secretary \nPaulson, others, Secretary Gutierrez, join us in helping move this \nSenate Finance package through to the finish line.\n  The final point I would make is that though we hope we will get this \npackage through, we know that our work here on the economic issues of \nAmerica is not yet done. A second and short-term phase, which I believe \nwe should undertake here in the next month or so, is we need to deal \nmore comprehensively with the housing issues that face our country. We \nneed to deal with the 2007 farm bill and get that through conference \nand get that done to ensure the food and fuel security of America.\n  We need to return to that Finance Committee-produced package on \nenergy that would have fueled the clean energy future of America for \nthe 21st century. We need to go to that as soon as we get the stimulus \npackage through. I am hopeful that we will be able to move in that \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have listened with some interest today \nto many of my colleagues who have come to the floor to speak about what \nis called a stimulus package. I have never quite understood the word \n``stimulus'' as it applies to economics. I did teach economics in \ncollege at one point. I guess the notion of a stimulus is to excite the \neconomy, to do something to expand the economy.\n  The fact is, until a couple of months ago, the President was telling \nus the economy was doing really well; we have a strong, sound economy. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury was telling us the economy is solid and \nwe are on solid ground. Of course, most Americans knew better. Now we \ndiscover that the economy needs a stimulus. Let me describe why that is \nthe case, and a response to some of the discussion on the floor of the \nSenate today.\n  We have had an almost unbelievable 7 years. President Bush came to \nthe Congress at the start of his Presidency, and he said: President \nClinton has left a large budget surplus. Alan Greenspan said he \ncouldn't even sleep; the surplus was so big. He was worried the surplus \nwas so large it was going to be a problem.\n  President Bush saw this projected surplus, a surplus in the first \nyear of his Presidency and then projected for the next 10 years. He was \nso excited, he rushed to the Congress and said: You have to help me. We \nneed to get rid of this projected surplus. We need to provide very big \ntax cuts. By the way, if you earn a $1 million a year in income or $10 \nmillion a year, brace yourself, I have big things in mind for you. I am \ngoing to give you a very big tax cut.\n  Some of us said: Mr. President, you said you were a compassionate \nconservative. Where is the conservative part of this? What if something \ngoes wrong? These are just projections. Let's wait and see if these \nsurpluses materialize.\n  The President said: Don't worry. Be happy. We want to give tax cuts, \nwith the biggest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.\n  Sure enough, he got that through the House and the Senate--but not \nwith my support. I did not vote for it. But almost instantly we saw, \nNo. 1, the country move into a recession in 2001. Then we had 9/11 and \nthe devastating attack by terrorists. Then we had a war in Afghanistan \npursuing Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. Then we went to war in Iraq \nand had all of the homeland security issues. All of a sudden, we had \nall of this extra expense, and we had a downturn in the economy. What \nhad been budget surpluses turned into very large budget deficits.\n  The President, oblivious to all of that, said: It doesn't matter. \nThings are the same, as far as I am concerned. We want more and more \ntax cuts for upper income Americans.\n  So that has been the fiscal policy for 7 years: ignore the obvious, \nignore reality, and just preach the positive message and hope \neverything turns out all right.\n  The fact is, everything has turned out all right for some. If you are \nat the top of the income ladder, you have to be ecstatic. Your share of \nthe assets and wealth of this country has dramatically increased. But \nif you are someone at the bottom of the economic ladder, working two \njobs, trying to make ends meet for your family, if you are someone who \nis trying to buy a home, somebody who is trying to hang on to a job in \na plant that the owners want to move to China in search of 30-cent \nlabor, if you are someone who works in a company that has now told you \ntimes have changed, you no longer get health care and your retirement \nprogram is gone and if you don't accept a $2-an-hour decrease, your job \nis going to Shenzhen, China, you are somebody who is having a tough \ntime with things in recent years.\n  Then, all of a sudden, we see the subprime mortgage scandal. The \nsubprime mortgage scandal is an unbelievable scandal with greed in \nevery direction, the brokers making massive amounts of money with fast-\ntalking sales pitches to a lot of folks, putting them in a new subprime \nloan at a 2-percent interest rate that will reset 3 years later at \nrates people have no capability of paying; just buy it and flip it in 2 \nyears, and you will make a lot of money.\n  The mortgage companies that were advertising on television were \nsaying: Hey, get a mortgage from us. If you have had bankruptcy, no \nproblem. You have trouble, you have bad credit, no problem. Can't pay \nyour monthly home bills, no problem. We will give you a loan. Come to \nus. Bad credit, come to us.\n  You saw the ads. All of us saw those ads. Those mortgage companies \nand brokers together ratcheted up this huge bubble. Then what they did \nis, when they sold these subprime mortgages, they cut them up like \nsausage. Just like meat-packing plants filled sausage with sawdust for \nfiller, they sliced up these mortgages, collateralized debt \nobligations--some subprime, some decent loans--and securitized them and \nsold them, and nobody knew what they had. All of a sudden, people can't \npay their house payments. Interest rates get reset. They have no \ncapability of paying. We have substantial bankruptcy, home \nforeclosures--it is a huge mess. It has caused a serious drag on the \neconomy.\n  Couple that with this President's fiscal policy in which we have a \n$600 billion requirement to borrow in this fiscal year alone and a $700 \nbillion trade deficit, $2 billion a year that we import more than we \nexport. That is $1.3 trillion in debt this year on a $13 trillion \neconomy. That is a 10 percent indebtedness in 1 year on top of the \ngreed that comes from a subprime loan scandal and an economy that seems \nto have come to a dead stop.\n  Then they say: We need to stimulate the economy. Yes, we probably do. \nThis economy probably needs a lot more than stimulus. We need to hook \nup some jumper cables to something.\n  The Federal Reserve Board--a board that has gotten a lot of my \nattention over the years--has taken aggressive action. They seldom take \naggressive action on anything. They did two cuts, a three-quarters of a \npercent interest rate cut and a half a percent interest rate cut. The \nfact is, that is a bold move for the Federal Reserve Board.\n\n  Now it is up to Congress to do something on the fiscal policy side. \nBut it is just a step, an important step. Psychologically, we must take \nthis step, or markets and others would have an apoplectic seizure. So \nwe write a piece of legislation in the Finance Committee, try to bring \nit to the floor of the Senate, and we have people doing all kinds of \ngymnastics on the floor. They say: Well, this is loading up a bill with \nornaments and goodies and projects and so on.\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\n  I guess they want to avoid the obvious. The obvious difference that \nexists with this stimulus package is very simple. This stimulus bill, \ncoming out of the Finance Committee, is supported by the Democratic \nchairman and the Republican ranking member. Senators Baucus and \nGrassley said this: If you are going to stimulate the economy and you \nare going to give $500 rebates, you need to include the 20 million \nlower-income senior citizens who would not get a rebate under the \nHouse-passed stimulus plan.\n  Folks who work in this Chamber, take a shower in the morning, put on \na blue suit, and come to work, are not, in most cases, trying to count \ntheir pennies to see if they will have enough for soup and medicine the \nrest of the week. But there are a whole lot of folks, senior citizens \nespecially, living on fixed incomes who have an awful time making it \nstretch month to month. I meet a lot of them, especially a lot of older \nwomen living alone in many cases, trying to figure out: How do I make \nthis income stretch to be able to pay for my medicine and to buy the \nfood and pay the rent?\n  I mentioned medicine. Senior citizens are about 12 percent of the \npopulation. They consume one-third of all prescription drugs. One of \nthe fastest growing elements of health care is the cost of prescription \ndrugs. You can't do a stimulus package and decide that some 20 million \nsenior citizens should not participate. You are going to give a rebate \nto the American people to try to stimulate the economy, and you are \ngoing to say grandpa and grandma don't apply, they don't count? What \nkind of approach is that? Grandpa and grandma don't count? We inherit \nthis place from them. They were the stewards of this country of ours. \nThey helped build this country. They provided the roots by which we, \nthe branches, have been able to succeed. But now we have people in this \nChamber who say grandpa and grandma don't count; millions of senior \ncitizens shouldn't be a part of this.\n  The difference in the stimulus package being debated is one that is \npretty stark: 20 million lower income seniors, many of whom need it \nmost, under our proposal would get a rebate check of $500. To some, \nthat doesn't mean much, I suppose. There are people around here who \nlose a cuff link worth $500, I reckon. But to a lot of people, $500 is \nvery significant. We cannot--I emphasize--we cannot pass a stimulus \npackage and walk out of that door with our heads high if we decide 20 \nmillion senior citizens don't count, that these senior citizens won't \nbe included.\n\n  There is another issue in this piece of legislation that we passed \nout of the Finance Committee. It is something that for anyone who has \nstudied rudimentary economics 101. It is one of the economic \nstabilizers in our economy: When there is an economic slowdown, you \nextend unemployment benefits. It is axiomatic that when there is a \nslowdown in the economy, you must extend unemployment insurance \nbenefits. We have always done that. Yet those who object to what we \nhave passed out of the Senate Finance Committee are saying, no, you \ncan't do that. Don't support that. We don't support giving rebates to \nsenior citizens who need it and we don't support extending unemployment \ninsurance benefits to those at the bottom of the economic ladder who \nhave lost their jobs.\n  Again, there is no one in this Chamber who would have lost their job \nduring this slowdown. No one in this Chamber is going to go home and \nsay, Honey, today wasn't a very good day. I was given notice that my \njob was over. It wasn't my fault. I worked pretty hard, but I was given \nnotice that I am no longer needed. Nobody in this Chamber will have to \nget that message. But there are a whole lot of people in this country \nwho have experienced that.\n  So when we talk about the economic stimulus package that came out of \nthe Finance Committee, the major differences are simple and easy to \nunderstand. We say 20 million senior citizens cannot be left out of an \nopportunity for the rebate check. They too will stimulate this economy. \nThey especially need that help. We say when those who have lost their \njobs during an economic downturn and have run out of unemployment \nbenefits, that their benefits should be extended, as we have always \nextended them during an economic downturn.\n  Yesterday, President Bush sent us a new budget, and it reflects much \nof what I have described of the priorities that seem to be completely \nbackwards. The President's priorities are: Let's continue to borrow, \nborrow, borrow more money. Let's decide to cut substantially here at \nhome the investments we should make in this country.\n  I spoke to a group about a half an hour ago that is very interested \nin rural water investments. All of us who come from rural States \nunderstand the urgency of getting good water to our communities. Rural \nwater systems are unbelievably important. The President, as one example \nin this budget, said: Let's cut funding for the Corps of Engineers by \n$851 million. Let's cut funding for the Bureau of Reclamation by $183 \nbillion. He said: Let's cut water funding for projects that will bring \nquality drinking water to people around this country in rural areas; \nlet's cut that by about $1 billion.\n  I say consider this: In the President's budget, he said, let's cut \nwater project funding in our country--the infrastructure investment \nthat will bring dividends for years--let's cut that by $1 billion. This \nis from the Special Inspector General for Iraq. The Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq says, we are now, American taxpayers, funding 967 \nwater projects in the country of Iraq. We are going to cut $1 billion \nin water projects in this country, and we are funding 967 water \nprojects in Iraq. We are designing and constructing the Ifraz main \nwater supply project, $194 million. We are doing the Haditha project, \nthe Baladrooz water supply project; we are building the water supply \nproject at Meshkab. We are designing and constructing the water supply \nproject at Nassriya. The list is long--I could read this for a long \nwhile. The water treatment plant in Sadr City, the water treatment \nplant in Al Wathba.\n  There is plenty of money, apparently, as long as it is overseas \nsomeplace. There is just not enough money to take care of things here \nat home. It is unbelievable to me.\n  By the way, while I am at it, most of this is done with contract \nwork. We hire contractors. There is the greatest waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country with the hiring of those \ncontractors. I brought this item to the floor a number of times--and I \nwant to do it again, because I held about 17 hearings on this subject. \nI ask unanimous consent to show this towel on the floor of the Senate.\n  This towel was brought to us by Henry Bunting. Henry Bunting was a \npurchaser in Kuwait for the Halliburton Corporation, their subsidiary \nKellogg, Brown, & Root. I had a hearing about waste, fraud, and abuse \nin contracting which is hair raising: $45 for a case of Coca Cola, \n$7,500 to rent an SUV per month. How 50,000 pounds of nails that were \nordered to Iraq and they were too short. They are laying in the sand \nnow, discarded, because none of that matters. Henry Bunting said \nHalliburton said: Don't worry about it. The taxpayer picks up the tab. \nHe held up this towel. He said: This is an example of everything that \nis wrong. My job was to order towels for the troops, among many other \nthings. He said: I filled out a requisition to order towels for \nAmerican troops in Iraq, and I ordered white towels. He said: My \nsupervisor at Kellogg, Brown, & Root said, No, no, no, that is not the \ntowel we are going to order. You are going to order a towel that has \nKBR embroidered on the towel, the initials of the contracting company, \nthe Halliburton subsidiary. Henry said: Yes, but that is going to \nquadruple the cost. It is going to cost four times more to buy a towel \nlike that. His supervisor said: It doesn't matter. This is a cost-plus \ncontract. The taxpayers are going to pay for this. This is just a \ntowel. It is a towel that costs four times what it should have cost for \nthe American taxpayer. But it is not just a towel; it is a brand new \n$85,000 truck that has a flat tire, and because it has a flat tire and \nthey cannot fix it on the road because they didn't have the \nright wrench, they leave it there to be torched; or an $85,000 brand \nnew truck that has a plugged fuel line that is left to be set on fire. \nWhy? The American taxpayer will pay for all of that. That is not a \nproblem. Nobody will even know, except I know, and some of my \ncolleagues know. Nobody seems to care, however, in the executive \nbranch. Nobody.\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\n  When I see what is now coming to us in this budget--it is \ninteresting. When I talk about this issue of a hand towel with the \nembroidered initials of the Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & \nRoot, that cost four times more, but they said, don't worry, it doesn't \nmatter, the taxpayers pay for that. We don't care about that. All of \nthis is funded out of these emergency requests sent to us by the \nPresident. Here is what he has done. It starts again this year.\n  In 2002, the President said: We are going to fight a war, and I want \n$49 billion, and I want it now, and I want it declared an emergency, \nand we are not going to pay for it. We are going to put it on top of \nthe debt.\n  In 2003, he said: I want $76 billion. I want all of it declared an \nemergency and we are going to put it on the debt. We need that for the \nwar. In 2004, he said: I want $87 billion. We are not going to pay for \nit. Add it to the debt. In 2005: I want $82 billion. In 2006: I want \n$92 billion. In 2007, he said: I want $103 billion. Last year, for \nfiscal year 2008, he said: I want $193 billion. That is $16 billion a \nmonth, $4 billion a week. He said: I don't want any of this paid for. I \nwant to add it to the debt, because I am sending soldiers to war and \nthey are going to come back and help pay the bill. Now, that is nearly \n$700 billion--nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars, not a penny \nof it paid for. Not a cent.\n  Don't ever talk to me again about what is liberal or what is \nconservative. If this is a conservative President, as he claims, saying \nlet's add almost three-quarters of a trillion dollars to Federal \nindebtedness because we don't have the courage to ask the American \npeople to do what we should do, and that is pay for that which we are \npursuing in Iraq--on top of this added to the debt, the budget we \nreceived yesterday is an almost unbelievable description of what has \ngone wrong and what will continue to go wrong as long as this \nadministration doesn't recognize the unbelievable danger that comes \nfrom fiscal policy debt and trade debt.\n  As I indicated earlier, we are doing a stimulus package. I strongly \nsupport that which came out of the Senate Finance Committee. I strongly \nsupport the notion that we must include lower income seniors; we must \ninclude, for example, the stabilizers we have always included of \nextending unemployment insurance. All of that is very important. When \nwe are finished with that, we must say to this President and to the \nnext occupant of the White House that we have structural problems that \ncannot wait. We cannot possibly have a growing, vibrant American \neconomy that expands opportunity for the American people unless we put \nour fiscal house in order. In terms of priorities, we can't be American \nleaders and say: Oh, by the way, let's cut $1 billion in water projects \nin the United States, and Katy bar the door, here are 967 separate \nwater projects we want to fund in Iraq. We are going to say we can't \nbuild hospitals in the United States, but we will build hospitals in \nIraq. We say we don't have enough money to rehabilitate the schools in \nthe United States, but we will build the schools in Iraq.\n  My point is it is long past the time to start taking care of a few \nthings here at home, and this President's budget is a completely \nbankrupt budget. This President's budget says the following: This \nPresident's budget says he will take our Federal debt from $8.9 \ntrillion to $12.2 trillion in the next 6 years. Think of that. That is \na complete abdication of responsibility. It means we have no \nleadership. It falls on our shoulders, it seems to me, to begin using \nsome modicum of common sense, and we intend to do that.\n  I have some other things I was going to visit about today, but I want \nto wait because some of my colleagues are on the floor. I don't know \nwhether Senator Reid is ready with the unanimous consent request, but \nwhen he is, I certainly would want him to do that. I also know my \ncolleague Senator Sanders from Vermont is on the floor as well.\n  I would be happy to wait until after Senator Sanders makes a \npresentation. But I want to make a presentation about a couple \nadditional issues that relates to some of this.\n  At this point let me relinquish the floor, and perhaps I could ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Sanders is finished, I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The majority leader \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I tried to be very patient. I have been \nwaiting for an hour to have some Republican come to the floor so I may \noffer a unanimous consent request. I don't know how much more patient I \nneed to be. The unanimous consent simply says we are doing nothing \ntoday; can't we at least have amendments offered on FISA. I was talking \nwith staff, Republican and Democratic staff. I understood that was \nsomething we could do. But now maybe we can't even do that.\n  I have called Senators. I have called Senator Dodd and he is willing \nto come here and offer his amendment. Senator Feingold is willing to \ncome and offer two amendments. Senator Whitehouse is willing to come \nand offer his amendment. We have people ready to work. But this is \nSuper Tuesday, and at this late hour--Senator Klobuchar is leaving in a \nfew minutes to go back to Minnesota. They have a primary there tonight. \nThe same in Illinois. A number of other Senators have left.\n  But we are willing to debate these amendments to speed up what we are \ntrying to do. The President came out today with--it is difficult to \ncomprehend this. He came out with a veto threat on FISA. Now, try that \none on for size, everybody. The President has issued a veto threat on \nFISA today when we don't have anything for him to veto. Maybe he has \ncome to the conclusion that he doesn't like the Intelligence Committee-\nreported bill. But that is where we are. The President has stated he \nwants to veto FISA. I guess he is becoming impatient to become \nrelevant. I don't know what to say.\n  It is obvious there would be an objection, because we can't even get \nsomeone here to object, so I won't offer this because I would like to \nhave one of my colleagues here, but I was going to ask unanimous \nconsent to resume consideration of the FISA legislation, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII. I was going to specifically mention \namendments my folks are willing to offer. The Republicans also have \namendments to offer. Senator Bond has a couple. But it is obvious that \nthis is slowdown time, so I will not offer the unanimous consent \nrequest unless I hear something from--here it is 4:15 in the afternoon, \nand the only thing we have heard today dealing with FISA is the \nPresident's threat to veto something that doesn't exist.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of S. 2248, the FISA legislation, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, and that the pending amendments be set aside for the purpose \nof offering amendments as follows: Nos. 3912, 3913, 3907, two by \nSenator Feingold and one by Senators Dodd and Feingold; and that this \nwould be for debate only--they are on the list, and the unanimous \nconsent is now before the body--and that all time count postcloture to \nthe stimulus package now before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, we had a vigorous discussion at lunch about moving \nforward on this bill. I think I am safe in saying that the overwhelming \nmajority of the members of the Republican caucus would like to have \nbeen voting today on amendments; nevertheless, that appears not to be \npossible. So at least we can debate these three amendments and get \nstarted in that way. I think that is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, further, other Senators may want to come and \nconsult with my friend, the Republican leader, to see if there would be \nopportunities to offer their amendments. Senator Bond has two. Senators \nWhitehouse and Specter have one. They agreed to come over. I think \nSenator Feinstein has an amendment. This would be a big help, to get \nrid of these three today.\n  There is an order before the body that when Senator Sanders finishes \nhis statement, the Senator from North Dakota will be recognized. How \nlong will he be speaking?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be no more than 10 minutes and probably not that \nlong.\n  Mr. REID. Would Senator Feingold be ready then?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me concur with Senator Reid. The \nAmerican people want us to begin to get work done for them. It is high \ntime we did that.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from North Dakota and share his \nconcerns about many of the points he made, not the least of which, if \nwe are going to spend hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars on \nthis war in Iraq, that bill should not be left to our children and our \ngrandchildren. We should at least have the decency to pay for that \nourselves.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words this afternoon about the \nbudget President Bush brought before us yesterday and tell you I was \nextremely dismayed by what was in that budget and what was not in that \nbudget. Frankly, in my view, this budget is unconscionable, and it \nreflects priorities that are hard to imagine and are way out of step \nwith what ordinary Americans feel and believe.\n  While providing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest people in our country--the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 \npercent--over the next decade, the President, at the same time, has \nproposed major cuts in health care, in low-income heating assistance, \nin weatherization, in nutrition, in housing programs, and in other \nbasic needs of low- and moderate-income Americans. That is a set of \nvalues which I think reflect badly on the White House and does not \nreflect the values of the American people.\n  In my view, this is a Robin Hood-in-reverse budget. This is a budget \nwhich takes from the poor to give to the rich. This is a budget which \ncuts programming for those most in need and gives billions of dollars \nin tax breaks for those least in need. This proposed budget simply \ntells us--again, if we didn't need this reminder--just how out of touch \nthis administration is with the needs of working Americans.\n  Let me be very clear. I am a member of the Budget Committee, and I \nintend to do everything I can to make sure that President Bush's budget \nis rejected and that we bring forth in the Senate a new budget that \nreflects the priorities of the vast majority of the people in our \ncountry and not just the wealthy few.\n  Most Americans understand that our health care system is \ndisintegrating. Everybody knows that. Since President Bush has been in \noffice, 8.5 million Americans have lost their health insurance, 47 \nmillion Americans are now uninsured, and the cost of health care is \nsoaring. How does President Bush respond to the growing crisis in \nhealth care? Well, it is an unusual response: He slashes funding for \nMedicare. He slashes funds for Medicaid. He cuts rural health care \nprograms. In other words, he is making a bad situation even worse.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, we are living in a period where our \nhealth care system is disintegrating. More and more people lack health \ninsurance. The costs are soaring, premiums are going up, copayments are \ngoing up, and deductibles are going up. The President's response to \nthis crisis is to savagely cut Medicare, Medicaid, rural health care \nprograms, and other health care programs. What logic is there in making \na bad situation even worse? But it is not just health care.\n  I understand that it would be asking too much for this President to \ntake on the insurance companies and take on the drug companies and move \nus toward a national health care program, which every other major \ncountry on Earth has. We are the only country in the industrialized \nworld that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. I understand \nthe President is not going to do that, but at the very least, he should \nnot be adding more people to the rolls of the uninsured. At the very \nleast, at a time when we have some 17,000 Americans who are dying every \nyear because they lack health insurance, he need not make a terrible \nsituation even worse.\n  In the State of Vermont and throughout many parts of our country, we \nhave experienced extremely cold weather this winter. There are parts of \nAmerica where we have seen 20-below-zero weather. At the same time, the \nprice of home heating oil is soaring. In fact, it has more than doubled \nsince President Bush has been in office. The result is that the LIHEAP \nprogram, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which keeps \nmillions of seniors and lower income households warm in the winter, is \nstretched to the breaking point. The simple truth is that when home \nheating costs soar, either States will cut back per person or they will \ndeny large numbers of people any heating oil at all. That is the \nreality the States face.\n  I understand President Bush has no problem with the fact that his \nfriends at ExxonMobil have just announced the largest profits in the \nhistory of the world for the third consecutive year--over $40 billion \nin profits in 2007. I know he has no problem with that. I know he has \nno great problem with the fact that home heating oil prices are now at \nover $3.30 a gallon. I know he is not worried about the fact that a few \nyears ago, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, Mr. Raymond, received a $400 \nmillion retirement package from that company. From President Bush's \nperspective and ideology, I suppose those are good things.\n  Despite the President's lack of concern about rising fuel costs, it \nreally is beyond comprehension that he would slash the LIHEAP program \nby $570 million in his budget--a 22-percent reduction from last year. \nImagine that. The cost of home heating oil is soaring, LIHEAP is under \ngreat strain and it cannot do what it did last year for lack of \nfunding, and President Bush's response is: Let's cut another half-\nbillion dollars from LIHEAP.\n  What are people supposed to do next year under Bush's budget when the \nweather gets cold? What do old people who are living on Social Security \nand cannot afford the outrageously high prices for home heating oil do? \nDo they freeze to death? Do they move in with their kids? How many \nblankets do they have to throw on themselves? How do you treat old \npeople when it gets cold? You don't slash LIHEAP by $570 million. That \nis pretty cruel.\n  At a time when millions of low-income seniors are struggling to \nsurvive on inadequate Social Security benefits, this President, in his \nbudget, wants to cut back on nutrition programs for low-income seniors, \nin addition to cutting back on senior housing.\n  There is a program which, in Vermont, works very well--the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program. It provides a free package of groceries \nevery month to low-income seniors. People all over the country utilize \nthis program. They need this program. The President may not know this, \nbut hunger is on the upsurge in America. In this great country, more \nand more fellow citizens are going hungry. What we are seeing is \nemergency food shelves not having enough food to feed desperate people \nall over America. And the President's response to this crisis is to cut \nback or eliminate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. What is the \nmoral justification for doing that? I don't know.\n  I am a member of the Veterans' Committee, and I am proud that last \nyear, against opposition from the White House, we substantially \nincreased funding for the VA and are providing billions more so that \nveterans can gain access to quality care in VA hospitals and clinics. \nDespite all of his rhetoric about how much he loves and respects the \ntroops, this President, in his budget, has proposed a very large \nincrease in health care fees for veterans who access VA facilities. The \nincreases would range from $250 to $750. What is the goal there? It is \nvery clear. The goal is to drive veterans--low-income veterans--out of \nthe VA system so the VA can save money. Thank you very much, Mr. \nPresident.\n  A week ago, the President, in his State of the Union Address, was \ntelling us how much he loved and respected the veterans. Now he is \nraising fees for VA health care with the explicit goal of driving \nveterans out of the VA health care system. That is wrong but, frankly, \nit is consistent with what President Bush did some years ago when he \ncompletely eliminated access to the VA for so-called category 8 \nveterans, who were too wealthy. These were veterans who didn't have \nservice-connected disabilities, were not wounded, but had incomes of \nover $27,000 a year. They were too wealthy to access VA health care.\n  Well, I say to President Bush, at a time when tens of thousands of \nour soldiers have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, please do not \nbalance\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\nyour budget on the backs of our veterans.\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, we have seen recordbreaking \ndeficits, and our national debt is now $9.2 trillion--$3 trillion more \nthan when he came into office.\n  All of us in Congress want to move this country toward a balanced \nbudget and to make sure our kids and grandchildren are not left with \nthis enormous debt Bush has accumulated. But there are right ways to \nmove us toward a balanced budget and there are wrong ways to do it and \nGeorge W. Bush's budget moves us exactly in the wrong direction.\n  As many Americans know, since President Bush has been in office, the \nmiddle class has been decimated, poverty has increased, and the gap \nbetween the very wealthiest people in our society and everyone else has \ngrown wider. In fact--and we do not talk about this terribly much, \nalthough we should be talking about it--the United States today has by \nfar the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major \ncountry on Earth. In fact, our distribution of wealth and income is \nincreasingly looking like Mexico, it is looking like Brazil, it is \nlooking like those poor developing countries and certainly not looking \nlike Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or other industrialized nations.\n  Mr. President, as you are more than aware, there are a lot of facts \nand figures that are thrown out on the floor of the Senate, but let me \nmention one statistic that I hope all Americans will pay attention to \nand to which I hope my colleagues in the Senate will pay attention. And \nthat is, according to the latest available statistics, the wealthiest \n300,000 Americans--men, women, and children--300,000 take in more \nincome than the bottom 150 million. In other words, the upper one-tenth \nof 1 percent, 300,000, people earn more income than do the bottom 50 \npercent. One-tenth of 1 percent, 50 percent, more income for the top \none-tenth of 1 percent. In my view, that is not what America is \nsupposed to be about, but that is the direction in which we are moving. \nThat gap between the people on top, a handful of people, and everybody \nelse is getting wider and wider.\n  For those people who live in the bottom 90 percent of the population, \nthe overwhelming majority of our people, their average income was \n$33,000 way back in 1973 before globalization, before computers, before \na huge increase in worker productivity. Thirty-five years have come and \ngone, and today, inflation accounted for dollars, that average income \nhas declined from $33,000 to $29,000. That is a $75-a-week pay cut. \nThat is called the collapse of the middle class: people working longer \nhours, they are making lower wages. That is the reality facing tens of \nmillions of our fellow citizens.\n  That explains to my mind why in yesterday's Washington Post a front \npage story was headlined: ``U.S. Concern Over Economy is Highest in \nYears.'' It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. People go to the \ngas pump and pay $3.15 for a gallon of gas. They go to work and the \nboss says: Sorry, you no longer have health insurance. Oh, I can't \nafford to pay my mortgage; I am losing my house. Oh, too bad, 3 million \nAmericans lost their pensions last year.\n  In area after area, in almost every aspect of middle-class life, \npeople are getting hit. Then when they go to the grocery store and have \nto use their credit card to buy their groceries because they don't have \nthe cash available, they find they are paying 28 percent in interest \nrates so Wall Street can become wealthier. That is what is going on, \nand that is why the American people are outraged about what is going on \nin terms of the middle class.\n  I have to tell you I find it literally beyond belief that with \npoverty in America increasing, with the middle class shrinking and with \nthe wealthiest people in our country having it better than at any time \nsince the late 1920s--incomes are soaring for millionaires and \nbillionaires, a huge growth in the number of millionaires and \nbillionaires--in the middle of all that, what President Bush is saying \nis he wants to repeal the estate tax which would provide $1 trillion in \ntax relief to whom? To the top three-tenths of 1 percent; $1 trillion \ngoing to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. That is what this budget, \nthis Robin-Hood-in-reverse budget is all about.\n  If you are old and you are having a difficult time heating your home, \nPresident Bush is going to cut the program that keeps you warm. If you \nare low income or a working person in need of health care, President \nBush wants to cut the programs that help you. If you are a veteran who \nhas put your life on the line defending this country, the President \nwants to make it harder for you to access VA health care by \nsubstantially increasing your fees. If you are a low-income person in a \nhome which lacks insulation and you are spending all kinds of money \ntrying to keep your house warm, the President wants to completely cut \nback and eliminate the weatherization program. That is the bad news. \nBut if you are a billionaire, if you are one of the wealthiest families \nin America, in this very same budget, the President wants to give you \nhuge tax breaks. Cutbacks for those in need; tax breaks for \nbillionaires.\n  Let me give one example. If the estate tax is completely repealed, as \nPresident Bush wants that to take place, one family, the Walton family, \nwhich owns Wal-Mart, which is worth about $82 billion, that one family \nwill receive over $30 billion in tax relief.\n  We hear on this Senate floor a lot about morality, right? We hear a \nlot about values. I want to know what kind of moral values there are \nwhen there are some people, including the President, who would give one \nfamily, an enormously wealthy family, a multibillion-dollar family, $30 \nbillion in tax breaks and then cut back on the needs of millions and \nmillions of low-income and working families? What kind of moral values \ndoes that speak to?\n  We have a lot of work in front of us. We have to completely rewrite \nPresident Bush's budget. We need to work hard so the people of our \ncountry once again begin to have faith in their Government, that they \nknow those of us who are elected are prepared to stand with them rather \nthan the millionaires and the billionaires and their lobbyists who have \nso much power over this institution.\n  We need, for a start, to reject the President's budget, rewrite that \nbudget so it works for ordinary people. We need to pass a stimulus \npackage which represents the needs of our seniors, our veterans, the \nmiddle class, working people. We need to do that now, and we need to \nbuild on that. Not only do we need to reject the President's disastrous \nbudget, but more importantly, we need to reclaim the faith of the \nAmerican people. Mr. President, I look forward to working with you to \ndo that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                  Private Debt Collection for the IRS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had wished to conclude a couple of \ncomments in morning business, after which I believe the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, will want to begin discussing an amendment. I \ntalked about the stimulus package and about the economy generally. I \nwished to talk about two issues I have been working on that I think \nneed to be resolved.\n  First, it is almost unbelievable to me, but there is a tiny little \nissue--not so tiny perhaps to some--that needs to get fixed. This \nadministration decided they wanted to farm out the collection of taxes \nowed to the Federal Government to private debt collectors. A number of \nus--myself, Senator Murray, and others--objected strenuously. We tried \nthat before, and it didn't work. The administration pushed ahead. We \npassed a funding prohibition through the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. The full U.S. House passed a bill saying don't do this. \nNonetheless, the Internal Revenue Service and the Bush administration \npushed and pushed very quickly. So they decided to farm out tax debt \ncollection.\n  What they did was put taxes that were owed and not paid in the hands \nof private debt collectors. Now we have had 1 year of experience with \nit, and I want to share with my colleagues what has happened. It is \nalmost breathtaking to hear.\n  What has happened at the end of a year is the cost of administering \nthe program to provide these delinquent taxes to debt collectors for \ncollection has exceeded the revenue by $50 million. In other words, we \nhave a project where the Internal Revenue Service\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nsays we are going to take some of these areas where the taxes haven't \nbeen paid, we are going to give them to private debt collectors, and we \nare going to give them a commission for collecting it. So at the end of \na year, the IRS lost $50 million.\n  I don't know how you lose $50 million when you are collecting taxes. \nThat takes some genius apparently. It was estimated by the National \nTaxpayer Advocate that if the same money, just over $70 million that \nwas invested in this program, had been invested in hiring the agents at \nthe Internal Revenue Service, generally based on what they calculate, \nthey would have collected $1.4 billion. So for this investment, the IRS \ncould collect $1.4 billion or they could lose $50 million. Talk about \nstaggering gross incompetence.\n  It would be kind of nice to put in the Record the names of every \nperson who was involved in the administration so they can somehow be \nrecognized in a ``Hall of Shame.'' How on Earth do you lose $50 million \nat the Internal Revenue Service with a program as goofy as this one? \nAgain, take delinquent taxes, give them to private debt collection, and \nlose $50 million, or take the same amount of money and invest it in IRS \ncollection and collect $1.4 billion.\n  What is the choice? The President's people said the choice is to give \nit to the private collection agencies because we like to privatize \neverything, and they end up losing $50 million. That is unbelievable.\n  We are going to try once again this year--and I think we will \nsucceed--to shut this program down. Aside from losing $50 million, we \nhave had experience with this program before. It was tried before. It \nwas a miserable failure when it was tried previously. We have examples \nof what happens when private debt collectors get ahold of these things. \nFirst of all, you have very sensitive information about people's lives, \nthe financial information on tax returns. There are criminal penalties \nfor dealing with that information. You are going to farm that out. They \nsay: We will farm it out, but we will protect the information.\n  It makes no sense at all to have been through this and then to farm \nit out to a private debt collection agency and find one elderly couple \nwho gets 150 telephone calls over 27 day from a collection agency. It \nturns out they were not the taxpayers who were being called but, \nnonetheless, their phone rang 150 times. That is the kind of thing that \ngoes on and shouldn't, in addition to the incompetence of losing $50 \nmillion.\n  Senator Murray, myself, and many others are going to fix this \nproblem. It is important the American people understand what happened, \nand someone needs to be accountable for it.\n\n\n                       Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  I wish to mention one additional point because tomorrow Secretary \nBodman is coming to Capitol Hill. He is the Secretary of Energy. I have \ngreat respect for Secretary Bodman. I work closely with the Department \nof Energy. I chair the appropriations subcommittee that funds all the \nwater and energy projects in our country. So I have a relationship with \nthe Department of Energy. I like the Secretary and I like some of the \npeople who work for him down at the Department of Energy. But there is \nsomething going on down there that bothers me a lot, and I intend to \ntalk to the Secretary about it tomorrow.\n  At a time when oil is priced at $90 to $100 per barrel and when the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve--that is oil we stick underground that is \nsaved for a rainy day, a national emergency or a time when we \ndesperately need the oil--at a time when the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is 97 percent filled, this administration is taking oil through \nroyalty-in-kind payments from producers in the Gulf of Mexico and \nsticking it underground. They are taking oil out of the supply pipeline \nthat should have gone into the supply pipeline, at a time when we have \nthese unbelievable prices for oil, and sticking it underground in domes \nto increase the supply in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is \nexactly the wrong thing to do at this point in time. It is exactly what \nwe should not be doing.\n\n  From August of 2007 to January 2008, 8.4 million barrels of oil were \ntaken out of the supply. That is oil that was given as a payment in \nkind for the royalties our Government was owed. Instead of taking that \nand putting it into the supply, using the money to reduce the Federal \ndebt and having the oil in the supply pipeline, the Dept. Of Energy \nstuck it underground. So at nearly a hundred dollars per barrel, we are \nputting oil underground, which tends to price gasoline at a much higher \nrate because you are diminishing supply at a time when that is the last \nthing we should do.\n  Now, the strategic petroleum reserve is filled with about 700 million \nbarrels of oil. The administration's approach is: Well, let's top it \noff. Let's fill it to 727 million barrels of oil. The administration \njust awarded three companies contracts--Shell, Sunoco Logistics, and \nB.P. North America--to place an additional 12.3 million barrels of \nroyalty-in-kind oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next 6 \nmonths. So that means another 12 million barrels will be taken out of \nsupply and stuck underground.\n  I mean, can anybody think of something that makes less sense at a \ntime when $100 or $90 or $80 a barrel of oil exists? People are driving \nto the gas pump and having to consider a mortgage to fill their tank. \nCan't anybody think of something that we should rather do than take oil \nout of the supply pipeline and stick it underground? It makes no sense \nto me at all.\n  So I am going to propose legislation that says no more for filling \nthe strategic petroleum reserve for the next year, unless oil drops \nbelow $50 a barrel. Let's take that royalty-in-kind oil and put it in \nthe supply pipeline and make sure it contributes to an increasing \nsupply and, therefore, lower prices for gasoline. Instead, the \nadministration is intent on taking that oil and sticking it \nunderground. That will have the impetus of pushing gas prices up.\n  Now, some would say: We are not talking about a large portion of oil \nhere. Well, no, it is true, we are only talking about 12.3 million \nbarrels in the next 6 months--8.4 million barrels from August to \nJanuary. Is that a massive quantity of oil? No. But we have had \nwitnesses testify before the Senate Energy Subcommittee and the \nHomeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that the \ngovernment is taking light sweet crude, which is part of a smaller \nsubset of more valuable oil, and putting it underground that has the \neffect of increasing the price of gasoline.\n  So I am going to ask the Secretary a lot about this issue tomorrow \nwhen he appears before the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, \nand I intend to address this in the appropriations process this year so \nthat we can prevent this from happening further. At least until the \npoint we have seen the price of oil come back down. My legislation \nproposes a prohibition from filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for \n1 year or at least until a time when the price of oil comes back below \n$50 a barrel.\n  Again, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is nearly 96 percent filled. \nWhy would we put upward pressure on gas prices? Because the Federal \nGovernment has decided to do things that would put upward pressure on \ngas prices by putting oil underground at a time when we have hundred-\ndollar-per-barrel oil. It defies common sense. You couldn't find two \npeople in Mike's Bar in Regent, ND, to make a judgment like that after \nthey have been there a couple hours. Just common sense would tell you \nthis makes no sense and we ought to stop it, and I intend to visit \nabout this at some length with the Secretary tomorrow when he comes \nbefore the Senate Energy Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S639-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S639-S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey ).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3913 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3913.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Menendez, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3913.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit reverse targeting and protect the rights of \n          Americans who are communicating with people abroad)\n\n       On page 6, line 6, strike ``the purpose'' and all that \n     follows through line 9 and insert the following: ``a \n     significant purpose of such acquisition is to acquire the \n     communications of a particular, known person reasonably \n     believed to be located in the United States, except in \n     accordance with title I;''.\n       On page 7, line 7, strike ``United States.'' and insert the \n     following: ``United States, and that an application is filed \n     under title I, if otherwise required, when a significant \n     purpose of an acquisition authorized under subsection (a) is \n     to acquire the communications of a particular, known person \n     reasonably believed to be located in the United States.''.\n       On page 9, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) the procedures referred to in clause (i) require \n     that an application is filed under title I, if otherwise \n     required, when a significant purpose of an acquisition \n     authorized under subsection (a) is to acquire the \n     communications of a particular, known person reasonably \n     believed to be located in the United States;\n       On page 17, line 2, strike ``United States.'' and insert \n     the following: ``United States, and are reasonably designed \n     to ensure that an application is filed under title I, if \n     otherwise required, when a significant purpose of an \n     acquisition authorized under subsection (a) is to acquire the \n     communications of a particular, known person reasonably \n     believed to be located in the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment, approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, assures the new authorities contained in this bill \nwill not be used to engage in what is known as ``reverse targeting of \nAmericans.'' FISA requires the Government to get a court order when it \nis listening in on Americans on American soil. Reverse targeting refers \nto the possibility that the Government will try to get around this \nrequirement by using these new authorities to wiretap someone overseas \nwhen what the Government really wants to do is listen to the American \nwith whom that foreign person is communicating.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has testified that reverse \ntargeting is a violation of the fourth amendment. This amendment merely \ncodifies that constitutional principle. Specifically, the amendment \nsays the Government needs an individualized court order when a \nsignificant purpose of the surveillance is to acquire communications of \na person inside the United States. Now, this language is critical if we \nare to protect the constitutional rights of Americans because the \nunderlying bill merely requires a court order if the purpose of the \nacquisition is to target the American.\n  A member of the Intelligence Committee, the Senator from Georgia, has \nsaid the underlying bill only prohibits surveillance when the \nGovernment is targeting a foreigner solely--solely--to listen to the \nAmerican with whom that foreigner is communicating. Now, what does this \nmean? That means if the Government has any passing interest at all in \nthe foreigner being wiretapped, it could intentionally conduct ongoing, \nlong-term surveillance of an American inside the United States without \na warrant. Now, the DNI says that would be unconstitutional, but it \nappears to be permissible under the current bill.\n  Recently declassified exchanges between the administration and \ncongressional intelligence committees demonstrate why the issue of \nreverse targeting is a very real problem.\n  According to the administration, ``if valid collection of the foreign \nintelligence target indicates that the person in the United States is \nof intelligence interest,'' NSA would disseminate an intelligence \nreport to the FBI, which can request the identity of that person and \n``which could''--I repeat, could--``seek a FISA court order to conduct \nelectronic surveillance in the United States.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe declassified documents to which I am referring.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       When NSA is acquiring the communications of a person in the \n     United States during its targeting of a foreigner overseas, \n     is it reasonable to impose a time limit on NSA's \n     determinations of whether to target the person in the United \n     States or drop that individual? It is not reasonable to \n     impose time limits on NSA's targeting determinations in this \n     manner. If frequent contacts occur between the foreign target \n     overseas and a person in the United States and if there is no \n     foreign intelligence to be obtained, analysts will------such \n     that the interception of the communications of the person in \n     the United States when targeting the foreigner overseas will \n     not occur. If valid collection of the foreign intelligence \n     target indicates that the person in the United States is of \n     intelligence interest, NSA would disseminate an intelligence \n     report with the identity masked to the FBI, which could seek \n     a FISA Court order to conduct electronic surveillance in the \n     United States. If valid foreign intelligence is expected to \n     be obtained by targeting the foreign selector, any \n     incidentally collected information about the person in the \n     United States would be handled in accordance with NSA's \n     minimization procedures.\n       How many times has NSA obtained a FISA order to target a \n     person in the United States where the initial target was a \n     foreigner overseas and a U.S. communicant became of foreign \n     intelligence interest? How many cases have there been where \n     the target remains the foreigner overseas and there have been \n     multiple communications between that target and a person in \n     the United States such that NSA considered whether to obtain \n     a FISA order to conduct electronic surveillance against the \n     person in the United States? This is difficult to answer \n     because NSA routinely provides information to the FBI and it \n     decides whether to follow up by getting a FISA order to \n     conduct electronic surveillance in the United States. For \n     example, if an analyst reviews an intercept and finds \n     evidence that a party to the communication (not the target of \n     the surveillance) is a U.S. person, he would go through his \n     foreign intelligence calculus. That is, he determines whether \n     the communication contains foreign intelligence. If he \n     determines that it does contain foreign intelligence, he \n     would disseminate a foreign intelligence report. The report \n     would mask the U.S. person's identity as ``U.S. person'' \n     under NSA's minimization procedures. Upon receipt, a customer \n     (here probably the FBI) would likely request that person's \n     identity. Under NSA's minimization procedures, NSA would \n     provide it if the requester demonstrates that the request is \n     within the scope of its mission and knowing the U.S. person's \n     identity is necessary to understand or assess the foreign \n     intelligence in the report. In this case, the FBI would \n     likely meet that test and, upon receipt of the identity, can \n     decide whether or not to follow up. NSA surveillance against \n     the foreign target would continue.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this confirms that when the Government \nhas an interest in an American, it is entirely up to the discretion of \nthe FBI to decide whether the Government will seek a warrant to listen \nto that American's communications. But the FBI may not seek a warrant \nfor any number of reasons, including lack of resources, insufficient \ncoordination with other elements of the Government, or simple \nincompetence. A recent Justice Department inspector general report \nfinding that the FBI's court-approved surveillance was disrupted \nbecause the Bureau failed to pay the telecommunications company on time \nshould give us cause for concern.\n  In this case, this amendment would actually help us to stop \nterrorists by requiring that when a foreign terrorist talks to a person \nin the United States and that communication prompts a significant \ninterest in the American, it can't just plain fall through the cracks.\n  Now, of course, the FBI might also choose not to seek a warrant \nbecause it doesn't have a real case against the American or because the \nGovernment doesn't want to tell the FISA Court the real reason it is \ninterested in that American. So if the FBI doesn't seek a court order, \ncan the NSA just listen in indefinitely to the communications of \nAmericans so long as they are communicating with a person overseas? I \nam afraid to say, Mr. President, the answer appears to be yes. \nAccording to the administration, the FBI, upon receipt of the identity \nof the American, ``can decide whether or not to follow up. NSA \nsurveillance against the foreign target would continue.''\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\n  The Government's apparent authority to continue indefinitely its \nsurveillance of the international communications of Americans is not \nlimited to terrorism cases where the Government should at least have an \nincentive to seek warrants against an American. It applies to all \nforeign intelligence. That includes the communications of an American \nwho is talking to a person overseas who is not a terrorist suspect, is \nnot suspected of any wrongdoing, and is not even an agent of a foreign \npower. Yet, no matter how interested the Government is in what that \ninnocent American has to say, if the FBI doesn't think it is worth its \nwhile to seek a court order or if the FBI knows it couldn't get the \norder, the surveillance continues nonetheless.\n  This raises serious constitutional concerns, which is why the \nRockefeller-Levin bill, the alternative to the Protect America Act that \nthe Senate considered back in August, required procedures to seek a \ncourt order if electronic surveillance was ``of the nature or quantity \nas to infringe on the reasonable expectations of privacy of persons \nwithin the United States.'' Yet, in a recently released letter, the DNI \ncomplained about this requirement, saying it would take months to make \nthis determination, that they couldn't determine in advance what such a \nprocedure would say. In other words, even as the administration sought \nand obtained broad new authorities to collect communications of \nAmericans, the administration refused to even consider when it might be \nviolating the Constitution.\n  If the administration can't assure us that they respect the \nConstitution, Congress needs to step in. For all their promises that \nreverse targeting is not occurring, the record is clear there is \nnothing to stop it, and the administration has resisted establishing \nprocedures to protect the rights of Americans. At the same time, it has \nsought to remove the FISA Court's ability to protect those rights.\n  This bill denies the FISA Court any role whatsoever in determining or \nmonitoring why a person overseas has been wiretapped, which, of course, \nwould help indicate whether the Government is conducting reverse \ntargeting of an American. The bill denies the court the ability to \nmonitor what becomes of the communications of Americans that are \ncollected.\n  Mr. President, it is clear this administration won't protect the \nconstitutional rights of Americans, and unfortunately, in the PAA, \nCongress passed legislation denying the courts any oversight role. It \nis critical Congress act to remedy this great problem. We have a unique \nopportunity to protect the Constitution and stop abuses before they \nhappen. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it appears there is no opposition to it, but \nnonetheless I will retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so that I may call up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3912 to Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3912.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3912.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the requirements for certifications made prior to \n                the initiation of certain acquisitions)\n\n       On page 10 between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       ``(vii) the acquisition of the contents (as that term is \n     defined in section 2510(8) of title 18, United States Code)) \n     of any communication is limited to communications to which \n     any party is an individual target (which shall not be limited \n     to known or named individuals) who is reasonably believed to \n     be located outside of the United States, and a significant \n     purpose of the acquisition of the communications of the \n     target is to obtain foreign intelligence information; and\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment ensures that in \nimplementing the new authorities provided in this bill, the Government \nis acquiring the communications of targets in whom it has some foreign \nintelligence interest and is not conducting bulk collection of all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas. This amendment \nwas also approved by the Judiciary Committee.\n  This amendment is necessary because of the vast and overbroad \nauthorities provided by the PAA and this bill. In public testimony, the \nDNI stated that the PAA would authorize the bulk collection of all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas. Now, that could \ncover every communication between Americans inside the United States \nand Europe or South America or the entire world. It could also include \na communication between Americans overseas and their family and friends \nback home.\n  This bill is understood to allow the warrantless targeting of a \nterrorist suspect overseas even when that person is communicating with \nan American at home. The bill does not simply apply to terrorist \nsuspects, however. It permits warrantless collection of communications \nbetween law-abiding Americans and people overseas who are not suspected \nof doing anything wrong at all. That is a problem that needs to be \naddressed. But this bill does not just allow the targeting of \nconversations of people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing; this \nbill actually allows the Government to capture all international \ncommunications to or from the United States in bulk, for no good \nreason. I think it is safe to say no one in this country expects that \nall of their international communications can be collected by the \nGovernment. That kind of communications dragnet would offend anyone who \nhas ever communicated with friends, family, or professional associates \nin other countries. It raises serious constitutional questions. It \nwould completely overwhelm the already inadequate minimization \nprocedures that are the only bump in the road to completely \nuncontrolled dissemination of information about Americans. And there \nwould be no court oversight whatsoever.\n  Bulk collection poses yet another serious constitutional danger. By \ncollecting all international communications, the Government would be \ncollecting communications between Americans overseas and their friends \nand family back home.\n  Senators Wyden and, Whitehouse and I have fought hard to ensure that \nAmericans overseas cannot be intentionally targeted without a warrant, \nbut bulk collection is a backdoor way to conduct the same warrantless \nwiretapping. Imagine the number of Americans' communications, not with \nforeigners but with other Americans--with other Americans, Mr. \nPresident--that would be acquired by the Government through bulk \ncollection of, say, communications between the United States and \nBritain. That means Americans studying and working abroad, tourists \npassing through, and even U.S. troops stationed there.\n  Nothing--nothing--would prevent their communications from being \ncollected and retained, and nothing would prevent those communications \nfrom being disseminated so long as the Government decided there was \nforeign intelligence value.\n  I ask my colleagues: At what point do we draw the line? At what point \ndoes the Constitution mean something? I am sure some of my colleagues \nwill say we should trust the Government not to do this, not to abuse \nthis. Yet the DNI has testified that while bulk collection is not \nneeded:\n\n       It would certainly be desirable, if it was physically \n     possible to do so.\n\n  This is not a short-term piece of legislation. It is not reassuring \nthat the intelligence community cannot currently collect all \ninternational communication. This bill does not sunset for years. What \nis technically possible in this area changes rapidly. Given the \npotential impact on the privacy and constitutional rights of Americans \nposed by bulk collection, Congress needs to act now. The DNI has put us \non notice that bulk collection is both authorized and, in his words, \ndesirable. Legislative silence on this issue is consent. This body must \ntake a position on this issue. Should the Government be able to sweep \nup all international communications involving Americans at home and \nabroad? We cannot avoid that question. The bill, combined with the \nDNI's comments, places it squarely before us.\n  The amendment I have offered here is extremely modest. It merely \nrequires the Government to certify to the court\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nthat in using these broad new authorities to conduct warrantless \nsurveillance, it is collecting the communications of foreign targets \nfrom whom it expects to obtain foreign intelligence information. The \nGovernment does not have to explain its foreign intelligence interests \nto the Court; it does not even have to identify its target. It merely \nhas to say that an interest exists, and the court cannot challenge this \ncertification. Because this amendment is so modest, opponents have \nraised an absurd hypothetical argument against it, and this is what it \nis: that it would somehow prevent the collection of communications into \nor out of an enemy-occupied city that the U.S. military is about to \ninvade.\n  This argument is plain silly. My amendment requires that there be a \nforeign intelligence purpose for collection. This hypothetical posited \nby opponents of the amendment--and all individuals in a city our troops \nare about to invade would clearly have foreign intelligence value. That \nis what distinguished this case, in which the Government can easily \nmake the certification required by the amendment and, on the other \nhand, the bulk collection of all communications between, say, the \nUnited States and Europe.\n  The reason absurd scenarios such as this have been raised as \n``unforeseen consequences'' is that opponents of this amendment do not \nwant to address the consequences of not passing it, the consequences of \nthe Government collecting all communications between the United States \nand Canada or Europe or South America, the consequences of millions of \ninnocent Americans' communications being collected, the consequences of \nalready inadequate minimization procedures being overwhelmed by the \ncollection.\n  These are not even unforeseen consequences. The DNI testified that if \nthis were physically possible, bulk collection would certainly be \ndesirable. The DNI envisions a country where the Government, if it were \ntechnologically feasible, would listen in on every international phone \ncall made by its citizens and read every international e-mail. That is \na police state, not the United States of America.\n  This amendment will help put to rest another concern that has been \nexpressed about this legislation. In August, after the enactment of the \nPAA, the DNI stated:\n\n       Now, there is a sense that we are doing massive data \n     mining. In fact, what we are doing is surgical. A telephone \n     number is surgical. So if you know what the number is, you \n     can select it out.\n\n  And the DNI then added:\n\n       We have got a lot of territory to make up with people \n     believing that we are doing things that we are not doing.\n\n  The best way to assure Americans that the Government is not doing \nmassive data mining of their international communications is not to \nauthorize the massive collection of their international communications. \nThe DNI cannot have it both ways. He cannot complain that people \nbelieve the Government is doing things it is not doing, and then oppose \namendments to the law that would prohibit the Government from doing \nthose very same things, especially when he has also said that bulk \ncollection would be ``desirable'' if it were physically possible.\n  Finally, my amendment would help resolve a serious constitutional \nquestion surrounding this bill. When Americans are on the line, the \nconstitutionality of the surveillance depends in part on how it is \nconducted. Bulk collection of millions of Americans' communications of \nwhich the Government has no interest in the person on the other end of \nthe line could very well be unreasonable under the fourth amendment. We \ncan eliminate this particular constitutional problem with the adoption \nof this very modest amendment.\n  I challenge anyone who opposes this amendment to stand up on this \nfloor and explain to the American people why the Government should have \nthe authority to engage in bulk collection of their private \ncommunications. Let's tell the American people the truth for once. Do \nnot rely on hypothetical, unintended consequences that are easily \nanswered. Explain why this very modest protection of the privacy of our \ncitizens cannot be granted.\n  I believe this amendment brings this bill into line with its actual \nintent. It gives Congress a say in how far these vast new authorities \nwill be taken, and it protects the civil liberties of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.) The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not here for all of my \ncolleague's descriptions of his two amendments. But let me make one \nthing clear. What he is laying out is a scenario that does not exist. \nHe is raising all kinds of concerns that are dealt with in the \nunderlying bill. They are dealt with by the Constitution of the United \nStates. They were dealt with by the Protect America Act.\n  I can assure the American public that we are not collecting all of \nthe communications they send overseas and reading them and listening to \nthem and using them in some way that violates the fourth amendment or \nthe provisions of these two measures.\n  Before we actually have a vote on these measures, we will talk about \nthem more in detail. I think he raised the reverse targeting amendment \nfirst. Let me be clear and explain that you cannot target a person \ninside the United States without a court order. All acquisitions must \ncomply with the fourth amendment.\n  Last week we agreed to an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy which \nensures that the authorities in this bill will not be used to acquire \ncommunications where the sender and all intended recipients are known \nto be in the United States. That has to be with a FISA Court order if \nyou are targeting somebody in the United States. This is an explicit, \nbright-line prohibition against reverse targeting in the current bill. \nIf one would look at page 6 of the statute, section 703(b)(2), I will \nread it for you. It says:\n\n       An acquisition authorized under subsection (a) may not \n     intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States if the purpose of such \n     acquisition is to target a particular known person reasonably \n     believed to be in the United States except in accordance with \n     title I or title III.\n\n  It does not get much clearer than that. So if the purpose in \ntargeting someone outside the United States is actually to target a \nperson inside the United States, you cannot use the authorities under \nthis bill. It is clear. That is what the DNI stated his purpose was; \nthat is what the bill provides. You have to get a FISA Court order if \nyou are targeting somebody. You cannot do it by the back door.\n  Now, I heard yesterday some far-out explanations that a family whose \nchild goes overseas to go to school, we would be listening in on those \nconversations. That is absolutely nonsense. If that is a United States \nperson, we could not even target that United States person abroad, and \nwe certainly do not target someone in the United States without a court \norder. We have provisions to assure that the United States person who \ngoes overseas cannot be targeted without an application to the FISA \nCourt. Quite simply put, that does not happen.\n  Now, if somebody is calling a suspected terrorist overseas, one on \nwhom we have initiated collection because of intelligence sources \ncertified by the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence, this person has significant terrorist information, \nsignificant intelligence information, foreign intelligence information, \nif one were to call that number, then it is possible, it is likely, and \nwe would expect that they would find out what is in that call.\n  If it is an innocent call, if it has nothing to do with terrorist \nactivity, it is immediately suppressed; ``minimized'' is the term. They \ndo not even record the name of the United States person.\n  But when calls come from outside the United States into the United \nStates from a person, a known terrorist abroad, or when they initiate \nthe call, someone from the United States does, then what we must do is \nfind out if they are talking about planned terrorist activity in the \nUnited States. That is the most important collection we can make. We \nhave lots of important information targeting foreign terrorists, \nsuspected terrorists, foreign intelligence targets overseas that is \nuseful to our allies in protecting their countries. There are lots of \ninstances where we have done that or when they\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nare--and that does not require minimization, and it should not. But the \ninformation that is used is only that information which applies to a \ndirect threat, a terrorist threat, or other significant foreign \nintelligence value. If a United States person is involved in that, if \nthere is an involvement of the terror plot in the United States or \nelsewhere, then that information would be accepted, and if it is \nnecessary to collect further against that American citizen or United \nStates person, then they have to go through the normal procedure. \nProbably the FBI would get their normal search warrant and go after \nthat person and determine what role, if any, he or she has in carrying \nout terrorist activity. So in addition to the bright-line test, there \nis clear oversight authority. There is oversight exercised by the \nsupervisors at NSA, by the inspector general, by the Department of \nJustice, whose lawyers oversee it, and by our Intelligence Committee to \nmake sure that the prohibitions on reverse targeting are being \nobserved.\n  If this proposal were to be accepted, the uncertainty, the \noperational uncertainty of determining what a purpose is in reverse \ntargeting would make this an impossible situation for an analyst to \nobserve and to make that determination. There is a clear prohibition \nagainst reverse targeting.\n  The other amendment which he brought up, 3912, is on bulk collection. \nThe bipartisan Intelligence bill contains numerous provisions to ensure \nthat acquisitions targeting foreign terrorists overseas--that is \nforeign terrorists overseas--comply with the fourth amendment and \nfollow court-approved targeting. It gives clear protection, as I said \nearlier, against reverse targeting.\n  The amendment that has been proposed under 3912 has some very \nnegative consequences for protecting our troops abroad. This amendment, \nfor example, would prevent the intelligence community from targeting a \nparticular group of buildings or geographic area where, for example, \nterrorist activity is known to be occurring, and preventing them from \ncollecting signals intelligence prior to operations by our Armed \nForces.\n  If there is an area which has significant terrorist activity, to say \nwe cannot collect all of the communications coming out of that area to \nidentify who the terrorists might be, whether there are innocent \npersons involved before our military goes in, does not make any sense, \nbecause if we send our military in, they are going in and probably \ngoing to be using significant lethal force. Had this bulk collection \nprovision been in place, it would have prevented our troops from \nconducting surveillance in Fallujah, for example, prior to their \nmilitary operations.\n\n  The details on this are classified. We can provide more information \nin a secure setting. But this amendment, according to the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the Attorney General, ``could have serious \nconsequences on our ability to collect necessary foreign intelligence \ninformation, including information vital to conducting military \noperations abroad and protecting the lives of our servicemembers, and \nit is unacceptable.'' I agree with them because I have had the \nopportunity to learn how the system operates. My colleague from \nWisconsin has. I believe it is very clear from the information we have \nreceived and the knowledge we have about it that the evils which he \npurports to address are evils that do not exist. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose both amendments.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is sort of odd that we are debating these two \namendments together. But there is one advantage. Under our system of \ngovernment, the way we make sure that abuses don't occur is by passing \nlaws to make it absolutely clear that abuses aren't occurring and can't \noccur. We are supposed to accept the say-so of one Senator who says we \nare not doing these things. We are not conducting bulk collection. We \nare not doing reverse targeting so don't worry. Yet he resists two \namendments that simply make it clear you can't do these things. What is \nthe objection on the merits to these two amendments? They would apply \nto an administration that initiated an illegal wiretapping program in \ndisregard of the statutes. We have reason to believe that maybe they \nwould do things we don't know about and don't like and don't think are \nlegal, but we are supposed to simply take the word of one Senator \ninstead of passing a law to clearly protect the American people.\n  With regard to reverse targeting, the Senator asserts that somehow \nhaving a provision that says ``the'' purpose would have to be targeting \nan American before a court order is required is going to protect us. \nBut that doesn't protect us. That language would mean that any \nincidental reason for targeting a foreign person when the government \nwants to listen to the American would be a sufficient basis for ongoing \nwarrantless surveillance of the American. In fact, the Senator from \nGeorgia has indicated that what this means is that the sole purpose of \nthe collection would have to be to obtain information on the American \nbefore a court order is required. If that is true, then it would be \nvery easy for the government to bootstrap any incidental interest in a \nforeign target so that they can listen in on an American.\n  The DNI has said that reverse targeting is unconstitutional. What is \nthe legitimate objection to making it absolutely clear that this can't \nbe done in this statute? There is no substantive objection. The same \nthing goes for bulk collection. Again, one Senator assures the American \npeople that the government is not doing bulk collection. That might be \nright. We may not be doing it now. But the DNI has said it would be \ndesirable. He would love to do it. Yet the Senator will not permit a \nsimple amendment that says that something that the DNI has also said is \nnot actually needed but would raise serious constitutional problems, \nshould be prohibited.\n  This is an amazing moment. Instead of legislating, we are supposed to \ntrust. With regard to all of our international communication, we are \nsupposed to simply trust one Senator's assurance that there is nothing \nto worry about. I suggest the American people deserve better than that.\n  To show the complete lack of content to these arguments, I addressed \nwhat the Senator, who was not out here at the time, has called the \nFallujah example. He keeps saying that under this provision, you \ncouldn't get information about what was going on in Fallujah when we \nwere attacking al-Qaida and others there. That is absolutely false. I \nlaid it out. As long as the Government says there is a foreign \nintelligence information purpose, of course they can do it. If there is \na terrorist hotbed, they can do it. They just have to assert that. This \nargument that somehow this would interfere with that collection flies \ndirectly in the face of the bill and the amendment. There is no truth \nto that argument at all. The amendment is absolutely clear in cases of \nconflict, where the government merely needs to assert that it has a \nforeign intelligence purpose for conducting surveillance in that area. \nIn that situation, the purpose is clear.\n  Because of the floor situation, the arguments related to these two \namendments have merged, but it sort of works in a way because both of \nthem are such straightforward, simple protections that a majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee agreed had to be included in this bill to \nprotect the rights of the American people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are quite a few things I disagree with \nthat my colleague from Wisconsin has brought up. No. 1, he said the \nadministration instituted an illegal wiretapping program. That is not \ntrue. That is wrong. I reviewed the documents on which they based it--\narticle II, and the authorization for use of military force. That was \nnot an illegal effort. But that is a debate for another time. The \nadministration did advise the leaders of Congress what they were going \nto do. The big eight were advised, and they did not deem any \nlegislation advisable at the time.\n  Secondly, he gives me too much credit in saying it is only the word \nof one Senator that his amendments are unworkable and unnecessary. This \nwas brought up and debated in the Intelligence Committee. We spend our \ntime overseeing intelligence collection. It was not adopted there. It \nwas withdrawn.\n  If my colleague has any evidence that there are any violations in \nreverse\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\ntargeting or bulk collection of the fourth amendment of the \nConstitution or other violation of privacy rights, then I suggest he \nbring them up in our Intelligence Committee in closed session where we \ncan debate all the activities that are going on. I assume he has been \nout to NSA to see how it operates. He has been in and had the \nopportunity to question leaders of the intelligence community. He says \nthere is a total lack of substance. I have to say there is a total lack \nof substance to the allegations he makes. There are legitimate concerns \nwhich we address in this bill by specifically prohibiting reverse \ntargeting. It is specifically prohibited in this bill. I have to say \nthe people who run the program are the ones who have told us the \nadditional bells and whistles he wants to put on for no reason or even \nreasonable prospect of violations would make it impossible to carry out \nthe business of collection on foreign terrorists with potential \nactivities in the United States.\n  Again, there will be others who will discuss this. But it is not the \nword of one Senator. It is the word of a majority of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and it is the word of the intelligence community itself, \nbacked up by the Attorney General, that this is unwise, unnecessary, \nthat these amendments would significantly hamper the ability of the \nintelligence community to conduct its operations.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Briefly, Mr. President, it is important to put in the \nRecord that the Judiciary Committee, after carefully considering this \nnot just in the context of intelligence--and I do serve on the \nIntelligence Committee as well--but in the context of the relationship \nbetween intelligence and civil liberties, came to the opposite \nconclusion on both reverse targeting and bulk collection and voted by a \nmajority to adopt the very sort of amendments I am proposing. With \nregard to the vice chairman's assertion that I had not put forward any \nconcerns about the impact of these authorities on the civil liberties \nof Americans, I, in fact, sent a classified letter to the DNI in \nDecember expressing serious concerns about the implementation of the \nProtect America Act and its effect on the rights of Americans. I can't \ndiscuss classified specifics here. But the fact is, these aren't merely \ntheoretical concerns.\n  One final point: The thrust of our concern about reverse targeting \nand bulk collection doesn't have to do necessarily with what has \nalready occurred but what could occur, what abuses could occur if we do \nnot clarify in the law that they should not be done. This is especially \nimportant in light of the fact that, as I have indicated, the Director \nof National Intelligence has said it would be desirable to do this bulk \ncollection. If the DNI says that, wouldn't that be a reason to be a \nlittle concerned and to make sure it is clearly prohibited?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3907\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to inquire as to how we are to \nproceed. I was asked to offer my amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Feingold regarding striking the language dealing with immunity \nin the bill. I don't want to interrupt the debate. I don't know how we \nought to proceed. Is this debate concluded? I will check with the \nauthor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so I may offer the Dodd-Feingold amendment dealing with \nretroactive immunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me inform my colleagues that what I intend to do is not \nto speak at length. I know under the previous time agreement, there are \n2 hours allocated to this amendment. My intention this evening is to \nuse probably 10 or 15 minutes of debate on this amendment. I see my \ncolleague from Washington. I don't know if she has an intention to \naddress the Senate on this matter or something else. I am going to take \n10 or 15 minutes to talk about the amendment and then reserve the \nremainder of my time for tomorrow. There are other Members who would \nlike to be heard on this amendment. I don't want to consume too much of \nthe time to deny others the opportunity to be heard. I presume my \ncolleague from Wisconsin tomorrow may want some time. I will take a \nbrief amount of time this evening and then reserve the balance until \nlater. Then my colleague from Washington can certainly be heard or \nanyone else for that matter.\n  I send to the desk an amendment offered by myself and Senator \nFeingold, and Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Harkin, Wyden, Sanders, Obama, \nBiden, and Clinton and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Sanders, Mr. Obama, Mr. Biden, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3907.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provisions providing immunity from civil \n  liability to electronic communication service providers for certain \n                 assistance provided to the Government)\n\n       Strike title II.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment we have talked about at \nlength over the last number of weeks going back into December. This is \na striking amendment to strike the language in the bill out of the \nIntelligence Committee that would provide for retroactive immunity to \nthe telecom industry. It has been debated at length. This amendment \nstrikes that language in the bill, conforms it to what has been adopted \nby the other body in its legislation dealing with the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act suggestions and recommendations, and \nconforms it to what has been included in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nbill. So while there have been three different committees that have \nreported their suggestions to the Congress on this issue, the \ncommittees in the House of Representatives and one committee here have \nreached different conclusions than that of the Intelligence Committee, \nwhere they have recommended that retroactive immunity be granted to the \ntelecom industry for having kept over the last 5 years sort of a \nvacuum-cleaner approach to telephone conversations, faxes, e-mails that \nhave been engaged in by Americans across the board.\n  This goes back immediately to after 9/11. As I said, had this been a \ntemporary deviation from the norm, particularly in the wake of 9/11, I \nwould not be standing here asking that retroactive immunity not be \ngranted. But this program went on for 5 years. It only came to an end \nbecause of a revelation by whistleblowers and others that the program \nstop. This was 5 years of collecting data and information on U.S. \ncitizens without a court order.\n  The FISA Court was established back in 1978 specifically to provide \nfor warrants and court orders when such information was being solicited \nand needed to provide for the security of our country. I think these \namendments that we need to update the FISA legislation are critically \nimportant, and I certainly want to see them adopted. But I believe it \nis going way beyond the pale in the midst of all this to extend \nretroactive immunity back to a group of companies that decided this was \nan appropriate request and they were going to comply with it. I would \npoint out to my colleagues that not all companies did. If every single \ncompany complied with this, you might make the case that there was \nsomething going on that required, or certainly warranted, their \ndecision to agree to this invasion of privacy without a court order. \nThere were companies that said: No, we will not comply with that \nrequest absent a court order. That court order was never forthcoming \nand those companies did not engage, to the best of our knowledge, in \nthe collection of this data and information.\n\n  Now I am not drawing the conclusion--but I have my opinions about \nthis--as to whether what the companies did was legal or illegal. That \nis not a matter for 51 of us here by a majority vote to decide. That is \na matter for which the courts exist in this country. It is not a matter \nfor the executive branch to decide. It is why we have three coequal \nbranches of Government.\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nWhen matters such as this arise, raising the legality of certain \nactions, then that matter ought to be appropriately decided by that \nthird coequal branch of Government, as the Framers intended, in exactly \nthese kinds of cases; that is, the matter to determine whether those \nwho are suggesting that these telephone companies did exactly what they \nshould have done under the circumstances. There are many here and \nelsewhere who believe otherwise, and while short of reaching a \ndetermination as to legality, believe that the courts ought to make \nthat determination.\n  There are some 40 cases now pending before the courts on this very \nmatter. If we take the action adopted by the Intelligence Committee, we \nwill never, ever know whether these actions were legal, whether the \nprivacy of millions and millions of Americans were invaded. Once we \nhave set the precedent of allowing this retroactive immunity to go \nforward, why not then in other areas outside of the case of \ntelecommunications? What about medical records? What about financial \nrecords? The Congress will have voted that it is all right to grant \nretroactive immunity. The next time an American President asks these \ncompanies or other companies to engage in similar activities, why not \nuse the precedent established by the telecommunications industry to \ncomply with that request absent a court order?\n  These are critical moments involving the rule of law--the rule of \nlaw--not the whim of a President, any President. Given the pattern of \nbehavior of this administration over the last 6 or 7 years, in example \nafter example where there has been a disregard, in my view, of the rule \nof law and the Constitution of the United States, what more does this \nbody need to understand in this matter than to once again grant this \nadministration a pass and in effect say to those companies: It doesn't \nmake any difference. We don't know whether what you did was legal, but \nyou get a pass on this right now. I think nothing could be more \ndangerous than to allow that precedent to go forward without us \ninsisting that the courts be allowed to exercise their judgment in \nthese matters.\n  There are arguments that have been raised on why we shouldn't let \nthis happen. One: It might hurt these companies financially. That \nargument is so offensive I hesitate to make it even on behalf of those \nwho would argue it. The idea that some financial injury is far more \nimportant than the rule of law ought to be offensive to every American, \nwhether you agree or disagree with whether these companies did the \nright thing, or somehow that these companies had no idea what they were \ndoing; they went along with this because an American President asked \nfor it.\n  I would point out that in 1978, during the drafting of the FISA \nlegislation, many of these companies were directly involved in the \ndrafting of that legislation. They knew exactly what the law is in this \narea. I would further point out that it has been reported to the press \nthat there have been more than 18,000 requests of FISA Courts over the \nlast 30 years when it has come to these kinds of inquiries. In all but \n5 cases, out of the more than 18,000 requests, the FISA Courts have \ncomplied with executive branch requests for warrants to invade or to \nengage in surveillance activities. Only in 5 cases were they rejected, \nout of more than 18,000 requests. That is better than 99.9 percent of \nthe cases. Why not in this one? Why were the courts not solicited to \nprovide the kind of approval for the court orders that would have \nallowed for this surveillance to go forward? It is not a minor point. \nIt is a huge point.\n  I would further point out that the administration, of course, \noriginally requested that immunity be granted not only to the \ntelecommunications industry but everyone involved in this matter. \nThanks to the wisdom of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, that \nbroad request was rejected, and I thank them for it. But it is \nimportant that our colleagues understand that that is what they wanted \nto do; They wanted total immunity for everyone involved in this 5-year \nplan. But the committee wisely rejected that request and narrowed the \nimmunity only to the telecommunications industry. But nonetheless, I \nthink all of us understand the net effect. If we grant retroactive \nimmunity as requested by this legislation, then we will never get to \nthe bottom of what occurred here, and once again, opening the door to \npossible future violations.\n  It is being suggested by some: Well, this is just a bunch of \nDemocrats going after a Republican administration. I will tell my \ncolleagues that if this were a Democratic administration, I would be \nstanding here with as much passion as I am today. This is not about \nRepublicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives; it is about the \nrule of law. It is about the Constitution of the United States. All of \nus here, regardless of political ideology or what party we affiliate \nwith, this is a matter that transcends all of that. We ought to--as we \nhave sworn to do when we raised our right hand in the well of this \nbody, as each one of us has here as Members of this institution--\nprotect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Nothing less \nthan that is being asked of us when we vote on this matter: to strike \nthis provision and allow the courts to do their work; to determine \nwhether, as those who are advocating for retroactive immunity assert, \nthat this was an appropriate and proper response by these companies, or \nto draw the different conclusion that it was not and that it was \ninappropriate, illegal, and improper for them to do what they have \ndone; and that all other bodies in this country, private or otherwise, \nneed to understand when this administration or any administration makes \na similar request in the future, the Congress has spoken on this \nmatter, so that they do so only when they receive those kinds of court \norders and then provide that kind of immunity which, in every single \ncase in the past, they have when the court order has been approved by \nthe FISA Courts. That is the sum and substance of this debate.\n\n  There are various other arguments for immunity, including the \nargument that somehow you can't protect private information. As one \nFederal judge has already pointed out--I might point out a Republican \nappointee to the bench--what are we all hiding from? We all know this \nwent on. This is not some secret. We all know that for 5 years or more, \nthis information was being vacuumed up. That is no longer a secret. \nWhat is potentially a secret is how this was done--methods and means--\nand I appreciate those who want to make sure that we don't allow for \nthe revelation of that kind of information. But there are ample \nexamples of how the Federal courts have handled these matters in the \npast, acting in a way that protects this kind of information. The \nsuggestion that this is too dangerous to allow these matters to go \nforward I don't think is a valid argument, particularly when you are \ngoing to sweep across retroactive immunity. There are plenty of \nexamples. In fact, I would note that the Presiding Officer--I don't \nknow this, but I presume in his previous life as an attorney general--\nfaced matters in his own State where certain private information had to \nbe kept private and secret and there were matters before the courts \nbefore which he operated where that was exactly the case. I have \nlistened to other attorneys general cite examples where there was \nprivacy and other information that did not belong in the public domain \nand was protected. So the argument that somehow we can't run the risk \nof allowing the Federal courts to handle these matters given the \nrevelation of information that otherwise shouldn't be in the public \ndomain--I don't buy that argument either. But those are the arguments \nfor having retroactive immunity on this legislation.\n  I have spoken at great length about this in the past and I appreciate \nthe indulgence of the chairman and others to listen to me over and over \nagain on this subject matter. But this is a matter I care deeply about \nand I know others do too. This is not a Democrat standing up here \ntrying to cause trouble for a Republican administration. That is an \noffensive argument. I think we know each other well enough to respect \nand understand that these are serious debates and serious arguments. \nThe tension that has existed for the life of our great Republic is this \ndebate today, how do we protect the rights and liberties of our \nAmerican citizens and simultaneously protect our people from those who \nwould do us great harm and injury. It is not an easy debate; I \nunderstand that. But it is one that is as old as our Republic, to make \nsure\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nthat we maintain those rights and liberties while simultaneously \nfulfilling that obligation to protect our citizens from those who would \ndo us great harm. I believe the tension is such that I don't believe we \nwant to give up these rights, these important systems we put in place. \nIn fact, the very FISA Courts as they exist were designed to \nspecifically address that balance more than 30 years ago, and I believe \non some 30 different occasions over the years we have amended the FISA \nlegislation to allow us to stay current with technologies that could be \nused against us as well as allowing those technologies that allow us \ngreater opportunity to learn about those who would do us harm. So over \nthe years we have made those recommendations. Almost unanimously--and I \nbelieve I am correct in that assessment--previous Congresses have \nadopted those recommendations and suggestions. To suggest, as was done \nhere, that because of Senator Feingold's amendments dealing with \nreverse targeting and bulk collections, that somehow we are violating \nthat history, I think is wrong. I think those suggestions are \nworthwhile and warranted, and it can improve not only what we are doing \ntechnologically in this bill, but also fulfilling the second part of \nthat obligation, and that is to protect the rights of our citizenry.\n  It is truly a false dichotomy to suggest that we can only become more \nsecure by giving up rights. I think that is a very dangerous argument \nto make. Too many in this country are subscribing to it today. That is \nexactly the opposite of what the case ought to be: that we become more \nsecure when we insist upon those rights and liberties. That has been \nthe history of our great country. In every single example I can think \nof when we have allowed our rights to be shortchanged to the argument \nof security, we look back historically and regret those moments. When \nwe think about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II \nand other examples, I think all of us look back and regret those \nmoments, if we did anything but give our country more security. We have \nhad great moments when we stood up for the rights and liberties of our \nfellow citizens in the face of arguments that our security was in \njeopardy if we didn't somehow tailor those rights and liberties to give \nus additional security. I think that is the same argument today. I \nthink we will be a proud body by rejecting this piece of the bill \nbefore us, allowing the courts to do their job as the Framers intended \nthem to do, to determine the legality of the actions taken by these \ncompanies at the request of this administration, to allow them to make \nthat decision, not by some vote in this body that would allow these \nmatters to be swept aside for all of history without ever knowing \nwhether we did great damage to the rights and liberties of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I will make additional arguments here tomorrow, but I want to reserve \ntime because here we are on Super Tuesday and a lot of people are not \nhere who want to engage in this debate. So I will reserve the remainder \nof my time so that others can be heard on this matter when it comes up \neither tomorrow or whenever the matter comes back to the floor. But I \nappreciate the managers of this legislation giving me a few minutes to \nmake my case on this issue. I have said so many times before, and I \nwill say again, Jay Rockefeller and Kit Bond are very good friends of \nmine. I have great admiration for these men. We have served a long time \ntogether here. They don't have an easy job. This is a very difficult \ncommittee to have to work on, given the difficult matters they are \nfaced with. I am sure they understand that my objections are not about \nour friendship or my respect for the work they do, but about a \nfundamental disagreement. I admire what they are trying to do, I \nrespect the job they have been asked to do, and I thank them for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut for \nthe kind words. We are delighted to have him back, although some would \nwish that he were otherwise occupied tonight. But we welcome him back \nand welcome him to the debate. I express my appreciation for the kind \nwords he said about me in Iowa. It didn't do much good in Iowa, but I \nalways appreciate them.\n  On this debate, however, I respectfully say that my good friend, with \nwhom I have worked on many measures and intend to work with on many \nmore, is dead wrong. He is correct that the FISA law was passed in \n1978, but the problem is it has been superseded by technological \nchanges. The technology of transmission of signals changed \nsignificantly. He probably was not here when I mentioned it earlier, \nbut when the terrorists struck on 9/11, there was a question of how we \ncould prevent further attacks that were planned and some of them were \nunder way. The appropriate intelligence community officials recommended \nelectronic surveillance and noted that since the laws had not changed, \nbut technology had changed, it was quite likely that FISA, as it \nexisted from 1978, even with minor tweaks, would not accommodate the \ncollection that was needed. The intelligence community leaders and the \nadministration leaders addressed this with the Gang of 8, the leaders \nof both parties, both Houses, and both sides of leadership on the \nIntelligence Committees, and they concluded that there was not time to \nchange the law, so the President went ahead, using his article II \npowers as enhanced by the authorization for the use of military force. \nThe President issued orders and, for the most part, the Attorney \nGeneral signed off on it when he was available. The Director of \nNational Intelligence issued them, and companies, understanding the \nurgency of providing collection against foreign terrorists--this was \ndirected against foreign terrorists calling into the United States--\ncomplied.\n  Now, the fact that one or two may not have complied speaks no praise \nfor those companies, because if they failed to comply with what I have \nreviewed and believe to be valid orders of the Federal Government, and \nas a result, communications that might have tipped off an imminent \nattack on the United States of America were missed, then it would be a \ngreat shame for those companies.\n  Now, I cannot speak for the other body. I do say that the Judiciary \nCommittee, which has broad jurisdiction over many important things--and \nI respect the leadership of that Committee--doesn't spend the time that \nwe in the Intelligence Committee do on intelligence matters--going out \nto NSA, having people come before us, being briefed, going through \nlaboriously technical operations that allow these searches and \nsurveillance, and going through and listening and observing the means \nof assuring that these functions are carried out in compliance not only \nwith constitutional directions but the regulations and the statutes of \nthe United States is very important. We have seen the oversight. There \nis the supervisor and the inspector general who act as an independent \ncheck; the Department of Justice lawyers who come and review it from \ntheir standpoint; but also the Intelligence Committees in both Houses, \nwhich have not only the right but the responsibility to oversee this.\n  Based on that, our committee determined and reported out a measure \nsaying it was absolutely essential for the continued security of this \ncountry to eliminate lawsuits that had been filed against a number of \ncarriers alleging that they may have participated in this activity.\n  Now, why is that a problem? Well, today, we had open hearings \ninvolving the DNI, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, \nthe Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Deputy \nSecretary of State for the INR Division. We asked all of them why it \nwas essential that they provide retroactive liability protection.\n  The first and most important concern raised was that allowing these \nlawsuits to continue against the company--my colleague from Connecticut \nis right. We permit cases to go forward against the Government or \nGovernment officials. We are just protecting private companies. It is \nthe pleadings, the discovery, and the testimony that would inevitably \ntell us, and the terrorists, much more about the operations of the \nprogram than the terrorists ought to know. In May of 2006, after the \ndisclosures of this terrorist surveillance, GEN Mike Hayden came before \nour committee for confirmation. I asked him: What impact has the \ndisclosure of our terrorist surveillance\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nprogram had on the collection of intelligence from foreign terrorists \nand suspected terrorists? He smiled and said, ruefully: We are applying \nthe Darwinian theory to terrorists. We are only collecting the dumb \nones.\n  I can assure you the people we want to listen in to are the very \nclever, very witty, very diabolical, murderous heads of al-Qaida and \nother terrorist organizations who want to do great bodily harm to the \nUnited States. They think, what we can do to tell them more about it, \nwhich would tell them how to evade even the means of collection that we \nhave left available, that would leave our intelligence community deaf \nand blind to threats not only to this country, which is most important \nto all of us but to our allies and our troops overseas.\n  All the heads of the intelligence agencies I mentioned said one of \nthe most important things we can do is provide this retroactive \nliability protection because, without it, then the private carriers--\nthe telecom companies--will no longer participate voluntarily to \nrequests from Government entities. We have many areas where the \ntelecommunications companies work with the Federal Government--whether \nit is tracking a missing child, tracking down a sex offender or, on \nanother level, breaking up a drug cartel or, on another level, \nprotecting against cyber attacks from other countries. If litigation is \nallowed to proceed against these companies, not only will it likely \ndescribe in detail the means that our intelligence community uses to \ncollect information, it will put the companies in such dire straits in \nterms of business reputation here and abroad that it will be a very \nserious blow to the shareholders, to the pension funds that own the \ncompanies, and it will lead the counsel for those companies to say: \nnever participate with the Federal Government again.\n  This could be a disaster for effective collection. I believe it was \nthe consensus of those present at our hearing today--the Director of \nthe FBI, the Director of CIA, the general in charge of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, Under Secretary in charge of INR, and Admiral \nMcConnell, the DNI--that retroactive liability protection for any \ncarriers that may have participated, as well as carriers that are \ngetting sued that didn't participate, that cannot exercise the state \nsecrets to protect them, it will ensure that we don't get protection, \ndon't get the cooperation from these telecommunications carriers when \nwe need it.\n  We have worked hard on this measure. After reviewing all the \ninformation available to us, including opinions and authorizations that \nwe reviewed in the executive office, the committee determined, on a \nstrong bipartisan basis, that the providers acted in good faith \npursuant to representations from the highest level of the Government, \nthat the TSP was lawful.\n  We worked hard to fashion a limited liability protection provision \nthat serves the dual purpose of ending the litigation against the \nproviders while allowing the cases against the Government to continue. \nGo ahead and attack the Government. There is no shortage of that in \nthis body. I have heard it previously earlier today. That is part of \nour role on a partisan basis. We exchange criticism of the other party \nand particularly the administration when it is of the other party. We \ncan make our best arguments. But we need to stop investigations, for \nexample, by State public utility commissions of the providers' conduct \nunder the TSP.\n  These investigations involve very sensitive, classified information \nthat no public service commission or public utility commission is \ncompetent to handle, maintaining the secrecy, the confidentiality we \nneed of our collection methods. We know this program has inflicted no \nharm on our citizenry and has protected us from harm.\n  I invite my colleagues, once again, to go to the fourth floor \nconfidential classified hearing room or come to the Intelligence \nCommittee's offices in Hart, if they want to see, from the Director of \nNational Intelligence, a list of things that have been accomplished \nunder the Protect America Act because collecting this electronic \ninformation is vitally important. It is right up there with \ninterviewing detainees--high-value detainees--in providing us our most \nvaluable information. To strike this provision of retroactive liability \nprotection from the bill would significantly lessen our ability to \ncollect intelligence and will make our country much less safe.\n  I ask that my colleagues vote against it. I will shortly yield time \nto my colleague and the chairman of the committee. At this point, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If the Senator will yield, it is very important for \na particular person on this floor to be able to, within the next 15 \nminutes--and for a particular reason--say some things that are very \nimportant to her, not on either of our pending amendments, the two \namendments you and I are about to offer.

Mr. President, understanding whatever it is that the \nSenator from Arizona decides he wants to do, there is a particular \nreason and a particular time constraint that the Senator from \nWashington has to speak now. That is why I asked that she be allowed to \nspeak in morning business. She will make that request, and I hope there \nwill be no objection to it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. But I would like \nto add that when the Senator from Washington has concluded her remarks, \nI be recognized for my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes and that the time not be counted \nagainst the debate on the FISA legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Stimulus Package\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about clean energy \nproduction tax credits, investment tax credits, and the energy \nefficiency provisions in the pending stimulus package, which I think \nare critical to restoring economic growth in America and continuing \nwhat is a burgeoning industry that is helping us create jobs and \neconomic stimulus across our country. We are talking about tax credits \nthat are a proven stimulus and business investment. They give \nconsumers, in this case, energy efficiency credits of up to $500 to \nmake energy efficiency improvements to their homes, which could save \nhomeowners as much as $800 per year in avoided energy costs. We are \ntalking about $20 billion of stimulus and 116,000 jobs that could be \nimpacted.\n  The bottom line is the renewable energy industry generated over $40 \nbillion of revenue in 2006 and accounted for 450,000 direct and \nindirect jobs last year. So we know that clean energy is one of the \nfastest growing sectors of our economy. But by failing to act when we \ndidn't pass these critical tax incentives last year, we caused \nturbulence in what is a very new and growing industry. And if the \nSenate rejects these incentives now, we could put this industry in a \ntailspin by not giving them predictability on their tax credits. That \nis why it is so important we pass the stimulus package tomorrow.\n  Let's talk about what we are hearing from some of those in the \nindustry who know this sector very well. The Alliance to Save Energy, a \ngroup of business, government, and consumer leaders, committed to \nseeing this country take advantage of cost savings from efficiency have \nsaid:\n\n       Energy efficiency tax incentives put money into the economy \n     by encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products and \n     services.\n\n  This group has representatives of this body as part of that alliance. \nTheir job is to advocate for policies to help this industry grow. What \nare we hearing from particular industries? I like this chart \nparticularly because so many of my colleagues--I do it, and so many on \nthe other side, and even the President of the United States speaks at \nthese various clean energy industry plant sites and advocate and are \nexcited about the jobs they create. But sometimes it stops there and \nafter the ribbon cutting they fail to support the necessary \npolicies. That is why recently a particular solar company CEO made this \nstatement:\n\n       The Senate can ensure that we keep the economic engine \n     moving forward and extend the solar tax credits as part of \n     the economic stimulus bill.\n\n  That is directly from the solar industry that we politicians like to \nstand in front of and talk about jobs being created. Here is somebody \nwho was the prop behind one of these events in the last week, and they \nare telling us to pass this tax credit in the stimulus package.\n  What are we hearing from a consortium of those in the industry? We \nare hearing from one consolidated report of the renewable industry that \nsaid:\n\n       Over 116,000 U.S. jobs, and nearly $19 billion--\n\n  This is just on solar, wind, and other renewable electricity \nsources--\n\n     nearly $19 billion in U.S. investment could be lost in one \n     year if renewable energy tax credits are not renewed by \n     Congress.\n\n  That report came out earlier this week.\n  The reason why people are so concerned about this is because what we \nhave seen traditionally--and we can see on this chart that in 2000, \n2002, and 2004 where we did not give predictability to this industry by \nsaying we are going to continue the tax credit policy--what happened is \na 93-percent drop in investment; in 2000. In 2002, a 73-percent drop in \ninvestment; and again in 2003, another 77-percent drop in investment.\n  Here is where this industry is now in 2007. It is a growing industry. \nAs I said, in 2006, it was $40 billion in revenue and over 450,000 \ndirect and indirect jobs. And we are about to kill this level of \ninvestment and put it into a tailspin by not continuing this tax \npolicy.\n  In fact, that is exactly what this solar industry CEO, who had the \npleasure of standing there with Governor Schwarzenegger and others, \nsaid. He said Federal tax credits for solar energy are about to expire. \nThey are about to expire and it will send the solar industry into a \ntailspin.\n  It doesn't have to get any clearer than that: CEOs of companies that \nare the backdrop of great press events telling us we are about to send \ntheir industries into a tailspin. I suggest we instead pass these tax \nincentives and get\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\non with what could be certainty in tax policy.\n  What I like about wind is the fact that it is happening in lots of \nplaces across this country, but it is also giving farmers a second \ncrop. Almost 200 members of the American Wind Energy Association have \nsent us a letter saying that ``companies in our industry are already \nreporting a decrease in investment as a result of the uncertainty \nsurrounding tax policy.'' They are saying they are already seeing \npeople starting to cancel projects.\n  We want to help our economy grow, and there is stimulus in these tax \nincentives, but I ask my colleagues to consider what is going to happen \nwhen they do not renew them. They are actually going to cause more \ndamage to the economy because people are going to start canceling \nprojects.\n  Let me explain. This same report by Navigant came out earlier this \nweek and got very specific as to which States had significant \ninvestment by renewable companies and exactly what was going to happen \nboth in the loss of opportunity for new jobs and in actually having \njobs cut when there is not predictability.\n  Texas, one of the biggest investors from a wind production side, \ncould lose a future opportunity and existing jobs of upwards of 23,000; \nColorado, 10,000; Illinois, 8,000; Oregon, 7,000; Minnesota, 6,000 \nplus; Washington State, nearly 5,000 jobs are at stake. The list goes \non to other States that have made incredible progress in renewable \nenergies that are creating jobs, and all these jobs are at stake for \nthe future and some of them represent jobs where people are getting a \npaycheck today. Instead, they will take our rebate check, if we pass \nthe House bill, and they will receive a pink slip because their jobs \nare not going to be there anymore. That is why we have to pass this \npackage.\n  In fact, I want to give examples of two specifics where people will \nactually lose jobs.\n  Noble Environmental Power is developing projects for wind in New York \nand Texas, and they plan to construct two parks in New York State and \ntwo in Texas. If the production tax credit is not extended, these \nprojects will not be built which will eliminate 1,200 full-time \nconstruction jobs. That is 600 jobs in each State.\n  In addition, the company in its head count will be cut from 220 to \n120 because they will also cut other jobs related to planning. In fact, \nif we do not give them this predictability this year, in 2008, $200 \nmillion in orders for equipment will be canceled. That is stimulus, $20 \nmillion that will not be made because they do not have certainty and \nthey are going to cancel their plans for equipment.\n  Additionally, $18 million in engineering services are going to be \ncanceled because they do not have predictability in this Tax Code.\n  Again, if the production tax credit is not extended, 600 full-time \nconstruction jobs will be eliminated in each State, New York and Texas.\n  Another example. Safeway, which is a major grocery store chain, is \nplanning on retrofitting additional stores with solar panels. Why are \nthey doing that? Because they know they can get offset rising energy \ncosts out of those solar panels. They are looking at 15 additional \nstores with solar panels and injecting an additional $30 million into \nthe economy if the solar investment credit is extended. If it is not \nextended, these jobs are going to be in jeopardy.\n  Here are companies trying to help us stimulate the economy, create \njobs, lower energy costs, and I am sure that helps with the bottom line \nof food costs in America, and yet we are not giving them \npredictability.\n\n  We also saw in my home State of Washington a company, Wellons, a \nleader in wood-fired energy systems, say they are going to mothball up \nto 20 projects unless they get the production tax credit. That means \nthat some of the 500 people in this particular company will be laid \noff.\n  I think the Arizona Republic said it best. In fact, they had an \neditorial this week that said:\n\n       The economic stimulus package from Congress . . . should \n     include an extension of tax credits for renewable energy \n     sources. For Arizona--\n\n  And I think this is similar for many other States, but Arizona is a \nleader in this area--\n\n       the continued development of our solar industry is at \n     stake.\n\n  That is why we need these credits. We had today the Los Angeles Times \nsay:\n\n       Investors won't pump money into clean power if there is a \n     danger of losing their tax incentives . . . green technology \n     is an extremely promising growth industry that could help \n     make up for the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n\n  That is another editorial from today.\n  We know this, and yet we somehow want to pretend that the elimination \nof these tax credits does not matter. I know it matters to Governors \nbecause we have heard from the Governors of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, \nKansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South \nDakota, and Wisconsin:\n\n       We know that uncertainty of the future of a wind production \n     tax credit must be avoided if this burgeoning industry is \n     going to thrive in the years ahead.\n\n  So we are hearing from our Governors who are on the ground wanting to \napprove these projects knowing how much they mean to their local \neconomies, and yet we are ignoring that.\n  We also heard from a growing industry partner, the American Corn \nGrowers Association. They said:\n\n       If President Bush will agree with the inclusion of the \n     production tax credit in the stimulus package, he will be \n     adding numerous jobs to our economy.\n\n  Why is that? Because this industry sees that this is a good partner. \nIt is actually helping them with additional revenue, and it is helping \nthose Midwest economies continue to grow.\n  What about the National Farmers Union, another organization, which \nsaid:\n\n       Encourage your support including important renewable energy \n     tax incentives in the economic stimulus package currently \n     being considered by Congress.\n\n  The Farmers Union obviously knows this means jobs in their local \neconomy. But for them, it also means that instead of paying the high \nprices of natural gas and not having any product compete with it, that \nhaving renewable energy generate an additional 6,000 megawatts of power \ncan actually get alternative sources of electricity in the market and \nlower the demand on natural gas and thereby lowering the price. That \nhelps lower the cost of fertilizer. It is critically important.\n  This past week, we had 41 Senators sign a letter, including 14 of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, who agree that:\n\n       Extending these expiring clean energy tax credits will help \n     ensure a stronger, more stable environment for new \n     investments and ensure continued robust growth in a bright \n     spot in an otherwise slowing economy.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter of \nbipartisan support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2008.\n     Hon.

Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Baucus, and Grassley: We \n     strongly support current bipartisan efforts to mitigate an \n     economic downturn by providing direct financial relief to \n     American families. At the same time, we believe that we must \n     be cognizant that energy prices have been a leading cause of \n     our current economic environment. Accordingly, we strongly \n     believe that we must provide a timely long-term extension of \n     clean energy and energy efficiency tax incentives that expire \n     at the end of this year. Given record energy prices and \n     growing demand, postponing action on these critical energy \n     incentives will only exacerbate the problems afflicting our \n     economy. In fact, these renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency investments have a verifiable record of \n     stimulating capital outlays and promoting job growth. We must \n     ensure that this impressive record is maintained in 2008 and \n     extend these tax credits expeditiously.\n       Over one hundred thousand Americans could be put to work in \n     2008 if clean energy production tax credits were extended in \n     the first quarter of this year according to industry \n     estimates. However, because the incentives are set to expire \n     this year. renewable energy companies are already reporting a \n     precipitous decrease in investment due to uncertainly. \n     Projects currently underway\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n     may soon he mothballed. Clean energy incentives for energy \n     efficient buildings. appliances and other technologies, as \n     well as additional funding for weatherizing homes. would \n     similarly serve to stimulate 2008 economic consumption, lower \n     residential energy costs, and generate new manufacturing and \n     construction jobs.\n       Failing to act on these crucial incentives could choke off \n     promising business investment in 2008 and miss an opportunity \n     to address high energy costs. a critical contributor to \n     sinking consumer confidence and our nation's long-term \n     economic challenges. Extending these expiring clean energy \n     tax credits will help ensure a stronger, more stable \n     environment for new investments and ensure continued robust \n     growth in a bright spot in an otherwise slowing economy. To \n     that end we look forward to working with you to extend these \n     critical tax incentives in context of encouraging economic \n     growth and vitality.\n           Sincerely,\n         Maria Cantwell; Olympia Snowe; Ron Wyden; Gordon Smith; \n           Amy Klobuchar; John F.

Mr. President, we also received letters from 13 \ndifferent organizations that also support the inclusion of these \nprovisions in the tax package.\n  This is truly an opportunity for us to continue to stimulate the \neconomy in a key growth area, but my colleagues should not be fooled. \nThis is probably the only opportunity to do extend these credits before \nthey expire. We have had a dispute between the House and the White \nHouse and Members of the Senate about how to move forward on these tax \ncredits. Some want them paid for while taking money from oil revenues. \nOthers, such as the White House, don't want them paid for at all.\n  This is an opportunity for us if we are going to do $150 billion \nworth of investment in what we think is an economic opportunity to get \none of the best returns on investment in this stimulus package; that \nis, to invest about $5 billion and see over $20 billion in new energy \ninvestment in this country.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this tomorrow and consider how \nmuch we truly need these budding clean energy industries to grow and \nthrive in our home States. Anyone who supports this industry has to \nvote for the Senate Finance bill or we could very well miss a key \nopportunity to stimulate our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Connecticut to the FISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, the amendment that would strike provisions from the \nbill that provide liability protection to those telecommunications \ncompanies that were asked by our Government to assist us in a dire time \nof need.\n  I begin by asking unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks a letter to Senator Reid, dated February \n5, 2008, and signed by Attorney General Mukasey and Director of \nNational Intelligence Admiral McConnell.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, next, I would like to quote a few passages \nfrom this letter that relate specifically to this issue of liability \nprotection. They begin by noting:\n\n       Liability protection is the just result for companies who \n     answered their Government's call for assistance. Further, it \n     will ensure that the Government can continue to rely upon the \n     assistance of the private sector that is so necessary to \n     protect the Nation and enforce its laws.\n\n  The point of beginning with this reference is to note the fact that \nwhat happened was that the U.S. Government, in the aftermath of 9/11, \nwent to certain kinds of telecommunications and asked for their \nassistance in tracking down foreign terrorists, in providing \nintelligence-gathering services to the U.S. Government. These companies \ndid not have a legal obligation to provide that support, but they \ncertainly, as good citizens of the United States, undertook to provide \nthe support, some of them in that capacity. The question is whether, \nhaving done that in good faith, they should now be protected from \nprivate lawsuits that have been filed against them or whether, as is \nthe historic tradition in such circumstances, they would be immune from \nsuch lawsuits for volunteering to help the Government.\n\n  Here is a little bit of what Attorney General Mukasey and Admiral \nMcConnell wrote in the letter.\n\n       In its report on S. 2248, the Intelligence Committee \n     recognized that ``without retroactive immunity, the private \n     sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful government \n     requests in the future without unnecessary court involvement \n     and protracted litigation. The possible reduction in \n     intelligence that might result from this delay is simply \n     unacceptable for our Nation.''\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The committee's measured judgment reflects the principle \n     that private citizens who respond in good faith to a request \n     for assistance by public officials should not be held liable \n     for their actions.\n\n  And that, in fact, has always been the common law rule in the United \nStates of America. The concern is not only to protect those who were \ngood enough to assist the Government in the past but also to ensure \nthat in the future companies can rely upon this type of protection \nbecause of all of the situations in which they find themselves. It is \nvery difficult for people to do business with them if they believe they \nmight be hauled into court and all of the resultant effects of \nlitigation would extend to them.\n  In the letter that Attorney General Mukasey and Admiral McConnell \nwrote to our leadership, they point out their objection to several \namendments and one of those amendments is specifically the one offered \nby the Senator from Connecticut, striking the immunity provisions, No. \n3907. They begin by discussing it in this way:\n\n       Extending liability protection to such companies is \n     imperative; failure to do so could limit future cooperation \n     by such companies and put critical intelligence operations at \n     risk. Moreover, litigation against companies believed to have \n     assisted the government risks the disclosure of highly \n     classified information regarding extremely sensitive \n     intelligence sources and methods. If any of these \n     amendments--\n\n  And they specifically refer to this amendment--\n\n        . . . are part of the bill . . . we, as well as the \n     President's other senior advisors, will recommend that he \n     veto the bill.\n\n  We know we need a bill to become law. We know what the President will \naccept, and we know it would be unacceptable to strike the immunity \nprovisions as amendment No. 3907 would do. But let me continue to quote \nfrom this letter, because the authors note something in addition to the \nproblem I identified, and I will state from it precisely:\n\n       This amendment also would strike the important provisions \n     in the bill that would establish procedures for implementing \n     existing statutory defenses in the future and that would \n     preempt State investigations of assistance provided by any \n     electronic communication service provider to an element of \n     the intelligence community. Those provisions are important to \n     ensuring that electronic communication service providers can \n     take full advantage of existing immunity provisions and to \n     protecting highly classified information.\n\n  In other words, this amendment doesn't simply strike the immunity \nprovisions but would also have this deleterious effect.\n  I want to quote from three other paragraphs of the bill, but I don't \nwant to exceed 10 minutes. Therefore, I would ask how much time I have \nconsumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes has been consumed.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me quote from three other paragraphs of the letter relating to \nthis amendment. The authors are referring to the Intelligence \nCommittee's extensive work on this particular aspect of the problem, \nand they say:\n\n       After reviewing the relevant documents, the Intelligence \n     Committee determined that providers had acted in response to \n     written requests or directives stating that the activities \n     had been authorized by the President and had been determined \n     to be lawful.\n\n  The letter goes on to note:\n\n       In its Conference Report, the committee ``concluded that \n     the providers had a good faith basis'' for responding to the \n     requests\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n     for assistance they received. The Senate Intelligence \n     Committee ultimately agreed to necessary immunity protections \n     on a nearly unanimous bipartisan 13-2 vote. Twelve members of \n     the committee subsequently rejected a motion to strike this \n     provision.\n\n  The authors go on to note:\n\n       The immunity offered in S. 2248 applies only in a narrow \n     set of circumstances.\n\n  They note, for example:\n\n       A court must review this certification before an action may \n     be dismissed. This immunity provision does not extend to the \n     government or government officials.\n\n  In other words, they can still be sued.\n\n       And it does not immunize any criminal conduct.\n\n  This is critical to understand what the amendment does not do.\n  Let me quote from the final paragraph relating to this particular \namendment. Attorney General Mukasey and Admiral McConnell say:\n\n       Providing this liability protection is critical to the \n     national security. As the Intelligence Committee recognized, \n     ``the intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence \n     it needs without assistance from these companies.'' That \n     committee also recognized that companies in the future may be \n     less willing to assist the government if they face the threat \n     of private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance. The committee concluded that: ``The \n     possible reduction in intelligence that might result from \n     this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our \n     Nation.''\n\n  The authors then conclude:\n\n       Allowing continued litigation also risks the disclosure of \n     highly classified information regarding intelligence sources \n     and methods. In addition to providing an advantage to our \n     adversaries, the potential disclosure of classified \n     information puts the facilities and personnel of electronic \n     communication service providers at risk. For these reasons, \n     we, as well as the President's other senior advisers, will \n     recommend that he veto any bill that does not afford \n     liability protection to these companies.\n\n  This is, I guess one could say, the definitive word of what the \nPresident is recommending and is willing to accept from the Congress. \nIt comes from the two individuals in our Government who have the chief \nresponsibility for our safety with respect to not only the protection \nof American civil liberties but also the gathering of foreign \nintelligence, and it extensively quotes from the report of the \ncommittee itself, the Intelligence Committee, which it notes acted in a \nbipartisan 13-to-2 vote to provide for this liability protection.\n  That is why it is so critical that when we have an opportunity to \nvote, I gather tomorrow or whenever we have an opportunity to vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, we reject that amendment \non the grounds that it is contrary to the Intelligence Committee's \nactions, to the recommendations of the Attorney General and the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and to the President with respect to \nthe liability protection for these entities.\n  There is much we cannot discuss, because so much of this program is \nof a classified nature. But I think everybody understands the \nfundamental principle involved here, and that is: When citizens of the \nUnited States are asked by their Government to assist, and they agree \nto do that in good faith for the protection of citizens of the United \nStates of America, they should be protected from lawsuits that have \nbeen filed. That is what the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut \nwould do is to eliminate that protection, and it is why the amendment \nshould be defeated.\n  I hope my colleagues are recognizing the seriousness of what these \ntwo authors of this letter have said when they recognize the \nseriousness of the potential consequences from failing to provide this \nkind of liability protection and that we will support the Intelligence \nCommittee, we will support the intelligence community, and we will \nreject the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 February 5, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: This letter presents the views of the \n     Administration on various amendments to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) Amendments Act \n     of 2008 (S. 2248), a bill ``to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, to modernize and streamline the \n     provisions of that act, and for other purposes.'' The letter \n     also addresses why it is critical that the authorities \n     contained in the Protect America Act not be allowed to \n     expire. We have appreciated the willingness of Congress to \n     address the need to modernize FISA and to work with the \n     Administration to allow the intelligence community to collect \n     the foreign intelligence information necessary to protect the \n     Nation while protecting the civil liberties of Americans. We \n     commend Congress for the comprehensive approach that it has \n     taken in considering these authorities and are grateful for \n     the opportunity to engage with Congress as it conducts an in-\n     depth analysis of the relevant issues.\n       In August, Congress took an important step toward \n     modernizing FISA by enacting the Protect America Act of 2007. \n     That Act has allowed us temporarily to close intelligence \n     gaps by enabling our intelligence professionals to collect, \n     without a court order, foreign intelligence information from \n     targets overseas. The intelligence community has implemented \n     the Protect America Act in a responsible way, subject to \n     extensive executive branch, congressional, and judicial \n     oversight, to meet the country's foreign intelligence needs \n     while protecting civil liberties. Indeed, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) recently \n     approved the procedures used by the Government under the \n     Protect America Act to determine that targets are located \n     overseas, not in the United States.\n       The Protect America Act was scheduled to expire on February \n     1, 2008, but Congress has extended that Act for fifteen days, \n     through February 16, 2008. In the face of the continued \n     threats to our Nation from terrorists and other foreign \n     intelligence targets, it is vital that Congress not allow the \n     core authorities of the Protect America Act to expire, but \n     instead pass long-term FISA modernization legislation that \n     both includes the collection authority conferred by the \n     Protect America Act and provides protection from private \n     lawsuits against companies that are believed to have assisted \n     the Government in the aftermath of the September 11th \n     terrorist attacks on America. Liability protection is the \n     just result for companies who answered their Government's \n     call for assistance. Further, it will ensure that the \n     Government can continue to rely upon the assistance of the \n     private sector that is so necessary to protect the Nation and \n     enforce its laws.\n       S. 2248, reported by the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, would satisfy both of these imperatives. That \n     bill was reported out of committee on a nearly unanimous 13-2 \n     vote. Although it is not perfect, it contains many important \n     provisions, and was developed through a thoughtful process \n     that resulted in a bill that helps ensure that both the lives \n     and the civil liberties of Americans will be safeguarded. \n     First, it would establish a firm, long-term foundation for \n     our intelligence community's efforts to track terrorists and \n     other foreign intelligence targets located overseas. Second, \n     S. 2248 would afford retroactive liability protection to \n     communication service providers that are believed to have \n     assisted the Government with intelligence activities in the \n     aftermath of September 11th. In its report on S. 2248, the \n     Intelligence Committee recognized that ``without retroactive \n     immunity, the private sector might be unwilling to cooperate \n     with lawful Government requests in the future without \n     unnecessary court involvement and protracted litigation. The \n     possible reduction in intelligence that might result from \n     this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our \n     Nation.'' The committee's measured judgment reflects the \n     principle that private citizens who respond in good faith to \n     a request for assistance by public basic legal role officials \n     should not be held liable for their actions. Thus, with the \n     inclusion of the proposed manager's amendment, which would \n     make necessary technical changes to the bill, we strongly \n     support passage of S. 2248.\n       For reasons elaborated below, the Administration also \n     strongly favors two other proposed amendments to the \n     Intelligence Committee's bill. One would strengthen S. 2248 \n     by expanding FISA to permit court-authorized surveillance of \n     international proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. \n     The other would ensure the timely resolution of any \n     challenges to government directives issued in support of \n     foreign intelligence collection efforts.\n       Certain other amendments have been offered to S. 2248, \n     however, that would undermine significantly the core \n     authorities and immunity provisions of that bill. After \n     careful study, we have determined that those amendments would \n     result in a final bill that would not provide the \n     intelligence community with the tools it needs to collect \n     effectively foreign intelligence information vital for the \n     security of the Nation. If the President is sent a bill that \n     does not provide the U.S. intelligence agencies the tools \n     they need to protect the nation, the President will veto the \n     bill.\n\n\n        I. Limitations on the Collection of Foreign Intelligence\n\n       Several proposed amendments to S. 2248 would have a direct, \n     adverse impact on our ability to collect effectively the \n     foreign intelligence information necessary to protect the \n     Nation. We note that three of these amendments were part of \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee substitute, which has already \n     been rejected by the Senate on a 60-34 vote. We explained why \n     those three amendments were unacceptable in our November 14, \n     2007, letter to Senator Leahy regarding the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee substitute, and the Administration reiterated these \n     concerns in a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) issued \n     on December 17, 2007. A copy of that letter and the SAP are \n     attached for your reference.\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\n       Prohibition on Collecting Vital Foreign Intelligence \n     Information (No amendment number available). This amendment \n     provides that ``no communication shall be acquired under \n     [Title VII of S. 2248] if the Government knows before or at \n     the time of acquisition that the communication is to or from \n     a person reasonably believed to be located in the United \n     States,'' except as authorized under Title I of FISA or \n     certain other exceptions. The amendment would require the \n     Government to ``segregate or specifically designate'' any \n     such communication and the Government could access such \n     communications only under the authorities in Title I of \n     FISA or under certain exceptions. Even for communications \n     falling under one of the limited exceptions or an \n     emergency exception, the Government still would be \n     required to submit a request to the FISA Court relating to \n     such communications. The procedural mechanisms it would \n     establish would diminish our ability swiftly to monitor a \n     communication from a terrorist overseas to a person in the \n     United States--precisely the communication that the \n     intelligence community may have to act on immediately. \n     Finally, the amendment would draw unnecessary and harmful \n     distinctions between types of foreign intelligence \n     information, allowing the Government to collect \n     communications under Title VII from or to the United \n     States that contain information relating to terrorism but \n     not other types of foreign intelligence information, such \n     as that relating to the national defense of the United \n     States or attacks, hostile actions, and clandestine \n     intelligence activities of a foreign power.\n       This amendment would eviscerate critical core authorities \n     of the Protect America Act and S. 2248. Our prior letter and \n     the Statement of Administration Policy explained how this \n     type of amendment increases the danger to the Nation and \n     returns the intelligence community to a pre-September 11th \n     posture that was heavily criticized in congressional reviews. \n     It would have a devastating impact on foreign intelligence \n     surveillance operations; it is unsound as a matter of policy; \n     its provisions would be inordinately difficult to implement; \n     and thus it is unacceptable. The incidental collection of \n     U.S. person communications is not a new issue for the \n     intelligence community. For decades, the intelligence \n     community has utilized minimization procedures to ensure that \n     U.S. person information is properly handled and \n     ``minimized.'' It has never been the case that the mere fact \n     that a person overseas happens to communicate with an \n     American triggers a need for court approval. Indeed, if court \n     approval were mandated in such circumstances, there would be \n     grave operational consequences for the intelligence \n     community's efforts to collect foreign intelligence. \n     Accordingly, if this amendment is part of the bill that is \n     presented to the President, we, as well as the President's \n     other senior advisors, will recommend that he veto the bill.\n       Imposition of a ``Significant Purpose'' Test (No. 3913). \n     This amendment, which was part of the Judiciary Committee \n     substitute, would require an order from the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) if a \n     ``significant purpose'' of an acquisition targeting a person \n     abroad is to acquire the communications of a specific person \n     reasonably believed to be in the United States. If the \n     concern driving this proposal is so-called ``reverse \n     targeting''--circumstances in which the Government would \n     conduct surveillance of a person overseas when the \n     Government's actual target is a person in the United States \n     with whom the person overseas is communicating--that \n     situation is already addressed in FISA today. If the person \n     in the United States is the actual target, an order from the \n     FISA Court is required. Indeed, S. 2248 codifies this \n     longstanding Executive Branch interpretation of FISA.\n       The amendment would place an unnecessary and debilitating \n     burden on our intelligence community's ability to conduct \n     surveillance without enhancing the protection of the privacy \n     of Americans. The introduction of this ambiguous \n     ``significant purpose'' standard would raise unacceptable \n     operational uncertainties and problems, making it more \n     difficult to collect intelligence when a foreign terrorist \n     overseas is calling into the United States--which is \n     precisely the communication we generally care most about. \n     Part of the value of the Protect America Act, and any \n     subsequent legislation, is to enable the intelligence \n     community to collect expeditiously the communications of \n     terrorists in foreign countries who may contact an \n     associate in the United States. The intelligence community \n     was heavily criticized by numerous reviews after September \n     11, including by the Congressional Joint Inquiry into \n     September 11, regarding its insufficient attention to \n     detecting communications indicating homeland attack \n     plotting. To quote the Congressional Joint Inquiry:\n       The Joint Inquiry has learned that one of the future \n     hijackers communicated with a known terrorist facility in the \n     Middle East while he was living in the United States. The \n     Intelligence Community did not identify the domestic origin \n     of those communications prior to September 11, 2001 so that \n     additional FBI investigative efforts could be coordinated. \n     Despite this country's substantial advantages, there was \n     insufficient focus on what many would have thought was among \n     the most critically important kinds of terrorist-related \n     communications, at least in terms of protecting the Homeland.\n       In addition, the proposed amendment would create \n     uncertainty by focusing on whether the ``significant purpose \n     . . . is to acquire the communication'' of a person in the \n     United States, not just to target the person here. To be \n     clear, a ``significant purpose'' of intelligence community \n     activities that target individuals outside the United States \n     is to detect communications that may provide warning of \n     homeland attacks, including communications between a \n     terrorist overseas and associates in the United States. A \n     provision that bars the intelligence community from \n     collecting these communications is unacceptable. If this \n     amendment is part of the bill that is presented to the \n     President, we, as well as the President's other senior \n     advisors, will recommend that he veto the bill.\n       Imposition of a ``Specific Individual Target'' Test (No. \n     3912). This amendment, which was part of the Judiciary \n     Committee substitute, would require the Attorney General and \n     the Director of National Intelligence to certify that any \n     acquisition ``is limited to communications to which any party \n     is a specific individual target (which shall not be limited \n     to known or named individuals) who is reasonably believed to \n     be located outside the United States.'' This provision could \n     hamper United States intelligence operations that currently \n     are authorized to be conducted overseas and that could be \n     conducted more effectively from the United States without \n     harming the privacy interests of United States persons. For \n     example, the intelligence community may wish to target all \n     communications in a particular neighborhood abroad before our \n     armed forces conduct an offensive. This amendment could \n     prevent the intelligence community from targeting a \n     particular group of buildings or a geographic area abroad to \n     collect foreign intelligence prior to such military \n     operations. This restriction could have serious consequences \n     on our ability to collect necessary foreign intelligence \n     information, including information vital to conducting \n     military operations abroad and protecting the lives of our \n     service members, and it is unacceptable. Imposing such \n     additional requirements to the carefully crafted framework \n     provided by S. 2248 would harm important intelligence \n     operations without appreciably enhancing the privacy \n     interests of Americans. If this amendment is part of the bill \n     that is presented to the President, we, as well as the \n     President's other senior advisors, will recommend that he \n     veto the bill.\n       Limits Dissemination of Foreign Intelligence Information \n     (No. 3915). This amendment originally was offered in the \n     Senate Intelligence Committee, where it was rejected on a 10-\n     5 vote. The full Senate then rejected the amendment as part \n     of its consideration of the Judiciary Committee amendment. \n     The proposed amendment would impose significant new \n     restrictions on the use of foreign intelligence information, \n     including information not concerning United States persons, \n     obtained or derived from acquisitions using targeting \n     procedures that the FISA Court later found to be \n     unsatisfactory for any reason. By requiring analysts to go \n     back to the relevant databases and extract certain \n     information, as well as to determine what other information \n     is derived from that information, this requirement would \n     place a difficult, and perhaps insurmountable, operational \n     burden on the intelligence community in implementing \n     authorities that target terrorists and other foreign \n     intelligence targets located overseas. The effect of this \n     burden would be to divert analysts and other resources from \n     their core mission-protecting the Nation-to search for \n     information, including information that does not concern \n     United States persons. This requirement also stands at odds \n     with the mandate of the September 11th Commission that the \n     intelligence community should find and link disparate pieces \n     of foreign intelligence information. Finally, the requirement \n     would actually degrade--rather than enhance--privacy \n     protections by requiring analysts to locate and examine \n     United States person information that would otherwise not be \n     reviewed. Accordingly, if this amendment is part of the bill \n     that is presented to the President, we, as well as the \n     President's other senior advisors, will recommend that he \n     veto the bill.\n\n\n       II. Liability Protection for Telecommunications Companies\n\n        Several amendments to S. 2248 would alter the carefully \n     crafted provisions in that bill that afford liability \n     protection to those companies believed to have assisted the \n     Government in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. \n     Extending liability protection to such companies is \n     imperative; failure to do so could limit future cooperation \n     by such companies and put critical intelligence operations at \n     risk. Moreover, litigation against companies believed to have \n     assisted the Government risks the disclosure of highly \n     classified, information regarding extremely sensitive \n     intelligence sources and methds. If any of these amendments \n     is part of the bill that is presented to the President, we as \n     well as the President's other senior advisors, will recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n       Striking the Immunity Provisions (No. 3907). This amendment \n     would strike Title II of S. 2248, which affords liability \n     protection to telecommunications companies believed to have \n     assisted the Government following the September 11th attacks. \n     This amendment also would strike the important provisions in \n     the bill that would establish procedures for implementing \n     existing statutory defenses in the future and that would \n     preempt state investigations of assistance provided by any \n     electronic communication service provider to an element of \n     the intelligence\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\n     community. Those provisions are important to ensuring that \n     electronic communication service providers can take full \n     advantage of existing immunity provisions and to protecting \n     highly classified information.\n       Affording liability protection to those companies believed \n     to have assisted the Government with communications \n     intelligence activities in the aftermath of September 11th is \n     a just result and is essential to ensuring that our \n     intelligence community is able to carry out its mission. \n     After reviewing the relevant documents, the Intelligence \n     Committee determined that providers had acted in response to \n     written requests or directives stating that the activities \n     had been authorized by the President and had been determined \n     to be lawful. In its Conference Report, the Committee \n     ``concluded that the providers . . . had a good faith basis'' \n     for responding to the requests for assistance they received. \n     The Senate Intelligence Committee ultimately agreed to \n     necessary immunity protections on a nearly-unanimous, \n     bipartisan, 13-2 vote. Twelve Members of the Committee \n     subsequently rejected a motion to strike this provision.\n       The immunity offered in S. 2248 applies only in a narrow \n     set of circumstances. An action may be dismissed only if the \n     Attorney General certifies to the court that either: (i) the \n     electronic communications service provider did not provide \n     the assistance; or (ii) the assistance was provided in the \n     wake of the September 11th attacks, and was described in a \n     written request indicating that the activity was authorized \n     by the President and determined to be lawful. A court must \n     review this certification before an action may be dismissed. \n     This immunity provision does not extend to the Government or \n     Government officials, and it does not immunize any criminal \n     conduct.\n       Providing this liability protection is critical to the \n     national security. As the Intelligence Committee recognized, \n     ``the intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence \n     it needs without assistance from these companies.'' That \n     committee also recognized that companies in the future may be \n     less willing to assist the Government if they face the threat \n     of private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance. The committee concluded that: ``The \n     possible reduction in intelligence that might result from \n     this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our \n     Nation.'' Allowing continued litigation also risks the \n     disclosure of highly classified information regarding \n     intelligence sources and methods. In addition to providing an \n     advantage to our adversaries, the potential disclosure of \n     classified information puts the facilities and personnel of \n     electronic communication service providers at risk.\n       For these reasons, we, as well as the President's other \n     senior advisors, will recommend that he veto any bill that \n     does not afford liability protection to these companies.\n       Substituting the Government as the Defendant in Litigation \n     (No. 3927). This amendment would substitute the United States \n     as the party defendant for any covered civil action against a \n     telecommunications provider if certain conditions are met. \n     The Government would be substituted if the FISA Court \n     determined that the company received a written request that \n     complied with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(a)(ii)(B), an existing \n     statutory protection; the company acted in ``good faith . . . \n     pursuant to an objectively reasonable belief'' that \n     compliance with the written request was permitted by law; or \n     that the company did not participate.\n       Substitution is not an acceptable alternative to immunity. \n     Substituting the Government would simply continue the \n     litigation at the expense of the American taxpayer. \n     Substitution does nothing to reduce the risk of the further \n     disclosure of highly classified information. The very point \n     of these lawsuits is to prove plaintiffs' claims by \n     disclosing classified information regarding the activities \n     alleged in the complaints, and this amendment would permit \n     plaintiffs to participate in proceedings before the FISA \n     Court regarding the conduct at issue. A judgment finding \n     that a particular company is a Government partner also \n     could result in the disclosure of highly classified \n     information regarding intelligence sources and methods and \n     hurt the company's reputation overseas. In addition, the \n     companies would still face many of the burdens of \n     litigation--including attorneys' fees and disruption to \n     their businesses from discovery--because their conduct \n     will be the key question in the litigation. Such \n     litigation could deter private sector entities from \n     providing assistance to the intelligence community in the \n     future, Finally, the lawsuits could result in the \n     expenditure of taxpayer resources, as the U.S. Treasury \n     would be responsible for the payment of an adverse \n     judgment. If this amendment is part of the bill that is \n     presented to the President, we, as well as the President's \n     other senior advisors, will recommend that he veto the \n     bill.\n       FISA Court Involvement in Determining Immunity (No. 3919). \n     This amendment would require all judges of the FISA Court to \n     determine whether the written requests or directives from the \n     Government complied with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(a)(ii), an \n     existing statutory protection; whether companies acted in \n     ``good faith reliance of the electronic communication service \n     provider on the written request or directive under paragraph \n     (1)(A)(ii), such that the electronic communication service \n     provider had an objectively reasonable belief under the \n     circumstances that the written request or directive was \n     lawful''; or whether the companies did not participate in the \n     alleged intelligence activities.\n       This amendment is not acceptable. It is for Congress, not \n     the courts, to make the public policy decision whether to \n     grant liability protection to telecommunications companies \n     who are being sued simply because they are alleged to have \n     assisted the Government in the aftermath of the September \n     11th attacks. The Senate Intelligence Committee has reviewed \n     the relevant documents and concluded that those who assisted \n     the Government acted in good faith and received written \n     assurances that the activities were lawful and being \n     conducted pursuant to a Presidential authorization. This \n     amendment effectively sends a message of no-confidence to the \n     companies who helped our Nation prevent terrorist attacks in \n     the aftermath of the deadliest foreign attacks on U.S. soil. \n     Transferring a policy decision critical to our national \n     security to the FISA Court, which would be limited in its \n     consideration to the particular matter before them (without \n     any consideration of the impact of immunity on our national \n     security), is unacceptable.\n       In contrast to S. 2248, this amendment would not allow for \n     the expeditious dismissal of the relevant litigation. Rather, \n     this amendment would do little more than transfer the \n     existing litigation to the full FISA Court and would likely \n     result in protracted litigation. The standards in the \n     amendment also are ambiguous and would likely require fact-\n     finding on the issue of good faith and whether the companies \n     ``had an objectively reasonable belief'' that assisting the \n     Government was lawful--even though the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee has already studied this issue and concluded such \n     companies did act in good faith. The companies being sued \n     would continue to be subjected to the burdens of the \n     litigation, and the continued litigation would increase the \n     risk of the disclosure of highly classified information.\n       The procedures set forth under the amendment also present \n     insurmountable problems. First, the amendment would permit \n     plaintiffs to participate in the litigation before the \n     FISA Court. This poses a very serious risk of disclosure \n     to plaintiffs of classified facts over which the \n     Government has asserted the state secrets privilege and of \n     disclosure of these secrets to the public. The FISA Court \n     safeguards national security secrets precisely because the \n     proceedings are generally ex parte--only the Government \n     appears. The involvement of plaintiffs also is likely to \n     prolong the litigation. Second, assembling the FISA Court \n     for en banc hearings on these cases could cause delays in \n     the disposition of the cases. Third, the amendment would \n     purport to abrogate the state secrets privilege with \n     respect to proceedings in the FISA Court. This would pose \n     a serious risk of harm to the national security by \n     possibly allowing plaintiffs access to highly classified \n     information about sensitive intelligence activities, \n     sources, and methods. The conclusion of the FISA Court \n     also may reveal sensitive information to the public and \n     our adversaries. Beyond these serious policy \n     considerations, it also would raise very serious \n     constitutional questions about the authority of Congress \n     to abrogate the constitutionally-based privilege over \n     national security information within the Executive's \n     control. This is unnecessary, because classified \n     information may be shared with a court in camera and ex \n     parte even when the state secrets privilege is asserted. \n     Fourth, the amendment does not explicitly provide for \n     appeal of determinations by the FISA Court. Finally, \n     imposing a standard involving an ``objectively reasonable \n     belief'' is likely to cause companies in the future to \n     feel compelled to make an independent finding prior to \n     complying with a lawful Government request for assistance. \n     Those companies do not have access to information \n     necessary to make this judgment. Imposition of such a \n     standard could cause dangerous delays in critical \n     intelligence operations and put our national security at \n     risk. As the Intelligence Committee recognized in its \n     report on S. 2248, ``the intelligence community cannot \n     obtain the intelligence it needs without assistance from \n     these companies.'' For these reasons, existing law rightly \n     places no such obligation on telecommunications companies.\n       If this amendment is part of the bill that is presented to \n     the President, we, as well as the President's other senior \n     advisors, will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n\n                         III. Other Amendments\n\n       Imposing a Short Sunset on the Legislation (No. 3930). This \n     amendment would shorten the existing sunset provision in S. \n     2248 from six years to four years. We strongly oppose it. S. \n     2248 should not have an expiration date at all. The threats \n     we face do not come with an expiration date, and our \n     authorities to counter those threats should be placed on a \n     permanent foundation. They should not be in a continual state \n     of doubt. Any sunset provision withholds from our \n     intelligence professionals and our private partners the \n     certainty and permanence they need to protect Americans from \n     terrorism and other threats to the national security. The \n     intelligence community operates much more effectively when \n     the rules governing our intelligence professionals' ability \n     to track our adversaries are established and are not changing \n     from year to year. Stability of law also allows the \n     intelligence community and our private partners to invest \n     resources appropriately. Nor is there any need for a sunset. \n     There has been extensive public discussion, debate, and \n     consideration of FISA modernization and there is now a \n     lengthy factual\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\n     record on the need for this legislation. Indeed, \n     Administration officials have been working with Congress \n     since at least the summer of 2006 on legislation to modernize \n     FISA. There also has been extensive congressional oversight \n     and reporting regarding the Government's use of the \n     authorities under the Protect America Act. In addition, S. \n     2248 includes substantial congressional oversight of the \n     Government's use of the authorities provided in the bill. \n     This oversight includes provision of various written \n     reports to the congressional intelligence committees, \n     including semiannual assessments by the Attorney General \n     and the Director of National Intelligence, assessments by \n     each relevant agency's Inspector General, and annual \n     reviews by the head of any agency conducting operations \n     under Title VII. Congress can, of course, revisit these \n     issues and amend a statute at whatever time it chooses. We \n     therefore urge Congress to provide a long-term solution to \n     an out-dated FISA and to resist attempts to impose a short \n     expiration date on this legislation. Although we believe \n     that any sunset is unwise and unnecessary, we support S. \n     2248 despite its six-year sunset because it meets our \n     operational needs to keep the country safe by providing \n     needed authorities and liability protection.\n       Imposes Court Review of Compliance with Minimization \n     Procedures (No. 3920). This amendment, which was part of the \n     Judiciary Committee substitute, would allow the FISA Court to \n     review compliance with minimization procedures that are used \n     on a programmatic basis for the acquisition of foreign \n     intelligence information by targeting individuals reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. We strongly oppose \n     this amendment. It could place the FISA Court in a position \n     where it would conduct individualized review of the \n     intelligence community's foreign communications intelligence \n     activities. While conferring such authority on the court is \n     understandable in the context of traditional FISA collection, \n     it is anomalous in this context, where the court's role is in \n     approving generally applicable procedures for collection \n     targeting individuals outside the United States.\n       Congress is aware of the substantial oversight of the use \n     of the authorities contained in the Protect America Act. As \n     noted above, S. 2248 significantly increases such oversight \n     by mandating semiannual assessments by the Attorney General \n     and the Director of National Intelligence, assessments by \n     each relevant agency's Inspector General, and annual reviews \n     by the head of any agency conducting operations under Title \n     VII, as well as extensive reporting to Congress and to the \n     FISA Court. The repeated layering of overlapping oversight \n     requirements on one aspect of intelligence community \n     operations is both unnecessary and not the best use of \n     limited resources and expertise.\n       Expedited FISA Court Review of Challenges and Petitions to \n     Compel Compliance (No. 3941). This amendment would require \n     the FISA Court to make an initial ruling on the frivolousness \n     of a challenge to a directive issued under the bill within \n     five days, and to review any challenge that requires plenary \n     review within 30 days. The amendment also provides that if \n     the Constitution requires it, the court can take longer to \n     decide the issues before it. The amendment sets forth similar \n     procedures for the enforcement of directives (i.e., when the \n     Government seeks to compel an electronic communication \n     service provider to furnish assistance or information). This \n     amendment would ensure that challenges to directives and \n     petitions to compel compliance with directives are \n     adjudicated in a manner that avoids undue delays in critical \n     intelligence collection. This amendment would improve the \n     existing provisions in S. 2248 pertaining to challenges to \n     directives and petitions to compel cooperation by electronic \n     communication service providers, and we strongly support it.\n       Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (No. 3938). \n     This amendment, which would apply to surveillance pursuant to \n     traditional FISA Court orders, would expand the definition \n     of ``foreign power'' to include groups engaged in the \n     international proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction. This amendment reflects the threat posed by \n     these catastrophic weapons and extends FISA to apply to \n     individuals and groups engaged in the international \n     proliferation of such weapons. To the extent that they are \n     not also engaged in international terrorism, FISA \n     currently does not cover those engaged in the \n     international proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction. The amendment would expand the definition of \n     ``agent of a foreign power'' to include non-U.S. persons \n     engaged in such activities, even if they cannot be \n     connected to a foreign power before the surveillance is \n     initiated. The amendment would close an existing gap in \n     FISA's coverage with respect to surveillance conducted \n     pursuant to traditional FISA Court orders, and we strongly \n     support it.\n       Exclusive Means (No. 3910). We understand that the \n     amendment relating to the exclusive means provision in S. \n     2248 is undergoing additional revision. As a result, we are \n     withholding comment on this amendment and its text at this \n     time. We note, however, that we support the provision \n     currently contained in S. 2248 and to support its \n     modification, we would have to conclude that the amendment \n     provides for sufficient flexibility to permit the President \n     to protect the Nation adequately in times of national \n     emergency.\n\n\n                             IV. Expiration\n\n       While it is essential that any FISA modernization presented \n     to the President provide the intelligence community with the \n     tools it needs while safeguarding the civil liberties of \n     Americans, it is also vital that Congress not permit the \n     authorities of the Protect America Act not be allowed simply \n     to expire. As you are aware, the Protect America Act, which \n     allowed us temporarily to close gaps in our intelligence \n     collection, was to sunset on February 1, 2008. Because \n     Congress indicated that it was ``a legislative \n     impossibility'' to meet this deadline, it passed and the \n     President signed a fifteen-day extension. Failure to pass \n     long-term legislation during this period would degrade our \n     ability to obtain vital foreign intelligence information, \n     including the location, intentions, and capabilities of \n     terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets abroad.\n       First, the expiration of the authorities in the Protect \n     America Act would plunge critical intelligence programs into \n     a state of uncertainty which could cause us to delay the \n     gathering of, or simply miss, critical foreign intelligence \n     information. Expiration would result in a degradation of \n     critical tools necessary to carry out our national security \n     mission. Without these authorities, there is significant \n     doubt surrounding the future of aspects of our operations. \n     For instance, expiration would create uncertainty concerning:\n       The ability to modify certifications and procedures issued \n     under the Protect America Act to reflect operational needs \n     and the implementation of procedures to ensure that agencies \n     are fully integrated protecting the Nation;\n       The continuing validity of liability protection for those \n     who assist us according to the procedures under the Protect \n     America Act;\n       The continuing validity of the judicial mechanism for \n     compelling the assistance needed to protect our national \n     security;\n       The ability to cover intelligence gaps created by new \n     communication paths or technologies. If the intelligence \n     community uncovers such new methods, it will need to act to \n     cover these intelligence gaps.\n       All of these aspects of our operations are subject to great \n     uncertainty and delay if the authorities of the Protect \n     America Act expire. Indeed, some critical operations will \n     likely not be possible without the tools provided by the \n     Protect America Act. We will be forced to pursue intelligence \n     collection under FISA's outdated legal framework--a framework \n     that we already know leads to intelligence gaps. This \n     degradation of our intelligence capability will occur despite \n     the fact that, as the Department of Justice has notified \n     Congress, the FISA Court has approved our targeting \n     procedures pursuant to the Protect America Act.\n       Second, expiration or continued short-term extensions of \n     the Protect America Act means that an issue of paramount \n     importance will not be addressed. This is the issue of \n     providing liability protection for those who provided vital \n     assistance to the Nation after September 11, 2001. Senior \n     leaders of the intelligence community have consistently \n     emphasized the critical need to address this issue since \n     2006. See, ``FISA for the 21st Century'' hearing before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee with Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and Director of the National Security \n     Agency; 2007 Annual Threat Assessment Hearing before the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with Director of \n     National Intelligence. Ever since the first Administration \n     proposal to modernize FISA in April 2007, the Administration \n     had noted that meeting the intelligence community's \n     operational needs had two critical components--modernizing \n     FISA's authorities and providing liability protection. The \n     Protect America Act updated FISA's legal framework, but it \n     did not address the need for liability protection.\n       As we have discussed above, and the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee recognized, ``without retroactive immunity, the \n     private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful \n     Government requests in the future without unnecessary court \n     involvement and protracted litigation.'' As it concluded, \n     ``[t]he possible reduction in intelligence that might result \n     from this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our \n     Nation.'' In short, if the absence of retroactive liability \n     protection leads to private partners not cooperating with \n     foreign intelligence activities, we can expect more \n     intelligence gaps.\n       Questions surrounding the legality of the Government's \n     request for assistance following September 11th should not be \n     resolved in the context of suits against private parties. By \n     granting responsible liability protection, S. 2248 ``simply \n     recognizes that, in the specific historical circumstances \n     here, if the private sector relied on written representations \n     that high-level Government officials had assessed the [the \n     President's] program to be legal, they acted in good faith \n     and should be entitled to protection from civil suit.'' \n     Likewise, we do not believe that it is constructive--indeed, \n     it is destructive--to degrade the ability of the intelligence \n     community to protect the country by punishing our private \n     partners who are not part of the ongoing debate between the \n     branches over their respective powers.\n       The Protect America Act's authorities expire in less than \n     two weeks. The Administration remains prepared to work with \n     Congress towards the passage of a FISA modernization bill \n     that would strengthen the Nation's intelligence capabilities \n     while respecting and protecting the constitutional rights of \n     Americans, so that the President can sign such a bill into \n     law. Passage of S. 2248 and rejection\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\n     of those amendments that would undermine it would be a \n     critical step in this direction. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you and the Members of the Senate on \n     these important issues.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. The \n     Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the \n     perspective of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Mukasey,\n       Attorney General.\n     J.M. McConnell,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nquorum call, which I am about to invoke, we not have time counted \nagainst either side as it runs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nand that the time I use not be counted against debate on the pending \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. My home State of Ohio is deep into a foreclosure crisis. \nGas prices are going up, and all energy prices and transportation costs \nare going up. More Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, hand to \nmouth, some not even that lucky. Congress is now working on an economic \nstimulus package, one that is desperately needed. Let me tell the story \nabout something that happened last month in my home State of Ohio to \nillustrate how this recession, which has clearly already swept across \nmy State, has had an impact on families, on middle-class families, on \nfamilies who consider themselves middle class and sometimes do not--a \ncouple of stories.\n  One is from Tim in Cleveland. Tim told us that for some time, he and \nhis wife had volunteered at a food bank. They donated money to this \nfood bank. Over time, as his budget got tighter, his pay wasn't keeping \nup with the cost of gasoline, heating, the increasing cost of food, and \nhe no longer contributed to the food bank, but he and his wife kept \nworking there. More recently, Tim said that he began to go to the food \nbank for food. He said he was a bit embarrassed by that, which he \nshould not have been, and said: I used to consider myself middle class. \nNow I do not. He has held the same job, worked the same long hours, but \nhe is simply not able to keep up with an economy under the rules of \nglobalization, where wages are stagnant and prices continue to go up.\n  Perhaps a more tragic story, only because it involves a larger number \nof people, perhaps, than Tim: In Hocking County in Logan, OH, a \ncommunity about halfway between Columbus, in the center of the State, \nthe capital in Athens, the home of Howard University, a city on the \nOhio River, a town of Logan in the County of Hocking, a county of about \n30,000 people, at 3:30 in the morning on a cold December night, the \npeople began to line up at the United Methodist Church to go to a food \npantry. The doors opened at 8. People in cars were snaked around the \nwhole area in Logan, and by 1 in the afternoon, 2,000 people--7 percent \nof the population of Hocking County, an Appalachian county where people \nwork hard, have raised their kids proudly, have taken care of \nthemselves and their neighbors--2,000 people in this community of \n30,000 had visited this food bank, many of them driving 25 or 30 \nminutes to get there.\n  Congress, in response, is working on an economic stimulus package \nthat is desperately needed. The Finance Committee has passed a proposal \nthat puts cash in the hands of working Americans and doesn't turn its \nback on those in need.\n  A stimulus package is two things: One, it is to stimulate the economy \nby putting money in the hands of people who will spend it. Second, it \nis helping those people most victimized, hardest hit by the recession. \nThat is why the Finance Committee, better than the President's version \nand the House version, will do those two things. It will stimulate the \neconomy better, and it will put money in the hands of those who have \nsuffered, who have been hardest hit. I applaud the committee for taking \nthe plight of every American, retirees and disabled veterans, into \nconsideration.\n  The Finance Committee package aims at jump-starting this stalled \neconomy. For those who are facing in too many cases heat or eat, \nwhether they can afford food or paying the heating bills, it will \nprovide immediate assistance.\n  Importantly, the Finance Committee package provides relief to 20 \nmillion seniors and 250,000 disabled Americans who were left out of the \nother package under consideration, the package most of my Republican \nfriends are supporting, the one without help for 250,000 disabled and \n20 million seniors. Some Republicans, those who are a bit more \ncourageous and more willing to break with the President and their \nSenate leadership, are supporting the package that includes 20 million \nseniors and 250,000 disabled Americans.\n  The Finance Committee package includes an extension of unemployment \ninsurance, which is a crucial and commonsense response in an economic \ndownturn. An awful lot of Ohioans, in Toledo and Lima and Dayton and \nHamilton and Middletown, have seen their unemployment compensation run \nout. They have been unemployed for 26 weeks or longer--a situation they \ndidn't ask to be in, a situation where they involuntarily were laid \noff. They haven't been able to find a job in this economy. Many of them \nnow are in those food banks in Dayton and Cleveland and Toledo, and \nmany of them are looking for help. That is why it is so important that \nwe put money directly into the pockets of people, through seniors, \ndisabled Americans, and with the extension of unemployment compensation \nbenefits.\n  About a week ago, I met with seven or eight religious leaders \nrepresenting several Christian denominations, a rabbi and a leader in \nthe Muslim community who came to my office to talk about what we need \nto do to answer the call for social justice, the call that preaches \nthat regardless of one's faith, we have a responsibility, those who are \nmore privileged, to those who are less privileged. This economic \nstimulus package does this. These leaders from the faith community who \nvisited me last week spoke passionately about how, with the LIHEAP \nprogram, the program for the elderly indigent who can't afford their \nheating bills, with food banks and food stamps and the extension of \nunemployment benefits, what we need to do in this stimulus package, \nputting money in the pockets of middle-class Americans, including 20 \nmillion seniors and 250,000 disabled, how that is so very important to \ncelebrate American values. As these religious leaders were discussing \nwith me, to celebrate our Nation's values and to celebrate our faith, \nit is particularly important that we pass a stimulus package that not \njust stimulates the economy but helps those people most in need who \nhave most been hurt by this recession.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, secretary for the majority, Mr. Martin \nPaone, is leaving the U.S. Senate. I am personally saddened by Marty's \ndecision because I have known and worked with Marty for nearly 30 \nyears. I take great pride in the fact that, as Senate majority leader, \nI hired young Marty to work in the Senate Democratic Cloakroom in 1979. \nThree years later, I promoted him to the floor staff of the Senate \nDemocratic Policy Committee.\n  In both positions, Marty performed his work for the Senate with \nincredible dedication and professionalism. In fact, in a floor \nstatement I made on October 11, 1988, I acknowledged the ``disciplined, \norderly thinking'' which Marty had brought to his work in the Senate, \nand complimented him on his ``calm demeanor under pressure.''\n  I was most pleased, but not surprised, when Senate Majority Leader \nMitchell selected Marty Paone to be assistant secretary for the \nmajority, and Senate Majority Leaders Daschle and Reid chose him to be \nsecretary for the majority. This last position, of course, is one of \nthe most important positions in the Senate. The secretary for the \nmajority is regarded as the Senate's ``chief legislative officer'' \nbecause the office digests and processes all legislative proposals \nwhich come before the Senate. Marty thoroughly mastered his difficult \nand demanding responsibilities. He has carefully studied the Senate's \nrules and precedents. He understands how this great institution really \nworks.\n  The dedication and diligence which Marty brought to every position in \nwhich he has served the Senate have only been enhanced by his friendly, \nhelpful demeanor. Marty Paone was always on the job and at the top of \nhis game.\n  Mr. President, it will be hard to say goodbye, but I wish Marty and \nhis lovely wife Ruby, also a Senate staffer, all the happiness in the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S657-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CAROL MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my former \nlongtime staff members, Carol Mitchell, who for 15 years helped me \nimprove health care delivery and services throughout West Virginia and \nthe Nation. Carol has continued her contributions to public health by \nworking in the private sector for the past 12 years.\n  Carol has decided to retire to enjoy more time with her husband David \nand son Rob. I salute Carol for her 30 years of service to the Congress \nand for her loyal and conscientious staff work in my office.\n  Over the years, Carol has worked directly with educators, health care \nproviders and community and business leaders in West Virginia and \nthroughout the country to develop and implement programs which benefit \nour citizens. She was instrumental in the creation of many of the \nFederal health and educational programs we know today and possesses a \nunique understanding of these programs and how institutions can \nsuccessfully utilize them.\n  Carol's Capitol Hill service, includes 6 years on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee staff and 15 years as a senior staff aide to \nmy West Virginia office. As a professional staff member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation and Related Agencies, she was a trusted adviser to \nsubcommittee chairman Tom Harkin. She regularly briefed subcommittee \nmembers on Federal programs totaling in the billions of dollars.\n  Prior to joining the Appropriations Committee as a professional \nstaffer, Carol worked for Senator Robert P. Griffin of Michigan and \nCongressman William T. Cahill of New Jersey.\n  Carol was an exemplary public servant who has made a significant, \npositive difference in the lives of many people she may never meet. I \nthank Carol for her fine service to her country, and wish her well in \nwhatever endeavors she undertakes in her retirement years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S657-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  In the early morning of February 2, 2008, a gay couple, Thomas \nColonna and Brad Crelia, were walking in the Capitol Hill area of \nSeattle, when they were nearly struck by a vehicle. The car then \nscreeched to a halt, and several men exited, yelling anti-gay slurs. \nThe couple attempted to run away, but Crelia, who had a broken foot, \nwas unable to move quickly. The attackers descended upon the two men, \nstill hurling epithets as they began to hit them. One assailant \nsnatched the cane Crelia had been using to support his weight and began \nto beat him around the head and face with it. Crelia and Colonna both \nsuffered cuts, bruises and broken bones as a result of the attack. \nPolice have not yet made any arrests, but witnesses have provided \ndescriptions and a license plate for the attackers.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S657-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S657-S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Corporal Duncan C. Crookston\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of CPL \nDuncan Crookston, who died recently at Brook Army Medial Center in \nTexas from wounds he sustained when a roadside blast tore through his \nhumvee on September 4, 2007. The attack killed three other soldiers in \nhis vehicle. When he died on January 25, Duncan was 1 day shy of his \n20th birthday.\n  Corporal Crookston's friends and family gathered at Fort Logan \nNational Cemetery in Denver on Saturday to share their memories of a \nyoung man of extraordinary energy and talent who chose to devote \nhimself to the service of his country. His fellow soldiers say he chose \nthe Army knowing the dangers and accepting the possibility of losing \nhis life. He did his job and ``he met his calling,'' one soldier said.\n  Duncan joined the Army shortly after graduating from Denver West High \nSchool. With his standardized test scores, any university in the \ncountry would have been lucky to have him, but he was committed to \ndoing right by his Nation and by those with whom he served. In the \nArmy, it became immediately clear that he had a mind for engineering \nand electronics, so he became the radio-tech operator in his unit. He \ncould fix almost anything, and in the toughest conditions.\n  For almost 5 months after the Baghdad blast, Corporal Crookston hung \non. His wife Meaghun and his mother Lee stayed by his side at Brook \nArmy Medical Center, helping him in his fight for recovery. His wounds, \nthough, were simply too grave. He had burns over 50 percent of his \nbody, lost both of his legs, his right arm, and his left hand.\n  There was no limit, it seems, to Corporal Crookston's courage. On a \nmission, he always wanted to be out front. In the hospital, he fought \nthe odds to the end.\n  Corporal Crookston's courage is all the more admirable for the fact \nthat he applied it in service to his country, fulfilling his duty with \nhonor. ``You will never do anything in this world without courage,'' \nthe Greek philosopher Aristotle once wrote. ``It is the greatest \nquality of the mind next to honor.''\n  It is hard to imagine a more powerful example of courage than that \nwhich Duncan Crookston and his family demonstrated over the last few \nmonths of his life. There are no words that can capture the pain or \ngrief they must have endured as they battled for his life.\n  To his wife Meaghun, to his father Christopher, to his mother Lee, \nand to\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nhis five brothers, our thoughts and prayers are with you. You have made \na sacrifice that a grateful Nation can never repay. I hope that one day \nyour sorrow will salved by your pride in knowing that Duncan served the \nNation with overwhelming honor, courage, and dignity. He will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S658-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL JUSTIN B. ``JEB'' NEEL\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that today \nI commend a great American and Arkansan on his last day of duty in the \nMarine Corps. Cpl Justin B. ``Jeb'' Neel grew up in Little Rock and \nattended Little Rock Catholic High where he was a member of their \nprestigious and well-known Marine Junior Reserve Officer Training \nCorps. He went on to graduate from the University of Arkansas, my alma \nmater, with his bachelor's of art in criminal justice. He was also a \nmember of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, of which I am a member.\n  Upon his graduation in 2003, Jeb enlisted in the Marine Corps and \nanswered the call to serve his country. After completing boot camp in \nSan Diego, Jeb was assigned to the Marine Barracks in Washington, DC. \nWhile there, Jeb served as a member of the world famous U.S. Marine \nBody Bearer section. This small but vital group is composed of marines \nwithin one of the ceremonial drill companies at the Marine Barracks.\n  As a marine in Bravo Company, Jeb was charged with the difficult duty \nof receiving marines who had been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nEventually, Jeb was called to serve in the global war on terror, and in \nFebruary 2007, he deployed to Al Anbar Province in western Iraq. While \nin Al Anbar, Jeb and his fellow marines performed missions that \nincluded month-long hikes up the Euphrates River searching for weapons \ncaches and fallen marines. They also performed foot patrols in cities \nacross Al Anbar including Fallujah and Hit. By all accounts Jeb and his \nfellow marines greatly contributed to the mission of increasing peace \nand stability for the Iraqi people.\n  Jeb returned from Iraq at the end of 2007 to his strong and \nsupportive family and finished the rest of his military service at Camp \nLejeune. I am proud to have citizens like Jeb from the State of \nArkansas who so valiantly and honorably serve this Nation.\n  I had the pleasure of having breakfast with Jeb before he deployed to \nIraq, and I was truly inspired and impressed by his commitment and duty \nto our country. It is with great thanks that I commend Corporal Neel \nfor his service. Today, Jeb leaves the Marine Corps and moves on to do \nother great things with his life. I think we should all take this \nopportunity to recognize what our service men and women like Jeb Neel \nsacrifice for this great Nation. I thank him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S658-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S658-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S658-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DORGAN, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 310.

A bill to establish a program at the Forest Service and the \nDepartment of the Interior to carry out collaborative ecological \nrestoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on public land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Forest \nLandscape Restoration Act. I developed this bill with Senators Domenici \nand Feinstein, and I am pleased they have joined as cosponsors. The \nbill also is cosponsored by Senators Allard, Wyden, Salazar, Cantwell, \nCraig, Akaka, and Crapo. I also am pleased that Chairman Grijalva will \nbe introducing a companion bill in the House of Representatives, and I \nlook forward to working with him as his subcommittee in the Natural \nResources Committee moves forward with the bill.\n  The bill establishes a program to select and fund projects that \nrestore forests at a landscape scale through a\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\nprocess that encourages collaboration, relies on the best available \nscience, facilitates local economic development, and leverages local \nfunds with national and private funding.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we are facing serious forest health \nand wildfire challenges in many of our National Forests. A century of \nover-aggressive fire suppression, logging, and other land uses have \nsignificantly deteriorated entire landscapes. These conditions have \nplayed an important role in the extraordinary wildfires and insect-\ncaused mortality we have seen on millions of acres of National Forest \nand other lands. To address these problems, it is critical to begin \ntrying to restore our forests at a landscape scale.\n  Landscape-scale restoration is important because, first, it is key to \ncontrolling wildfire suppression costs, which is one of the issues that \nis emphasized in our bill. Wildland fire appropriations have more than \ntripled in the last decade, and we are now spending billions every year \ntrying to suppress fires. We will not be able to get control of the \nballooning costs of fire suppression until we can allow more fires to \nplay their natural, beneficial role in restoring and maintaining \nhealthy, fire-resilient forests. But that will not be possible until we \ncan reduce hazardous fuels and the risk of unnaturally intense fire on \na landscape scale.\n  So, our bill will help to reduce wildfire suppression costs through \nforest restoration.\n  Second, landscape-scale restoration is an important component of \nsuccessful economic development, another issue we have emphasized in \nour bill. In many cases, forest restoration will not be fiscally viable \nunless we can put the byproducts of restoration to economic use. Large-\nscale forest restoration efforts can help to provide economies of \nscale, and long-term efforts can help to provide entrepreneurs with the \nconfidence that encourages investment and initiative.\n  So, our bill will help to make the restoration economy a reality by \nfacilitating the use of restoration byproducts.\n  Third, landscape restoration is necessary for the health of many of \nour forest ecosystems, which also is emphasized in our bill. We need \nhealthy landscapes for a clean, abundant, and controlled water supply. \nWe need them for clean air and carbon sequestration. We need them to \nsupport fish and wildlife. And we need healthy forest ecosystems if \nthey are to have a chance to survive the pressures of climate change. \nFire suppression and other land uses have caused entire forest \nlandscapes to deteriorate, and we cannot reverse that deterioration \nwithout landscape-level restoration.\n  So, our bill provides a unique program to conduct comprehensive \necosystem restoration through landscape-scale treatments.\n  Our bill also builds upon the existing successes in forest \nrestoration by requiring collaboration and the best available science \nto form the foundation for landscape restoration.\n  Despite the importance of landscape-scale restoration, neither the \nNational Fire Plan, nor the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, nor any of \nour other efforts have been very successful in facilitating restoration \nand hazardous fuels reduction on landscape scales. A lack of sufficient \nfunding is one of the primary reasons. Restoring landscapes takes a \nsignificant amount of funding over a significant period of time. That \nhas proven to be beyond the capacity of the local and regional agency \nbudgets.\n  To address this problem, the Forest Landscape Restoration Act \nauthorizes $40 million per year for 10 years to be paid into a national \npool. Eligible landscape restoration projects from around the country \nwould compete for a portion of that money. Forty million dollars is not \nnearly enough money to fund landscape-scale treatments in all of the \nforest landscapes in need of restoration, but it is a realistic amount \nof funding, and it is enough to make landscape-scale restoration a \nreality.\n  Because of funding and other challenges, landscape-scale restoration \nremains largely theoretical. As a result, this legislation is designed \nto be both practical and experimental. It does not redirect existing \nefforts. It instead adds to existing efforts by creating a program that \nwill make planning, funding, and carrying out at least a handful of \nlandscape-scale forest restoration projects possible. If it is \nsuccessful--and I think it will be--we can expand it in the future.\n  I would again like to thank Senators Domenici and Feinstein and the \nother cosponsors of the bill. I appreciate the stakeholders who have \nwritten to support this bill, including the Nature Conservancy--which \nhas been very supportive of our effort--American Forests, the Forest \nGuild, Sustainable Northwest, the Watershed Research and Training \nCenter, and Conservation Northwest. I look forward to working with them \nand the many other stakeholders as we move forward with the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2593\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 443\n\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 2007, nearly 60,000 checks issued \n     by the Department of the Treasury, worth approximately \n     $56,000,000, were endorsed by forgery;\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury receives \n     approximately 1,400,000 inquiries each year regarding \n     problems with paper checks;\n       Whereas, each month, nearly 12,000,000 social security and \n     other Federal benefit payments are made with checks;\n       Whereas the United States would generate approximately \n     $132,000,000 in annual savings if all Federal benefit checks \n     were paid by direct deposit;\n       Whereas the use of direct deposit is a more secure, \n     reliable, and cost-effective method of payment than paper \n     checks because the use of direct deposit--\n       (1) helps protect against identity theft and fraud;\n       (2) provides easier access to funds during emergencies and \n     natural disasters; and\n       (3) provides the people of the United States with more \n     control over their money;\n\n       Whereas the Department of the Treasury and the Federal \n     Reserve Banks have launched Go Direct, a national campaign to \n     motivate people who receive Federal benefit payments to use \n     direct deposit to receive those payments;\n       Whereas Go Direct works with more than 1,100 partners \n     across the Nation, including financial institutions, advocacy \n     groups, and community organizations;\n       Whereas more than 130 financial institutions representing \n     25,000 branches nationwide participated in the 2007 ``Go \n     Direct Champions'' competition to encourage the use of direct \n     deposit among people who receive Federal benefit payments; \n     and\n       Whereas more than 1,600,000 people in the United States \n     have switched from paper checks to direct deposit to receive \n     Federal benefit payments since Go Direct launched in the fall \n     of 2004: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates February 2008 as ``Go Direct Month'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of the Go Direct \n     campaign;\n       (3) commends Federal, State, and local governments, \n     nonprofit agencies, and the private sector for promoting \n     February as Go Direct Month; and\n       (4) encourages people in the United States who are eligible \n     to receive social security or other Federal benefit payments \n     to--\n       (A) participate in events and awareness initiatives held \n     during the month of February with respect to using direct \n     deposit;\n       (B) become informed about the convenience and safety of \n     direct deposit; and\n       (C) consider signing up for direct deposit of social \n     security or other Federal benefit payments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S662-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3980.

Res. 434\n\n       Whereas recent survey data suggests that illegal drug use \n     among youth has declined by 24 percent since 2001;\n       Whereas, despite the reduction in drug use among youth, the \n     number of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who use drugs remains \n     too high and the rates of prescription and over-the-counter \n     drug abuse are alarming;\n       Whereas the overall rate of current illegal drug use among \n     persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, which has remained \n     stable since 2002;\n       Whereas ecstasy (methylenedioxy-\n     methamphetamine, or MDMA) use among high school age youth has \n     been rising since 2004;\n       Whereas, while methamphetamine use is down among 8th, 10th, \n     and 12th graders, many counties across the country still \n     report that methamphetamine is a serious drug problem;\n       Whereas 25 percent of youth in the 10th grade reported the \n     use of marijuana during the past year;\n       Whereas youth who first smoke marijuana under the age of 14 \n     are more than 5 times as likely to abuse drugs in adulthood;\n       Whereas nearly 6 percent of 12th graders have used over-\n     the-counter cough and cold medications in the past year for \n     the purpose of getting high;\n       Whereas Vicodin remains one of the most commonly abused \n     drugs among 12th graders, with 1 in 10 reporting nonmedical \n     use within the past year;\n       Whereas teenagers' and parents' lack of understanding of \n     the potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it even \n     more critical to raise public awareness about the dangers \n     associated with their non-medical use;\n       Whereas the rates of use for any illegal drug are directly \n     related to the perception of harm and social disapproval;\n       Whereas more than 20 years of research has demonstrated \n     that prevention interventions, designed and tested to reduce \n     risk and enhance protective factors, can help children at \n     every step along their developmental path, from early \n     childhood into young adulthood;\n       Whereas prevention efforts should be flexible enough to \n     address and prevent local problems before they become \n     national trends;\n       Whereas research has demonstrated that there are 4 major \n     targets of prevention: youth, parents, schools (including \n     colleges and universities), and communities and social \n     environments that must be reinforced by each other to have \n     the greatest effect in deterring the consequences of drug \n     use;\n       Whereas a comprehensive blend of individually and \n     environmentally focused efforts must be adopted and a variety \n     of strategies must be implemented across multiple sectors of \n     a community to reduce drug use;\n       Whereas community anti-drug coalitions are an essential \n     component of any drug prevention and education campaign \n     because they are data driven, know their community \n     epidemiology, and are capable of understanding and \n     implementing the multi-sector interventions required to \n     reduce the availability and use of drugs;\n       Whereas community anti-drug coalitions help to change \n     community norms, laws, policies, regulations, and procedures \n     to create an environment that discourages the use of drugs;\n       Whereas school-based prevention programs should be part of \n     a comprehensive community wide approach to deal with drug \n     use;\n       Whereas the more successful we are at general prevention of \n     drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to \n     deal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences \n     of their use;\n       Whereas the total economic cost of drug, alcohol, and \n     tobacco abuse in the United States is more than \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the savings per dollar spent on substance abuse \n     prevention rather than on substance abuse treatment are \n     substantial, and can range from $2.00 to $20.00;\n       Whereas there will always be new and emerging drug trends \n     that require additional prevention and education efforts;\n       Whereas preventing drug use before it begins and educating \n     the public about the dangers of drug use is a critical \n     component of what must be a consistent and comprehensive \n     effort to stunt and decrease drug use rates throughout the \n     country;

Mr. President, before we leave, I want to say a couple of \nthings.\n  It is a very important vote we have tomorrow. I want the Senate to \nknow we have received support from all over the country on the Senate \nstimulus package. I picked two of these just to comment on at this \ntime.\n  The Los Angeles Times editorial policy in recent years has not been \nvery progressive in nature, but to date here is what they said:\n\n       It's looking all but certain that Congress will pass an \n     economic stimulus bill before mid-February, which isn't \n     necessarily good news. It's questionable whether handing \n     taxpayers a few hundred bucks each would really jolt a \n     sluggish economy, yet there's no doubt at all that it would \n     increase an already scary national debt. Still, some stimuli \n     are more appealing than others, and if we must have a bill, \n     the Senate has a better plan than the House.\n\n  Among other things, this editorial says:\n\n       The Senate's plan extends unemployment insurance by an \n     additional 13 weeks, provides rebate checks to about 20 \n     million seniors living on Social Security and about 250,000 \n     disabled veterans (neither group would get a penny under the \n     House version), and expands home-heating subsidies. Jobless \n     people and those on fixed incomes are much more likely to \n     spend their rebate checks quickly than those in the middle \n     class, so if the goal is to stimulate spending, this is \n     precisely the population Congress should be targeting.\n       The Senate also addresses one of the biggest failings of \n     last year's energy bill. Wind and solar power installations \n     are growing at a sizzling pace, but that growth is fueled by \n     production tax credits that expire at the end of next year. \n     An extension was stripped from the energy bill because of an \n     unrelated dispute over taxing oil companies. The credits must \n     be extended as quickly as possible because investors won't \n     pump money into clean power if there's a danger of losing \n     their tax incentives. Renewable energy reduces reliance on \n     foreign oil while cutting greenhouse gases and other \n     pollutants; green technology is also an extremely promising \n     growth industry that could help make up for the loss of \n     manufacturing jobs.\n\n  The final paragraph of the editorial is as follows:\n\n       McCain has made much during the campaign about his \n     determination to combat global warming. If he's the man of \n     conviction he claims to be, he should return to Washington \n     and back the Baucus bill.\n\n  That was the Los Angeles Times.\n  Mr. President, now the Arizona Republic, which is a very conservative \npublication. That is an understatement. But here is what they said:\n\n       The economic stimulus package from Congress needs some \n     power. Renewable power. The plan should include an extension \n     of tax credits for renewable-energy sources, such as wind, \n     solar and geothermal.\n       We would get a three-for-one impact: creating jobs, \n     diversifying our energy supply, and reducing pollution.\n       These aren't new tax credits. They're existing ones that \n     are serving us well. Last year, nearly 6,000 megawatts of \n     renewable energy came on line. That injected $20 billion into \n     the economy. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this bill that came out of the Finance Committee, \nwhich we will vote on tomorrow, is a good piece of legislation--the \nArizona Republic, the Los Angeles Times--and we have had support from \nall over the country.\n  I will quote directly from the President's State of the Union Address \nwhen he said:\n\n       We should allow State housing agencies to issue tax free \n     bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. \n     (Applause.)\n\n  This was greeted by applause.\n\n       These are difficult times for many American families, and \n     by taking these steps, we can help more of them to keep their \n     homes.\n\n  That is in our bill.\n  We are going to have an opportunity at a quarter to 6 tomorrow to \nvote on this package. We are not going to pick and choose which of \nthese provisions on a bipartisan basis is placed in the bill. Are we \ngoing to throw overboard the seniors? No, they are part of the package. \nAre we going to throw under the bus disabled veterans? No. Are we going \nto do away with these business provisions that the business community \nloves because it will create jobs? Are we going to throw over the \nhomebuilders who are in Washington trying to get this package passed? \nNo. It is important. It is important because it will stop foreclosures. \nIt will help an industry that is in peril. Are we going to tell people \nwho are unemployed, some of whom have been unemployed for a long period \nof time, that we are not going to help them, we are going to strip them \nout of the package?\n  Everything we have in this bill is good. We have to go to conference \nanyway because there is a provision in here dealing with people who are \nundocumented and getting benefits.\n  This is a program, it is a package, it is a good package. That is why \nwe have had support from all over the country as to how much better it \nis than the proposal we got from the House. Is there anything wrong \nwith the House bill? No, not as far as it goes; it just didn't go far \nenough. Democrats will vote for this bill, all 51 Democrats will vote \nfor this, but I plead with my Republican friends, this is an important \npiece of legislation, not for Democrats, not for Republicans, it is for \nthe American people.\n  I was called by one of my Senators this afternoon. He said he talked \nwith one of the Republican Senators, one of the senior Senators, and \nsaid: Can you support us? He said: No, I can't because the Republican \nleader said at our conference today that he thinks we will have an \nopportunity to put in the seniors.\n  Democrats are not willing to throw overboard the very needy people \nwho we believe should be part of this package. It is a package and it \nis a good package. Are my Republican colleagues going to tell the \nunemployed it is unnecessary they get help? Are they going to tell the \nbusiness community this is not necessary now? I am not going to go \nthrough all the provisions of the legislation, but it is good, it is a \npackage. And my Republican colleagues, nine of them, we need nine of \nthem. We know we have three from the Finance Committee, and I hope we \nhave some other brave souls who will do the right thing for the \nAmerican people and not follow the path that for 7 years has led this \ncountry into a period of where today--the last report I got is the Dow \nJones was down about 350 points. Up and down--it is very bad for the \neconomy.\n  My Republican colleagues should understand that the White House has \ndone the country and not done the Republicans any favors during these \npast 7 years. The economy is in a deep trip south, and we have to do \nwhat we can to rectify that situation. It would help if we passed our \npackage. I cannot imagine why they would keep walking over that cliff \nas a result of what this President is telling them to do. It is \ndisaster for them. It is disaster for the American people. And nine of \nthem should step forward and do the right thing.\n  Senator Grassley supports this package. Senator Grassley is one of \nthe most conservative Members in this entire Senate. He is doing it \nbecause it is the right thing to do. This gentleman farmer is a great \nlegislator. My Republican colleagues, support this man, support the \nranking member of the Finance Committee. It would be good for our \ncountry, good for our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/05/senate-section/article/S672-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.
