Mr. President, we have a very busy schedule this week. We \nhave some work we need to complete. We have, of course, FISA, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act; we have the supplemental \nappropriations bill; we have the tax extenders; we have Medicare we \nneed to complete; and, of course, we are on housing today. Regarding \nthat, following any remarks I make and those of the Republican leader, \nwe will return to the House message to accompany H.R. 3221, the housing \nreform legislation. There will be up to an hour of debate equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees prior \nto a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Dodd-Shelby substitute \nwith respect to the housing reform bill. Senators have until 10:30 a.m. \ntoday to file amendments to the Dodd-Shelby substitute.\n  By virtue of the previous order, the Senate will be in recess from \n12:30 until 2:15 today for our weekly business luncheons.\n  Mr. President, let me say a couple of other things. We are going to \ndo a number of judges this afternoon, the exact number of which we \ndon't have worked out just yet, but we are going to do three circuit \ncourt judges and some district court judges. I have to confer with \nSenator Leahy on the number of district court judges.\n  I would also say to my friend the distinguished Republican leader \nthat I spoke to Senator Feingold this morning regarding the FEC \nnominations, and it appears very clear we should be able to do them \ntoday. In regard to that, I wish to underscore my desire--our desire--\nto constitute the Federal Election Commission so it is working.\n  Just a brief history, Mr. President. Before Memorial Day, there were \nfour FEC nominations pending--two Republicans, two Democrats. At that \ntime, we offered to confirm those nominees by unanimous consent. The \nRepublicans did not take me up on that offer. There would have been \nfive FEC Commissioners today had that been done. In fact, it would have \nbeen prior to that recess. There would have been enough to conduct all \nofficial business. There was a thought, I assume, on the part of the \nRepublicans that they wanted a full six, and I understand that. So they \nrejected the offer I made. They wanted to wait until a replacement for \nthe failed nomination of Hans von Spakovsky was received in the Senate. \nI told the Republicans in December that von Spakovsky would not be \napproved by this body. Someone should have been cleared to replace him \nlong before now. Nonetheless, I pledged to swiftly move that new \nnominee, and we have done that. I implored my Republican colleagues to \nconfirm the four who were ready to go so there would be five to restore \nthe agency so it would be workable. That offer was not accepted. The \nnew nominee has now been nominated, and we have waived both the hearing \nand the markup to speed this up. That makes good\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\non the pledge we made to swiftly review the nominee, and we did that, \nagain without a hearing and without a markup.\n  As I discussed on Friday, Senator Feingold--I didn't mention his name \nat the time, but it is out in the press since then--would like to meet \nwith each of the nominees. That will be completed today. These meetings \nare important to the Senator. He has the right to do that. I certainly \ncompliment him for caring so much. Four of the five FEC nominations now \npending are relatively new to the Senate, and it is certainly within \nSenator Feingold's right to speak with them prior to their \nconfirmation. This is not unusual. So I look forward to completing \nthat, unless something comes up that I don't understand, and we should \nbe able to do that today. It is very important.\n  There has been some concern raised by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that the Democrats have set out to delay this FEC being \nreconstituted so that the Democratic National Committee's lawsuit \nagainst Senator McCain may be heard in the court. The DNC sued McCain, \nalleging that he violated campaign finance laws in the treatment of his \nprimary campaign funding. The court dismissed that suit without \nprejudice, saying the DNC needed to give the FEC 120 days to act on its \ncomplaint before coming to court. The 120 days expires today, June 24.\n  There is simply no truth to the argument that we are playing this \ngame with the FEC. Democrats have been trying to get the FEC running \nsince it went dark in December. Repeatedly, the Republicans have \nobjected to consent request after consent request. This lawsuit of the \nDNC's has been out there many months. The decision for setting the \ndeadline for FEC action was made prior to our Memorial Day recess, and \nthe offer to confirm the pending nominations was made before that time.\n  What this means is that Democrats offered to confirm the four pending \nFEC nominees--which would have stopped the DNC suit--before Memorial \nDay. If we were trying to help the DNC's suit, would we have made that \noffer? I don't think so. Would we offer to waive the hearing and the \nmarkup for both Republican nominees so it would be moved quickly? The \nanswer would be no. Of course we wouldn't have done that, Mr. \nPresident. As I have told my colleagues, Democrats want a functional \nagency as soon as possible. That could have happened in May. It could \nhappen today. We want to do everything we can to reconstitute the FEC. \nIt is extremely important to do that.\n  I have mentioned the matters we need to complete, and, of course, the \none thing I didn't mention was the FAA extension. I asked unanimous \nconsent to do that, and that was objected to yesterday by my friend \nSenator Kyl on behalf of Senator DeMint. I hope we can get that done. \nThe House is going to pass that today as a temporary extension.\n  We also are going to bring before the body, within the next 24 hours, \nthe PEPFAR legislation. What is that? It is the AIDS legislation that \nthe President is in favor of and which we have been trying to move. It \nhas been held up on the other side by a Senator or two, and we hope we \ncan complete that. Again, I will ask unanimous consent that be passed \ntoday. It is my understanding, having spoken with Senator Enzi, that he \nand Senator Biden have worked something out on that, and hopefully the \nSenator on the other side who is objecting to this will no longer \nobject to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S5974-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with regard to the Federal Election \nCommission, let me first say that my good friend the majority leader is \ncorrect that I was not inclined to reconstitute the FEC with a three-\nto-two Democratic majority, and that would have been, of course, the \ncase had we gone forward on some but not all of the FEC nominations \nback before Memorial Day. So it is a fact that, in addition to \nobjecting to Republican nominees of the FEC, which has become something \nof a tradition around here, there was an additional attempt to gain a \nmajority on the FEC by acting prematurely, before we could confirm a \nfull complement.\n  Now we have the opportunity to confirm a full complement, and there \nhave been various efforts, it appears, to delay in order to give the \nDNC an opportunity to file a lawsuit today. Maybe I will be proven \nwrong today. Maybe they won't file that lawsuit, and then I will feel \ncomforted that the effort to delay confirming all six--or the four \nadditional FEC members whom we are confirming--was not somehow related \nto litigation being proposed by the DNC. So I hope they will not file \nthat lawsuit, and I guess that will be the best evidence of whether \nthere was an effort underway here to delay it.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the majority leader indicates we can \nconfirm these nominees today, and I have given him advance notice that \nI would like to propound a unanimous consent agreement that we do just \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed, at \nsome point today mutually agreeable to the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader, to executive session for the consideration of the \nfollowing Federal Election Commission nominations: Calendar No. 306, \nSteven T. Walther; Calendar No. 624, Cynthia L. Bauerly; Calendar No. \n625, Caroline C. Hunter; and Calendar No. 626, Donald F. McGahn; and \nthe nomination of Matthew S. Petersen, which is to be discharged from \nthe Rules Committee.\n  I would further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be \nconfirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nfinally, the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I hope in a \nmatter of hours that we can agree to the consent request proposed by my \nfriend, the distinguished Republican leader. I don't know what time the \nlast meeting is that Senator Feingold has with the last individual, but \nas soon as I get word on that, I will immediately come to the floor and \naccept the offer of the distinguished Republican leader. So I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my good \nfriend the majority leader, and I hope we will be able to confirm these \nnominees today. Also, hopefully the lawsuit by the DNC will not be \nfiled today, further raising the suspicion that the delays of the \nmajority were related to facilitating that legal action.\n  Mr. President, let me say with regard to this week that this is a \nweek when the Senate, hopefully, can make significant progress. There \nare three very significant pieces of legislation we hope to deal with \nthis week, as the majority leader indicated.\n  After a failed attempt to address the housing crisis without \nRepublican input, Democrats finally agreed last week to allow our \ninput. As a result, we now have a bipartisan housing bill that \naddresses many of our concerns. I think it could be made even better \nwith some further amendments, which I am hopeful we will have an \nopportunity to offer, even if cloture is invoked, because as much as I \nwould like to see this bill move forward, there are some housing-\nrelated amendments that have been shut out of the process so far, and I \nam hoping the majority leader and I can discuss how we might be able to \ndispose of those expeditiously before we clear that bill here in the \nSenate this week.\n  We must also complete two important and long overdue national \nsecurity measures--the supplemental troop funding bill that the \nPresident first requested more than 500 days ago and an updated \nterrorist surveillance bill that the Senate first approved last August \nbut which expired more than 4 months ago, after House Democratic \ninaction. It is worth noting that on both national security measures, \nDemocrats will be approving something Republicans have supported all \nalong.\n  Regarding the supplemental, Republicans have argued for the past year\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\nand a half that Congress has a solemn duty to fund our troops while \nthey are on the field of battle. Regarding FISA, Republicans have \nargued for more than a year that the intelligence community should have \nthe tools it needs to listen in on conversations between terrorists \noverseas and that companies that may have allowed them to do so should \nnot be punished for helping.\n  I remain hopeful the Senate will be able to get these important \nissues accomplished this week, and maybe a bipartisan Medicare \nagreement as well, and other matters that can be dealt with. It is \ninteresting how quickly the Senate can move when there is a broad \nbipartisan consensus behind measures. It may have taken a while for our \nfriends on the other side to come around to our view and the view of \nmost Americans on these issues, but for the sake of our troops, our \nfamilies, and our security, we are glad they finally did. I hope the \nmajority leader and I, working together, can figure a way through this \nmassive amount of legislation in a very few days that allows us to \nreach a successful conclusion on many legislative fronts that will give \nboth sides an opportunity to leave here at the end of the week \nbelieving this was a week of significant accomplishment for the Senate \nand for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S5975-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5975-S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \ntemporarily the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 5003, my \namendment to eliminate the FHA reverse mortgage cap.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I am frustrated \nthat we have not been allowed to call up germane amendments for the \npast few days. This is a substantial piece of legislation and Senators \nshould have had the opportunity to have up and down votes. I have filed \nfour amendments and I would like to talk briefly about two of them that \ndeal with the merchant card reporting requirement.\n  In an effort to find revenue offsets, I am concerned that Congress is \nrushing to adopt a flawed merchant card reporting proposal that \nestablishes a new tax compliance burden on small business and does not \nprovide enough time to develop and implement this new system. Little is \nreally known about the true costs of this proposal and the Finance \nCommittee hasn't had an opportunity to have the IRS demonstrate in a \nhearing that the information collected could be used in a meaningful \nway to drive tax compliance.\n  The merchant card reporting proposal would require that the \ninstitution that makes the payment to the merchant--payment \nfacilitator--for a payment card--both credit cards and debit cards--\nreport annually to the Internal Revenue Service--IRS--the name, \naddress, and aggregate amounts of payments for the calendar year of \neach participating merchant. Additionally, the payment facilitator or \nthe electronic payment organization must validate the taxpayer \nidentification number--TIN--of the participating merchant. If the \nnumber does not match, then the payment facilitator or the electronic \npayment organization must withhold 28-percent from the merchant.\n  This unprecedented level of reporting to the Federal Government will \nlikely impose substantial implementation costs that will be passed on \nto many compliant small business taxpayers. Small business owners will \nalso have to ensure that their records conform with the additional \ninformation reported by the merchant card processor. This is an \nadditional compliance step, which will add to the already high cost of \ntax compliance for small business owners, who currently spend on \naverage over $74 per hour to meet tax paperwork and compliance burdens \nthat already exist.\n  The structure of the merchant card system does not make complying \nwith the proposal feasible in a couple of years. Merchants are not \ncurrently identified in systems by social security numbers or taxpayer \nidentification numbers. Instead, merchants are generally assigned a \nmerchant identification number. If implemented, this proposal would \nrequire institutions to spend several years trying to match merchants \nto social security numbers of taxpayer identification numbers.\n  I appreciate the fact that the underlying legislation extends the \neffective date for reporting to December 31, 2011, and the effective \ndate for backup withholding to December 31, 2012. However, I do not \nbelieve this provides enough time to make the changes to existing \nsystems and processes, build and test new reporting systems, perform \ntaxpayer identification number matching, and hire and train the \npersonnel needed to implement and comply with the new reporting \nrequirements.\n  In addition, a higher dollar reporting threshold is necessary to \neliminate reporting on casual sellers rather than persons engaged in \nbusiness, and it should be granted to all payment settlement entities.\n  My preference would be that we strike this section until we identify \nthe costs to business, the total costs of implementing the new \nreporting regime with the IRS, and the ability of the IRS to use the \ninformation in a meaningful way to close the tax gap. If that amendment \nis defeated, then the Senate should provide an additional year to \nimplement this system. But as I indicated, we will not have an \nopportunity to vote on these amendments or other amendments that other \nSenators want to bring because we have been stopped from calling up \ngermane amendments as we move forward on this legislation.\n\n  As I indicated, I also tried to bring up several other amendments--an \namendment to reduce the $300 billion loan authority to $68 billion, \nwhich is the number that CBO expects the FHA refinancing program to \nactually utilize, and the number that was used to\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\ncalculate the score of the new program. Yet we will not be allowed to \nmatch the projections to the reality of the legislation.\n  I also asked permission to bring up my amendment, No. 5003, to \neliminate the FHA reverse mortgage cap, something which this Senate \nfloor has already voted to do and which was in the FHA modernization \nlegislation that this Senate has already passed. Yet it is now not \nincluded in this legislation, and we are not going to be given an \nopportunity, once again, to include it.\n  There is important material in this legislation that needs to move \nforward, but the legislation also contains serious flaws. I am \nconcerned that the process we are following has not allowed this Senate \nto truly work its will on this legislation as it moves forward.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I may offer amendment No. 5020.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5020\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am sorry to see objection has been \nraised. This is the amendment that we are trying to get brought up on \nthe housing bill that passed with an 88-to-8 vote in the Senate the \nlast time we were considering the housing bill. This is the tax bill \nthat will extend the renewable energy tax credits for the United \nStates. It includes solar, wind, geothermal, and many other forms of \nrenewable energy that are so important at this time of high energy \nprices in the United States. It seems absolutely ridiculous to this \nSenator that with an amendment that passed 88 to 8 in the Senate, one \nof the few bipartisan actions we have taken for a long time around \nhere, that there would be objection to adding it onto this bill.\n  So over the next couple of days, I want to let the managers of this \nbill know that there are some procedural things that can go on so it is \ngoing to take them a little more time to get this bill done than they \nwould otherwise have liked to have done.\n  I alert them this Senator will be exercising his full rights to try \nto get this renewable energy tax credit put on this bill.\n  So it is a critical piece of legislation. It is not only critical to \nget it done, it is critical to get it done soon, because a lot of jobs \nin the United States are going to be lost if these contracts cannot be \nlet out for a lot of the projects in renewable energy across the \ncountry. There are a lot of people out there right now, whether they \nget their financing put together or not, who are looking to see if the \nSenate will extend the renewable energy tax credits.\n  This is an amendment Senator Cantwell and I have worked on together. \nWe are pushing this any way we can to get this thing done. I applaud \nher for her efforts. But it is absolutely critical that this body act \nat a time when we can create jobs, we can produce more green energy for \nthe United States, and we can become less dependent on foreign sources \nof energy.\n  This is a small part of the energy package but an important part of \nthe energy package that we need to put together. We are going to \ncontinue to work on this.\n  I see my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Cantwell, is \non the floor. I will yield the floor so she can make some comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I actually applaud the Senator from \nNevada in trying to move this amendment onto this bill. I say that \nknowing some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are frustrated, \nbut the American people are frustrated with the high costs of energy. \nThey want us to be doing all we can to try to help alleviate those \nenergy bills that are going to be affecting them not just this summer \nbut next winter as they see higher home heating bills.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I are trying to say to our colleagues, it \nis important not to have this energy legislation tied up in a larger \nbill that is not currently moving before we adjourn for the July \nrecess.\n  We are already seeing jobs being canceled, projects being canceled, \npeople laid off, and generation not being ready to be put onto the grid \nto help assist with high energy costs, particularly in the area of \nnatural gas.\n  The underlying amendment Senator Ensign and I are talking about \ngiving tax credits to individual homeowners so they can make \nimprovements to their homes, and it can result in more than a 20-\npercent savings in their heating bills this winter. Those are \nimprovements, I guarantee you, we need to be making because many people \nin the Northeast are not going to be able to afford the high energy \ncosts they are going to be seeing.\n  In addition, it puts additional megawatts onto the grid, not just in \n2008, 2009, but for many decades to come. We need to diversify off the \nhigh costs of natural gas. The point is that natural gas costs are \ncontinuing to rise with other pressures. We need to diversify off of \nnatural gas and coal as the primary source for our electricity grid. \nThe fact is this produces and saves about $20 billion in natural gas \nbecause of the production we would get onto the electricity grid. We \nneed to be doing this now.\n  We already know the result of our delay, that we have cost jobs in \nAmerica, projects have been canceled, people have been laid off. We \nalready know it is costing us in lost time and investment to stimulate \nour economy, and now we know it is also going to cost us in higher \nenergy rates to our consumers. So I am for any plan that will get this \nenergy legislation untangled from other bills and actually approved by \nthe House and the Senate. My colleague and I are willing to work across \nthe aisle and across the Rotunda with people who have any ideas how to \nget this done--either paid for or not paid for.\n  But we simply cannot stand here today and say this is a vehicle that \nshould move without trying to put this housing and energy package \ntogether, since it is the underlying bill, and we do think it is \nstimulative to the economy.\n  I say to my colleagues that the return on investment of this \ninvestment in energy is a far greater ROI than some of the other \nstimulative activities we have done. So if we want to be true to our \nconsumers' anxiety about the high cost of energy they are seeing, not \nonly in gasoline but what they think is coming ahead, then we need to \nmove. We need to stop holding up good energy legislation while we are \ntrying to use it to get other legislation.\n  I hope we can pass this bill out of the Senate before we leave for \nthe July recess.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, for a number of months now I have been \ntrying, with the help of both Democrats and Republicans, to bring a \nLIHEAP bill onto the floor. The reason for that\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\nis, with the energy crisis we are now facing and the cost of home \nheating fuel and electricity escalating, there is no doubt in my mind \nthat both in warm-weather States this summer and cold-weather States \nnext winter, there are going to be people struggling for their lives.\n  Without air-conditioning, people--old people, frail people, sick \npeople--are going to have a hard time when the temperature gets above \n100 degrees. What we are seeing all over this country are unprecedented \nnumbers of homes being shut off from electricity because people cannot \npay their bills.\n  We remember some years back, in Chicago, hundreds and hundreds of \nelderly people died from heat exhaustion because of the heat in their \napartments. We must not allow that to happen again.\n  LIHEAP, of course, pays electric bills to help people keep their air-\nconditioning on when the temperature becomes very high. Clearly, in my \nState of Vermont and throughout the whole northern tier of this \ncountry, there is great fear right now--I should tell you that--not \njust about $4.10-a-gallon gas prices today--people worry about that, \nbut they worry about what is going to happen next winter when the price \nof home heating fuel is soaring.\n  So I have tried, and will continue to try, working with people in a \nbipartisan manner to get a vote on the floor. The simple truth is, we \nhave a lot of support from Republicans and Democrats, progressives and \nconservatives. People understand the significance of this issue. We are \ngoing to do our best to get a vote on the floor as soon as we possibly \ncan.\n  In the last couple months, we have had large numbers of Republicans \nand Democrats coming together on bipartisan legislation. We are going \nto keep up that effort.\n  So I wished to mention to my friends this is an issue of great \nimportance, I believe, to the American people all over this country. \nPeople are fearful about what happens when the weather goes down below \nzero, and people are worried about what happens when the temperature \ngoes up over 100 degrees.\n  In this country, we do not want to see people dying of heat \nexhaustion and we do not want to see people freezing to death. With the \ncost of home heating fuel soaring, electricity soaring, we have a moral \nobligation to significantly expand LIHEAP funding. I will continue to \ndo my best to make sure, finally, we get a vote on the floor of the \nSenate to do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand I have 6 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me make a couple observations.\n  First of all, I see my colleague from Vermont in the Chamber. I, once \nagain, commend him for his strong interest--a shared interest I have--\nin the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and our effort to, \none way or another, get to this matter, given the importance of this \nissue to all of us.\n  Let me, if I can, review the bidding a little bit as to where we are. \nThis morning, there are two new reports out that relate directly to the \nsubject matter that is before the Senate: the housing crisis, which is \nat the heart of the economic crisis; the foreclosure issue is, of \ncourse, the heart of the housing issue.\n  As I pointed out over the last number of days, we now have a \nstaggering number of foreclosure filings on a daily basis in the \ncountry. The latest report shows that 8,427, on average, filings for \nforeclosure are occurring on a daily basis--not on a weekly or monthly \nbasis. But every single day in this country between 8,000 and 9,000 \npeople are filing for foreclosure on their homes. This is obviously a \nstatistic that is deeply troubling and an indication of broader \nproblems in our economy.\n  In fact, this morning, one report has the consumer confidence levels \nat the lowest since they have been recorded in 1967--40 years. People's \nanticipation about the future, about the well-being of their children \nor their grandchildren, their ability to own a home, to raise a family, \nto be able to meet their obligations, to be able to retire with \ndignity, to be able to afford higher education--all these things \nworking families in this country historically, for the most part, have \nbeen optimistic and confident about, today, are showing the lowest \nlevel in 40 years.\n  So the issue we are grappling with is not one that is necessarily \ngoing to guarantee we are going to right the problems overnight, but it \nis a reflection that this body--made up of Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents--can, in fact, come together and do something constructive \nand positive at the epicenter of our economic problems.\n  That is the opportunity we are going to have in a few short moments, \nto decide whether to go forward and adopt legislation that would allow \nus to begin to put a tourniquet on the hemorrhaging of foreclosures in \nthis country with the adoption of the HOPE for Homeowners Act, to be \nable to do something about the government-sponsored enterprises and to \nsee to it we have a strong regulator, and to establish, for the first \ntime ever, a permanent affordable housing program.\n  There is a lead story in the New York Times this morning that talks \nabout families who have had their children going to four and five and \neight different schools in a school year in some cases because they \nhave had to move out of rental properties as the costs have moved up. \nSo the affordable housing issue, while it is not directly related to \nthe foreclosure crisis, does deal with the issue of affordable, decent \nshelter in this country. The fact that families are having to move as \nfrequently as they do and their children are having to go to as many \ndifferent schools in a year as they do because of the cost of housing \nis a problem we address with this legislation as well.\n  There is nothing that is as important as this bill for the country at \nthis moment. That is not to say there are not other issues we ought to \nbe grappling with. But there is a great danger we will miss the \nopportunity of doing something about housing in this country.\n  The Case-Shiller index now indicates--and I quote them this morning:\n\n       The S/Case-Shiller home-price indexes, a closely watched \n     gauge of U.S. home prices, show price declines continued to \n     get steeper in April, with prices in every region surveyed \n     now showing year-over-year drops.\n\n  Those predictions indicate we may have as much as a 30-percent \ndecline in home values. That is evaporating the long built-up equity \npeople have acquired as a result of purchasing their homes and holding \non to them.\n  So that idea of selling your home one day after your children are \ngrown to provide for your long-term security, to deal with the cost of \nhigher education, to deal with an unpredictable health care crisis that \ncould emerge--today we have almost 15 million homes in this country \nwhere debt exceeds equity, and those numbers are predicted to grow \nsteeper and steeper, as the Case-Shiller report this morning indicates.\n  So the level of optimism, the declining value of homes, and the \nserious problems in rental housing--all this is contributing to the \nmost serious economic crisis we have had in decades.\n  What Senator Shelby and I and the other 19 members of our committee \nhave tried to do is to put together, on a bipartisan basis, with a 19-\nto-2 vote out of our committee--not a highly divided committee, having \nheld almost 50 different hearings over the last year as to what we \nought to do to get our hands around this issue--our best recommendation \nto the Members of this body. Those of us on the committee, working \ntogether--all 21 of us on this committee--have tried to fashion and \ncobble together a proposal that deals with the heart of this issue.\n  So with the remaining minutes we have to debate this subject matter \nbefore the vote at around 11:15--in the next 5, 6 or 7 minutes--I urge \nmy colleagues to join with us. We are not telling you what we have \nwritten is perfect. We are not telling you it is going to solve all the \nproblems. If it does nothing more than to restore some\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\nconfidence the American people ought to have in their Congress, that in \nitself will be an achievement.\n  Beyond that confidence and optimism, we think we have recommended \nsome specific ideas that can very well begin to treat the problem of \ngrowing foreclosures, declining values in our homes, and the spread and \ncontagion effect this is having on student loans, municipal finance, \ncorporate finance, and the rest, in our Nation and around the world as \nwell. This issue is going beyond our own shores.\n  So we urge our colleagues to join with us, and over the remainder of \ntoday, as these various amendments are offered, to keep our eye on the \nball. The idea is to get a bill done, to work out our differences with \nthe other body, and then to give a bill to the President of the United \nStates, I would hope, by the Fourth of July, by Independence Day. What \nbetter gift on independence could we give the American people than a \nsense that this, their Congress of the United States, can come \ntogether, despite political differences, and craft legislation to make \na difference for our country.\n  I urge the adoption of the motion when the question is asked.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama controls \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe all time has been yielded back. We \nare prepared to move forward.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, pursuant \nto rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the amendment of the House, striking section 1 and \n     all that follows through the end of title V, and inserting \n     certain language, to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. \n     3221, the Foreclosure Prevention Act, with amendment No. \n     4983.\n         Harry Reid, Christopher J.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the knowledge of all the Senators here, \nwe are trying to wrap up a number of items today. Today is Tuesday. We \nhave to get out of here by Friday or Saturday, we would hope, at least. \nWe have a lot to do. We need to complete what we are working on now, \nthe housing legislation. We have a number of issues we are trying to \nwork out on judges. We also have to confirm the FEC nominees. We hope \nto do that later today. We have FISA that we have to work out. We have \na supplemental appropriations bill. We have the doctors fix on \nMedicare. We have the tax extenders. We are working on all these \nthings, so a lot of balls are in the air. I hope Members would be \ncooperative and try to work through this.\n  The Republican leader talked to me today, I have spoken to the \nmanager on our side on the housing legislation, and he has spoken to \nthe other manager, Senator Shelby--I haven't had that opportunity--and \nwhat we are trying to work out on that is, apparently, there are a \nnumber of Senators who asked that consideration be given by the \nmanagers to having a finite number of housing-related matters, reviewed \nby the two managers. That is something we are trying to do to see if we \ncan work out something to speed up the work we are doing on the housing \nbill. I hope we can do that. If we have the cooperation of Members, we \ncan do that. If people dig in their heels and say we are not going to \ndo that, we might be in a situation where we don't finish the housing \nlegislation. That would be a shame, but that is certainly possible. \nThere is the potential to still have a number of other cloture votes on \nthe housing legislation. So we are trying to work that out. I hope we \ncan do that. The two managers I talked about before have experience and \nunderstand what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Oil Exploration\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I have spoken \nextensively over the past several months about the growing threat of \nour dependence on foreign oil. Two weeks ago, we were reminded of the \nthreat by new trade deficit numbers showing a $4.4 billion deficit \nincrease in just 1 month as a result of growing oil prices and growing \noil imports. Last week, the Wall Street\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\nJournal reported that six Arab economies took in $400 billion in oil \nand gas revenues last year alone. The Journal also reported that \npetroleum-producing states are investing more of their oil wealth at \nhome, triggering an investment and spending boom in the Middle East.\n  But as our reliance on foreign oil grows, 85 percent of our offshore \nacreage in the continental United States is still off limits for \nleasing, as are 62 percent of onshore oil reserves. Let no one tell you \nthat we have plenty of American acreage leased for energy development \nbecause compared to the rest of the world, we are falling behind, and \nit is making us poor and poorer and poorer. Since the Senate last voted \non my proposal to increase production, it was estimated that America \nlikely sent about $50 billion overseas to import oil.\n  What is particularly troubling to me is that after rejecting a \nproposal I submitted on behalf of myself and 20 other Senators to open \nnew areas for production, the majority has come up with excuse after \nexcuse for not taking any action.\n  First, without any evidence to back them up, they claimed that price \ngouging was the reason for high prices. At the same time, they said \nhigh prices were not caused by supply-and-demand issues, they told \nAmerica that we must stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nbecause the 70,000 barrels a day that went into it were raising the \nprice of gas. Suspending the SPR fill is something I have supported, \nbut I also said we need to do much more. It alone is practically \nnothing. Unfortunately, advocates of this SPR suspension in the \nmajority rejected a proposal to open areas of production that would \nbring online more than 2 million barrels of oil a day.\n  Now the other side has apparently settled on an argument that first \noriginated with the Wilderness Society. They claim oil companies are \nsitting on their leases and that if those companies just developed in \nthose areas, we would not need to open new areas. If only that were \ntrue, Mr. President. The other side is now saying the oil companies \nmust use it or lose it when it comes to their leases. They propose \nadding a tax on companies to punish them for not producing fast enough.\n  This Wilderness Society argument demonstrates a fundamental lack of \nunderstanding of how we explore for oil and gas in this country, and \nthe fact that this argument originates with a group that has led four \nmajor lawsuits in the last 4 years to prevent development in the very \nsame area speaks to how disingenuous it really is. Part of the reason \nit takes so long for companies to produce is because groups such as the \nWilderness Society keep throwing up roadblocks. They know it; we know \nit.\n  Today, I am going to tackle this idea that companies are choosing to \nsit on their leases, and I will debunk that once and for all.\n  First, let's consider the logic. Companies are paying a lot of money \nfor the right to explore on a lease and are given a short period of \ntime to produce oil. With the cost of oil now at $135 a barrel, why on \nEarth would a lessee intentionally sit on a lease and choose not to \nmake money on it? Why would a company pay money essentially to rent a \ntract of land and then not use it?\n  I have heard the claim that 41 million acres are leased on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and of that acreage, 33 million acres are not being \nproduced. The use of this statistic shows a fundamental lack of \nunderstanding of the long, risky procedure and process that begins even \nbefore bidding on a lease and hopefully ends with production. The other \nside is saying that unless oil is literally coming out of the ground on \nan acre, it doesn't count, even if that acre is being explored or is in \nthe process of getting environmental permits or in any other part of a \nprocess that is very long and tedious. Additionally, the use of this \nargument by groups who consistently go to court to prevent developing \non existing lease areas speaks volumes about the intent here.\n  Congress currently restricts access to 574.2 million acres of OCS. In \nactuality, it is clear by any measurable assessment that the majority \nin Congress is sitting on far more oil than the oil companies \nthemselves. Let me repeat that. It is clear by any measurable \nassessment that the majority in Congress is sitting on far more oil \nthan the oil companies themselves.\n  Let's focus on offshore Federal leases for a moment. Simply examining \nthe number of acres leased and the number of acres producing during a \nsnapshot of time is deceptive. There are many different steps for \nproducing oil and gas. At any given moment, a lease may not be \nproducing, but it is active and under development. In the 5, 8, or 10 \nyears that a company holds a lease--and they are given a specific \nperiod of time--environmental assessments could be underway, lessees \ncould be trying to secure permits, the leasing agency could be \nchallenged in litigation, and the lessee could be reviewing seismic \ndata. In fact, any number of preproduction processes could be underway. \nThese take time. These require experts. These cost money.\n  I do not hear critics suggest that we speed this up or that we waive \nor shorten environmental requirements--and I am not suggesting that \neither. But critics do want to impose new costs on U.S. producers under \nthe guise of ``speeding up leases.'' This tax and spend solution to a \nsupply and demand problem makes no sense. And, once again, the other \nside proposes a solution that threatens our competitiveness with \nnationalized oil companies who are after the same commodity around the \nworld. My friends on the other side of the aisle are fond of saying \nthat we can't drill our way out of the problem--and they are right. But \nmy message back to them is that we can't tax our way out of the problem \neither, and that is exactly what they keep proposing to do.\n  Second, there are many up-front costs that leaseholders take on to \nacquire an oil and gas lease. Bonus payments and pre-production rental \npayments often cost millions of dollars and these capital investments \nare only being made for the ultimate development and production of oil \nto return a profit on investment. Simply put, if oil is not produced \nfrom a lease, companies lose money on it.\n  Third, using these acreage numbers to claim that companies are \n``sitting on'' $135 oil simply ignores the historical fact that simply \nbecause you lease lands does of necessarily mean that you are able \ntechnically or economically to produce on them--or even that there is \noil under your lease. Hence the term: ``exploratory well.''\n  Ironically, some of the very same people who are arguing that these \nleases are not being developed also opposed an inventory of new areas \nthat would clearly speed the development process when they are opened.\n  To suggest that companies are not diligently developing their leases \non the American deep sea is to simply ignore the facts. Over the past \ndecade, more than 100 new discoveries have been announced and since the \npassage of the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act 13 years ago, offshore oil \nproduction has increased by 535 percent. Over the past months, three \nmajor sales for OCS oil and gas leases have taken place and together \nraised more than $9 billion in federal revenues. Under the oppositions \nargument--that is a lot of money companies are paying to sit on leases.\n  I have had the opportunity to review the data provided by one company \nthat holds leases--BP. BP has 124 leases that are actively producing. \nThose are the only ones that the majority is counting when they give \nyou their statistics of producing leases. But BP also has 459 leases \nthat are in the exploration phase, So 65 percent of BP's leases are \nunder exploration so that BP can produce from them in the future, yet \nthe majority would have you believe that BP is ``sitting on'' those \nleases instead of actively working toward producing on them. This is \nabout as deceptive an argument as I have ever heard. It is either \ntotally deceptive or it is absent knowledge and information--which is \nimpossible. This information is readily available.\n  We have severely limited our access to the American deepwater, and \nthe situation is only getting worse. In 1982, nearly 160 million acres \nof land were being leased for exploration. Today, its less than 40 \nmillion. Why? Because we are running out of available land and we are \nrestricting access to our own resources in favor of foreign oil. \nAccording to the MMS, only 2.4 percent of the total offshore acreage is \ncurrently being leased and about 85 percent of our continental offshore \nis under moratorium. As we debate about the use of\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\n43 million acres available for development, we must recognize that \nCongress has placed 574.2 million acres under moratorium--and the \nmajority has supported continuing to do so. Only 6 percent of total \nlower--48 OCS is currently leased. This does not demonstrate a lack of \nprogress in the deepwater, it demonstrates a lack of progress on energy \npolicy in Congress.\n  The American people have had enough with excuses and they are looking \nfor leadership. Two-third of Americans are asking us to produce \nAmerican oil, but the majority in the Senate is blocking it. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at the facts and take action.\n  There is no question in my mind that the excuse that is being used is \nthat we cannot drill our way out of the crisis. I submit that is not \nthe issue, whether we can drill our way out of the crisis. The issue is \nwhether we can produce more American oil or oil alternatives so we \nspend less overseas and keep more of our money at home. We are spending \nourselves broke. We are spending ourselves into economic oblivion by \nsending so much of our resources overseas every day, every month, every \nyear, for the acquisition of crude oil from foreign countries.\n  I have an editorial from the Albuquerque Journal of Sunday past \ncalled ``It Takes Black Gold To Get to Green Future.'' It states:\n\n       With all due respect to Al Gore, there is an urgent, new \n     ``inconvenient truth.'' Unless Congress acts quickly to \n     expand domestic oil supplies, the nation could face economic \n     destruction long before it sees the environmental fallout of \n     global warming.\n       For decades it has been easy for most Americans to dodge \n     the truth about our foreign oil dependence and to just keep \n     driving--but $4-a-gallon gas has finally snapped the trance. \n     Reality is sobering. The United States has put its economic \n     survival in the hands of unstable foreign powers and volatile \n     commodities markets. At any time, a major disruption in \n     foreign supply could bring the enormous, transportation based \n     U.S. economy to a standstill.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the editorial and a Washington \nPost editorial called ``Drill Deeper'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, June 22, 2008]\n\n               It Takes Black Gold To Get to Green Future\n\n       With all due respect to Al Gore, there is an urgent new \n     ``inconvenient truth.'' Unless Congress acts quickly to \n     expand domestic oil supplies, the nation could face economic \n     destruction long before it sees the environmental fallout of \n     global warming.\n       For decades it has been easy for most Americans to dodge \n     the truth about our foreign oil dependence and just keep \n     driving--but $4-a-gallon gas has finally snapped the trance. \n     Reality is sobering: The United States has put its economic \n     survival in the hands of unstable foreign powers and volatile \n     commodities markets. At any time, a major disruption in \n     foreign supply could bring the enormous, transportation-based \n     U.S. economy to a standstill.\n       The U.S. trade deficit jumped to its worst level in more \n     than a year in April, driven primarily by oil imports. Not \n     only does this empower anti-American regimes, it siphons off \n     money consumers could be spending or saving or investing.\n       ``I have never been more frightened for America's future \n     than I am right now;'' Sen. Pete Domenici said last week, \n     urging Congress to remove the ban on off-shore drilling and \n     open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil companies.\n       President Bush--in a speech laced with counter-productive \n     partisan rhetoric--called on Congress last week to open up \n     several domestic oil fields that have been off-limits since \n     the 1980s. ANWR could yield 27 billion barrels; the Atlantic \n     and Pacific coasts contain 17 billion barrels, and the Gulf \n     Coast could produce another 72 billion. There is strong \n     evidence this can be done in an environmentally responsible \n     way.\n       Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has so far \n     ignored polls that show a majority of Americans rallying \n     around calls for domestic drilling. He continues to argue \n     that the answer to foreign oil dependence lies in wind, solar \n     and nuclear technologies. The inconvenient truth, however, is \n     that climate-friendly technologies will take decades to \n     develop. We look forward to the day when we can all plug our \n     green cars into an electrical grid powered by something other \n     than coal.\n       Until then, we're going to have keep buying gas. Even if we \n     achieve a dramatic 20 percent reduction in oil consumption, \n     some experts estimate that oil will still cost $200 a barrel \n     by 2012. So here's another inconvenient truth: New drilling \n     isn't about returning to cheap gas. It's about economic \n     survival.\n       The United States needs to organize a Manhattan Project for \n     alternative energy, addressing the threats from both global \n     warming and foreign dependence. We need to vigorously pursue \n     those, along with a crash course in conservation.\n       These are monumental undertakings, and to succeed they must \n     transcend party lines or individual egos. Sen. Jeff Bingaman \n     was on-target Wednesday when he faulted President Bush for \n     injecting ``election-year politics'' into the Rose Garden \n     speech. As chairman of the Senate energy committee, Bingaman \n     will be a key player on both fronts of the effort to chip \n     away at America's-dangerous level of dependence on foreign \n     oil.\n       The way ahead is not easy. Fuel costs are impacting food \n     and retail prices. Truckers are parking their rigs. School \n     bus operators and closing up shop. Airlines are laying off \n     thousands and perhaps are heading for prices that will put \n     air travel out of reach for the middle class. The idea of the \n     family flying to Disneyland, for example, would be out of the \n     question. Even a family vacation by car could look like a \n     luxury.\n       Americans have never backed down from a challenge, however. \n     Once we know the truth, no matter how inconvenient it may be, \n     we like to get to work. In this case, the work involves a \n     drilling rig, and the self-confidence to use it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 22, 2008]\n\n                              Drill Deeper\n\n       If there is a silver lining in the price of gasoline \n     shooting past $4 a gallon, it's that it has sparked an \n     intense debate in the United States about its energy \n     security--or lack thereof. President Bush and Sen. John \n     McCain (R-Ariz.) have given the impression that relief for \n     drivers lies in off-shore drilling and the construction of \n     nuclear power plants. In fact, those solutions wouldn't \n     produce results for years. But if this level of passion and \n     debate continues through the fall election and is followed up \n     by action, the nation will be better off.\n       Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican Party nominee for \n     president, kicked things off last Tuesday when he reversed \n     himself in a speech to a Houston audience and announced that \n     the moratorium on drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf \n     that has been in effect since 1981 should be lifted. He got a \n     Rose Garden assist the next day from Mr. Bush, who called on \n     Congress to allow states the option of drilling off their \n     coasts to tap the estimated 18 billion barrels of oil \n     underneath. On Wednesday, Mr. McCain said that if elected \n     president he wanted 45 nuclear reactors built by 2030 ``with \n     the ultimate goal of 100 new plants to power the homes and \n     factories and cities of America.''\n       The mantra from the Democratic Party--from the presumptive \n     presidential nominee, Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), on down--has \n     been a variation on ``We cannot drill our way out of this \n     energy crisis.'' Considering that the U.S. is estimated to \n     have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, that's certainly \n     true. But it if is acceptable to drill in the Caspian Sea and \n     in developing countries such as Nigeria, where environmental \n     concerns are equally important, it's hard to explain why the \n     United States should rule out careful, environmentally sound \n     drilling off its own coasts. Like Mr. McCain, we do not \n     support drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     which Mr. Bush advocated Wednesday. That pristine area, with \n     its varied and sensitive ecosystems, should be preserved.\n       Washington has done a poor job of telling the public that \n     energy security will be achieved not from one source \n     overnight but from many over years and that there are no easy \n     solutions and no cheap ways to break this nation's dependence \n     on oil. There will be trade-offs and sacrifices that have yet \n     to be considered. So far, the focus has been on biofuels, \n     solar power and wind energy. But all this talk of drilling, \n     squeezing oil out of shale, as Mr. Bush proposed, and pushing \n     for more nuclear power is a welcome widening of a larger and \n     necessary discussion.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will return the discussion to housing. I \ndo thank the Senator from New Mexico for his comments on energy. I know \nfrom traveling around Wyoming last weekend, the biggest thing on \neverybody's mind is $4-plus gas. I got a lot of comments on ways it \ncould be fixed. What we are working on right now, of course, is fixing \nhousing.\n  I am going to discuss the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform \nof 2008. That is what we just had the vote on. I do not support this \nlegislation.\n  I opposed this legislation in the Senate Banking Committee and I \ncontinue to oppose it today. As the national housing market continues \nto suffer from falling home sales, housing starts, and skyrocketing \nforeclosure rates in some parts of the country, the Senate has an \nopportunity today to restore confidence in the principles of good \ngovernment to our economy. These principles include limiting taxpayer \nliability, ensuring a sustainable housing market in the future, and \npreventing a Federal Government bailout of big\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nbanks that made unaffordable loans or investors who made bad \ninvestments. Unfortunately, the bill ignores these principles and \nignores irresponsible actions at the expense of responsible homeowners \nand hard-working taxpayers.\n  This bill contains a title called ``The HOPE for Homeowners Act.'' \nThe program included in this title would create a $300 billion taxpayer \nloan guarantee program.\n  Let me repeat that. It would create a $300 billion taxpayer loan \nguarantee program--taxpayer guarantee program--doubling the size of the \nFederal Housing Administration. This expansion will be accomplished by \ntaking the worst performing and the most risky loans made by banks, \nshifting 100 percent of the liability of foreclosure onto the American \ntaxpayer. The loans I am talking about have made a lot of press in the \npast few months--adjustable rate, interest only, low documentation or \nno documentation; loans that in many cases the lender made with no \nregard for the borrower's ability to repay.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 35 percent of these \nloans will default, placing a huge liability on the FHA and ultimately \nthe taxpayer for guaranteeing these loans. Even FHA Commissioner Brian \nMontgomery believes this is a dangerous proposition. On June 9 he \nstated:\n\n       The FHA is not designed to become Federal lender of last \n     resort, a mega-agency to subsidize bad loans.\n\n  But that is exactly what this bill does. In past years, banks \ncontinued to make record profits by pushing these unaffordable \nmortgages. Investors, homeowners, bankers, and realtors bet heavily on \nthe tidal wave of ever increasing home prices. If a rate adjustment \nmade monthly mortgage payments unaffordable, homeowners and mortgage \ninvestors could count on home equity to bail them out. In other words, \nthe value of the price of the home would go up sufficiently to cover \nthe costs homeowners could not. As the Senate's only accountant, I can \ntell you this practice does not make good financial sense. It is \ncompletely unsustainable. However, most of industry ignored the warning \nsigns and continued to make record profits from unaffordable loans.\n  Now these same banks and investors are in trouble. They have \ndiscovered that unaffordable mortgages can be, shockingly, \nunaffordable. Complicating this matter is that the housing market cycle \nis now on a downswing and people can no longer rely on home equity \nloans to bail them out of a mortgage rate hike. Banks and speculators \nnow expect Congress to reward this irresponsible behavior with a \ntaxpayer bailout. They expect the Federal Government to turn its back \non responsible lenders and borrowers and renters waiting to become \nfirst-time homeowners, and support those groups that have pushed our \nhousing market into decline with bad loans and bad investments. This \nbill is a Federal Government bailout and that is why I oppose it.\n  I will also note there are separate provisions of the legislation I \ndo support. A separate title of this bill would create a new regulator \nfor the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nand the Federal Home Loan Banks. This world-class regulator will have \nthe authority necessary to ensure that these entities are adequately \ncapitalized and are operating safely within the secondary mortgage \nmarket.\n  The GSEs, government-sponsored enterprises, are the most important \nfactors in our mortgage market and play an increasingly influential \nrole in our global credit markets.\n  The regulators created by this legislation must support the housing \nmarket by allowing Freddie and Fannie to buy and securitize mortgages, \nthereby increasing credit at lower rates and restoring investor \nconfidence. While I continue to oppose the affordable housing trust \nfund included in the bill, I support a strong regulator that will allow \nthe secondary mortgage market to operate more effectively, to the \nbenefit of our economy.\n  I support the deliberate and safe conversion of the GSEs into the \njurisdiction of the new agency included in this legislation. It is past \ndue. As these massive entities are brought under new supervision, I \ntrust the transition will be done in a way that ensures that no \ndisruptions occur in our housing and our credit markets.\n  There are also several tax provisions that are important to Wyoming \nand the Nation. Currently, Wyoming receives approximately $2 million \nper year in low-income housing tax credits to encourage developers and \ncontractors to develop affordable rental housing projects. This bill \nwill provide a temporary 2-year increase of approximately $50,500, a \n2.5-percent increase to the Wyoming Community Development Authority. It \nwill also increase access to the Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, another \nhelpful tool for Wyoming housing infrastructure development.\n  Unfortunately, the good provisions of this legislation are not enough \nto outweigh the bad ones. Pushing liability onto the Federal Government \nby bailing out irresponsible lenders and investors is not good \ngovernment. I cannot support a bill that puts reckless investors and \nlenders ahead of hard-working Wyoming taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes, if I \ncan. We had a very strong vote again this morning on the housing \nproposal. I thank my colleagues. This morning I believe that vote was \n83 to 9 to invoke cloture, to begin the 30 hours of debate on this \naspect of the bill.\n  I would remind my colleagues, going back a little bit to the end of \nlast year on the FHA modernization bill, the Senate voted 94 to 2, in \nDecember of 2007 on the Foreclosure Prevention Act in April, we voted \n84 to 12; then the government-sponsored enterprises, HOPE for \nHomeowners vote out of committee, which included the affordable housing \nprogram, as well as the GSE reform and the HOPE for Homeowners, passed \n19 to 2 in our committee, an overwhelming vote on a controversial bill \ninvolving substantial resources and ideas to deal with the housing \nproblem.\n  Then late last week, we had amendments to strike the affordable \nhousing program. That was defeated 77 to 11. An amendment basically to \nstop or cut out the HOPE for Homeowners Act was defeated 69 to 12.\n  The point I make with these votes is it is quite clear that this \nbody, both Democrats and Republicans, believes it is important that we \ncraft and move forward with a major housing bill. I cited earlier this \nmorning in the discussion the two recent reports dealing with consumer \nconfidence and the value of homes in America.\n  The value of homes in America reported by the Case-Shiller Index, \nwhich is the most respected index on home values in our country, has \nreported yet further decline in housing values. In fact, Professor \nShiller has predicted we may have as much as a 30-percent decline in \nhome values. That would be the most significant drop nationally since \nthe Great Depression, to the point where now we have millions of homes \nwhere the equity in the homes is exceeded by the debt. Of course, for \nfamilies, that home ownership has not only been a stable environment \nfor them and their families, but it has also been a source of wealth \ncreation; that is, building up the equity in that home to provide for \nthe retirement years, where that home can be sold and the value, the \nincreased equity, can be a source for financial support.\n  For many families that has been one source of additional income for \nmiddle-income families to provide that higher education they promised \ntheir children since the day they were born. If you work hard, do the \nright things, your family is going to stick with you. When that cost of \neducation comes up, for college or community college or a technical \nschool, we are going to be there to help you because the equity in our \nhome is going to give us some additional cash to make that possible.\n  Let me tell you what it is like for that family today, those 15 \nmillion homes across our country where that debt exceeds equity. They \nturn to that child and say: We can no longer do it because our \nfinancial obligations exceed the value of our house because it has \ndeclined because of the foreclosure crisis, where more than 8,400 homes \nare filing for foreclosure every single day in the country.\n  So we have done what we can in our committee, and our colleagues have\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nsupported these ideas. The HOPE for Homeowners Act, the GSE reform, the \naffordable housing ideas have been embraced by overwhelming majorities. \nSo what we need to do today, if we can, is to come over. The amendments \nhave been suggested. I want to work out as many amendments on housing \nas I can. There are some we can work out and accept. Some I will not be \nable to accept, obviously, working with Senator Shelby and others who \nare involved. But we need to get this done.\n  If we go again into the middle of July--and just remember that if we \ntake next week off, which we do, we will go back to our respective \nStates. While we are back there walking in our parades and celebrating \nIndependence Day, every day we are there, somewhere between 8,000 and \n9,000 of our fellow citizens, on Independence Day, will be filing \nforeclosure on their homes. So we may leave here Friday or Saturday \nwithout having gotten this done, but as you are flying back home and \nvisiting your States and celebrating Independence Day, remember if we \ndid not get this done many more Americans are going to be paying an \nawful price.\n  So I urge my colleagues with amendments, give us a chance to work \nthese out. For those who want to offer amendments that are not directly \nrelated to this but are terribly important, I do not minimize it. I beg \nyour indulgence to spare us the opportunity of having to engage in that \ndebate on this bill. That does not minimize the importance of your \nidea. But if you put it on this bill and it is not paid for, the House \nwill reject it, and you will lose both ideas--both your idea and this \nidea that we are trying to move forward. So some discipline is needed, \nsome understanding is needed. This is the issue of the hour. This is \nthe problem that is causing so much depression in terms of people's \naspects of their future.\n  That report this morning about consumer confidence is so alarming. \nThat, more than anything else, is what I worry about: the optimism and \nconfidence of our fellow citizens. It is at the lowest since data has \nbeen collected on consumer confidence. It is at a 40-year low; 40 years \nhave transpired since the confidence and optimism of our fellow \ncitizens have been as low as it is today.\n\n  We bear responsibility more than anything else to offer a future, \nsome hope for our fellow citizens and people who count on us. I think \nthis housing proposal gives us a chance to do that. It is not going to \nsolve everyone's problems, but it can make a difference in saying to \nthe American people: We hear what you are saying, and we are doing \nsomething about it.\n  I have often cited historically those first 100 days from March of \n1933 to June of 1933, the beginning of the Franklin Roosevelt \nadministration when the country was in a deep depression, millions had \nlost their jobs, homes were being foreclosed. In that 100 days, there \nwere a lot of ideas that were posed to get us back on our feet again. \nMany of them never went anywhere; some did.\n  The most important thing, more than anything else that the Congress \nor the President achieved in those 100 days, was the American people \nsaw a government that had rolled up its sleeves and gone to work on \ntheir behalf. That, more than anything else, was what was needed in \nthose days to give people a sense of hope and optimism and confidence \nthat their Government, their President, their Congress was going to \nwork on their problems and give them a chance to have a better day. And \nthat is as much as what is needed today.\n  We need to demonstrate to the people of this country who have lost an \nawful lot of faith in almost everything but certainly in ourselves \nhere, that we can get something done, that we can put aside differences \nand make a difference in their lives. That is the opportunity that \nSenator Shelby and I are offering to our colleagues in the remaining \nhours of this debate.\n  So we need your help to come over and bring people together so we can \nwrap this up and send a bill to the House which, hopefully, they can \naccept. I am confident they will. Not that they are going to agree with \neverything that we have done, but I believe Barney Frank, the \nCongressman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee; Nancy Pelosi, the distinguished Speaker of the House--they \nget this, they understand this. They understand the difficulties we \nhave over here procedurally to deal with things, to deal with matters \nthat are different from the House of Representatives.\n  But they also understand we basically embrace three of the major \nconcepts: HOPE for Homeowners, affordable housing, GSE reform. That is \nthe centerpiece of what we are trying to achieve. The Presiding \nOfficer, as a member of the Banking Committee, has been tremendously \nhelpful, and I thank him for it, as well as other members of the \ncommittee, putting aside our own specific ideas of how we would do this \nto come up with a product that could be embraced by 19 of our 21 \nmembers of that committee to bring the bill forward as we have today, \nwith the added provisions that have been included in this bill.\n  So we urge our colleagues to come over. Senator Shelby and I are more \nthan happy to entertain ideas. Where we can accommodate them, we will \ndo so. If we cannot, we will be candid and tell them that we cannot. \nThere is always another day, but we cannot deal with every bill and \nevery idea that people have been waiting for on this bill. We urge our \ncolleagues to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time while the Senate is in recess \nfor the conference lunches count under the time postcloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. With that, we have had a strong vote. I say this to my \ncolleague from Alabama, through the chair, that 83-to-9 vote, not to \nmention 94 to 2 on modernization; 84 to 12, the various votes on other \nmatters late last week--all indicate the strong willingness on the part \nof our colleagues, the overwhelming majority here, to get something \ndone on this issue. That is the best news of all. Now we need to come \nto closure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to pick up on a few things that the \nSenator from Connecticut has been talking about. We got a vote a few \nminutes ago, I believe 83 to 9, on cloture on this bill.\n  Last week we had three or four well-debated amendments offered by \nvarious Senators, and they were overwhelmingly rejected, huge votes.\n  Where are we now? We have worked on this a long time. We have GSE \nreform in here, which I have worked on for 5 years on the Banking \nCommittee, as Senator Dodd recalled, and the Presiding Officer, a \nmember of the Banking Committee and very involved in the Banking \nCommittee.\n  This is a very complicated piece of legislation in this title dealing \nwith GSEs, which we have come a long way with. Everybody here knows, I \nbelieve on both sides of the aisle, that the GSEs provide a lot of the \nmortgage funds, most of them today. But they do need to be well \nregulated. They also need to be well capitalized, considering the risk \nand so forth, the implicit guarantee of the Federal Government.\n  I have been told recently that their debt, that Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae debt, exceeds the debt of the United Kingdom and France \ntogether. I do not know if that is exactly right. But if it is, that is \nover $5 trillion.\n  So we need to get this done. We need to make sure the GSEs survive. \nWe want to make sure GSEs are properly regulated, and we can do it \nhere. Another part of the title of this bill is dealing with housing, \nas the Presiding Officer knows. This is going to give a lot of people \nin America an opportunity to refinance some mortgages. It will not save \neverybody. It should not save everybody.\n  But there is no specific bailout for any specific mortgage company or \nbanks, as somebody alluded to last week--none of that. The chairman of \nthe committee, the Presiding Officer, as a member of the committee, and \nI, as a Senator, we would not have that. We would not vote our support \nfor anything like this. But we will create conditions to let people \nrefinance their mortgages, assuming they can work this out, assuming \nthe lender would rather take a haircut--you know, less money than a \nforeclosure.\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\n  The last thing a lender as a rule wants is a foreclosure because the \nhouse is vacant in the neighborhood. Senator Dodd was talking about \nthat. We do not need four or five vacancies in the neighborhood and the \nhouse run down, weeds growing instead of the lawn trimmed.\n  Everybody knows what that does to the value of their neighbors' \nproperty.\n  Housing is important. What we are trying to do--and one can see the \nvotes we have been getting--is fashion something that will give a lot \nof people a better opportunity to finance their home, as well as to \nregulate the GSEs in a meaningful way. Most of the Members of the \nSenate know that.\n  If somebody has an amendment, they ought to come down here. I know we \ncan debate this for 30 hours under the rules--I believe that is right--\nafter cloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We are that close to passing a meaningful piece of \nlegislation. We would like to pass it. We would like the House to pick \nit up quickly--either agree to it, amend it, or whatever, and get it to \nthe President. The sooner, the better.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation, but overall it has a lot \nof good things in it.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Vitter--he \nis going to speak next for approximately 5 minutes--I then be \nrecognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 3183 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the housing bill before \nthis body now and to speak about an important omission from the \nmanagers' amendment that is before the Senate. This is just one piece, \none narrow issue, but it is an important one that will affect many \nfolks in the housing market and throughout America. I am talking about \nthe need to provide a transition period for the implementation of the \nnew GSE regulatory structure in the bill.\n  A large part of this legislation on housing recovery is devoted to \nGSE regulatory reform. GSE means ``government-sponsored enterprises''--\nregulatory reform regarding those entities. This is a huge undertaking, \nwith wide-reaching consequences for the mortgage and housing industries \nand our economy generally.\n  This GSE reform title would combine the regulatory authority and \npersonnel of three distinct agencies--HUD, the FHLB, and the OFHEO--to \ncreate an entirely new GSE supervisor with broad, far-reaching powers \nover this $3 trillion part of our economy, the housing finance system. \nThe effects of new regulatory powers would not be limited even to the \nhousing industry, as big as it is. The vast global investment in GSE \nsecurities and the 8,000 member banks that obtain liquidity and other \nservices from our Federal Home Loan Bank system would also be \nsignificantly affected.\n  Given the far-reaching and very significant impact of this part of \nthe bill--this very significant consolidation of three separate \nagencies--I think simple common sense would dictate that implementing \nthat sort of measured change should be done with great care and over \nsome reasonable time period. That is why the House in its legislation \nrecognized the need for an orderly transition. Their bill included a \nuniform effective date of 6 months after enactment to allow the \nPresident to begin the appointment process immediately but to give that \n6-month transition to a very new regulatory structure.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us in the Senate today does not \ninclude this transition period in this language.\n  Under the Senate substitute amendment, the powers of the new agency \nwould be effective immediately, potentially destabilizing our housing \nmarket, causing real concerns among many in that important market.\n  I am very concerned about this. I think it is a significant omission, \na significant problem, a significant issue. Making the powers of a new \nagency effective immediately, before the three existing agencies are \ncombined and before expert personnel can be transferred and this new \nagency staffed is putting the cart before the horse. At a time of great \ninstability in the mortgage and housing markets, we should use care to \npreserve consumer and market confidence by ensuring a smooth transition \nand regulatory stability.\n  That is why I am strongly urging the adoption of the House approach \nwith regard to this specific issue. It would ensure a gradual \ntransition of no less than 6 months, allowing for careful and efficient \nconsolidation. In our push to make the housing and mortgage markets \nstronger and more responsive to the American people, let's also make \ncertain we don't break what we didn't need to fix in the first place.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to adopt this commonsense, \nreasonable, balanced House approach with regard to a 6-month \ntransition.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is it necessary that I ask to speak as in \nmorning business? I am taking time off my postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may be recognized under cloture.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Drilling in Pristine Areas\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to discuss, in about a 20-minute timeframe, \na couple issues that are swirling around this country and the Senate, \nand I wish to go on record on both of them. One has to do with \nPresident Bush and Senator McCain's proposal to open pristine areas off \nAmerica's coastline to offshore oil drilling as an answer, they say, to \nhigh gas prices. I am going to, hopefully, debunk that argument, and I \nhope I can do it convincingly.\n  The second area is going to be my feeling on the FISA bill, which is \ncoming to us tomorrow--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill.\n  I think I can start off where Senator Dorgan ended. He has been \nbrilliant on the point that speculation in oil futures is what is \nresponsible for a good deal of this horrific runup in the price of gas \nat the pump. We need to do something about these speculators. We have \nbeen blocked from doing that by the Republican leadership. I wish to \nquote Michael Greenberg, a former director of trading and markets for \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who testified before the \nSenate Commerce Committee. He said:\n\n       Going after the speculators will bring down the price of \n     crude oil to get at least a 25 percent drop in the cost of \n     oil and a corresponding drop in the cost of gasoline.\n\n  Testifying Monday before a House Energy and Commerce Committee \nsubcommittee, Michael Masters, of Masters Capital, said:\n\n       The price of crude oil would drop to a marginal cost of $65 \n     to $75 a barrel, about half of the current $135.\n\n  Imagine, the experts are telling us speculation is responsible for \nabout 25\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nto 50 percent of the cost runup of gasoline. We are trying desperately \nto close that Enron loophole, to ensure that the speculators are once \nagain regulated. There is a Bill Nelson bill, S. 3134, which would say \nall energy future contracts will fall within the regulatory format they \nwere at before. So we can do this.\n  Where are President Bush and Senator McCain on going after the \nspeculators? I don't hear them suggesting that. I don't see my \nRepublican friends embracing this. They have already stopped us a \ncouple times from doing it. If we want to do something about the price \nof gas, let's go after the speculators, and it will result in a very \nquick reduction in these outrageous price increases. We have the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve which is 97 percent full. George Bush's \nfather took some oil out of there after the first gulf war. President \nClinton also took some out of there, and it had the impact of lowering \nthe price. In other words, they are adding a supply from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. Again, it is 97 percent full. This is the moment \nwhen we could tap it. It will make a difference, and it will get to the \npeople, within a few short days. Thirteen days from a Presidential \ndecision, we could have more oil on the market.\n  Our colleagues agreed with us to stop filling SPR, but we don't have \ntheir support for taking some out--and, of course, you would return it \nat another time.\n  Here is a big one, and I will show you this chart. Remember, the \nPresident and Senator McCain said open all the coastal areas to \ndrilling--these pristine areas. So you have to ask yourself: Well, have \nwe run out of places to drill offshore? The answer is no. What about \nonshore? No. Oil companies hold leases to nearly 68 million acres of \nFederal lands that are not producing oil. This land could produce 4.8 \nmillion barrels of oil each day--six times the peak production from \ndrilling in the Arctic--and it would double total U.S. oil production. \nLet me say that again--68 million acres of oil leases are being held \ntoday by the oil companies. I say they should use it or lose it. Here \nwe have people saying: Oh, give them more. That is akin to saying to a \nkid, whom you are trying to get to do something, I will buy you an ice \ncream cone if you do XYZ; but they are holding two ice cream cones in \ntheir hands now.\n  Let me show you what 68 million acres looks like. First, I will show \nyou the onshore, which is about half of that. Look at the red areas on \nthe map. This is onshore, 34.5 million acres that are unused by the oil \ncompanies. They will not drill there, but now they want more leases in \nthe most beautiful parts of America.\n  This is ridiculous. It is a phony idea. It is not going to bring down \ngas prices 1 cent, according to the Bush Energy Department. It will \nhave no impact--maybe by 2030. I am looking at some of the Senate \npages, and they will be moms and dads by then.\n\n  Let's look at the offshore leases. Look at this. These are the \noffshore leases that the oil companies hold. They are not using them. \nYet, still, President Bush and Senator McCain--and this is a flip-flop \nby Senator McCain; he has always supported protecting the beautiful \nareas, but they are now saying it is necessary now to sell off the \nfamily jewels.\n  I have to tell you, coming from a State--and the Senator in the chair \ndoes as well--where an unspoiled coastline is our ticket to a tourist \nindustry, a fishing industry, a recreation industry, an industry in \nAmerica that provides, today, $70 billion in a coastal economy--$70 \nbillion and millions of jobs. In my State, it is about $11 billion or \n$12 billion and a quarter of a million jobs.\n  So you have to ask this question to the President and Senator McCain: \nWe all want to help our middle class and our working poor pay for the \nprice of gas. We want to bring down the price of gas, or we want to \ngive them alternatives to having to fill their cars; we all want to do \nthat. Let's give real answers. Let's not give an answer that could \nthreaten a huge coastal economy. Our families are having a very hard \ntime paying for gas. Imagine what happens when they lose their jobs \nbecause the coastal economy is now going to go. What good is that? \nMillions of jobs are at stake.\n  So rather than go after the speculators, rather than look at the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, rather than tell the oil companies, look, \nyou can double production and you are not doing it, rather than ask the \nFederal Trade Commission to investigate supply manipulation--and I can \ngive you story after story of supply manipulation. In my own State, we \nhad a large company--Shell Oil--try to close down a refinery. They said \nit wasn't making money and there were no buyers. Untrue. We called our \nState attorney general. He got involved. We found out they were making \nmoney and that there were buyers. They just want to manipulate the \nsupply. Because of our involvement, and especially the attorney \ngeneral, that refinery was sold. That was 2 percent of our State's \nsupply at the pump.\n  So these oil companies do not come to this with clean hands. We know \nit. This administration gives them a pass, saying let the speculation \nfly, and let the oil companies sit on these leases; forget about using \nthe CFTC, forget about going to the World Trade Organization and \nlodging a complaint against OPEC because they are anticompetitive. They \ndon't do that. They are not doing anything to extend the tax credit for \nthe most fuel-efficient vehicles. That expired because they put a cap \non it, on how many cars would have to be sold before you no longer get \nthis tax credit. They don't do any of the things that would help us \nnow. I don't see them saying: Let's make sure our transportation \ndistricts locally have enough funds to add more buses and to add more \nferry boats. We could be doing these things now.\n  What is their answer? Drill, drill, drill, drill, drill. Where? The \nmost pristine areas of our coasts--these areas that are a gift from \nGod. Millions of dollars have gone into setting aside marine \nsanctuaries. We will put it all at risk because oil companies see it as \nan opportunity to get more leases, increase their portfolio, and \nincrease the assets on their books.\n  I have to say I hope the American people will look at this proposal \nthe same way they looked at the gas tax holiday. When that first came \nup, having a gas tax holiday, John McCain recommended it, saying this \nis going to mean good news at the pump. The truth is it threatens the \nhighway trust fund because those are the funds that go into the highway \ntrust funds so we can take care of our highways. There was nothing in \nthe proposal that would have led to a lowering of the price of \ngasoline. Other costs could have been passed right on to the consumer.\n  So it is amazing to me that we now have another proposal that is \nbasically the same kind of proposal: Drill, drill, drill, and put at \nrisk a $70 billion coastal economy. First, the gas tax holiday put at \nrisk the highway trust funds. This proposal puts at risk a $70 billion \ncoastal economy and millions of jobs that go with it, and it doesn't \neven account for the fact that there are so many acres--68 million \nacres--leased to oil companies that they have not produced.\n  It seems to me the American people will understand that this so-\ncalled solution to high gas prices, which the President's own Energy \nDepartment says will not save a penny, is another phony solution. It is \nnot real. When we look at the long term, what we know is we have to \npass global warming legislation. When we do that, when the private \nsector puts a price on carbon, we are going to see technologies erupt \nfrom America that are going to make us competitive. We will export \nthose technologies.\n  We know when we take care of our environment, in the long run, our \neconomy gets stronger. We need to invest in transportation. We need to \ngo after OPEC. We have to go after the speculators. We know we will \nsee, with global warming legislation, investments in cellulosic \nethanol, which is going to compete with fossil fuel, and we know it is \ngoing to work.\n  So there are short-term answers to these gas prices, and I laid them \nout, and there are long-term answers, and I laid those out. I am not \nthe only person in the Senate who has these ideas. But to put out a \nphony solution to a real problem does not help us and it jeopardizes a \nlot of jobs and a coastal economy.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on going after the \nspeculators and doing all I need to do.\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 10 minutes on \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate over gas prices and the long-\nterm and short-term solutions is going to go on for a while. I look \nforward to addressing them, both in my committees of jurisdiction and \non the floor.\n\n\n                 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n\n  Mr. President, we are about to get a Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act bill that is going to come to the Senate probably \ntomorrow. I know that a lot of my colleagues worked very hard and very \nlong to try to get a compromise on this bill. I have to say that there \nis a portion of this bill that I believe is egregious and will prevent \nme from voting for this bill. It is because I believe one of the most \nbasic tenets of our freedom is justice. Looking at justice, we have to \nsee what lies at the heart of justice. And what lies at the heart of \njustice is the search for the truth. If you block the truth from coming \nout, if you don't allow a search for the truth, you don't find justice. \nI worry very much about that.\n  Throughout our history, whenever the U.S. Government has violated the \ntrust of the American people, we have worked to regain that trust by \nseeking the truth and allowing for a full examination of the abuses of \nGovernment power. We can see that in the history of America. Sometimes \nthese egregious acts take many years to uncover. I am thinking of the \nTuskegee experiments. Of course, we have to go back to the days of \nslavery. Go back to the Jim Crow laws. Go back to the era of the \nVietnam war and the tenure of J. Edgar Hoover, who headed the FBI. We \nknew in that particular case that the CIA and the FBI, under J. Edgar \nHoover--he headed the FBI--he engaged in spying on the political \nactivities of American citizens. He was spying on famous, important \npeople, such as Martin Luther King. He was spying on people at the \nhighest levels of Government. He was also spying on the American \npeople. Pictures were taken at rallies where people were trying to \nargue for an end to the Vietnam war.\n  In 1975, the Church Committee, which would later become the Senate \nCommittee on Intelligence, looked into allegations of covert and \nillegal spying by the Federal Government on Americans. What did the \ncommittee find? The committee found that, indeed, there had been spying \non Americans by the FBI and the CIA.\n  Here is what is interesting. What did the Congress do when they found \nout, in horror, that the Government was spying on the people? They \npassed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978. It set up a \nnew court with authority to approve electronic surveillance but only on \na case-by-case basis. Since that time, we have updated FISA to reflect \nthe changes in the threat we face in America and to reflect the new \ntechnologies.\n  Suddenly, in late 2005, we learned that the U.S. Government--our \nGovernment, the Bush administration--had violated the trust of the \nAmerican people again when the New York Times published a story \nexposing a warrantless surveillance program authorized by President \nBush shortly after 9/11. Since that time, Congress and the American \npeople have been grappling with the disclosure and working, with no \nhelp from this administration, to find out what happened. We cannot \nfind out exactly what happened, who was spied upon. Was I spied upon? \nWere you spied upon? How many people were spied upon? What information \nwas gained?\n  In putting together the FISA bill, I do believe House and Senate \nmembers tried hard to find a balance and figure out a way to get to the \ntruth, but I feel they have fallen short because what we will have \nbefore us when this bill comes before us is not only a bill that will \ndeny the court the ability to make a judicial determination as to the \nlegality of the spying program, but it will effectively guarantee \nimmunity for the telecommunications companies that cooperated with the \nadministration and violated the privacy of their customers.\n  You have to know that we had laws in place that specifically said to \ntelephone companies: You cannot invade the privacy of your customers. \nWhat apparently happened was the Government went to them and said: We \nare asking you to disregard the law.\n  I understand the predicament of the companies, although there was one \ncompany that refused to cooperate. One company refused to cooperate. \nThey said: No, we are not going to do it. But all the others \ncooperated. And now we have a situation where we know the telephone \ncompanies responded to the Government and said: OK, we will disregard \nthat law on your say-so.\n\n  I would support granting the telecom companies indemnification--in \nother words, having the Government step in and be the party that has to \npay the price--but this immunity provision that is in the bill blocks \nus from finding the truth. Remember what I said when I started: The \nessence of justice is to get to the truth, and we are not going to be \nable to get to the truth. We are not going to know exactly how this \nprogram ran. We don't know enough. The Bush administration, in my view, \ntrampled on the Constitution, and we are not doing anything in this \nbill to provide accountability. Frankly, if we just left out this \nprovision and passed the rest of the bill, we would let the courts do \ntheir job. Fine. But, no, no, we have to add this provision and \nessentially set up kind of a new law now to deal with this spying \noperation.\n  I don't think we can hold up the Constitution when it suits us and \nset it aside when it hinders us. That is not what the Constitution is.\n  The supporters of this compromise will say: Wait a minute, Senator \nBoxer, we have a provision in there that says the telecom companies \nhave to prove they were asked by the Government to do this activity. We \nknow they were asked by them. That is why I don't want to punish the \ntelecom companies.\n  Mr. President, I tell you what I do want to do: find out the truth. \nThat, the truth, I want to find out. I have to believe that if we don't \nchange Title II of this bill, we are perpetuating a coverup. I use that \nword advisedly because I don't think we will ever get to the truth of \nwhat happened here.\n  I support giving our country every tool necessary to track down the \nterrorists. I voted to go to war against bin Laden, and I am disgusted \nthat he is still out there taunting us, all these days, all these \nyears, despite George Bush. Dead or alive, we will get him. Where is \nhe? I want to go after al-Qaida. I want to go after bin Laden. I think \nwe do have to provide all the tools that are necessary, but we also \nmust uphold the Constitution and the rights of our citizens.\n  This granting of immunity will block the courts from moving forward \nand learning whose privacy was violated. I want to be able to look in \nthe eyes of my constituents in California, 38 million people, and say: \nI know you were in that group of people, and I feel terrible, and we \nare going to make it right for you; or, I know you were not involved in \nbeing caught up in this net.\n  These are extraordinary and difficult times. Our sons and daughters \nwere sent to Iraq to fight for our freedoms. We have to listen to what \nformer Justice Marshall says:\n\n       History teaches us that grave threats to liberty often come \n     in times of urgency, when constitutional rights seem too \n     extravagant to endure.\n\n  Our Constitution is not an extravagance. It is the centerpiece, the \nvery essence of a democracy. It is what our sons and daughters are \nfighting for abroad. How could we say on the one hand to our soldiers: \nGo fight for our freedoms, go fight for the freedoms in our \nConstitution, while at home we are covering up the erosion of those \nfreedoms?\n  The bill was improved upon, and I am glad Title I improved the way we \ngo about protecting the rights of our citizens and balances it with the \nneed to get this information. I am very pleased with that. But it seems \nto me, if you believe in the truth, then I don't see how you grant this \ntype of immunity.\n  Again, I would substitute the Government, I would indemnify these \ncompanies. I am not interested in hurting them. But I want to get to \nthe truth. We have a really good way to do that, which is to strip this \npart from the bill. We will have our rights protected then. We will \nhave the tools we need to fight terrorism. We must do better than this.\n  So unless there is some miracle that happens overnight and we see \nsome changes, I will be forced to oppose this bill. I am hoping we will \nhave an opportunity to vote on a substitute that will\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nkeep the rest of the bill intact but eliminate this egregious provision \nwhich really is very troubling. Anyone who lived through the days of J. \nEdgar Hoover and the kind of spying that went on, who understands FISA \nwas passed to protect Americans has to be alarmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I came to the floor for another subject, but \nI do wish to tell my friend from California that we will have an \nopportunity to talk about the FISA bill that was passed. The bill we \npassed in the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority protected \ncivil liberties of American citizens much further than they have ever \nbeen protected even under existing criminal law, we provided more \nprotection.\n  The Senate committee looked at the essence of the terrorist \nsurveillance program for which we recommended that retroactive immune \nliability protection be provided for those who cooperated. They \ncooperated in good faith on the basis of the representation by the \nintelligence community that there was a Presidential directive \nauthorized by the Attorney General. It was authorized under the clear \nconstitutional authority of article II of the U.S. Constitution, \nsupported by the MOFA that was passed by Congress. We determined that \nthey were entitled to protection.\n  As a lawyer, I have read all of the documents. I am convinced that \nthe bill we passed does not in any way give away any rights or \nprotections.\n  Anybody who objects to the granting of this liability protection \nshould know that we do not protect Government officials or the \nGovernment itself from lawsuits. If one wants to challenge it, file \nsuit against the Government, file suit against Government officials, \nbut don't ruin the business reputation of those who, in good faith, as \ngood citizens, provided the intelligence that was needed to keep our \ncountry safe and to keep our soldiers and marines, such as my son, on \nthe field safe from battlefield attacks. They provided that \ninformation, and we owe them better than to haul them before a court to \nhave them exposed to the vengeance of terrorists or people who didn't \nlike what they did. We owe our security in the United States better \nthan to lay out in an open court proceeding all of the things our \nintelligence community can do to stop terrorist attacks--terrorist \nattacks which have not occurred in this country since September 11, \n2001, which were certainly planned and underway before they were \ninterrupted.\n\n  I can't go into any more on the floor. Any Member of the Senate is \nentitled to have that information in confidential SCIFs where we \ndiscuss classified information. I invite them to be briefed, and I will \nhave much more to say about the FISA law when we get on the debate.\n\n\n                           Missouri Flooding\n\n  But I come to the floor today to share some observations with my \ncolleagues, and anyone else who may happen to be watching, about the \nnatural disaster that is going on right now in my State of Missouri.\n  If you turn on the television, you will probably see the flooding \nthat is expanding over an area west of St. Louis County and St. Charles \nCounty. The Eagle Point levee breached last night, and that is only the \nlatest example. Many other levees have also been breached.\n  This past weekend, I went to visit the people on the front lines. I \nmet with State and local officials, who are prepared and are responding \nextremely well, given the prolonged damages, the challenges, and the \nextensive duration of the flood. This effort, I am proud to say, is a \ngood testament to how bad disasters can be mitigated from becoming \nworse disasters when competent local and State leaders and volunteers \nproactively take steps at the immediate scene of the disaster.\n  At Winfield, MO, on Friday afternoon, right along the Mississippi \nRiver, I met with volunteers from the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, \nMissouri Civil Air Patrol, local law enforcement's emergency planning \nofficials, the Missouri National Guard, and local and surrounding \ncommunity volunteers. It was inspiring to see how people came together \nto help protect lives and property. Over 1,000 volunteers--some of my \nstaff members joined with them--filled sandbags and built the levees. \nThey were joining neighbors, church groups, civic groups, and other \npeople coming in to help. By that afternoon, they said they were going \nto have to call and say: We don't have need for more volunteers now, so \nwait until there is a problem elsewhere.\n  As always, the National Guard acted valiantly. Their work has given \nbusinesses and families the critical time they need to get important \nassets out of harm's way where levees are in danger of failing. And so \nfar--knock on wood--we have come through with minimal personal damage. \nPeople from all walks of life across Missouri and across the \nheartland--neighbors came in from Illinois--have pitched in to help. It \nhas truly been an all-hands-on-deck effort, and I couldn't be more \nproud of them. I thanked them in person, and I come here on the floor \nto express my thanks to them.\n  Missourians and our midwestern neighbors have pulled together and, as \nit turns out, they may be doing too great a job of fighting the floods. \nLocal communities have been burdened with the financial strain that \ncomes with any disaster. Communities along the Mississippi have \ninvested hundreds of thousands of dollars in pumps and sandbags, and \nuntold tens of thousands of volunteer efforts in trying to protect \nproperty and lives. While these current investments made are small \ncompared to cleanup costs, our small towns, our communities, still need \nFederal help.\n  I come here today to report, regrettably, that despite national news \ncoverage day after day of the destruction in Missouri, FEMA has still \nnot declared Missouri a Federal disaster area. Our families and \ncommunities along the Mississippi River are investing every resource \nthey have to mitigate the disaster while FEMA figures out the extent of \nthe disaster.\n  Not only has this flood destroyed homes, but it is currently \nsaturating tens of thousands of acres of some of our State's most \nproductive farmland. In addition to waiting for the waters to recede, \nfarmers will have to remove the debris the Mississippi River leaves \nbehind before they can plant their crops. I don't know if you have ever \nbeen to a flood scene, but it isn't just a whole bunch of land getting \nwet; it brings in everything you don't want to have on your land, and \nyou can't plow it, you can't even mow it because of all the debris \nleft.\n  Many have heard the saying ``knee high by Fourth of July.'' That used \nto be a reference to corn height in Missouri, if you wanted a good \ncrop. Now, in a good year, if it isn't six feet tall, then you are way \nbehind. But this year, regrettably, in talking about the height of \ncorn, there is a lot of land where we are going to be talking about the \nheight of water.\n  USDA, FEMA, and other Government agencies, I hope and I expect, will \nprovide emergency funds to clean up the disaster. I am pleased I have \nbeen joined by my other colleagues from the Midwest to fund these \nprograms in supplemental appropriations bills that will ensure disaster \nvictims receive much needed aid. We have to continue to do our part in \nthe Senate to make sure these flood victims will be able to get their \nfeet back on the ground. I have joined with eight of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring Senator Grassley's disaster tax package, which will also \nhelp.\n  But, I repeat, none of these actions will provide any relief until \nMissouri gets a disaster declaration. And with everyone in Missouri \ndoing their part--his and her part--acting responsibly and responding \nlocally, I urge FEMA to do its part and approve the predisaster \ndeclarations they asked our State officials to make. We know there is \ngoing to be more work in finding out the total extent, but anybody who \nlooks at the pictures on the television and who doesn't believe this is \na major disaster, is saying, I am not believing my own lying eyes, \nbecause it is right there for them to see. I wish FEMA would start the \nmechanism rolling.\n  We know we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot of disaster, but \nwe are thankful in our hearts for minimal human damage and the \ntremendous human outreach. It is time for the Federal Government's \nemergency management agency to get off the dime and move.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me say to my friend from \nMissouri, we do see the videos of what is happening in his State with \nthe devastating floods, and the people of Maryland agree with the \nSenator's statements. We want to make sure FEMA does the right thing.\n  Certainly the Senator is very concerned about the circumstances, and \nwe want to do everything we can to help the people of Missouri and the \nother States that have been devastated by these floods. It has \nobviously had a dramatic impact on many lives, and this is when our \nNation needs to come together to help those who have been devastated. \nSo the Senator will have our support, and I wanted him to know that.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are considering now in postcloture is the \nbill the House sent over to us to deal with the housing crisis. I was \nvery encouraged with the vote earlier today, and I hope we are on the \nverge of passing this much needed legislation so we can work out our \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. I know we still have some \nprocedural hurdles we have to overcome, but I hope my colleagues will \nact quickly so we can complete our work on this very important housing \nbill.\n  The people of Maryland, the people around the Nation, are hurting \ntoday because of what is happening in the housing market. We know it \nwas the housing market that triggered our current economic problems. We \nknow throughout the country there has been a large number of these so-\ncalled subprime adjustable rate mortgages that were issued over \nthe last several years, and as a result of the declining housing market \nand the adjustable rate mortgages and subprime mortgages, we have \nrecord numbers of foreclosures around the Nation, including my own \nState of Maryland.\n\n  We are not only seeing a record number of foreclosures, we are also \nseeing circumstances where homeowners' equity in their property is \nactually negative. That means the money they owe on their mortgage is \nexceeding the value of their property. And with declining markets, it \nis becoming more and more difficult for individuals to be able to sell \ntheir homes, so we anticipate there could be continued problems of more \nforeclosures. That means it is very important that this Congress act.\n  We also know it not only affects the individual whose home is at \njeopardy, but it affects the entire neighborhood. When there is a \nforeclosure in a community, the value of all the homes in that \ncommunity declines. Local governments are also seeing a dramatic \nreduction in property tax revenues as a result of the decline of \nproperty values. Just at the time we need local government being more \nactive in helping people who are going through tough economic times, \nthey are finding it more difficult to act.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for bringing forward a \nbipartisan bill, a bill that now stands an excellent chance of being \nenacted, and a bill that the people of this Nation desperately need. It \nwould do something about the housing problems in this country, so I do \nthank them for their patience and their work.\n  I see Senator Dodd is on the floor, and I personally thank him for \nthe work he has done. We are now on the verge, I hope, of passing this \nvery badly needed legislation, the key features of which are going to \nhelp the people of Maryland and around the Nation.\n  This bill deals with properties that are in danger of being \nforeclosed by trying to prevent foreclosure. I think that is one of the \nthings we should be doing here. The HOPE for Homeowners Act will help \nup to 400,000 or 500,000 homeowners on a voluntary basis get their \nmortgages refinanced, at no cost to the Government, using FHA, in order \nto make it affordable and to prevent foreclosure. That, to me, is \nsmart. It is good for the homeowner, it is good for our economy, and it \nis a great investment for taxpayers because it will save them money by \nhaving less foreclosures in their communities.\n  The legislation also helps communities in desperate need. The CDBG \nfunds are increased to help the communities that have been hardest hit \nthrough the numbers of foreclosures, but then, moving forward, we do \nsomething about the housing crisis in this country. We provide \naffordable housing funds, which we desperately need in Maryland and \nthroughout the Nation.\n  We also provide more money for counseling. I say to Senator Dodd that \nI had a meeting in Baltimore with housing counselors who are \noverwhelmed. They cannot handle the number of people seeking their \nhelp, so the funds provided in this legislation will help them help \npeople who want to get counseling, but the services are not available \nin so many communities around the country.\n  The new disclosure requirements will also help people who will be \nmoving forward because they will know what they are doing and have less \nchance of ending up in trouble in the future.\n  I also want to comment on the provisions in this legislation that \nease the credit crunch. Today, it is very difficult to find affordable \nmortgages. Obviously, lenders are being much more cautious and it is \ndifficult today, if you live in a minority community or you live in a \nmodest-income neighborhood, to be able to get a mortgage. Yet banks are \nwilling to write mortgages. In the subprime mortgage industry, there \nwere so many people, particularly from minority communities, who were \nsteered into subprime loans. These individuals could have had \ntraditional mortgages and they wouldn't have been in trouble today. Now \nthere are many people who need help in finding an affordable mortgage.\n  In this legislation, with the GSEs, the government-sponsored \nentities--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan--and the \nreforms in the FHA--raising the loan limits and by changing some of the \nunderwriting--they will provide more mortgages to modest-income \nfamilies in America, so those who are in the market to buy homes and \nwho want to be in the market to buy homes will have a much easier time \nfinding an affordable mortgage in order to move forward. That will be \ngood for home ownership, which is good for our neighbors, and it is \ngoing to be good for our economy.\n  I also thank Senator Baucus of the Senate Finance Committee for \nbringing forward some changes, some amendments to this legislation, \nwhich I think are very important. I had a meeting in Baltimore and met \nwith the real estate community, and they told me several months ago we \nneeded to do something to try to get first-time home buyers into the \nmarket. If the Federal Government could offer some incentives, it would \nhelp in freeing up the market, which is going to be good for our \neconomy. At that time, I filed an amendment that would have provided a \nfirst-time homeowner's tax credit. I thank Senator Baucus for bringing \nout a similar proposal in the bill that is before us for first-time \nhome buyers. The Federal Government will help participate in their \nbuying a home and will offer them a credit of up to 10 percent of the \ncost of the home, up to $8,000, which will ultimately be an interest-\nfree loan that the Federal Government will invest in an individual \nbuying their first home, for modest-income families.\n  To me, that makes sense. We want to encourage young people who can \nafford to own homes to buy homes, but they are reluctant to get into \nthe market today because they do not know what is going to happen with \nthe property values. When the Federal Government helps them buy that \nhome, they are going to be more confident this is the right time to \ncome into the market and to buy that home.\n  I think this provision can make a huge difference, and I appreciate \nthe Senate Finance Committee adding it to the good work of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  As I said earlier, this is an important bill. Today's vote was an \nimportant vote. We are on the path to getting it enacted. I urge my \ncolleagues, let's work out our last differences, and let's get the \nvotes we need to get on the floor of the Senate. Let's move this bill \nforward. Let's reconcile the differences with the House. Let's get it \nto the President. Let's get it into law so we can help the housing \nsituation around the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I commend Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby for working so hard to bring this bill to the floor--\nSenator Chris\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nDodd for his wonderful leadership on the House bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 10 \nminutes and the time be charged postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Creating American Jobs\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have to say that I was quite amazed \nand shocked yesterday to hear the proposal that certainly flies in the \nface of what I believe needs to be happening for Michigan and other \nStates that have been the backbone of the manufacturing economy in our \ncountry, the backbone of the middle class. It was a proposal to turn \nour way of handling American jobs and the economy into a game show. We \ndo not need a game show. We do not need prizes down at the end of some \nlong line for doing what needs to be done in order to create innovation \nand be able to focus us on the next generation of advanced battery \ntechnology or any other technologies. What we need is something \nthoughtful and sustained, ongoing investments to create jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  The last 8 years we have not seen that. We have not seen a \nwillingness to step up and aggressively invest in advanced battery \ntechnology research or any other areas where we would be able to get \nthe kind of jobs and production we need in the United States. I remind \nthe Chair that, as he knows so well, just since January we have lost \n325,000 good-paying jobs in America. As the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and I have both come to the floor to speak about good-paying \nAmerican jobs, middle-class jobs for middle-class families, we continue \nto lose jobs.\n  I am very proud to be a part of a majority that is tackling that, \nfocusing on investments, on jobs rebuilding America, on investments in \nthe future. We passed a budget resolution a little earlier this year \nthat included a green-collar jobs initiatives, which I was proud to \noffer. It had strong support from our Presiding Officer. Among things \nthat we listed and we put into the budget resolution was advanced \nbattery funding. This is something I know our appropriators are taking \nseriously. I also know my colleague, Senator Levin, is focusing on this \nin the Department of Defense authorization. I know we are serious about \ninvesting in the future now, today--putting dollars in to partner with \nthe private sector to get us to that next generation of vehicle that is \nso critical.\n  One of the things about which I am extremely concerned is that other \ncountries have been investing for years, and we have not seen the same \nkind of investments proposed year after year in the President's budget \nor supported by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  When Toyota first made the Prius, we heard a lot about it. They made \nthis with advanced batteries made in Japan. What is more concerning is \nwhen Ford Motor Company first made the Ford Escape Hybrid--and I am \nvery proud they did--they looked around and couldn't find the advanced \nbattery in America. They got it in Japan.\n  We cannot afford to be on a road to dependency on foreign technology \nas we are trying to get off of dependence on foreign oil. This needs \nmore than proposals that feel like game show prizes down at the end of \na road, a road we may not be able to get to if we are not serious as a \ncountry about what we need to do in making investments right now.\n  Germany has announced a great battery alliance which will invest over \n$650 million in advanced lithium-ion batteries. It is specifically \naimed at helping German auto companies.\n  South Korea, by 2010, will have spent $700 million on advanced \nbatteries and developing hybrid vehicles.\n  China has invested over $100 million in advanced battery research and \ndevelopment.\n  Over the next 5 years, Japan will spend $230 million on advanced \nbattery research. It is spending $278 million a year on hydrogen \nresearch for zero emission fuel cell vehicles.\n  These countries understand they need to step up to compete in a \nglobal economy and partnering with their automobile industry. We need \nto do no less.\n  We have picked one segment of the economy, the automobile industry, \nin which we have placed a major new mandate--an $80 billion mandate on \nfuel efficiency. We need to do everything we can to help them achieve \nthat. But they will not get there unless now--this year, next year, the \nyear after--we are supporting and partnering on efforts for advanced \nbattery technology research and development. Not the basic research, \nthe basic research is being done. Now we are at a point where we need \nto have the technology developed to deal with issues around the size \nand the weight of the vehicle and the reliability of the batteries and \nall of the issues that bring it to the point for marketing and sales. \nWe are very close. But our country needs to be taking this very \nseriously right now if we are going to have good-paying manufacturing \njobs, high-tech manufacturing jobs in this country, particularly in the \nautomobile industry.\n\n  I thank our majority leader and our chairman of the Budget Committee \nwho placed dollars into the budget. I thank all of those who will be \ninvolved as we move forward to implement our efforts to invest in \nadvanced battery technology research. I only wish the passion that was \nshown yesterday would be shown on the Senate floor, would be shown in \nvotes for the budget resolution, would be shown in votes for \nappropriations, would be shown in votes and leadership speaking up as \nthe President, year after year, has woefully underfunded his requests \nfor advanced battery technology research.\n  We are past time to get this done. It should not be treated as \nsomething that is trite but as something that is very serious and very \ndoable if we are willing to step up and partner and make the \ninvestments that need to be made, as every other country is doing.\n  Our companies today are not competing with other companies around the \nworld. They are competing with other countries around the world, other \ncountries that understand that whoever gets to advanced battery \ntechnology first will have the edge. Whoever is getting the hydrogen \nfuel cell technology first will have the edge. Whoever gets to that \nnext technology will find themselves in the position to be the leaders \nin a global economy. We need to understand that and take that \nseriously. I am proud to be part of a majority that does, and we are \nworking very hard.\n  We have moved the ball down the road and have more to do, but I am \namazed to hear the kinds of discussions that have gone on in the last \n24 hours as it relates to jobs and the economy and prizes. The prize \nfor us is a good-paying job and a strong middle class and keeping \nadvanced manufacturing in this country. We do that by being serious and \nsustained and thoughtful, by providing dollars on the front end, by \nmaking sure we understand the seriousness of the competition around the \nworld, and having a sense of urgency about American jobs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are on the bill having to do \nwith homes and foreclosures. I want to speak on the bill, and then I \nwould ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak thereafter as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will be offering an amendment which I think \nwill be adopted or embraced, approved, cleared by both sides. It is a \nbipartisan amendment with Senator Coleman. It is to give some \ncommonsense relief to homeowners who are trying to stay in their home \nwhile their home is under foreclosure.\n  If a homeowner is there and doesn't have any cash, the homeowner has \nfewer options of what to do if the bank is foreclosing on the home. But \nsuppose the homeowner has a retirement fund, a private retirement fund, \na 401(k) retirement fund. We have allowed, under current law, for the \nability of a homeowner to take money out of that retirement fund, \nwithout paying the 10 percent penalty, to take it out of the retirement \nfund before retirement for\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nthe purpose of purchasing a home. But if it is a homeowner with a home \nthat is under foreclosure and they need cash, under current law, if \ntheir only source of cash is that retirement fund, in order to pull it \nout, they have to pay a 10-percent penalty. It seems it is common sense \nand the kind of public policy that we would want to adopt to give the \nhomeowner the means of avoiding foreclosure by being able to tap into \nsome of their cash in their retirement fund in order to save their \nhome.\n  That is what the amendment is all about. It is simple. It waives the \n10-percent penalty for folks wishing to make an early withdrawal from \ntheir retirement fund in order to avoid foreclosure.\n  We put some parameters, some boundaries around it so it cannot be \nabused. We say homeowners have to show they are participating in a \ngovernment- or industry-sponsored foreclosure prevention program, such \nas the ones we are setting up in this bill, the HOPE NOW or the HOPE \nfor Homeowners programs. Both of those are established in the bill \nbefore us today. That is one parameter. Another parameter is, we make \nthis thing limited for 2 years so it will not go on and on. The \nforeclosure crisis is right now. We want to help homeowners stay in \ntheir homes. We limit it for 2 years.\n  The third parameter, we put a limit of $25,000 on what they can take \nout of their retirement fund. We are going to give that homeowner, once \nthey take the money out and they save their home, the ability to put \nthat money back into their retirement fund within a 3-year period and \nnot have to pay income tax on that money. A normal retirement fund, you \ntake money out of the fund, you will have to pay income tax on it. If \nthe purpose is to get a ready source of cash to help them stay in their \nhome under foreclosure, we want to give them that opportunity to get it \nback in their retirement fund and not have to pay income tax. They have \nto do that--another one of those parameters--within 3 years.\n  The cost is fully offset. I want to give an example. We all, from our \nStates, get horror stories. I got one from a retired Air Force sergeant \nwho lives in Stuart, FL. He recently lost his job and, in order to stay \nin his home, pay his mortgage, he liquidated his 401(k) savings and \npaid the 10-percent penalty. The bill we are considering today gives, \nin another provision, a tax credit for first-time homeowners to buy \ntheir first home. But unless we do it with this provision, we are going \nto penalize folks such as Wayne who didn't have any source of cash \nexcept his 401(k) in order to try to do his best to save his own home \nusing his own money.\n  It is true that for most people, a home is the greatest single source \nof wealth. It seems to me it is common sense that we would have this \nnarrowly defined, limited exception to allow homeowners to use every \ntool available within their power to stay in that home and not have it \nforeclosed. That is the amendment I will be offering at an appropriate \ntime. I believe we have received clearance from Senator Grassley. I am \ntrying to get clearance from Senator Baucus, then the two managers of \nthe bill, and the Banking Committee, to get clearance from them.\n\n\n                              Oil Futures\n\n  Why has oil hit, last week, $140 a barrel, and why is it, within the \nlast couple days, somewhere in the high 130s? We have had testimony now \nfrom the president of Shell Oil Company. We have had testimony from an \nexecutive of ExxonMobil. The two respective testimonies say that under \nthe normal marketplace for oil, a world marketplace of supply and \ndemand, one of them testified oil ought to be at $55 a barrel, not \n$140, and the other one testified it ought to be somewhere between $35 \nand $65 a barrel, not $140. So why is it at $140?\n  It is true that little ``jitterations'' in the marketplace, any \nlittle minicrisis in any part of the world is going to send jitters \ninto the financial marketplace. That is going to cause upward pressure. \nThe fact is that China and India, of course, having so much consumption \nof oil, makes it tighter. But even so, with all that, they said it \nought to be in the range of somewhere between $35 and $65 a barrel.\n  The reason it isn't is because 8 years ago, in the dead of night just \nbefore Christmas in the year 2000, the Senate, adjourning to go home, a \nprovision was slipped into an unrelated bill that deregulated energy \nfutures contracts. It was called the Enron loophole because it \nbenefited Enron. We saw that a couple years thereafter in electricity \ncontracts in California having been bid up and bid up and bid up, and \nthat caused a great crisis that ultimately caused blackouts in \nCalifornia. Then, when Enron unraveled financially, we found out about \nthat. But nothing was done to reregulate the agency, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, the CFTC.\n  A lot of our colleagues here think we just reregulated them last \nThursday night in the farm bill. But we only partially reregulated them \nwhen we passed the farm bill over the President's veto. What that was, \nwas new power of the CFTC to go in on an ad hoc basis on an individual \noil contract, with certain other limitations, to examine it and then \ndetermine if it wants to regulate it. I don't want to do that.\n  The bill I have filed--and I have Senator Dorgan, Senator Obama, and \nSenator Boxer as cosponsors--takes us back to the status quo before the \nEnron loophole was passed, which is the trading mechanisms attached to \nthe United States have to be regulated if it is energy futures \ncontracts. It is very simple. As a matter of fact, my bill is only two \nwords. It inserts the words ``or energy'' in there to reregulate energy \nfutures contracts.\n  What is regulating? That Commission would decide, for example, that \nthey are going to require that if you are going to bid on these future \ncontracts for oil, you are going to have to use that oil. It is people \nnow who don't have any intention of using oil who go into these markets \nand speculate and bid up the price. It is believed that if we plugged \nthis loophole, the price of gasoline will drop by half. That is pretty \ndramatic. Yesterday, the House of Representatives had testimony that \nthe price of oil per barrel would drop by over half. That is pretty \ndramatic.\n  People are hurting. Every Senator knows that. Our people are hurting. \nThis $4 gas is hurting our people financially. They are not able to \nmake financial ends meet. So if we want to do something, we have to get \nto where we can do something about it.\n  Why did the price of oil futures jump $11 in 1 day? Do you know what \nthe airline industry has told us? That 1-day jump of $11 a barrel cost \nthe airline industry $4 billion extra. They can't survive like that. \nThis is an entity we want to survive. They transport us about the \ncountry and the world. We can do something about it, if we have the \npolitical will.\n  This Senator is going to continue to pound on this issue to try to \nget the attention, and we are getting some heft, when Dorgan and Obama \nand Boxer all start signing up. It is a very elegant, very simple \nthing. You go back and plug the loophole that was unplugged back in \nDecember of 2000 and allow the Government to do what it ought to do by \nsaying that the commodity exchanges have to regulate the trading of oil \nfutures contracts.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, to inform my colleagues and others \ninterested, we are making progress on various amendments that people \nare proposing to the housing bill. As the majority leader has \nindicated, the only amendments we are going to consider are housing \namendments. This is a housing debate. These are the issues on which \npeople are anxious to see resolution so we can begin to make some \nserious movement on the foreclosure crisis in our country.\n  I have a long list of potential amendments, some 44 of them. I am not \nsure all are going to be offered. Some, because we are in a postcloture \nenvironment, might fall. But I strongly urge those who have amendments, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to come to the floor to meet with staff to \ntry to resolve their amendments if at all possible, to reach some \ncompromise on\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nthem so they can be agreed to or in some cases clarity as to how to \nproceed so we can begin to organize how these amendments can be \nhandled.\n  It is my intention shortly on a couple of amendments--a Democratic \namendment and a Republican amendment--where we have reached agreement \nand compromise, to propose those, as my colleague from Alabama will, \nand to agree to those amendments, and then at some point my hope is to \ntry to propose a unanimous consent proposal to accommodate those who \ninsist on floor votes, to accommodate those with time agreements so we \ncan have some clarity as to how the rest of this bill will unfold.\n  There are complicated procedural hurdles we have to weave our way \nthrough, but I think, given the overwhelming vote of 83 to 9 on \ncloture, there is a strong bipartisan desire to complete this housing \nmeasure. We have the opportunity to do that. I need Members or staff, \nwhomever they designate, to come over with their amendments to give \nSenator Shelby and I an opportunity to try to resolve them, to declare \nwhether they are going to qualify for working out some agreement. That \nwould be a great help. There are some, I know, to which we can agree. \nThere are other matters that Members want to bring up on this bill, but \nI know there is going to be strong resistance--and properly so--by the \nmajority leader to entertain ideas that are not pertaining to housing. \nThere will be other opportunities, and there have been other \nopportunities, for the consideration of such ideas, but they are not \ngoing to be a part of this bill, knowing that when we go to the other \nbody with provisions that will not be accepted by the other body, they \nwill kill those ideas, as well as this one, the housing bill.\n  So for reasons that are very practical, not political, we have to \nstay on the theme we are dealing with, housing, foreclosures, and what \nwe can do to put our housing situation on a far better footing and give \nthe institutions and the regulatory bodies the necessary reforms and \ntools that allow them to do their jobs. That is fundamentally what is \nat the heart of this legislation.\n  The other body has completed their proposals, and we are talking with \nthem in productive meetings, with Congressman Frank, chairman of the \nHouse Financial Services Committee, along with Jack Reed, our colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, talking about how we might resolve some of these \ndifferences on these two bills.\n  There are a number of efforts ongoing. Even though we have not been \nengaged in a public debate in this Chamber over the last several hours, \nthere is movement.\n  Those who have amendments, I strongly urge them to come to the floor, \nbring their ideas, and see if we can't resolve how we are going to \nhandle them, either a vote up or down to agree to them or inform the \nauthors that they will probably fail in a postcloture environment.\n  I am grateful to all of our colleagues for their support this morning \non invoking cloture and getting us close to adoption of this \ncomplicated housing proposal. We had very strong votes beginning in \nDecember with the FHA modernization bill, in April with the foreclosure \nproposals, and most recently 19 to 2 out of our committee on this \nparticular proposal, and, of course, the vote this morning on cloture, \n83 to 9. So there is a strong indication that I take from our \ncolleagues' actions that there is a desire to get this bill done. We \nhave the opportunity to do that in the next few hours, a day or so, to \ncomplete this process before the Independence Day recess.\n  The ideas I just suggested, the proposals we are making, will help us \ncome closer to that reality if people will take advantage of them.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I want to speak directly to the folks \nat home right now. In the last few days, we have heard Senators say \nthat we are in a historical crisis that requires action by the Federal \nGovernment. Supporters of this bill say it directs relief to homeowners \nwho desperately need it, and deserve it. But they are trying to sell \nyou on the cover of a book without letting you see what is inside. I \nlike to know what kind of product I am buying before I open my wallet. \nAs U.S. Senators, we have a responsibility to dig through any piece of \nlegislation before we open up your pocketbook.\n  This bill is over 600 pages long. I have seen portions of it in the \nBanking Committee and the Finance Committee, but for the first time we \nare seeing the whole package here on the Senate floor. I am not buying \nit, and I do not think you, your children, and your grandchildren \nshould have to either. Let me tell you why.\n  This bill puts you, the taxpayer, at risk. It creates a new, \npermanent tax on mortgage business done by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nThat tax threatens the solvency of those institutions and permanently \npunishes the shareholders, many of which are institutional investors \nsuch as pension funds. The tax also reduces the amount of capital these \nGSEs can provide to the mortgage lending system in a moment of serious \nliquidity issues in the market.\n  Furthermore, the FHA is already projecting losses of over $4.6 \nbillion from existing loans, which will wipe out 22 percent of its \ncapital reserves. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nparticipants in the FHA refinancing program will re-default at a rate \nof 35 percent. That is more than one out of every three loans \nrefinanced through the program. We are putting more bad loans on an \nalready broken program that can't handle the risks it currently has. Is \nthat a good idea? Of course not.\n  The author of this bill says it does not put the taxpayer on the \nhook. That is just not true. First, the tax on Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac will be paid by ordinary Americans, either through higher costs for \nfuture mortgages or through lower share prices in their retirement \naccounts. Is that fair? No.\n  Second, taxpayers are on the hook for any losses beyond what is being \ntaken from the GSEs. Supporters of this legislation say that will not \nhappen, but even their own numbers show just how likely it is for this \nprogram to be bankrupt in a few years. The CBO score for losses only \nfits within the GSE tax set aside for the program because they assume \nless than a third of the refinancing authority is used. I think time \nwill prove all those assumptions wrong. The real question in my mind is \nwhen will we have to bail out FHA and who is going to pay for it?\n  This bill not only creates a dangerous new tax, but also uses that \nrevenue to fund housing initiatives off the books of the Federal \nGovernment. Under this bill, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be \nassessed $500-800 million annually by the Federal Government. At least \nfor the first year, that money will be used to cover the inevitable \nlosses to the FHA from a bailout program for irresponsible and \nundeserving lenders and borrowers. The balance of that money will pay \nfor a permanent slush fund for housing causes that will end up \nbenefitting partisan groups, some of whom have recently had workers \nindicted for voter fraud. Additionally, there is an extra $150 million \nin counseling funds for these partisan groups, with even less \naccountability attached to those funds.\n  Another provision that has received little attention is $4 billion in \nemergency spending to buy foreclosed homes. That is nothing more than a \ngift to the banks, who by definition are the ones who have foreclosed \nhomes to sell. These funds will have the perverse effect of increasing \nforeclosures because banks know there is going to be a willing buyer.\n  And if these tax and spend policies weren't enough, this bill vastly \nincreases an already overreaching Federal bureaucracy. It nearly \ndoubles the size of the FHA. It assigns important decisionmaking \nresponsibilities with regard to this program to a board created of \nvarious agency heads, not Congress. It creates a new trust fund for \n``affordable housing'' that is permanent and mandatory, outside the \nnormal appropriations process. It requires loan originators to \nparticipate in a National Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. If \nyou are a fan of big government, this bill definitely delivers.\n  But I am only skimming the surface. Unfortunately, it gets much \nworse. Make no mistake--this bill is a huge bailout for our Nation's \nlenders. The bill's author has said this bill is going to help the \neveryday man. Let's take a closer look and see what you think.\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n  The FHA program created by this bill refinances borrowers who have \ndefaulted on their mortgages into government-insured loans. Just how \nmuch of those loans does the government insure? One hundred percent. By \ncreating this program, this bill limits how much lenders can possibly \nlose through mortgage transactions. When you invest in a business \nventure or in the stock market does the Federal Government cap your \nlosses? No. But when it comes to big banks this bill willingly \ntransfers downside risk of future losses right to the FHA and you, the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  As I said before, CBO estimates at least one in three mortgages \nrefinanced under this bill will default again. Therefore, we have put \nin motion a scenario where taxpayers take the hit rather than the \nlenders who made that loan to a risky buyer who bought a house he could \nnot afford, with a mortgage he could not afford. That is a bailout for \nthe lender any way you slice it.\n  Probably the most glaring flaw is that the bill offers no way to keep \nout irresponsible and undeserving borrowers. In fact, borrowers are not \nrequired to show that they did not lie on their original mortgage \napplication. To qualify for the bailout, borrowers get to sign a piece \nof paper saying they did not lie the last time they signed for a \nmortgage. This bill subjects the FHA to another wave of fraud that \nthese no-documentation loans experienced in the primary market.\n  Borrowers who have not demonstrated an ability to pay can get a \nbailout because there is no requirement that borrowers have made any \ntimely payments on their original mortgage. There is no income cap on \neligibility for the program. As written, this bill would allow \nhomeowners with houses valued at up to $550,000 to qualify for a \nbailout. In my county in Kentucky, which is one of the most expensive \nin the whole State, the median home price is $270,000. So this bill \nwould give a bailout to people with homes valued at twice the median \nprice. The American people are compassionate and often willing to help \nthose in need. But I do not think giving a bailout to anyone who owns \nsuch an expensive home is fair to the average American. If you recall \nfrom the economic stimulus debate, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle vehemently opposed rebates for ``rich'' taxpayers. Now when \nit comes to bailing out banks that made risky loans, all income classes \nof borrowers can qualify.\n  The list of problems goes on and on. Mortgage professionals, people \nwho by definition should have known better, can qualify for the \nbailout. People who defaulted on government loans before can come back \nto the trough. People who drained all the equity in their homes to buy \nflat screen TVs and new cars can qualify. This seems to me like a \nsurefire way to set a program up for failure at a time when the FHA is \nreporting record losses.\n  The tax division of this bill also is flawed in several respects. In \nparticular, it includes a $9.8 billion tax increase on small businesses \nthat the Senate Finance Committee has never held hearings to review. \nThis credit card reporting provision will result in a vast increase in \npaperwork for credit card companies and in millions of confusing and \npossibly misleading notices sent to the IRS and taxpayers.\n  Another provision that needs more work is the new limitation on the \ngain exclusion for the sale of a second home. This provision applies to \nany second property owned by the taxpayer, including an investment \nhome. That means that taxpayers who lose their principal residence and \nmove into a vacation home or investment property will also lose the \nbenefit of gain exclusion. Is that the drafter's intent? This \nlegislation has not been well thought out. That scenario should be \nexcluded, and I have no doubt it would have been if this bill had \nfollowed the normal course through the Senate Finance Committee.\n  There are a few provisions in this bill which are worthwhile and \nneeded. Most importantly, the bill creates a strong new regulator for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress has been trying to pass such a \nbill for years, and it is sorely needed and worth passing on its own. \nBut the proponents of the bailout are holding those needed reforms \nhostage to get their bailout.\n  I and many others hoped to offer amendments to try to mitigate the \ndamage this bill could do. Unfortunately we have been blocked from \ndoing so. On a bill of this magnitude that is irresponsible and \nunacceptable.\n  One of my amendments would have made refinancing more affordable for \nthe vast majority of homeowners by allowing them to write off interest \npoints paid on a home mortgage in the year paid. For no good reason, \nthe Tax Code requires homeowners to treat points differently, depending \non when they are incurred. If they are incurred in an original purchase \nfinancing, the points are deductible, just as they would be under my \namendment. If they are incurred in a refinancing, the points can only \nbe deducted ratably, over the life of the loan. The difference is so \nsignificant that it will affect the ability of millions of homeowners \nto afford refinancing.\n  The whole idea of bailing out people who took a gamble and lost is an \nirresponsible way to spend the taxpayers' money. I do not think the \npeople back in Kentucky sent me to Washington to bailout speculators, \nWall Street executives, and people who drained the equity in their \nhomes to buy flat screen televisions and new cars.\n  This bill is simply the wrong kind of housing policy for Congress to \nbe engaging in and is fatally flawed. Even the sponsor of the bill has \nadmitted on the Senate floor that he is not even sure it is going to \nwork, but he hopes it will. As the most deliberative body in the world, \nI think we can do better. In fact, we owe it to our grandchildren to do \nbetter. Who is going to bail them out when FHA is left with $300 \nbillion in bad debt? On behalf of the people of Kentucky, this Senator \nis not buying this bailout bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate has turned to the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act, which in large part was the \nresponsibility of three of my colleagues, Senator Dodd, Senator Reed \nfrom Rhode Island, and Senator Shelby, which will provide much needed \nrelief to our country's homeowners and the communities they live in.\n  Ohio has been at the center of this storm for a number of years, and \nafter years of neglect from the Federal Government, I am pleased that \nwe are finally about to act. Congress needs to help and it needs to act \nquickly.\n  I understand we have an agreement that limited amendments today to \nthose that are relevant. This agreement I hope remains in effect \nthrough the consideration of the legislation.\n  Ohio set a record for foreclosures last year, some 83,000 \nforeclosures. That is more than 1,000 a week. That is close to 200 a \nday. More precisely, every week about 1,500 families have lost their \nhomes. The end is nowhere in sight. These families need our help now. \nThey do not need political posturing on unrelated issues. We have seen \ntoo much of that. That can wait until we are done with this bill.\n  This fall, by some estimates, we will see the peak of the subprime \nmortgage resets. One research firm predicts half the subprime loans \nmade in the fourth quarter of 2006 will fail. That is not lending; that \nis gambling with someone else's house.\n  The people who were sold these loans, and the neighborhoods they live \nin, must be among our highest priorities. The needs of communities are \ncritical because this crisis has an impact far beyond the people who \nlose their homes. Whenever a home goes in foreclosure, the value of \nneighboring homes drops by about 1 percent. Crime goes up. Just when \nproperty tax revenues are plunging and the resources of a city or town \nare stretched to the limit, more resources are needed, and there is \nless ability to deliver to help people.\n  The Foreclosure Prevention Act which we passed in April has been \nincorporated in this legislation before us. It will provide close to $4 \nbillion in aid to communities so they can rehabilitate or in some cases \nknock down abandoned homes in neighborhoods.\n  The bill will fund more counseling to help people rework unfair \nloans. Yesterday in Columbus I visited a neighborhood on East 21st \nStreet where the Columbus Housing Partnership has been so helpful in \ncounseling many people. More than 100 people, they say, have had their \nhomes saved because of this counseling. Two of them were with me on \nEast 21st Street yesterday.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n  This is no easy task. Once upon a time you took out a loan with your \nlocal bank to buy a home, you knew people at the bank, they knew you, \nand the bank had a stake, as much stake in your success as you did.\n  Today, especially for subprime loans, that is seldom the case. The \nvoice on the phone and the owner of the loan could be anywhere in the \nworld. Help in navigating the mortgage maze is essential. But the \nproblem is too big for one-by-one approaches. No matter how hard \ncounselors and servicers work--and they are doing yeoman work all over \nthe country, Toledo, Cleveland, Dayton, and Springfield, all over my \nState and all over the country. No matter how hard they work, we need a \nmore comprehensive approach to help homeowners who could afford to stay \nin their homes if they had a fair mortgage.\n  The bill before us establishes a temporary program within the Federal \nHousing Administration that, on a voluntary basis, would allow lenders \nand borrowers to refinance their mortgages into a more affordable and \nstable product.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Act would help perhaps half a million \nfamilies. But the impact is far wider, as their neighbors and \ncommunities will be helped as well if we can avoid foreclosure for \nthese homes in the neighborhoods.\n  These provisions are not a bailout for borrowers or lenders. \nBorrowers get no subsidy from the Federal Government. They will have to \npay a mortgage on their property like everybody else. The difference is \nthey will now have a standard 30-year fixed rate loan based on the true \nvalue of the property, rather than an exploding adjustable rate \nmortgage based on an inflated appraisal. Lenders, meanwhile, will have \nto take a loss by writing down the mortgage below the actual value of \nthe property if they choose to participate.\n  In many cases it will be in their interest to do so. With bank-owned \nhomes selling at a fraction of the outstanding mortgages on them, many \nwill want to accept a smaller loss. If the program works as we hope, it \nshould provide liquidity to the mortgage market so that lenders will be \nable to again make prudent loans.\n  The legislation also creates an affordable housing fund. With our \nstock of affordable housing both aging and shrinking, this fund will be \nvital to the many families who are struggling to keep a roof over their \nchildren's heads.\n  Families who are ready to buy a home will be helped in several ways \nby this legislation. First, it includes a modernization of the FHA \nprogram. What we saw over the past several years was an incredible \nshrinking of the market share for FHA loans as borrowers opted for \nriskier loans instead. The legislation would update the FHA program, \nincreasing limits for high-cost areas and streamlining its operation. \nSecond, home buyers will be eligible for a credit of $8,000 in the form \nof a 15-year interest-free loan. This credit is phased out for higher \nincome taxpayers, and it will last 1 year. But it should provide help \nnot only to home buyers but help to stabilize markets around the \ncountry.\n  The bill includes several other noticeable tax provisions. It \nprovides an additional $11 billion of mortgage revenue bonds, so that \nState housing agencies can respond to the housing crisis in a way that \nbest suits their situation. It provides a measure of property tax \nrelief to people who do not itemize on their taxes, an estimated 28 \nmillion taxpayers.\n  This legislation provides a needed overhaul to the regulation of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. This is an \nissue that has been debated for years. We have now reached a point \nwhere we can move forward. The bill creates a new independent regulator \nwith broad authority equivalent to that of other Federal financial \nregulators. The new regulator will be able to establish capital \nstandards, management standards, and review and approve new products. \nIt will have teeth too, as it will be able to enforce its orders \nthrough various means.\n  This new regulator will draw from various agencies already in place, \nand it will be required to undertake rulemaking in several areas. I \nhope my colleagues will give some attention to the transition from the \ncurrent regulatory regime to the new one. It has taken us years to get \nto this point in the legislative process. It is unlikely that a new \nregulator can be created to do a competent job overnight.\n  Let me conclude by commending Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby \nfor bringing us to this point today, and especially to the majority \nleader for his work in getting there. No one in the Senate wants to \nhelp people who engaged in fraud or speculation. But hundreds of \nthousands of people were sold mortgages designed to fail. These people \ncan stay in their homes with a fair mortgage but will be on the street \nwithout our assistance. They deserve our help. They deserve it now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Helene N. \nWhite, of Michigan, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum be equally divided between the parties, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is presently in executive session.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Am I correct that we are now on a judicial nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 hours equally divided. But the \nSenate has used some of that time in the quorum call.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself such time as I may need in the time \nallotted to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Today, the Senate is turning to a package of three nominations for \nlifetime appointments to the Federal bench in Michigan, including \nPresident Bush's nominations of Judge Helene White and Raymond \nKethledge to fill the final two vacancies of the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  These nominations are the result of the hard work of Senators Levin \nand Stabenow, who consulted with President Bush to end a decade-long \nimpasse in filling vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. During that time, \nSenate Republicans had blocked President Clinton's nominees to that \ncircuit, leaving open four vacancies.\n  I am worried that some on the other side seem intent on preventing us \nfrom making this progress. Judge White's nomination should be a \nconsensus nomination. Judge White was nominated by a Democratic \nPresident and by a Republican President. When the most partisan \nPresident in modern history, one responsible for sending us so many \ndivisive nominations, renominates a Clinton judicial nominee, it \nactually should send a signal.\n  Nevertheless, her nomination drew criticism from the Republican \nleader and opposition from Republicans on our committee. After I \nexpedited a hearing on the Michigan nominees, figuring that 10 years of \nwaiting might have been enough, Republicans objected that we were \nmoving too fast. They peppered her with more questions than any nominee \nof President Bush that I can recall. At our committee markup, \nRepublicans made the wildly dumbfounding claims that she is not \nexperienced. But after more than 25 years as a Michigan State court \njudge, including 15 as a State appellate court judge, she is a more \nexperienced judicial nominee than many of those they previously \nsupported.\n  It is interesting that Republicans did not raise this concern when \nthey were supporting far less experienced nominees such as Jennifer \nElrod and Catharina Haynes of Texas to fill circuit court vacancies. In \nfact, Judge White has been on the appellate bench longer than Mr. \nKethledge, the other Sixth Circuit nominee, has been out of law school.\n  It is ironic that last week several Republican Senators held a press \nconference with representatives from right wing groups organized by a \ngroup calling itself Concerned Women for America. It is Republican \nopposition to a woman nominee that has been holding up the progress of \nfilling judicial vacancies. Now this woman nominee they seemed \nconcerned about is described on President Bush's White House Web site \nas ``an experienced and highly qualified judge, who is known for her \nintellect, work ethic, and demeanor.'' She has been given the highest \nrating for the position by the ABA. Yet her extensive experience, which \nis far more than the experience of many supported by my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, does not seem to meet the sudden last-minute \nstandards set by Republican members of the committee.\n  As a state judge, she has not been called upon to consider and apply \ncertain Federal statutes. That would be the same with thousands of \nstate judges all over the country. It is understandable. But if you \ncharacterize her because of that as unqualified, that would turn back \nthe clock to before the confirmation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nwho had been a State legislator and a State judge. Justice O'Connor was \nnot experienced in deciding Federal law issues before confirmation as \nthe first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. I think we should all agree \nshe nonetheless served the Nation well in that capacity. And I agreed \nwith her chief sponsor in this body, my friend and former colleague, \nBarry Goldwater of Arizona, and I was proud to join with him in voting \nfor Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  It is also ironic that week after week, as the Senate continues to \nmake progress in filling judicial vacancies, we hear a steady stream of \ngrumbling from Republicans whose main priorities now seem to be to \nprevent the Senate and the Judiciary Committee from addressing the \npriorities of ordinary Americans. You would almost think that gasoline \nhas not skyrocketed as the dollar has collapsed in value worldwide \nbecause of the huge debt caused by the Iraq war. They do not seem to \nrealize that some of the typical Americans in my State of Vermont and, \nI suspect, the Presiding Officer's State of New Jersey, are finding it \nvery hard to buy gas to go to work or pick up their children after \nschool or do their grocery shopping or visit an ailing parent. You \nwould not think these were important matters when you hear of the \npriorities on the other side. You would not be aware there is a huge \ncrisis in the housing industry, where people are losing houses all over \nthis country, hard-working Americans who finally had the American dream \nof owning their own home and are now losing it. You would think that \nwas not happening by what we hear from the other side.\n  Republicans are now regularly objecting to hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. They seem disappointed when we conclude hearings \nwithin the first 2 hours of the Senate's day and they cannot disrupt \nthem.\n  They objected to Senator Feinstein completing an important hearing on \ninterrogation techniques used against detainees. It is almost as if, if \nwe can block that hearing from happening, these terrible things never \nwould have happened because Republicans foreclosed the ability of \nAmericans to hear what went on in those hearings.\n  They objected to a hearing highlighting the impact of Supreme Court \ndecisions on the daily lives of all Americans even though that meant \ncutting short the testimony of two brave women victimized by such a \ndecision, Pennsylvanians who came to Washington to tell how badly they \nhad been hurt by these decisions. The Republicans effectively silenced \nthem to make sure they could not speak and could not testify because \nthey said we should not have these Judiciary Committee meetings. So \nthese two Pennsylvanians had to go back home unable to finish telling \ntheir story.\n  And a few days ago, the Republican minority objected to a hearing \nthat had been requested by Judiciary Committee Republicans to examine \nthe need for additional Federal judgeships throughout the country. This \nnow all too familiar pattern is childish and serves no good purpose.\n  We will see later this week whether they allow Senator Biden to \nproceed to chair a hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs \nconcerning fugitives from justice.\n  Regrettably, these obstructionist tactics from the other side of the \naisle are likely to continue without regard to the real priorities of \nthe struggling Americans I spoke about, the voters who have elected \nevery Senator to serve. Their priorities are being pushed aside.\n  We read last week another story about the dissatisfaction of right \nwing\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nactivists and their pressuring of the Republican leadership in the \nSenate. We witnessed their response this month as they forced a reading \nof a substitute amendment to critical climate change legislation. They \ndid this for hours and hours, thereby shutting down the work of the \nSenate.\n  Two weeks ago, we saw a story in Roll Call that included the headline \n``Divided GOP Settles on a Fight Over Judges.'' That headline reminded \nme of the famous Wolfowitz quote about why the Bush administration \nsettled on supposed weapons of mass destruction as the justification \nfor attacking Iraq even though they knew there were no weapons of mass \ndestruction--it was the rationale they could agree on. They all knew \nthey wanted to attack Iraq, they knew they did not have the facts to \nattack Iraq, so they found a cover story they could use. And thousands \nof lives and $1 trillion later they say: Oops, sorry, no weapons of \nmass destruction, but, boy, we all agreed on the rationale.\n  The report in Roll Call included discussion by Republican Senators of \nthe politics that fuels their efforts to appeal to ``conservative \nactivists'' and ``ignite base voters'' and find an issue that ``serves \nas a rare unifier for Senate Republicans'' and their Presidential \nnominee. That piece mirrored an earlier article in the Washington \nTimes, reporting how this is all part of an effort to bolster Senator \nMcCain's standing among conservatives.\n  This political song-and-dance would not be so bad if it were not \nimpacting the integrity and the independence of the Federal judiciary, \nsomething that in the past both Republicans and Democrats tried to \nprotect.\n  I had suspected that much of this complaining was because Republican \npartisans were looking for an issue to energize their political base \nduring an election year. The reports from the media outlets have \nconfirmed my suspicions. I wonder if they realize that liberals, \nconservatives, Republicans, and Democrats are suffering from having to \npay these outrageous gas prices. Wouldn't it be better if they worked \non that?\n\n  Americans, Republicans and Democrats, in all parts of this country, \nare seeing their houses disappear and the value they had hoped for \ntheir retirement gone. Wouldn't addressing that be something better on \nwhich to unite America?\n  On this date in the 1996 session, another Presidential election year \nbut one in which a Republican Senate majority was considering judicial \nnominees of a Democratic President, do you know how many judicial \nnominees had been confirmed? The answer is easy: None, not a single \none. That was a session that ended without a single circuit court judge \nbeing confirmed.\n  By contrast, if Republicans will allow the confirmation of Judge \nWhite to the Sixth Circuit, we will have today completed the \nconfirmations for 12 judges, including 4 circuit court judges, so far \nthis Presidential election year, compared to 1996, when none had been \nconfirmed at this point.\n  In addition to today's three nominees, two more judicial nominees \nalready reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee are pending on the \nSenate's executive calendar. I have placed four more on the Judiciary \nCommittee business agenda for later this week.\n  It is perhaps the ultimate irony that here, as the Democratic \nleadership of the Senate takes the extraordinary step of proceeding to \ntwo more of President Bush's circuit court nominees in June of a \nPresidential election year, I am being criticized by Republicans for, \nof all things, moving too quickly. I had hoped, in light of the \ndiscussion between the majority leader and the Republican leader \nearlier this spring, to have concluded Senate action on this package of \nMichigan nominees more quickly. I tried to have these votes in May \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, but we were thwarted in that effort by \nRepublican concerns about expediting consideration of these Bush \nnominees. So what we might have done in May, we are now having to do in \nJune.\n  It reminds me a little bit of the Republican antics and shenanigans \nearlier this year that cost us progress in February. Rather than making \nprogress, Republicans refused to make a quorum in the Judiciary \nCommittee that entire month so no judicial nominees would come out in \nMarch, and then in March, they could give speeches.\n  So let there be no mistake. If Judge White is confirmed, we will have \nbroken a 10-year impasse on the Sixth Circuit. By contrast, the \nRepublican Senate majority during the Clinton years refused to consider \nPresident Clinton's Sixth Circuit nominees for 3 years and left four \nvacancies on that court.\n  When, as chairman, I scheduled a hearing and vote for Judge Julia \nSmith Gibbons of Tennessee and Judge John Marshall Rogers of Kentucky, \nwe were able to confirm the first new judges to the Sixth Circuit in 5 \nyears. The others had been pocket-filibustered by Republicans. I said \nwe would not do the same thing to them, and we did not. We moved \nquickly on President Bush's nominees to that circuit. The confirmations \nof Judge White and Mr. Kethledge of Michigan would complete the process \nby filling the two remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Judge White was first nominated by President Clinton to a vacancy on \nthe Sixth Circuit more than 11 years ago, but the Republican-led Senate \nrefused to act on her nomination. She waited in vain for 1,454 days for \na hearing before President Bush withdrew her nomination in March 2001. \nHers was 1 of more than 60 qualified judicial nominees pocket-\nfilibustered by Republicans. This year, President Bush reconsidered and \nrenominated her, and I applaud President Bush for doing so. He deserves \ncredit for trying to close the door on a sorry chapter. I commend the \nPresident for doing it and for what he has said on his White House Web \nsite about Judge White's nomination. I hope the Senate will follow the \nexample of President Bush and confirm Judge White to one of the last \ntwo vacancies on the Sixth Circuit.\n  The Michigan vacancies on the Sixth Circuit have proven a great \nchallenge. I commend the senior Senator from Michigan, chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and his outstanding \ncolleague, Senator Stabenow, for working to end years of impasse. I had \nurged the President to work with the Michigan Senators. After 7 years, \nhe now has.\n  We have come a long way since I became chairman in 2001 when the \nSixth Circuit was in turmoil because Republicans had blocked \nnominations for many years. Today we complete that progress by \nconfirming Judge White and Raymond Kethledge.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time. How much time \nremains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour 32 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are moving forward today on the votes \nfor confirmation of three Federal judges. Among the many very heavy \nresponsibilities of the Senate, the confirmation process ranks very \nhigh. Under our system of government, we give to the judicial branch \nthe responsibility of interpreting the Constitution and establishing \nthe rule of law. That has broad implications. It means the courts \nrender decisions where one citizen has a claim against another, which \ngoes to court. It means a claim when the government and a citizen have \na controversy which is to be settled by an impartial judicial \narbitrator. It also involves some of the historic constitutional \nconfrontations, one of which we will have later this week on the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Where does the Article II power \nof the President end as Commander in Chief, and where does the Article \nI power of the Congress of the United States establish itself under \nArticle I?\n  It is a very, very high calling. When the framers adopted the \nConstitution, Article I was given to the Congress. Article II to the \nexecutive branch and Article III to the judicial branch. Later, Chief \nJustice Marshall, in effect, rewrote the order of priority. I think if \nthe Constitution were to be rewritten today, the judicial branch would \nbe No. 1, because the judicial branch has taken over the \nresponsibility, for a variety of reasons, for deciding all of the \ncutting edge questions.\n  We have had a great deal of focus of attention on the confirmation \nprocess. This attention usually happens when Supreme Court nominations \nare involved. Then, in the major committee hearing rooms, Senators are \nall at\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\ntheir desks. There are not too many Senators at their desks here today. \nIn fact, I don't see anybody at their desk here today, except for the \nPresiding Officer, which is not exactly his desk. It is the vice \npresident's desk. But, Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey looks \ncomfortable in the position. We have had, during the confirmation \nprocess of Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justice Alito, seen the \nSenate at its best--avoiding the controversy, avoiding the \npartisanship, and moving forward in dignified hearings.\n  As I have said before--and it is worth repeating--I compliment the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his courageous \nstand in voting for Chief Justice Roberts. Chief Justice Roberts was \nconfirmed by a vote of 78 to 22. Counting the Independent vote with the \nDemocrats, a majority of the Democrats voted in favor of Chief Justice \nRoberts, and it was a good, unifying symbol. We moved through that \nprocess where there had been some doubt as to how the Senate would \nperform, a doubt which was occasioned by the very bitter infighting, \nwhich characterized the Senate in 2003, 2004, and 2005, when we had the \ncontroversy with the filibuster by one side and the threat to invoke a \nnew rule of cloture with the so-called constitutional or nuclear \noption.\n  I have the pleasure of having my 14-year-old granddaughter with me \nthis week. She just graduated from the eighth grade and is spending a \nweek as an intern in the Senate. It may be a little early for the job. \nHer father spent 6 weeks with Senator Hugh Scott many years ago when he \nwas 17. But, in going over the day's itinerary, I sought to explain to \nmy granddaughter, Silvia Specter, what a confirmation is. She is \nwatching, with more interest, the activities of the Senate today \nbecause she is onboard. It is my hope, with agreements which have been \nreached here today to move ahead with the confirmation of three Federal \njudges today and two more on Thursday, that perhaps we will see a \nreturn to at least some basic level of comity in the Senate. We have \nmoved a considerable distance from the tradition of confirmation of \nFederal judges where, in times gone by, there was merely a review of \nacademic standing, professional standing, and trial practice; now, we \ngo into much more detail of the ideology and philosophy of the \nnominees. That change has led to some deep concerns over the so-called \ncultural wars which have, candidly, muddied the waters. However, it is \nmy hope that in the time that remains in the 110th Congress, we will \nmove ahead with the confirmation of judges on up-and-down votes.\n  The three nominees we are considering today have come to the floor as \na result of an arrangement worked out by the leadership on both sides. \nOriginally, there had been a commitment to have these confirmations \noccur before Memorial Day. When I say ``commitment,'' let me modify \nthat slightly to ``best efforts.'' When the nominees were selected, \nthere was concern on the part of the Republican side of the aisle that \nthere was insufficient time to take up the nomination of appellate \ncourt Judge Helene White to be a judge of the Sixth Circuit.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that the full text of my statement on \nJudge White's nomination be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  By including my statement, I can abbreviate my comments now. In my \nstatement, I note that there were only 22 days between Judge White's \nnomination and hearing, and there was not an opportunity to get into \nthe details of her record, which is a matter not just of procedure, not \njust of form, but of real substance in terms of the committee's ability \nto evaluate Judge White. I shall talk about that specifically, in terms \nof her qualifications and in terms of specific cases which she has \ndecided. The context of the mere 22 days to evaluate her nomination is \nfurther illuminated by the fact that there were so many other nominees \nwho had been on the agenda for much longer. A very distinguished \nlawyer, Peter Keisler, a man who has been praised on the editorial \npages, had been waiting for 726 days for a committee vote on his \nnomination to Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. It is not too \noften that judicial nominees are praised on the editorial pages, but \nPeter Keisler has been. A judge in North Carolina, District Court Judge \nRobert Conrad, who is up for a seat on the Fourth Circuit, has been \nwaiting for a hearing for 343 days. A man named Steve Matthews, also \nfor a seat on the Fourth Circuit, has been waiting for a hearing for \n292 days.\n\n  It seemed to my Republican colleagues and me that where you had a \ncommitment for confirmations by Memorial Day, and you had people who \nhad been waiting around for this length of time and we were in a \nposition to evaluate them, that they should have been the ones to be \nconsidered. But, the majority leader chose otherwise, and now we have \nbefore us the nomination of Judge White for a position on the Sixth \nCircuit.\n  The status of a circuit judge is extremely important in our judicial \nhierarchy because the circuit court--for those who are not familiar \nwith the details of Federal procedure--is the appellate court right \nabove the U.S. District Court, which is the federal trial court. When \nappeals are taken, or, more specifically, a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari is applied for to the Supreme Court of the United States, it \nis a discretionary matter whether the Supreme Court takes the case. \nMost of those applications are not heard--the U.S. Supreme Court takes \nvery few cases from the court of appeals. So, when a three-judge panel \nsits in a circuit court, that is it. Now, sometimes there will be a \ndecision by the circuit court en banc, when the full circuit court will \ndecide, but customarily the decision is only rendered by the three-\njudge panel, and many decisions are two to one.\n  One case which illustrates the importance of the circuit court, and \nespecially the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, was the decision \non the constitutionality of the Terrorist Surveillance Program, the \nprogram put into effect by the President on warrantless wiretaps. These \nwiretaps went on for a long time before they were disclosed--a \nviolation of the National Security Act of 1947, which requires the \nPresident to inform the Intelligence Committees of such proceedings, \nand a violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n  The President has responded to the law that Article II powers are not \naffected by statute, but that is a matter for judicial decision. A \nFederal court in Detroit declared the Terrorist Surveillance Program \nunconstitutional. The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit, and on a \ntwo-to-one decision, the Sixth Circuit decided the plaintiffs did not \nhave standing. That is a complicated legal procedure, which I will not \ntake time to discuss today, but, in short, they do not have a right to \nchallenge it because they are not sufficiently affected by it.\n  There was a dissent in that Sixth Circuit decision. Then, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States denied certiorari--a decision which I \nthought was unfortunate. When you have a major constitutional \nconfrontation between the Congress and the President--the most dominant \nconfrontation of this era--it seems to me the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States ought to decide the issue and, candidly, not look for a \nway to duck it.\n  The doctrine of standing has sufficient flexibility, as illustrated \nby the dissent in the Sixth Circuit, that the Court could have taken \nthe case. There is a lot of flexibility when the court deals with \nissues such as standing. Coming back to the point, one judge of the \nSixth Circuit made the difference. So, when you have a nominee to the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals, or any court of appeals, it is an \nimportant decision.\n  Going back to the topic at hand, we had the hearing on Judge Helene \nWhite, and we had it in a very hurried fashion. We did not have the \nrating of the American Bar Association, and, regrettably, we did not \nhave all the materials that should have been available to the \ncommittee. When judges write opinions, a good many of them are what are \ncalled unpublished. For those who do not know the legal procedures, \nthere are published opinions, which are bound in volumes that are used \nfor precedents. But, the courts make a distinction on what is published \nand what is unpublished, and a good many of Judge White's opinions were \nunpublished and reversed, and we never were able to get them.\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n  I asked Judge White at the hearing about a number of her cases \nbecause my own sense is to get involved in the specifics. In evaluating \njudges and evaluating lawyers on their legal skills, it is very \nrevealing to see what they have decided. Perhaps even more revealing \nthan what they have decided is the way they have reasoned through the \ndecision. My questions about her cases were not designed to be so-\ncalled ``gotcha'' questions. All the cases I used for questioning were \nspecifically listed on Judge White's Senate questionnaire that she \nprovided to the committee on April 25, just 12 days prior to her \nhearing. I thought she would at least be familiar with these cases.\n  One of the cases I questioned Judge White on was captioned People v. \nSantiago. In that case, Judge White dissented from her colleagues' \nopinion, where her colleagues--two other judges--upheld a jury \nconviction of a defendant for first-degree felony murder and armed \nrobbery. Judge White would have reversed the sentence.\n  In this case, the defendant had driven the other two defendants to \nthe house where the robbery and murder were committed, knowing that the \ndefendants intended to rob and likely kill the victim--a classic \nexample of aiding and abetting. It is a basic, fundamental rule of \ncriminal law that an accomplice in a getaway car is a part of the \nconspiracy to rob and is responsible for the consequences of a felony \nmurder which follows--very basic fundamental law.\n  I asked Judge White why she did not agree with her colleagues that \nthe defendant was guilty of aiding and abetting. She could not explain \nwhy her decision deviated from the legal standards. I asked her \nspecifically if it was ``standard, clear-cut law that when somebody \ndrives a codefendant to a place where there is a robbery and a murder, \nthat kind of assistance constitutes guilt on the part of the \ncoconspirator, accessory before the fact?'' She commented, \nunresponsively, that she ``went to law school in Pennsylvania,'' but \nthen continued that ``in Michigan, to be responsible for the principal \noffense, one has to either share the intent to commit the principal \noffense or provide aid and support with knowledge that the principal \noffense was going to be committed.''\n\n  Given that acknowledgment, I again asked her why she came to a \ncontrary conclusion. I asked her if she stood by her decision, even \nthough her two colleagues who participated in the case with her on the \nMichigan Court of Appeals disagreed and the Supreme Court had denied \nappeal, and she responded that she stood by her original judgment, \nwithout providing any legal reasoning to justify that conclusion.\n  I asked Judge White about another case, captioned People v. Ryan. She \nparticipated in the decision affirming the dismissal of a drug dealer's \nconviction. The conviction had been reversed. The circumstances were \nthat the defendant was arrested by Federal agents but was charged and \nconvicted in a state court. The defendant argued that the decision to \npursue a state prosecution rather than a federal prosecution was \nvindictive. The panel on which Judge White sat found that the trial \ncourt's determination that there was vindictive conduct was not clearly \nerroneous. The Supreme Court reversed stating:\n\n       The mere threat to refer the case for State prosecution \n     does not amount to objective evidence of hostile motive.\n\n  The Supreme Court reversed the decision to which Judge White had been \na party.\n  I am sorry for the interruption. Anyone watching this debate on C-\nSPAN just saw a congenial exchange between the distinguished chairman \nand the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. As a matter of fact, \nwe have quite a few such exchanges. The evening is getting late and a \nlot of colleagues have a lot of commitments, and there has been a \nrequest by the majority that I abbreviate my comments. I think I can do \nthat sensibly and will be delighted to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield without losing \nthe floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, Mr. President, I already have yielded.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator said. I hope \npeople understand who are listening. I know the two Senators from \nMichigan are going to speak very briefly. But if we wrapped up the \ncomments in, say, the next 15, 20 minutes, we could then go to a \nrollcall vote on Helene White. I would agree, then, to a voice vote on \nthe other two judges, provided the ranking member had no objection to \nthat, which would probably bring about a huge sigh of relief from \nSenators on both sides of the aisle that we would not be stuck here \nwith three votes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nhis suggestion. It is almost 6 o'clock--a few minutes before--and I \nknow people have a lot of engagements. I think the course he outlines \nis a solid one. I think we can handle the Senate's business in that \nway. As I said earlier, I will expedite my presentation and rely more \non what I have in my statement for the Record. I do not think I am \ngoing to change a whole lot of votes in what I say, but I do think it \nis important for the Senate to understand that voting against Judge \nHelene White is not a matter that is done lightly or without cause. \nThere ought to be a statement as to why.\n  Well, back to the case of People v. Ryan. Quite frequently there is a \nFederal investigation and a State prosecution. It happens all the time. \nIt was very commonplace when I was district attorney of Philadelphia. \nThat scenario is certainly not the basis for saying it is vindictive or \nout of order. For one reason or another, it is better suited to pursue \nthe State court. If a State law is violated, you can do it that way. \nJudge White was wrong, as determined by the appellate court.\n  There is one other case on which I wish to comment. There is a case \ncalled People v. Thomas, which is in the Record and which I will \nincorporate by reference to save some time; however, I do want to \nspecify the case of People v. Hansford, which was an opinion reversed \non appeal by the Michigan Supreme Court and was a third case she had \nsummarized in her questionnaire prior to her hearing.\n  After reading to Judge White in the hearing the defendant's extensive \ncriminal record, which included several counts of larceny and attempted \nlarceny, receiving and concealing stolen property, fleeing and \nalluding, and violations of probation, I noted that habitual offender \nstatutes are designed to take habitual offenders off the streets. I \nasked what her reasoning was for determining that a man with an \nextensive criminal record such as the defendant did not deserve to be \noff the streets for life.\n  Once again, her response to my question was that she was not familiar \nwith the case. She further stated that she ``accept[ed] the Supreme \nCourt's decision . . . and accept[ed] that the sentence was appropriate \n. . . because the Supreme Court has said it is appropriate.''\n  I again asked her whether she thought her decision was correct in \nlight of the Michigan Supreme Court's reversal, and she said:\n\n       I have to have been wrong . . . The Supreme Court reversed. \n     I was wrong. The Supreme Court reversed.\n\n  Well, that is, in my legal opinion, totally insufficient for a \nnominee to respond in that way to a very important question such as \nthat. You have habitual offender statutes which are designed to take \ncareer criminals off the streets. When you have three or more \nconvictions for violent offenses, it has been determined that the \ncriminals ought to have life sentences. Based on the experience I had \nas district attorney dealing with these cases, I authored the Armed \nCareer Criminal bill, which created a federal life sentence for serious \nrepeat offenders convicted of three or more major felonies. The \nfundamental part of the criminal law is to protect society. Recidivists \ncommit 70 percent of the crimes so if there is a habitual offender who \ncommits repeat crimes, they ought to be taken off the streets. Here \nthere was one, and the Supreme Court of Michigan said the treatment \nshould have been for a habitual offender. Judge White didn't treat it \nthat way, and she didn't have any justification for why she didn't \ntreat it that way, and she didn't explain the logic of her reasoning.\n\n  As delineated in the very extensive floor statement, which I have \nalready had printed in the Record, we were not given a great many of \nJudge White's opinions. It was very difficult--really impossible--to \ncalculate her reversal rate when we didn't have those opinions. Based \non the opinions we have,\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nher reversal rate was in excess of 6 percent, much higher than Judge \nRobert Conrad's reversal rate--2 cases out of 175, or about 1 percent. \nThe national average is at 8.6 percent; however, Judge Boyle from North \nCarolina, who was rejected by the Democrats based on his high reversal \nrate, had a reversal rate which was lower than Judge White's. And I \nrepeat, we still don't know what her reversal rate is. We don't know \nwhat her reversal rate is because we had a great many unpublished \nopinions that were reversed on appeal that we did not have an \nopportunity to examine because they were not provided to us.\n  Just a couple of comments in conclusion. It is my hope that we will \nyet return to some basic comity and have a respectable number of \nconfirmations of Federal judges this year. The statistics show that \nPresident Clinton had a significantly larger number of circuit judges \nand district court judges confirmed than President Bush has had in the \nlast 2 years. Further, President Clinton's overall confirmation numbers \nare higher than President Bush's. President Clinton had 65 circuit \njudges and 305 district court judges confirmed, while President Bush \nhas had only 59 circuit judges and 244 district judges confirmed. We \nhave heard several discussions about the so-called ``Thurmond rule''--\nthat is a rule which has been commented upon which, when analyzed, has \nno real substance. During President Clinton's Administration, Chairman \nLeahy commented that the so-called ``Thurmond rule'' was a ``myth,'' \nand then he proceeded to specify a great many judges who had been \nconfirmed late in past Presidents' terms.\n  Upon examination, we find that the facts are that in the last 2 years \nof Presidents' terms, there have been many judicial confirmations. In \n1988, President Reagan's last year in office, the Senate confirmed 7 \ncircuit nominees and 33 district court nominees. In 1992, President \nGeorge H.W. Bush's last year, the Senate confirmed 11 circuit nominees \nand 53 district court nominees. In 2000, President Clinton's last year \nin office, the Senate confirmed 8 circuit nominees and 31 district \ncourt nominees.\n  The Thurmond rule allegedly arose when the issue about the \nconfirmation of judicial nominees came up near the end of President \nCarter's term in office. But, an examination of the facts shows that \nnominations were not being blocked. In fact, by today's standards, the \nend of President Carter's term was a rather remarkable situation. \nPresident Carter nominated Steven Breyer to be a court of appeals judge \nfor the First Circuit on November 13, 1980, after President Carter had \nlost the election to President Reagan. We talk about the fights over \ncircuit judges now. The election was gone. We had a new President. But, \nthe Senate confirmed Steven Breyer to the First Circuit, and history \nshows that he later became a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  We have had some very troubled times on this Senate floor, and that \nkind of infighting and partisanship is something which does not add to \nthe luster of the Senate as the world's greatest deliberative body. We \nhave seen very bitter disputes on this Senate floor. The Republican \nmajority, in my opinion, did not act properly on President Clinton's \nnominees when the Republicans controlled the Senate and the President \nwas a Democrat. I said so on the floor at that time and voted for \nPresident Clinton's qualified nominees.\n  When we had the battle over filibuster versus the so-called nuclear \nconstitutional option, the tradition of this body was strained to the \nutmost, and we dodged that bullet or cannon or nuclear bomb. So, it is \nmy hope that Senator Leahy and I can take the lead, as we have in the \npast. He is the chairman; I am the ranking member. The roles have been \nreversed. We have a lot of role reversals around here. When Pat Leahy \nand Arlen Specter passed the gavel, it was a seamless passing of the \ngavel. We are not going to filibuster Judge White. I am going to vote \nagainst her for the reasons I have given here, and more detailed in my \nstatement. I have not campaigned against her. I think the matter is up \nfor every individual Senator to judge. My expectation is that she will \nbe confirmed. I think there may well be a fair number of votes against \nher, but I haven't counted the votes. But, I think the important thing \nis that we have an up-and-down vote, and that we not have a filibuster. \nWe have waiting in the wings the judge from North Carolina, Judge \nConrad, and the man from South Carolina, also nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit. I hope we move on these nominees.\n  I also have written to my colleagues who are not returning blue slips \non nominees from New Jersey and from Maryland and from Rhode Island. I \nhave talked to them and urged them to return their blue slips, urging \nthat we not maintain vacancies in anticipation of the election results. \nBut, essentially, it is my hope that we can move ahead in a way that is \nin the tradition of the Senate and to discharge our constitutional \nresponsibilities with up-or-down votes.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that my full statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senator Arlen Specter, Floor Statement, Nomination of Judge Helene \n              White to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n       I have sought recognition to discuss the nomination of \n     Judge Helene White to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Sixth Circuit, but before I discuss the merits of her \n     nomination, I'd like to remind the members of this Committee \n     of the history behind this nomination.\n       On April 15, 2008, Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Leahy \n     committed to confirming at least three more circuit court \n     nominees by the Memorial Day recess. Senator Reid said: \n     ``Senator Leahy and I are going to do everything we can to \n     approve three circuit court judges by Memorial Day. . . . Who \n     knows, we may even get lucky and get more than that. We have \n     a number of people from whom to choose.''\n       The same day as the Majority's commitment, the White House \n     reached an agreement with the Senators from Michigan on \n     nominations to the Sixth Circuit, which broke a decade-long \n     impasse. The impasse began in 1997, when President Clinton \n     first nominated Judge Helene White to a seat on the Sixth \n     Circuit. The Senate did not act on Judge White's nomination \n     prior the end of the Clinton Administration, and as a result, \n     there has been an ongoing feud between the Michigan Senators \n     and the White House, which led to numerous filibusters of \n     Sixth Circuit nominees in 2003 and 2004, and left the Sixth \n     Circuit with an understaffed court for over ten years. The \n     April 15th agreement between the White House and the Michigan \n     Senators specified that the White House would withdraw the \n     nomination of Mr. Stephen Murphy to the Sixth Circuit and \n     would instead nominate Judge White to that seat. In return, \n     the Michigan Senators would return their blue slips on Mr. \n     Raymond Kethledge, another Sixth Circuit nominee who has been \n     blocked for over 700 days, and Judge White. Mr. Murphy was \n     nominated to a Michigan district court seat instead, and the \n     Michigan Senators agreed to return blue slips on his \n     nomination.\n       On April 29th, when it became clear that the Majority \n     intended to include the recent nomination of Judge White in \n     the promised ``three circuit court nominees confirmed by \n     Memorial Day deal,'' Senator McConnell and I sent a letter to \n     Senators Reid and Leahy advising them of the logistical \n     impossibility of confirming Judge White by Memorial Day. In \n     the letter, we noted the numerous ``time-consuming steps in \n     the judicial confirmation process'' and expressed our concern \n     that ``[g]iven these standard prerequisites and Judge Helene \n     White's recent nomination date of April 15, 2008, we do not \n     believe regular order and process will allow for her \n     confirmation prior to May 23, 2008.'' We further observed the \n     ABA rating for Judge White was not likely to be completed in \n     time, given the ABA's standard timeframe for completing \n     ratings, and noted that the ``Democratic Majority has placed \n     particular importance [on the ABA rating] over the years.'' \n     In fact, the Judiciary Committee has never held a hearing for \n     a circuit court nominee prior to receiving his or her ABA \n     rating.\n       On May 7th, a mere 22 days after her nomination, the \n     Committee held a hearing on Judge White. Twenty-two days is a \n     very short period of time to evaluate any circuit court \n     nominee's record, but this expedited confirmation process was \n     even more troubling in the case of Judge White. Judge White \n     has been a state court judge her entire career and has \n     participated in over 4500 cases on the Michigan Court of \n     Appeals alone. It has been eight years since her last \n     nomination was pending, and in that time period, she likely \n     participated in over 2000 cases in addition to the 2500 she \n     participated in before 1997. That is quite a record to go \n     through in just 22 days.\n       As is standard Committee procedure, questions were \n     submitted to both Judge White and Mr. Kethledge after their \n     hearing. Republicans were criticized for submitting these \n     initial questions even though they submitted a total of only \n     73 questions to Judge White, which is no more than other \n     circuit court nominees have received from Democrats. In fact, \n     several recent Bush appellate nominees and a Department of \n     Justice nominee have received more questions from Democrats \n     than Judge White received from\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\n     Republicans. Democrats submitted 108 questions for Judge \n     Jennifer Elrod, a 5th Circuit nominee, 80 questions for Judge \n     Leslie Southwick, another 5th Circuit nominee, and 250 \n     questions for Grace Becker, a nominee to the Civil Rights \n     Division of the Department of Justice. In addition, the \n     Committee had more time to evaluate these other nominees' \n     records prior to their hearings. Contrasted with the mere 22 \n     days the Committee had to evaluate Judge White's record, the \n     Committee had 112 days to evaluate Judge Elrod's record \n     between her nomination and her hearing, 121 days for Judge \n     Southwick, and 117 days for Ms. Becker. I believe these \n     questions for Judge White were particularly warranted given \n     the expedited hearing schedule for her nomination. Both \n     nominees' returned their answers by Wednesday, May 21st, \n     three days before the end of the session, negating the \n     proposition that Republicans' questions slowed these \n     nominations.\n       As Senator McConnell and I predicted, the ABA did not issue \n     its rating for Judge White prior to the Memorial Day recess, \n     and the Committee was unable to complete its work on her \n     nomination prior to the recess.\n       The Majority did not fulfill its commitment to confirm \n     three more circuit court nominees by Memorial Day because \n     they chose to expedite the confirmation of a recently \n     submitted circuit court nominee rather than acting on any of \n     the other outstanding circuit court nominees currently \n     pending in Committee whose paperwork has been complete for \n     months or even years longer than Judge White's.\n       The failed Memorial Day commitment is not the first time \n     the Majority has not fulfilled expectations. At the beginning \n     of this Congress in February 2007, Senator Reid stated: \n     ``[W]e are going to do our very best to make sure this is not \n     our last circuit court judge [confirmation] but the first of \n     a significant number who can at least meet the standards of \n     Congresses similarly situated as ours.'' During the last 20 \n     years, on average, the Senate has confirmed 17 circuit court \n     nominees in the final two years of a president's term, and in \n     President Clinton's final two years in office, the Senate \n     confirmed 15 circuit court nominees. Since Senator Reid made \n     that statement in February of last year, this Senate has \n     confirmed only 8 circuit court nominees, less than half of \n     the historical average, and the Majority has intimated that \n     they may not process any more circuit court nominees this \n     year. Hence, Senator Reid's February statement was the first \n     of many unfulfilled commitments.\n       Second, in his announcement of the deal, Senator Reid \n     acknowledged the fundamental unfairness of discriminating \n     against circuit court nominees from states with two \n     Republican Senators in favor of nominees from states with \n     Democratic delegations or mixed delegations. He stated: \n     ``[W]e have a number of places from which the Judiciary \n     Committee can move matters to the floor. We have North \n     Carolina, South Carolina, Rhode Island, Maryland . . . \n     Pennsylvania. . . . Virginia. . . . Maryland. We have a wide \n     range to choose from. . . . [N]o, it should not be because \n     you have two from the same party from one State and they \n     are not our party; that should not cause them not to have \n     their nominee approved. . . . I think if you have two \n     Senators from the same party, they should not be \n     discriminated against. I mentioned their names. Their \n     names are Matthews and Conrad.'' Notwithstanding this \n     acknowledgment, the Majority insisted on proceeding with \n     Judge White and Mr. Kethledge rather than moving to other \n     exceptional circuit court nominees from states with \n     Republican Senators such as Steve Matthews of South \n     Carolina and Robert Conrad of North Carolina who had been \n     ready and waiting for Senate action for months longer than \n     Judge White. Once again Senator Reid disregarded his prior \n     commitment not to discriminate against states with \n     Republican delegations, breaking yet another commitment.\n       Now, I'd like to turn to Judge White's qualifications. \n     Providing advice and consent on judicial nominees is one of \n     the most important duties of a United States Senator. I take \n     my role in the confirmation process very seriously, and I \n     have serious concerns about Judge White's qualifications to \n     be a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Except for \n     the two years she spent clerking for a Michigan State Supreme \n     Court judge, Judge White has been a state court judge her \n     entire career. She has never litigated a case, she has never \n     handled clients, and she has had extremely limited experience \n     with federal law as a state court judge.\n       While this lack of certain legal experience by a circuit \n     court nominee certainly would not immediately disqualify the \n     candidate from holding a federal appellate position, given \n     the short time frame the Senate has had to consider Judge \n     White's record, these factors are significant in her case. \n     She had a very limited opportunity to demonstrate her ability \n     to handle her docket and the complicated legal issues that \n     face a federal appellate court judge.\n       Given her lack of experience with federal law, Judge White \n     was questioned about the types of federal issues that she has \n     handled and was asked to articulate her understanding of some \n     common federal legal principles. She repeatedly responded \n     that she had not dealt with these issues and was unable even \n     to discuss some common federal legal issues and the cases \n     addressing them.\n       At her hearing, I also asked Judge White several questions \n     about decisions that she had participated in on the Michigan \n     Court of Appeals that were reversed by the Michigan Supreme \n     Court. She repeatedly stated that she was unfamiliar with the \n     cases and did not recall the factual scenarios or her legal \n     reasoning. Even after I had given her the relevant facts of \n     the cases, she was unable even to articulate her legal \n     analysis or reasoning process. My questions about her cases \n     were not designed to be ``gotcha'' questions; the cases I \n     mentioned were all specifically listed in Judge White's \n     Senate questionnaire that she provided the Committee on April \n     25, just 12 days prior to her hearing. Further, for three of \n     the cases, she had provided the Committee with short \n     summaries of the facts and holdings in her questionnaire. At \n     the very least, I thought she would be familiar with the \n     cases she apparently had reviewed recently in order to \n     provide the Committee with those summaries.\n       In one case upon which I questioned Judge White, People v. \n     Santiago, she dissented from her colleagues' opinion \n     upholding a jury conviction of a defendant for first degree \n     felony murder and armed robbery. In this case, the defendant \n     had driven the two other defendants to the house where the \n     robbery and murder were committed, knowing that the \n     defendants intended to rob and likely kill the victim--a \n     classic example of aiding and abetting. When I asked her \n     about her dissent which held that the defendant was not \n     guilty of aiding and abetting, she could not explain why her \n     decision deviated from the legal standards for aiding and \n     abetting, as enunciated by the majority opinion and as \n     affirmed by the Michigan Supreme Court when they denied \n     appeal. I specifically asked her if it was ``standard, clear-\n     cut law that when somebody drives a co-defendant to a place \n     where there is a robbery and a murder, that kind of \n     assistance constitutes guilt on the part of the co-\n     conspirator, accessory before the fact?'' She responded first \n     that she ``went to law school in Pennsylvania,'' but then \n     continued that ``in Michigan, to be responsible for the \n     principle offense, one has to either share the intent to \n     commit the principal offense or provide aid and support with \n     knowledge that the principal offense was going to be \n     committed.'' Given that acknowledgement, I again asked her \n     why she came to the conclusion that the defendant was not \n     guilty of aiding and abetting. Again, she could not explain \n     her legal reasoning in the case. I asked her if she stood by \n     her decision even though her two colleagues who participated \n     in the case and heard the same set of facts disagreed with \n     her and the Supreme Court had denied appeal, and she \n     responded that she did.\n       In another case, People v. Ryan, Judge White participated \n     in a decision affirming the dismissal of a drug dealer's \n     conviction, and the Supreme Court reversed that decision and \n     reinstated the conviction. In this case, the defendant was \n     arrested by federal agents, but was charged and convicted in \n     State court. The defendant argued that the decision to pursue \n     a State prosecution rather than a federal prosecution was \n     vindictive. The panel on which Judge White sat found that the \n     trial court's determination that there was vindictive conduct \n     was not clearly erroneous. The Supreme Court reversed \n     stating: ``The mere threat to refer the case for State \n     prosecution does not amount to objective evidence of hostile \n     motive.'' After reciting these facts to her, I asked Judge \n     White if she stood by her opinion given that the only \n     evidence of vindictiveness was that Federal DEA authorities \n     turned the matter over to State prosecutors, which is a very \n     common practice. In response Judge White cited her \n     unfamiliarity with the case and deferred to the Supreme \n     Court's holding rather than answering my question. She stated \n     that ``because the Supreme Court reversed, it meant that I \n     among others, got it wrong. . . . I stand by the Supreme \n     Court.'' I was concerned by her stated unfamiliarity with the \n     case because this was a case Judge White had cited in her \n     questionnaire for which she had provided a summary. I was \n     equally concerned that she deflected my question about \n     whether she stood by her opinion.\n       I next turned to another case Judge White had summarized in \n     her questionnaire captioned People v. Thomas. I detailed the \n     facts of the case to Judge White, which included the \n     conviction of a drug dealer who was charged with second-\n     degree murder and was found guilty by a jury of voluntary \n     manslaughter, carrying a concealed weapon, and felony \n     firearm. I asked her whether she stood by her decision to \n     reverse the conviction of this gang member when the Michigan \n     Supreme Court had subsequently overturned her panel's \n     opinion. Once again she deferred to the opinion of the \n     Supreme Court and stated ``I stand by the judgment of the \n     Supreme Court.'' I told her I knew the Supreme Court had the \n     final word, but I wanted to know whether she thought the \n     Supreme Court's decision was right. She again stated that she \n     ``accept[ed] the conclusion of the Supreme Court.'' She did \n     not answer my question. I wanted to evaluate her judgment, \n     but she would not answer whether she thought her opinion was \n     right or wrong.\n       I also asked her about a Court of Appeals' opinion in which \n     she participated that reversed a sentence for a defendant who \n     was a habitual criminal offender, People v. Hansford. Again, \n     this was an opinion that was reversed on appeal by the \n     Michigan Supreme Court and was a third case she had \n     summarized in her questionnaire. After reading her the \n     defendant's extensive criminal record, which included \n     several counts of larceny and attempted larceny, receiving \n     and concealing stolen property, fleeing and alluding, and \n     violations of probation, I noted\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\n     that habitual offender statutes are designed to take \n     habitual offenders off the streets, and I asked her what \n     her reasoning was for determining that a man with an \n     extensive criminal record such as the defendant did not \n     deserve to be off the streets for life. Once again, she \n     claimed not to be familiar with the case. She further \n     stated that she ``accept[ed] the Supreme Court's decision \n     . . .'' and ``accept[ed] that the sentence was appropriate \n     . . . because the Supreme Court has said it is \n     appropriate.'' I again asked her whether or not she \n     thought her decision was correct in light of the Michigan \n     Supreme Court's reversal, and she said ``I have to have \n     been wrong . . . The Supreme Court reversed. I was wrong. \n     The Supreme Court reversed.''\n       In her answer to my question about the habitual offender, \n     Judge White also noted that the vast majority of her court's \n     opinions are unpublished. At her hearing, I expressed concern \n     about how many of her opinions were unpublished. I am also \n     concerned that copies of a number of her opinions that were \n     reversed on appeal were not provided to the Committee prior \n     to her hearing as required. Question 15(d) of the Committee \n     Questionnaire specifically asks for ``a list of and copies of \n     any of [the nominee's] unpublished opinions that were \n     reversed on appeal or where [the nominee's] judgment was \n     affirmed with significant criticism of [the] substantive or \n     procedural rulings;'' however, Judge White only provided the \n     Committee with copies of 23 cases that were unpublished and \n     reversed on appeal. Three of the cases about which I \n     questioned her were listed elsewhere in her questionnaire, \n     but were not included in those 23 cases that she provided to \n     the Committee and clearly fit into the category of cases she \n     should have provided. The Committee and the full Senate \n     cannot properly evaluate a nominee's record if it does not \n     have key elements of that record. I would have liked to have \n     had access to all of Judge White's opinions that were \n     reversed prior to her hearing so that they could have been \n     analyzed and used as the basis for questioning.\n       In follow up questions after her hearing, I asked Judge \n     White to provide those missing cases and to explain why she \n     did not provide them initially. She responded to my question \n     by saying it was an ``oversight'' that she did not include \n     them initially and further stated that she can only provide \n     the Committee with a ``partial list of cases in which [she] \n     participated . . . which were reversed'' because the method \n     the Michigan Court of Appeals employs to catalogue cases \n     makes it difficult to locate those cases. She only provided \n     the Committee with an additional 11 cases that were reversed \n     on appeal. I find this response deeply troubling for a number \n     of reasons. First, appellate judges should be held to the \n     highest standards of competence. ``Oversights'' by a judge \n     can lead to defendants being wrongly convicted, criminals \n     being set free, or wronged litigants not receiving justice. \n     Attention to detail and thoroughness are critical qualities \n     in an appellate judge. Second, nominees to the federal courts \n     who have served as judges should provide all of the opinions \n     they participated in that were reversed on appeal or, at \n     least, demonstrate a reasonably robust effort to do so. \n     Democrats have required prior appellate court nominees to \n     provide substantial numbers of their unpublished opinions in \n     addition to the ones that were reversed on appeal. I recall \n     one judge being asked to go to a depository in another state \n     to retrieve copies of unpublished opinions. Judges should \n     make every reasonable effort to provide all of their opinions \n     that were reversed on appeal, not merely the ones that are \n     easily accessible. I am also troubled by Judge White's \n     relatively high reversal rate. A review of Judge White's \n     opinions that are available publicly reveals that 6.7% of her \n     cases have been reversed by the Michigan Supreme Court. That \n     is a pretty high percentage of cases. Further, Judge White's \n     reversal rate may be much higher, but we cannot determine her \n     actual reversal rate because Judge White still has not \n     provided the Committee with all of her unpublished opinions \n     that were reversed on appeal. As comparison, Democrats \n     objected to the nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the \n     Fourth Circuit when his reversal rate was 6.2%.\n       I am troubled by some of Judge White's decisions that were \n     reversed on appeal, but I am more concerned about her \n     inability to articulate her legal analysis and reasoning \n     process in these cases and her lack of experience with \n     complex federal issues. I am also concerned that Judge White \n     has not provided the Committee with a complete record of her \n     judicial opinions upon which we could evaluate her \n     qualifications for this prestigious position.\n       Given the brief period of time I had to review Judge \n     White's opinions, her apparent unfamiliarity with her own \n     opinions, her inability to articulate her legal reasoning and \n     analysis in those opinions, and her failure to provide the \n     Committee with important elements of her judicial record \n     prior to her hearing, I plan to vote against her confirmation \n     to the Sixth Circuit.\n\n                Needless Rush to Judgment on Judge White\n\n       A Republican Senate confirmed 15 circuit court judges and \n     57 district court judges in President Clinton's final two \n     years. Thus far in this Congress, the Senate has confirmed \n     only 8 of President Bush's circuit court nominees and 38 \n     district court nominees.\n       President Bush is also far behind President Clinton in \n     total confirmations when contrasting their entire terms. \n     President Clinton had 65 circuit court and 305 district court \n     judges confirmed, while President Bush has so far had only 59 \n     circuit and 241 district court judges confirmed.\n       There are a total of 32 judicial nominees currently pending \n     in the Judiciary Committee: 11 Circuit Court vacancies with \n     10 nominees; 36 District Court vacancies with 22 nominees.\n       Judge Helene White was nominated on April 15. Her Judiciary \n     Committee questionnaire was received on April 25, and the \n     Minority did not receive her FBI report until April 29. Her \n     hearing was held on May 7. Responses to Judge White's \n     questions for the record following her hearing were received \n     yesterday.\n       The mere 22 days that elapsed between nomination date and \n     hearing is a far shorter period of time than is typical for \n     the Committee to perform its standard review of a circuit \n     court nominee's record. The average for Bush's circuit court \n     nominees has been 162 days between nomination and hearing.\n       The American Bar Association has still not completed its \n     rating of Judge White. The Committee has never held a hearing \n     for a circuit court nominee prior to receiving their ABA \n     rating.\n       Democrats have accused Republicans of stalling the two \n     sixth circuit nominees. Senator Reid: ``Senators on the \n     Republican side on the Judiciary Committee have delayed \n     consideration of Judge White. . . . following the hearing, \n     [they] asked a total of 73 separate written questions''\n       In fact, Judge White did not receive more questions than \n     other recent circuit court nominees: Republicans submitted 73 \n     questions for Judge Helene White, 6th Circuit; Democrats \n     submitted 108 questions for Judge Jennifer Elrod, 5th \n     Circuit; and Democrats submitted 80 questions for Judge \n     Leslie Southwick, 5th Circuit.\n       And, the Committee had more time to evaluate these other \n     nominees' records prior to their hearings. Days from \n     nomination to hearing: White: 22 days; Elrod: 112 days; and \n     Southwick: 121 days.\n       Judge White has already submitted her answers to the \n     Committee, proving that no delay by Republicans occurred. The \n     delay is due to the importance Democrats' have placed on the \n     ABA rating. In 2001, Senator Leahy stated: ``Here is the \n     bottom line. There will be an ABA background check before \n     there is a vote.'' Senator Leahy reiterated this pledge at \n     Judge White's hearing.\n       Judge White's nomination has only been pending for 37 days. \n     Meanwhile, Mr. Peter Keisler, D.C. Circuit, has waited 693 \n     days for a Committee vote, Judge Robert Conrad, 4th Circuit, \n     has waited 310 days for a hearing, and Mr. Steve Matthews, \n     4th Circuit, has waited 259 days for a hearing.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. My final comment, if I may make it while the chairman is \non the floor, is that we do have some other Senators who wish to speak. \nWell, I have just been advised that we don't have Senators who wish to \nspeak. Apparently, Senator Leahy, your comments about an early \nconclusion were much more persuasive than mine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, \nwhen the Senator from Pennsylvania is finished, I know Senator Levin \nand Senator Stabenow wished to speak very briefly. If that was the \ncase, I hope that maybe within the next 10 minutes or so, or that by \n6:30, or at 6:30, that perhaps what we can do is this: Let's say at \n6:30, if the Senator from Pennsylvania would agree that we might vote \nat 6:30, then under the previous unanimous consent, if Judge White is \nconfirmed, assuming she is, but if she is under the unanimous consent, \nthen the regular order would be to go to the other two nominees from \nMichigan. It would be my intent--unless somebody objected--it would be \nmy intent to do those by voice vote. That, of course, is contingent \nupon her being confirmed under the unanimous consent agreement that I \nhave been shown. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is acceptable to this side of the \naisle. I think it is an illustration of how the Senate can conduct its \nbusiness in an expeditious way. We started on a 4-hour time agreement \nat 5:15. We are 54 minutes into the 4 hours, and we will conclude with \na 2-hour-and-45-minute savings. Let this be an example for the balance \nof the confirmation process and other Senate work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will vote for all of the Judicial \nnominees before us today. I want to offer a few comments about one of \nthem and also about the current state of the judicial confirmation \nprocess.\n  The Constitution gives authority to nominate and appoint judges to \nthe President, not to the Senate.\n  The Senate's role is to check the President's power, to ensure that \nhis nominees are not crooks, cronies, or corrupt.\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\n  Too often in relent years, however, Senators have tried to push our \nrole beyond merely checking the President's power to actually \nhighjacking the President's power.\n  That goes too far and undermines the separation of powers which is so \ncritical to limit government power and to keep our system of government \nin balance.\n  For this reason, my perspective on the judicial confirmation process \nbegins with substantial deference to the President, no matter which \nparty occupies the While House or has the Senate majority.\n  For this reason, I have voted against and worked to eliminate \nfilibusters used to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees.\n  And for this reason, I have voted against very few nominees during my \n32 years in this body and on the Judiciary Committee.\n  From that perspective of deference, I then look at a nominee's \njudicial philosophy and qualifications.\n  Applying these criteria, my decision to support two of the nominees \nbefore us today, Raymond Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit and Stephen \nMurphy to the Eastern District of Michigan, was easy.\n  My decision to support Judge Helene White's nomination to the Sixth \nCircuit, however, was a much closer call.\n  Frankly, I have always believed that a President has the right to \nappoint judges who reflect his or her judicial philosophy.\n  I asked Judge White detailed questions designed to explore her \njudicial philosophy, her understanding of the proper role of Federal \nappellate judges in our system of government.\n  I want to share a few of her responses with my colleagues.\n  I asked Judge White to comment on the notion that judges must make \ndecisions based on the law as enacted by the people and their elected \nrepresentatives, even if they personally disagree with it.\n  Judge White agreed with this wholeheartedly, staying that judges \n``should be prepared to have no constituency except the law.''\n  I realize this is straight out of civics 101, but there are many \ntoday who believe judges may twist and shape the Constitution and \nstatutes into any form they please in order to achieve results they \ndesire.\n  In fact, some ray colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said \njudges must take sides, that they must favor certain ideological \ninterests and serve certain political constituencies.\n  I also asked Judge White whether judges may decide cases based on \ntheir personal views, sense of justice, empathy, or experience.\n  It would be difficult to come up with a more misguided and even \ndangerous role for unelected judges in our system of government, \nbut some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have endorsed \nthat approach.\n\n  To her credit, Judge White flatly rejected that activist view of a \njudge's role.\n  I wanted to share these thoughts with my colleagues because some have \nquestioned whether Judge White is the kind of judge President Bush has \nsaid he would appoint.\n  She was, after all, first nominated to the Sixth Circuit by President \nClinton whose nominees generally embraced a more activist judicial \nphilosophy.\n  President Bush is the first, at least during my Senate tenure, to \nresubmit an appeals court nominee first offered by a President of the \nother party.\n  President Clinton certainly did not do that.\n  But the Constitution gives each President the authority to make that \njudgment and I have always believed that there is a high bar for the \nSenate to withhold its consent on the basis of judicial philosophy.\n  That perspective of deference and her answers to questions like the \nones I described satisfy me on this point.\n  Let me turn to the question of qualifications.\n  The American Bar Associations rating of judicial nominees is more \nimportant for some than for others.\n  My friends on the other side have consistently said the ABA rating is \nthe gold standard for evaluating judicial nominees.\n  I take that back.\n  They have called the ABA rating the gold standard until they want to \nobstruct nominees who have received even the highest rating.\n  Judge White's ABA rating in 2008 is higher than it is in 1997, when \nshe was first nominated to the Sixth Circuit.\n  At that time, some members of the ABA evaluation committee thought \nshe was not qualified at all.\n  This time, a majority of the evaluation committee found her well \nqualified and no one thought her unqualified.\n  It is a little surprising, however, that after 26 years as a State \ncourt judge, 15 of them on the appellate bench, Judge White still has \nnot garnered a unanimous well qualified rating from the ABA.\n  In fact, Raymond Kethledge, the other Sixth Circuit nominee before us \ntoday, received a higher ABA rating than Judge White and he has no \njudicial experience at all.\n  Judge White has never litigated a case. She has never handled \nclients. She has virtually no experience with Federal law issues of any \nkind.\n  There have been serious concerns about her ability to manage her \ncurrent docket, let alone the far busier and more complex docket she \nwould face on the Federal bench.\n  Perhaps these dare some of the issues that kept the ABA evaluators \nfrom giving her the highest rating.\n  Unfortunately, Judge White did not distinguish herself in her hearing \nand offered the committee little to offset these and other concerns \nabout her qualifications. The distinguished ranking member, Senator \nSpecter, and others are detailing some of those concerns on the floor \ntoday.\n  Some of my friends on the other side have responded that \nthis nomination has really been pending for 11 years and that we should \nsomehow already know enough to fill in the blanks and resolve the \ndoubts.\n\n  That is ridiculous.\n  I have served in this body and on the Judiciary Committee for 32 \nyears. I know of no Senator who keeps tabs on the careers, \naccomplishments, and record of unconfirmed nominees from previous \nadministrations on the off chance that they might some day be \nrenominated.\n  We must evaluate each nominee on the current record developed through \nthe current process.\n  And on the question of qualifications, that record satisfies but \ncertainly does not excite me.\n  I respect the judgment of colleagues, especially on this side of the \naisle, who look at these and other issues and conclude that they cannot \nsupport Judge White. Voting against a nominee of your own party is a \nsignificant step.\n  There are Senators on the other side who have served here even longer \nthan I have who have never voted against a nominee of their party.\n  Each of us might make that judgment for ourselves and, though it is \nindeed a closer call than I would like, I will vote to confirm Judge \nWhite.\n  Before I conclude, I want to make a few observations about the \njudicial confirmation profess with regard to Judge White's nomination \nin particular and judicial nominations in general.\n  When I chaired the Judiciary Committee during the previous \nadministration, Judge White's nomination did not receive a hearing \nbecause she lacked support from her home State Senator who served on \nthe Judiciary Committee at the time.\n  Similarly, Sixth Circuit nominees of the current President, including \nMr. Kethledge who is before us today, did not receive a hearing because \nthey too lacked home State Senator support.\n  I am certainly glad that this issue has been resolve with our \ndistinguished colleagues from Michigan so that these nominees can move \nforward.\n  But I remain baffled why my following that longstanding policy is \ntoday attacked as a so-called pocket filibuster while the current \nchairman following that policy is praised for an exercise in senatorial \ncourtesy.\n  That is one of number of baffling and frustrating futures of the \ncurrent judicial confirmation process.\n  There have been seven previous Congresses during my service here that \nincluded a presidential election year.\n  During an average of 313 days in session, 25 appeals court nominees \nreceived a hearing and 20 appeals court nominees were confirmed.\n  Using that as our benchmark, in the current 110th Congress, we are \nnearly\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n90 percent finished with our days in session but so far less than one-\nthird as many appeals court nominees have received a hearing and only \nhalf as any have been confirmed.\n  It does not have to be this way, it has not been this way in the \npast.\n  I hope that when the nominees before us today ire confirmed, we will \nturn our attention to the others who are pending some for many months \nand even for years, and continue doing what the American people sent us \nhere to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are nearing the end, I hope, of what is \nsurely one of the longest judicial nomination sagas in U.S. history. \nJudge White was previously nominated by President Clinton for a vacancy \non the Sixth Circuit of the Court of Appeals starting in 1997. Her \nnomination was returned to the President without a hearing. Another \nnominee of President Clinton was also returned without a hearing. That \nwas the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis in 1999.\n  Judge White has been serving as a judge on the Court of Appeals of \nMichigan since 1993, and I believe she has participated in more than \n4,000 decisions. Before that, she served as a judge on the Wayne County \nCircuit Court from 1983 to 1993, and that is Michigan's top trial \ncourt. Judge White, as have our other nominees, has been given a \n``well-qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association's standing \ncommittee, and President Bush has called Judge White ``an experienced \nand highly qualified judge who is known for her intellect, work ethic, \nand demeanor.''\n  The second nominee for the Sixth Circuit is Raymond Kethledge, \ncurrently a partner at the Bush, Seyferth firm in Detroit, MI. Before \njoining that firm, Mr. Kethledge was a law clerk to Justice Anthony \nKennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court and earlier clerked for a judge well \nknown to those of us in Michigan, beloved Judge Ralph Guy of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Kethledge also served as \njudiciary counsel for Senator Spencer Abraham from 1995 to 1997, and he \ngraduated magna cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School in \n1993.\n  Steven Murphy, who is the nominee for the Eastern District position, \ncurrently serves as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. \nPrior to his service as U.S. attorney, Mr. Murphy was an attorney with \nthe General Motors legal staff in Detroit. He worked for the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice for more than 12 years.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to recognize the life and the work of \nKathleen McCree Lewis who, as I mentioned, was nominated by President \nClinton in 1999 for a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Kathy \nMcCree Lewis passed away last year. She never had her hearing and \nopportunity to be voted on by the Senate. She was dedicated to her \nprofession and to her family. While she is no longer with us, we \nremember her today.\n  The seat that Judge White is being nominated for on the Sixth Circuit \nis the same seat that was held by a wonderful woman, Judge Susan Bieke \nNeilson. She held that seat for a tragically short period of 2 months. \nThis vote is also a vote to Judge Neilson. Her husband, Jeffrey \nNeilson, wrote Chairman Leahy back in April that he believed that \nHelene White ``will reflect the best qualities of both Susan and \nKathleen in the performance of her duties, so that although death has \nprecluded their presence on the Sixth Circuit, they will be there in \nspirit.\n\n  Finally, I thank Chairman Leahy and our Democratic leader, Harry \nReid, for all they have done to make it possible that we can finally, \nhopefully, resolve this Michigan issue that has been stymied in the \nSixth Circuit and Eastern District for far too long, with a bipartisan \nresolution the President has sent us on these three nominees with his \nfull support in the Senate.\n  I hope the Senate will give an overwhelming vote to Judge White but \nalso then adopt a voice vote for the other two nominees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had hoped that before the Senate we not \nwould hear unfair criticism leveled at Judge White. Last month, Senator \nBrownback publicly apologized for his actions at her confirmation \nhearing, and I commended him for doing so. After Judge White answered \nthe scores of time-consuming questions Republicans sent to her and the \ncommittee had received the updated ABA ratings emphasized so much by \nRepublicans in connection with these nominations, I hoped we could move \nforward with this in a consensus fashion. It is disappointing that some \nstill seem bent on grasping at straws to criticize Judge White, \napplying a different standard from that which they used to evaluate \nother Bush judicial nominees.\n  Judge Helene White has served on the Michigan Court of Appeals for \nthe past 15 years, having been elected by the people of Michigan in \n1992. Before that she served for a dozen years on the Wayne County \nCircuit Court, the Common Pleas Court for the city of Detroit, and the \n36th District Court of Michigan. She is described on the Bush White \nHouse Web site as ``an experienced and highly qualified judge, who is \nknown for her intellect, work ethic, and demeanor.''\n  Judge White has been now been nominated by Presidents from both \nparties, by a Democratic President and by a Republic President. She has \nserved as a Michigan State court judge for more than 25 years. In \naddition, she has been active as a member of the legal community and of \ncommunity organizations including COTS, Coalition on Temporary Shelter; \nJVS, Jewish Vocational Services; and the Metropolitan Detroit Young \nWomen's Christian Association. She should be a consensus confirmation.\n  Oddly, Republican attacks on Judge White have focused on what they \nterm a lack of experience. Somehow, someone who has been a respected \nappellate judge for 15 years, who has served as a judge for well over \n25 years, and who the ABA rates as well qualified for the Federal \ncircuit court , is in their view not ``experienced'' enough to be a \nFederal appellate court judge.\n  Some Senators suggested that her lack of experience with specific \nFederal issues that never come before even the most experienced State \njudge was a problem. They ignore the fact that judges always have to \nlearn new areas of the law as new cases come before them, and no one is \nbetter prepared to do that than an experienced jurist like Judge White.\n  Indeed, Mr. Kethledge, President Bush's youthful nominee to the other \nvacancy on the Sixth Circuit, was gracious enough to concede at the \nhearing that he, too, lacked experience in the same specific areas of \nFederal law. Yet his qualifications have not been in called into \nquestion by Republican Senators. Judge White has served as a Michigan \nState appellate court judge longer than Mr. Kethledge has been out of \nlaw school, but some are questioning her experience while embracing his \nrelatively lack of experience.\n  With these criticisms, Republicans risk turning back the clock to \nbefore the confirmation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who herself had \nbeen a State legislator and State judge. Justice O'Connor was not \nexperienced in deciding Federal law issues before her confirmation as \nthe first female justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I think we can \nagree that she nonetheless served the Nation well in that capacity.\n  Should we conclude from the Republic attacks that no State court \njudge can be confirmed to sit on a Federal court? Certainly Jennifer \nElrod, a State court judge with far less experience than Judge White, \nwho the Senate confirmed to the Fifth Circuit late last year, was not \nheld to that standard by the Republicans. Indeed, recall what Senator \nCornyn said about her nomination: ``I would point out that when it \ncomes to experience, most of us, when we apply for a new job, or a \nnominee, have rarely done that job before. So the question is not \nwhether you have actually done that job before, it's whether you are \nlikely to do a good job, if confirmed.''\n  Others have pointed to a handful cases in which Judge White was on a \npanel decision that was reversed. This handful of cases comes from \n4,300 cases she heard on the bench. These were cases in which Judge \nWhite joined a unanimous panel of her court or in one\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\ninstance where she agreed with the rest of the court on the law and \ndiffered only on the facts. More to the point, they were cases of such \nlimited precedential value that the decisions were not even published. \nWhen asked about each case, Judge White testified that she accepted the \nMichigan Supreme Court's decision as correct. I hope that in a long \ncareer spanning thousands of decisions, she will not be judged by a few \nunremarkable cases. Republicans have certainly asked us not to focus on \na small handful of cases decided by other Bush nominees, even when the \ncases in question were far more noteworthy.\n  Republicans have simply not been able to point to anything in Judge \nWhite's long and distinguished career that should disqualify her or \neven justify a negative vote. It is unfortunate that some Republicans \nseem to be trying so hard to find reasons not to support this \nparticular nominee.\n  I hope that Republican and Democratic Senators will join together to \nsupport her nomination and the entire package of Michigan nominations \nthat President Bush has sent to us after consultation with Senators \nLevin and Stabenow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ndistinguished colleague in supporting the nominations of Judge Helene \nWhite, Mr. Raymond Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and \nMr. Stephen Murphy III to the District Court for the Eastern District \nof Michigan. I also want to remember those whom Senator Levin spoke of \nas well.\n  I thank, particularly, Chairman Leahy for working with us in a very \ndiligent manner, for his patience, and for his commitment and his \nwillingness to work with us to move the President's nominations \nforward. It has been a very long process--one that started more than 11 \nyears ago for Judge Helene White. In fact, I have been here for 8 \nyears, and she has been waiting more than 11 years for this vote--4\\1/\n2\\ years, originally, to have the hearing. I find that because of the \nlength of time she has been waiting, it is difficult to say that \nsomehow this was a short-circuited process or a process that happened \ntoo quickly. It has, in fact, been more than 11 years. I hope this \nserves as an example of how we can come together when both sides, with \nthe administration, are willing to work together in a bipartisan \nmanner. I am very pleased we have been able to come to this agreement \ntogether. That is what we have done here.\n  Senator Levin and I have worked with the Bush administration, and as \na result, we have the three nominees for the Federal bench who are in \nfront of us. In fact, all three of them were rated ``well-qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association. I urge my colleagues to support them.\n  First, let me say a few words about Judge Helene White, who brings 30 \nyears of legal experience to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She is \na graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Barnard \nCollege at Columbia University. Judge White has been a State judge \nsince 1981. She has served on both the 36th District Court for the city \nof Detroit and the Wayne County Circuit Court. Since 1992, she has \nserved, with distinguished service, on the Michigan Court of Appeals. \nShe has participated in more than 4,400 cases in her time as a judge on \nthe Michigan Court of Appeals. All told, Judge White will bring more \nthan 25 years of bench experience to the Sixth Circuit. While I support \nall of our nominees, Judge White is the only person who brings that \njudicial experience, having served on the bench with distinguished \nservice, someone who is respected by all sides for her intellect, her \nfairness, and her balance. I am so very pleased that we are finally at \nthis point to be able to vote on this important nomination.\n  Secondly, Mr. Raymond Kethledge, who is also nominated for the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, graduated magna cum laude from the University \nof Michigan and the University of Michigan Law School. I told him that \neven though I went to a rival school--Michigan State University--I will \nsupport his nomination. In fact, my son is a graduate of U of M. I was \npleased to see another Wolverine being nominated for this distinguished \nposition. Following law school, he served as Senator Spence Abraham's \njudiciary counsel. He then went on to clerk for both Judge Ralph Guy, \non the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Justice Kennedy, on the \nSupreme Court, before eventually becoming a partner at Bush Seyferth \nKethledge & Paige in Troy, MI. I am certainly pleased to support his \nnomination to this position.\n  Finally, Mr. Stephen Murphy has been nominated for a seat on the \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. He will bring both \nacademic and Federal law experience to the bench. He has taught at the \nUniversity of Detroit Mercy School of Law and the Ave Maria School of \nLaw in Ann Arbor. He has practiced as both a Federal prosecutor and a \ndefense counsel. He also practiced business litigation as an attorney \nfor General Motors. Since 2005, he has served as the U.S. attorney for \nthe Eastern District of Michigan.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nPresident's nominees. We have worked hard in a bipartisan manner. It \nhas taken a long time to get to this point, but I am very pleased we \nare here together supporting these nominees for the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals and the Eastern District of Michigan. I am hopeful that, \nvery shortly, we will confirm each of these nominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I listened to Senator Specter talk about \none of our most important responsibilities; that is, the confirmation \nprocess on the President's nominations for our courts, which are \nlifetime appointments. It is a major responsibility each of us has in \nthe Senate.\n  I think the way this confirmation process has proceeded with the \nthree judges before us is an example as to how we should be working on \nthe confirmation of judges. First, I think the process under which the \nSenators worked with the White House on the appointments is a model \nthat should be used, I hope, in more circuits, where there is a real \nworking relationship between the Senators and the White House to come \nup with the best qualified individuals to serve on the Federal bench. I \ncongratulate Senators Levin and Stabenow for the manner in which these \nnominations were brought forward.\n  Second is the confirmation process before the Judiciary Committee. I \nspent a lot of time reading the backgrounds on each of our nominees, as \nwell as the hearing itself. I must tell you that as a result of reading \nthe background material, as a result of the confirmation hearings, I am \na strong supporter of Judge White for her confirmation to the court of \nappeals. I also support Mr. Kethledge for the court of appeals. I must \ntell you, in reading his background, I was a little concerned because \nhe didn't have any real experience in writing opinions, didn't have \nexperience in trying cases, as far as a judge is concerned, and there \nwasn't much to judge his ability to reason on the court of appeals by \nhis background. But I must tell you, after listening to the \nconfirmation hearings, I was convinced that he is well qualified to \nserve on the court of appeals. I am supporting his nomination. That is \nwhat the confirmation process should be about.\n  I listened to Senator Specter have concerns about Judge White because \nof some of her opinions. I must tell you, I am pleased we have before \nus a nominee who has the experience to go onto the court of appeals or \nappellate courts. Judge White has served 15 years on the State \nappellate court. She has written numerous opinions, has participated in \nover 4,000 cases, served 12 years on the circuit court in Michigan. So \nshe has trial court experience as a judge, and she has appellate court \nexperience as a judge.\n  Quite frankly, I have been disappointed by a lot of the nominees who \nhave been brought forward by the White House because they have brought \nforward individuals who do not have experience to go on our second \nhighest court. I think experience is important. I raised those concerns \nduring Judge Elrod's confirmation hearing and Judge Haynes's hearing. I \nwould like to have people with more experience so that we can judge \ntheir qualifications.\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n  In Judge White's case, we have that record, and it is a great one. \nHas she been reversed in her 4,000 decisions? Yes. That is why we have \nappellate courts. But she has never been challenged as far as her \nreasoning and her fairness and her demeanor. In fact, she has been \nrated by the American Bar Association as ``well-qualified.''\n  One more thing, Mr. President, as to why I strongly support Judge \nWhite's confirmation, and that is the manner in which she handled the \nconfirmation hearings. They were not easy hearings. There were tough \nquestions that were asked. She exercised the type of demeanor I want to \nsee in our Federal judges. She exercised the type of response that I \nthink represents the types of qualifications I want to see on our \nFederal bench. So I am very much supporting her confirmation. I hope \nshe will receive a strong vote on the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all three of the Michigan judges who \nare before us for confirmation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. \nFirst, I commend the two Senators from Michigan, who spent years \nworking out this conclusion for these three nominees to be here. I \ncommend Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow for working so hard. Senator \nCardin spent so much time at the hearing with me. I appreciate the \namount of time he spent there. His words of calm reasoning, but with \nquestions that cut right to the importance of the hearing, were \nextremely valuable.\n  If nobody else is seeking recognition, I am going to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum in a moment. So that Senators will understand, at \n6:30 I will call off the quorum, and the time will be yielded back on \nboth sides. Then we will go to a rollcall vote on Helene White.\n  If Judge White is confirmed, as I fully expect she will be, then we \nwill go to the next two judges, but only if she is confirmed. Again, \nSenator Specter and I have both said we expect she will be. We will go \nto the next two judges, and I don't know of anyone who will require a \nrollcall vote on those two judges.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am authorized to yield back all time on both sides. I \nyield back all time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Helene N. \nWhite, of Michigan, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth \nCircuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If \nI could, though, have the attention of Senators who are here.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me say on this package of judges, we \nhave been working on these for 5 or 6 years. That is how long it has \ntaken. So this is really a step forward. Everyone has cooperated. I \nappreciate very much the help of the entire Republican caucus. Senator \nKyl was especially helpful to work through what we have done. We are \ngoing to approve two more judges the day after tomorrow, and then we \nwill see where we go from there on judges.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n  What I wanted to tell everyone here is we wanted to finish the \nhousing bill tonight. Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have worked very \nhard to craft a bill that doesn't go back to the House, but when the \nHouse signs off on----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will suspend. The Senate \nwill come to order.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize, it was hard to concentrate on what I wanted to \nsay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Senators Dodd and Shelby are crafting a bill that can go \ndirectly to the President. That is what we are trying to do, craft \nsomething on which there has been general agreement with the \ncounterparts of Shelby and Dodd in the House, and it would go \nimmediately to the President. As you know, they can do things very \nquickly in the House that we cannot do here. That is the goal with \nhousing.\n  We are going to get there eventually. The problem is the way this is \nsent to us from the House, the format in which it was sent to us, we \nare now under cloture. That cloture will run out at approximately 5:45 \ntomorrow evening. At that time there are two germane amendments that we \nknow of. There are a couple more that are arguably germane. We will see \nwhat is the will of the body.\n  It is my understanding that on those two that are arguably germane, \nthe managers of the bill have worked something out. If there would be \nno objection, they would accept those. The problem is on the amendments \nthey have worked on up to this time, there has been an objection and we \ncannot proceed on any of those amendments that Dodd and Shelby have \nworked out.\n  Automatically, after the 30 hours is up, we would vote on the germane \namendments. No one can stop us from adopting or rejecting those \namendments. If we cannot get permission from everyone here as of now--I \nknow of only one holdup on our being able to complete the housing \nlegislation. If we can't get that Senator to sign off on this, then we \nonly have one alternative; that is, we will file cloture on another arm \nof this housing legislation. We will have cloture on that 2 legislative \ndays later, and then we still have one more to do. That would mean we \nwould have to be here over the weekend. It was not anticipated that we \nwould do that.\n  In the meantime, having done that, it will hold up our being able to \ndo FISA. We wanted to do a consent agreement on that tonight. I was \ntold that would not be possible.\n  On that, there are people who do not like the FISA legislation. I \nrecognize that the majority of the Senate does, but some people do not \nlike it. But, in spite of that, I have found the two people who speak \nout mostly against that--but there are others--are Senator Feingold and \nSenator Dodd who have been very diligent in their opposition to the \nlegislation. But, of course, they understand the Senate very well.\n  So what we would like to do is have a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to that, but we cannot do that unless it is by consent. \nTherefore, we are going to have to do cloture on the motion to proceed \nto FISA at some later time, and then that only allows us to proceed to \nthe bill. Then we still have to do cloture on the bill.\n  FISA is a product of the administration. It has passed the House, and \nthat is fine. But we are not going to stop people from going home for \nthe Fourth of July recess over FISA. If people do not want to do it, \nthen we are not going to do it. It is not because we are holding it up \nover here, is what I am saying. It is being held up by the minority.\n  We are going to proceed, and we are going to stay here and finish \nthis housing bill. The Case-Shiller Home Price Index registered the \nlargest decline in home prices in that index's history. That is more \nthan 40 years. Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.\n  So we are going to finish the housing bill. It may knock a few people \nout of parades on July 4, or whatever--however long it takes us to do \nthis.\n  The other product we have that we want to finish before we go home is \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. Again, there has been a \ndelicately crafted piece of legislation that has come from the House. \nThey worked very hard to get the House leadership to approve that, \nDemocratic and Republican. The President of the United States has \nsigned off on it. Is it everything that I want? Is it everything we \nwant over here? The answer is no. But I think it is something that will \npass with a very large margin over here. But we cannot get to it unless \npeople allow us to get to it. So that, too, would have to wait until we \nget back after the July 4 recess.\n  I think that would be a shame. We have been told that the Pentagon \ncan pay the bills until about the middle of February. Then they are out \nof money.\n  I want the President and all of his people to hear what I am saying. \nWe are not holding up the supplemental. We, the Democrats, are not \nholding it up. We, the Democrats, are not holding up FISA.\n  We also have a matter that we need to complete, and that is the \nMedicare fix. It is the doctors fix. That is what we call it. But, \nagain, today the House passed that by a 350-some-odd margin to whatever \nmakes up 435--passed that overwhelmingly, again, with the sponsorship \nand leadership of the House leadership, Democrats and Republicans. We \nare going to take that up before we go. We have to. Not only that, if \nwe do not pass that legislation before we go, we do not have the \ndoctors fix taken care of, but that has a snowballing effect.\n  What it does is all insurance companies base their reimbursement on \nwhat the Medicare Program is. There are two things we have to do before \nwe go home for July 4: Housing and Medicare. We do not have to do it if \nthe Republicans don't want to do it--we don't have to do FISA, and we \ndon't have to do the supplemental. We can do it the week we get back \nafter July 4.\n  There are other things we would like to do--the FAA extension for 6 \nmonths. I tried to move to that yesterday. It was objected to. We want \nthe President and others who have worked so hard on this global AIDS \nbill--we would like to get that passed. I was told by Senator Biden \ntoday that should be worked out tomorrow. But we can't do any of this \nas long as people are holding us up on this housing bill.\n  One Senator I talked to tonight who I thought was holding up the \nhousing bill--which is true--did not object to our going to FISA. But \nothers have.\n  I do not know how much more direct I can be. I want to pass the \nsupplemental. I want to pass FISA. I want to pass the Medicare fix. I \nwant to pass housing.\n  I do not particularly like FISA, and I am going to vote against FISA. \nBut I have an obligation as the majority leader to move legislation \nthat the majority of the body wants to go forward. The majority of \nRepublicans and a significant number of Democrats want FISA to pass. \nBut I am not going to ask people to stay here next week because there \nis someone over here holding up the President's bill. I am pointing to \nthe Republicans.\n  I am willing to be as reasonable as I can. I think we showed that on \nthe housing bill when I brought up a piece of legislation that Senator \nDeMint and others wanted to move forward on--and Senator Bunning. We \ndid that to show good faith in reporting this housing bill. But with \nhome prices continuing to fall, foreclosures continuing to rise, 8,800 \nforeclosures a day--a day--the time to act is now.\n  I have said on this floor many times, the housing bill is bipartisan. \nDodd and Shelby have done a remarkably good job. I hope those people \nwho are trying--I don't know what their message is. To show the power \nof a Senator? I acknowledge, one Senator has a lot of power. But I \nthink they should recognize they are holding up a lot of stuff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say on this occasion I almost \nentirely agree with the majority leader about what needs to be \naccomplished this week. We do indeed need to do the housing bill. We do \nindeed need to do the supplemental for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The FISA bill, the Medicare fix--it is a complicated \nlegislative tangle which my good friend, the majority leader, has \ndescribed, and with which he is trying to deal as we move through the \nweek. But my goal is really the same as his, and we are going to \ncontinue talking to each other, continue to sort of run the traps\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nand hopefully clear the traps in such a way that we can have a highly \nsuccessful week before the recess.\n  That is my goal. It is the same as his goal. I will be working with \nhim to see if we can get all of those things done in the next few days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say one final thing. There is a time \nwhen we need to work together. The Republican leader recognizes that; I \nrecognize that. This is the time. We need to figure out a way to get \nfrom here to there. We are going to do our very best.\n  I think our messages--we don't need to worry about those next week. \nWe can come back and do that after the break. We really need to try to \nget this done for the American people. It would be good for the \nAmerican people if we could do something on one of the major crises we \nhave faced in our country, and that is this housing debacle. It is very \ndifficult.\n  Everyone knows that I do not throw a lot of bouquets to the \nadministration, but I throw them a bouquet on their willingness to work \nwith us on the supplemental because they were willing to bend a little \nbit here and there. I repeat, was it everything that I wanted, that we \nwanted? No, but a tremendous step forward. I compliment and I applaud \nthe President and the people who worked with us to get to the point \nwhere we are. I would be ashamed to have to wait until after the Fourth \nof July to do this bill; that is, the supplemental appropriations bill, \nbecause even though what we are going to be voting on only deals with \nthe GI bill of rights and the unemployment compensation and those other \nthings, if we do not act, the war funding doesn't go forward. We do not \nhave to vote on war funding. We have already done that.\n  As I said, I appreciate the work we have been able to accomplish with \nthe administration on this supplemental appropriations bill. Even \nthough, as I have indicated, I am not going to vote for the FISA bill, \nthere are people who have worked on this FISA matter for 3 months or \nmore. Again, the administration worked with them. Did they, on the FISA \nbill, move enough to make me vote for the bill? The answer is no. But \nthey moved enough to get a lot of people to vote for this bill, and I \nappreciate that also.\n  But we could wind up with all this good work being put off. It will \nbe very anticlimactic, the accomplishments that we have made.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n               64th Anniversary of the Gi Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, on Sunday, June 22, we marked an \nanniversary. On June 22, 1944, President Roosevelt signed the \nServicemen's Readjustment Act into law. I come to the floor today to \ncommemorate the 64th anniversary of the passage of this profoundly \nimportant bill, better known as the GI bill of rights.\n  World War II was the largest, most deadly, most terrible war in world \nhistory. Before it was over, Americans fought on the continents of \nEurope, Asia, and Africa, and in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Over \n16 million American men and women, including my father, answered the \ncall to serve. Since joining this body, I have held about 100 \nroundtables across my home State of Ohio, and through these discussions \nI have had the opportunity and privilege to meet with a number of Ohio \nveterans from World War II. Getting to know those remarkable men and \nwomen has reaffirmed my profound respect for their decision to serve \nour country. Their service and their sacrifice produced both a stronger \nnation and a safer world. The ``greatest generation'' earned this \nNation's enduring gratitude.\n  They earned the benefits the GI bill provided and used them to propel \nthis country into a time of unprecedented prosperity. The GI bill was \nmore than a payment to the veterans for their service to our country; \nit was also a very smart, very pragmatic investment in the social \nfabric and economic potential of our Nation. The GI bill was designed \nto help smooth the transition from military service into civilian life. \nAnd it did that for millions of men and women who served. It paid for \nveterans' tuition, books, fees, a monthly stipend, and other training \ncosts. It also provided veterans low-interest mortgages and \nunemployment insurance.\n  The GI bill provided veterans in Ohio and the rest of the country the \nopportunity to realize the American dream. The number of degrees \nawarded by colleges and universities more than doubled between 1940, \nthe last full year before the war, and 1950.\n  Veterans were responsible for buying 20 percent of all new homes \nafter the war. The investment in the middle class drove the development \nand economic expansion of an entire generation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield my hour post cloture to Senator \nDodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I too yield my postcloture hour to Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators have that right. The time is yielded \nto Senator Dodd.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. When you think about what happened to the GI bill, it was \nnot only providing opportunity individually to millions of men and \nwomen who served, and in that sense a payment they earned; it also \ncreated a huge, unprecedented, and unsurpassed sense of prosperity for \nthe country. When all of these men and women came home and were given \nthe opportunity to go to college, regardless of their income or their \nfamily status or their wealth or their positions, they were given that \nopportunity which they earned from World War II.\n  In recognition of that important anniversary honoring the service men \nand women, giving them the opportunity and creating the prosperity of \nmillions of newly educated men and women in our country, I call on \nCongress to renew its commitment to our veterans to recognize this \nanniversary.\n  It is our responsibility, our privilege, to uphold the promises our \nNation has made to veterans. It is our responsibility and our privilege \nto advance our Nation's economic goals. Passing the updated GI bill \ninto law is the right way to fulfill both responsibilities. I urge \nevery Member of this body to support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                            FEC Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very pleased that I am finally able to \nsay we are going to restore the Federal Election Commission to a fully \nfunctioning six-member body.\n  The FEC lost a functioning quorum last January when three recess \nappointments to the Commission expired, leaving only two FEC \ncommissioners. It takes four to conduct official business, so there was \nno way to conduct business. When the FEC went dark in January, it meant \nour Nation's campaign finance watchdog was off the beat. It also meant \nthat important provisions of the Democrats' Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act would not be implemented.\n  Most notably, the building of this Federal Election Commission is so \nvery important. I would be remiss to not say that the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act passed on a bipartisan basis. For example, the \nbundling rules we worked so hard to enact into law were put into limbo. \nBut now with the FEC within a few minutes going to be reestablished, \nthat will not be the case.\n  Since even before the Commission lost its quorum, I began offering my \nRepublican colleagues votes on the pending FEC nominees, but those \nefforts were rejected.\n  Democrats have been united in their desire to have the FEC restored \nto full power. I am pleased we can finally come together with our \nRepublican colleagues tonight on the nominations.\n  I would be remiss if I did not speak very briefly about my two \nDemocratic nominees, Steven Walther and Cynthia Bauerly, both \noutstanding lawyers. I\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\ncan tell you even more than that. They are outstanding people and \npublic servants. Steven Walther is from Nevada. He is one of those \npeople who is in public service because he wants to do something to \nhelp his country. He has been very active for many years in State bar \nactivities, very involved in the ABA activities, and he gave up a \nlucrative law practice to come here. He was a senior partner in a major \nlaw firm in Nevada. He did this for the right reason.\n  Both Cynthia and Steven are patient individuals. Steve Walther was \nfirst recommended to the President by me for this position on July 6, \n2005. That is almost 3 years ago.\n  He waited almost 3 years for the full Senate to confirm him.\n  I recommended Ms. Bauerly to the President in July 2007. She has \nwaited for confirmation over 11 months.\n  I cannot say enough nice things about Steven Walther. I want everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice to understand what a man of integrity he \nis. He is not even a Democrat. He is an Independent. But I have such \nconfidence in his fairness that it did not matter what his party \naffiliation is. He is a fine individual, has a wonderful family, a son \nWyatt who is getting used to the big city of Washington, DC.\n  I so appreciate Steve waiting since January with basically no job. He \nhas had no paycheck. There has been no FEC. Some people dropped off \nbecause they couldn't afford to not have a job. But fortunately, for \nthe FEC and our country, Steven Walther could afford to be unemployed \nfor 6 months.\n  Again, I want the record spread with my appreciation for Steven \nWalther's public service and his friendship to me. These two \nindividuals, Bauerly and Walther, have shown exceptional patience which \nwill be an asset to them in their work as Commissioners. I wish them \nand the FEC very well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATIONS OF STEVEN T.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the passage \nof the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This is a law that our Nation \nneeds. The most important change made by the pending\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nbill is to allow immediate and real-time surveillance of overseas \ntargets as soon as they become apparent in the course of a foreign-\nintelligence investigation. FISA had never been intended to block \nsurveillance of such targets, but a 2007 FISA court decision \ninterpreted FISA to apply to even foreign-to-foreign communications \nthat are routed through the United States. Because of changes in \ntechnology and U.S. dominance in the telecommunications industry, even \nphone calls from Afghanistan to Pakistan could be routed through the \nUnited States. As a result, a FISA order could be required before \ncommunications between two suspected al-Qaida members outside the \nUnited States could be monitored.\n  This system made overseas surveillance a practical impossibility in \nmany cases and caused valuable intelligence to be lost. Our best tool \nagainst al-Qaida and other terrorists is intelligence; it is absolutely \ncritical that we gather whatever intelligence is available.\n  In the summer of 2007, Congress enacted a 6-month restoration of U.S. \nagents' surveillance capabilities with the Protect America Act. Today--\nover 4 months after the PAA expired--Congress finally acts to extend \nthis surveillance authority for another 4\\1/2\\ years. I am heartened to \nnote that the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence both strongly support this bill and believe that it \nprovides them with the tools they need to gather intelligence about \nAmerica's foreign enemies.\n  Critically, this bill allows immediate and real-time surveillance of \nforeign targets located overseas whenever the Justice Department and \nthe intelligence community find that, without immediate surveillance, \n``intelligence important to the national security of the United States \nmay be lost or not timely acquired and time does not permit the \nissuance'' of a court order prior to such surveillance. This provision, \nin a new section 702(c)(2) of FISA, addresses the exact problem that \nintelligence agencies faced in 2007. Congress expects our intelligence \nagents to use every tool that is technologically available to monitor \nal-Qaida and those associated with it. With this reform, we make such \nsurveillance possible.\n  I also think that it is important that, in new section 702(i), the \nFISA Amendments Act allows pending surveillance certifications to be \nimmediately amended to allow surveillance of new targets related to or \ngrowing out of previous surveillance. This should help to reduce the \npaperwork burden of FISA, allowing our agents to focus more time on \nmonitoring the enemy and less on filling out forms. Also, the judicial \nreview authorized by this section is appropriately limited and \nrecognizes the intelligence community's primary role in deciding what \nforeign targets to monitor. The court's role is limited to reviewing \nwhether certifications are procedurally proper and are accompanied by \nreasonable procedures to limit potential impact on U.S. persons. Thus, \ncourts could block any obviously bad faith or improper use of foreign \nsurveillance that might affect U.S. persons, but courts will not be \nsecond-guessing intelligence judgments, and should not be imposing \nprocedures or making demands that will consume intelligence resources \nand divert agents from their primary mission. This limited role should \nalso allow the FISA Court to decide these cases very quickly, \nminimizing the burden on both the intelligence community and on those \njudges who are assigned to the FISA Court.\n  I should also note that this bill contains important provisions that \nwill allow all of the lawsuits against telecommunications companies to \nbe dismissed upon certification by the Attorney General. Foreign \nintelligence surveillance is a matter that our Constitution entrusts to \nthe executive in consultation with Congress, not to private litigants \nand the judiciary. These lawsuits all should have been dismissed \nimmediately; this bill will finally produce that result. Title II is a \ncritical part of this bill that should have been enacted long ago. \nFrankly, I find it odd that much of the early criticism of this bill \nhas been directed at this of all provisions. Those who are opposed to \nthe President's efforts to monitor al-Qaida's communications after 9/11 \nshould take their argument to the President, not to the private \ncompanies that patriotically complied with government requests to help \nthis country. Monitoring of al-Qaida's electronic communications cannot \nbe conducted without the cooperation of private companies. The general \nrule that private citizens acting in good faith to assist law \nenforcement are immune from suit has deep roots and serves important \npublic policies. As Justice Cardozo noted in the 1928 case of \nBabbington v. Yellow Taxi Corporation, the rule ensures that ``the \ncitizenry may be called upon to enforce the justice of the State, not \nfaintly and with lagging steps, but honestly and bravely and with \nwhatever implements and facilities are convenient and at hand.''\n  Finally, I should note that this bill's so-called ``exclusive means'' \nprovision, like the similar provision in the 1978 FISA, is hortatory \nverbiage that obviously yields the Constitutional authority of the \nPresident. The FISA Court of Review, in its 2002 decision in In re \nSealed Cases, made the point:\n\n       The [Fourth Circuit in the Truong case], as did all the \n     other courts to have decided the issue, held that the \n     President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless \n     searches to obtain foreign intelligence information. . . . We \n     take for granted that the President does have that authority \n     and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the \n     President's constitutional power.\n\n  Indeed, every administration since FISA was enacted--including the \nCarter administration--has concluded that Congress cannot take away the \nPresident's power to monitor foreign enemies of the United States \nwithout a warrant, and that to the extent that FISA purports to do so, \nit is unconstitutional. The Constitution's framers vested the executive \nwith primary responsibility and authority to protect the United States \nfrom foreign attack. Section 102 repeats FISA's ``exclusive-means'' \nclaims, yet provides in the same section of the bill, at subsection \n(c), an amendment to the immunity provisions for electronic \ncommunications service providers in 18 U.S.C. 2511(2) to require that \ncertifications conferring immunity identify the ``specific statutory \nprovision'' that allows the surveillance, but only if the certification \n``for assistance to obtain foreign intelligence information is based on \nstatutory authority.'' This provision, in the same section making \nclaims of exclusive means, acknowledges that not all surveillance is \nbased on statutory authority, but may, instead, be based on the \nexecutive's constitutional authority. If this nation again finds itself \nunder attack as it did on September 11, those in charge of our security \nshould not conclude from the exclusive-means language in section 102 \nthat they may not act in any constitutionally appropriate way to \nprotect this country.\n  Finally, the ``sunset'' provision in section 403, which will repeal \nthe authorities in the bill at the end of 2012, is problematic. As the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence have said: \n``[t]he Intelligence Community operates more effectively when the rules \ngoverning our intelligence professionals' ability to track our enemies \nare firmly established.'' The need to modernize FISA has been \nextensively debated since 2006, including numerous hearings, briefings, \nand floor debates that ``involved the discussion in open settings of \nextraordinary information dealing with sensitive intelligence \noperations.'' As the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence have pointed out, ``[e]very time we repeat this process it \nrisks exposing our intelligence sources and methods to our \nadversaries.''\n  Despite these flaws, the bill before us is needed. It is very similar \nto the bill that the Senate passed earlier this Congress and on which \nthe House refused to act. It has passed the House by a 3-to-1 margin, \nand I expect that we will see a similar margin in the Senate, as the \nbill already appears to have gained the support of some Senators who \nopposed last year's bill. I look forward to the passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6007-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6007-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk about \nWorld Refugee Day, which we recently recognized, and offer some \nobservations on the millions of refugees around the world and our \nefforts to aid them.\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\n  Refugees find themselves in the immensely difficult position of being \nunable to return to their homeland, yet stuck without any place else to \nturn. They are often the targets of persecution due to their race, \nreligion, political associations, or other traits that should be worthy \nof respect rather than a threat on one's life. The theme of this year's \nWorld Refugee Day is ``protection,'' with a particular focus on shining \na bright light on the plight of refugees around the world, so that the \nworld community takes action to ensure their safety.\n  While refugees deserving of our attention exist in many places around \nthe world, one area of significant concern is the refugee situation in \nIraq. The U.N. estimates that over 4 million Iraqis have been displaced \nby violence, with 1.5 million living in Syria and over 1 million in \nJordan, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and Turkey. It is a staggering \nhumanitarian crisis. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2008, Congress adopted the Iraqi Refugee Crisis Act, \nwhich I sponsored along with a number of my colleagues. This \nlegislation creates a process for Iraqis who have offered assistance to \nour forces in Iraq to apply directly to the United States for refugee \nstatus. It is clear that the United States has a special obligation to \nhelp this population. The largest community of Iraqi Christians in the \nworld outside of Iraq is in Michigan, which makes this issue \nparticularly significant for me and my constituents.\n  The stark reality is that Iraq is just one small part of the tragic \nrefugee situation around the world. Thon Chol, who was one of the \n``Lost Boys of Sudan,'' is currently serving as an intern in my \nWashington, DC, office. He recently graduated with a master's degree in \nsocial work from Western Michigan University. His success is hard \nearned, but his story underscores the point that refugees deserve our \nattention as well as our aid and protection.\n  Thon was forced to flee his hometown at age 6. While attempting to \nreach Ethiopia he was one of thousands who faced dehydration, famine, \nand attacks from wild animals and Government soldiers alike. He lost \nmost of his family, witnessing many deaths himself. He reached a \nrefugee camp in 1987, was forced back to Sudan due to the civil war in \nEthiopia in 1991, and then eventually traveled to live in a refugee \ncamp in Kenya for 8 years before being one of less than 4,000 Lost Boys \npermitted to settle in the United States and moving to Grand Rapids, \nMI.\n  Many are now American citizens. Thon's remarkable educational \nachievements are in line with others who were in his situation; many \nhave sought degrees beyond high school, ranging from community college \nto one student who is pursuing a master's degree at Yale University. \nThon and others have committed themselves to returning to Sudan to \nteach democratic values and religious freedom.\n  There are many challenges even for those very few refugees who have \nbeen granted asylum or citizenship in welcoming countries, including \ncultural adjustments, difficulties in uniting separated families, \nobtaining work skills, and adapting to an unfamiliar climate. In \nMichigan, numerous volunteers, community organizations, churches, and \nbusinesses have come together to assist refugees who come to our state. \nOn this World Refugee Day, I offer my praise and appreciation for the \norganizations and individuals--both those local to Michigan and those \ninternational in scope--who are committed to helping refugees find some \nstability and normalcy, and I urge my colleagues to consider what we \ncan do to help the millions who are suffering right now. Individuals \nwho wish to help can begin by visiting the U.N. Refugee Agency website \nat http://www.unhcr.org.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GASPEE DAY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, every student of American history \nknows the story of the Boston Tea Party, the men who crept onto British \nships moored in Boston Harbor on December 16, 1773, to destroy \nshipments of tea that the English sought to tax. They were patriots who \nyearned for liberty, for ``no taxation without representation,'' and \nwho stepped into history.\n  Only a few miles south and more than a year earlier, however, another \ngroup of men had engaged in another act of patriotism--yet these men \nare largely forgotten outside my home State of Rhode Island. Every \nyear, in their memory, Rhode Islanders celebrate Gaspee Day. This is \ntheir story.\n  During the buildup to the Revolutionary War, as tensions between \nEngland and its American colonies grew increasingly strained, King \nGeorge III stationed the HMS Gaspee, under the command of LT William \nDudingston, in the waters off Rhode Island. Its mission was to search \nincoming ships for smuggled goods and enforce the payment of taxes.\n  On June 9, 1772--16 months before the tea party in Boston--the \nsailing vessel Hannah was traveling from Newport to Providence when it \nwas intercepted by the Gaspee and ordered to stop to allow a search. On \nboard the Hannah, Captain Benjamin Lindsey refused and continued on his \ncourse, despite warning shots fired by the Gaspee. The smaller and more \nmaneuverable Hannah then raced up Narragansett Bay and into the safety \nof Pawtuxet Cove. The hulking Gaspee tried to chase the Hannah but ran \naground in the shallow waters of Namquid Point. The Gaspee was stuck, \nawaiting the higher tides of the following day.\n  Meanwhile, Captain Lindsey proceeded on his course, and upon arriving \nin Providence he met with John Brown, a community leader who later \nfounded Brown University. The two men arranged for a meeting of local \npatriots at Sabin's Tavern, in what is now Providence's East Side, \nlater that day. At the meeting, the assembled group of Rhode Islanders \ndecided that action must be taken. Gaspee was a symbol of their \noppression, and she was helplessly stranded in Pawtuxet Cove. In short, \nthe opportunity was too good to pass up.\n  As night fell on June 9, 1772, there was no moonlight on the waters \nof Pawtuxet Cove. The Gaspee lay silent on the sand bar at Namquid \nPoint. But just a few miles away in Providence, a team of about 60 men \nled by John Brown and Abraham Whipple was preparing for an assault that \nwould soon break that silence. They armed themselves, boarded \nlongboats, and set course for the Gaspee.\n  After paddling the longboats 6 miles down the dark waters of \nNarragansett Bay, the men reached the Gaspee and surrounded it. Brown \ncalled out and demanded that Lieutenant Dudingston surrender his \nvessel. Dudingston refused and instead ordered his men to fire upon \nanyone who attempted to board the Gaspee.\n  True to form, these brave Rhode Islanders seized the challenge. They \nforced their way aboard the Gaspee, and a struggle ensued. In the melee \nLieutenant Dudingston was shot in the arm by a musket ball: Rhode \nIslanders had drawn the first blood of the American Revolution, right \nthere in Pawtuxet Cove.\n  Brown and Whipple's men took control of the ship from the British \ncrew and transported the captive Englishmen safely to shore. They then \nreturned to the abandoned Gaspee for one final act of defiance to the \ncrown. The men set fire to the Gaspee and watched as its powder \nmagazine exploded, leaving the whole ship burning down to the water \nline. The place was eventually renamed Gaspee Point.\n  If that is not an act that defines the American struggle for \nindependence, then I don't know what does.\n  Since that night in June when the Gaspee burned, Rhode Islanders have \nmarked the event with celebration. This year, as I do every year, I had \nthe good fortune to march in the annual Gaspee Days parade in Warwick, \nRI.\n  And every year, I think about what it must have felt like to be among \nthe 60 men hauling on those longboat oars, as they paddled toward \ndestiny.\n  While it is doubtful that many of those patriots could fully grasp \nthe place they were about to take in history, there must have been a \nfeeling of deep satisfaction known only to those who, in the face of \ntyranny, have stood up for home, for family, and for country. It is the \nsame feeling that must have accompanied the soldiers of General \nWashington as they crossed the Delaware, the delegates of the \nContinental Congress as they signed the Declaration of Independence, \nand indeed those men in Boston who emptied a shipment of tea into the \nocean. I\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nhope that the brave Rhode Islanders that gave us Gaspee Day will be \nremembered with those other giants of the Revolution, and given their \ndue place in our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, earlier this week, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo .senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       To whom it may concern: The rising cost of fuel and food \n     are a big concern for us that live in Northern Idaho. We live \n     in a lightly populated area and the trips to ``town'' are \n     right at 100 miles round trip. We are on Social Security and \n     Social Security doesn't allow a lot of flexibility in what a \n     person can spend. Basic items like home heating and food \n     prices have made huge changes in the way we live.\n       Recently we had a death in the family in another state \n     (Arizona). After figuring the cost of both driving and flying \n     we determined it would be too much of an expense for us to \n     go. We sent our love and regards--but that doesn't take the \n     place of a hug. The cost of heating our home with heating oil \n     has gone from under a dollar a gallon to 3.97 at the last \n     tank fill up. That is a huge increase for a basic need. Many \n     are worse off then we are and have to choose between being \n     warm and eating. Something must be done.\n       Every day we see our government reaching out with aid to \n     other countries. . . .what about those right here in America? \n     I expect the stimulus payment most people received went to \n     catch up on a couple of bills--no one could afford the luxury \n     of just frivolously spending it. We need everyday, down-to-\n     earth practical help so basic needs can be met.\n       Please stop this ever-increasing price on fuel and food.\n           Thank you. . . .sincerely,\n     Mr. and Mrs. Ray, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       I normally drive our 1999 Chevy Suburban. It gets 14 MPG on \n     average. With gas prices over $4.00 a gallon I just use this \n     simple rule of thumb to calculate how much a trip on the \n     interstate costs me. It's simple. At normal interstate speed \n     of 65 MPH, it costs me $20.00 an hour to drive. 65 divided by \n     14 = 4.65 x $4.10 a gallon = $19.00 not including wear and \n     tear. So $20.00 an hour is my rule of thumb.\n       Now if I lived 1 hour from work and I made $12.50 an hour, \n     I would have to work 3.2 hours more to get my 8 hours pay.\n       Do the math yourself. This has to be fixed.\n       A few things that bother me the most:\n       Hearing that the gas companies have made ``record profits'' \n     again while I'm paying for it; the price of a barrel of oil \n     goes up in the morning then by noon the same day the price of \n     gas goes up even though that gas has been in the underground \n     tank for days; the price of a barrel of oil goes down in the \n     morning but the gas prices stay the same until they can go up \n     again later; relying on foreign oil. That is relying on a \n     foreign people who are not necessarily our friends or care \n     about us; we have oil under our own ground but can't get it? \n     Why?\n       Here's a question. Since when is not having oil not a \n     national security issue?\n     Aaron, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator: Nightly, I listen to a number of pundits and \n     politicos debate the ``solutions'' to our energy problems. \n     One of the more ridiculous ones is mandating people switch to \n     higher fuel efficiency automobiles (i.e., buy a new car). As \n     a small business owner, our health insurance premiums have \n     just gone up (again), the minimum wage has risen, grocery \n     costs are rising and our 401k is diminishing. The very \n     thought of anyone in Congress telling me I have to replace my \n     ``paid for'' cars, and take out a loan to buy a new (more \n     energy efficient) car is ludicrous!! Gasoline would have to \n     be over $10 a gallon to make economic sense to my family, in \n     lieu of absorbing a car payment.\n       I support drilling offshore and in ANWAR, as well as shale \n     oil extraction. I think it's time that the world's most \n     technologically-advanced nation illustrate to the world the \n     most technologically advanced means of extracting energy. I'm \n     deeply offended that the United States government, who can't \n     profitably manage Amtrak, the US Postal Service, or even its \n     own Senate cafeteria, has the audacity to pretend to convince \n     me that they know more about ``safe & sound'' energy \n     extraction than the companies that are professionals in this \n     endeavor. I hear people crying about how drilling in the US \n     might ``spoil natural resources''! I'd be willing to wager \n     that if we weren't dependent upon Middle Eastern oil, we \n     could have, most likely, saved about 4,000 US Servicemen and \n     women's lives. That cost of natural resource is infinitely \n     greater than a handful of caribou!\n           Respectfully,\n     Daniel, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My mother-in-law (80 years old) had emergency surgery in \n     Grand Junction, Colorado. With increased fuel prices, the air \n     fare to fly my wife to Grand Junction ONE WAY was almost \n     $900. I drove separately to Grand Junction so our car would \n     be available for our use. The total mileage over a week's \n     time was in excess of 1,500 miles and, at over $4.00/gal, our \n     fuel bill (23 miles/gal) exceeded $260.00. I'd like to buy a \n     more fuel-efficient car, but my down payment was \n     significantly reduced!\n       In eastern Idaho, the cost to go camping, fishing, or \n     hunting will average from 50 miles to 150 miles or more round \n     trip. A weekend outing has increased in cost from $5.00 to \n     $16.00 for someone with a small SUV to $7.50-$22.50 when \n     using the standard pickup and pulling a boat or trailer. This \n     is based on $4.00/gal fuel compared to $2.50/gal a year ago. \n     Summertime costs can easily be $100 per month more for fuel \n     in this area just for simple recreation (long distances and \n     not much else to do). Add a few trips to the store for \n     supplies and the costs can be 50% higher. We can't afford \n     these extra costs.\n       Some think the answer is E-85 Ethanol from corn, but that \n     does NOT save significant petroleum products and creates \n     additional water pollution in corn-growing states. \n     Additionally, my cost for food for my family has gone up \n     significantly because of the increase in the price of corn. \n     So why, oh why, do you in the government PAY the Midwest \n     ethanol producers $0.51/gal to pollute the water and drive up \n     the cost of food throughout the country, while still using as \n     much oil for tractors in the fields, fuel trucks to transport \n     the ethanol (it can't go in pipelines), fertilizer, fuel the \n     ethanol plants, and other energy costs for something that \n     only has about 68% of the energy content of gasoline? You in \n     the government should get out of the way of the energy \n     industry. They were doing fine before government got \n     involved. Please let the energy sector drill for oil, develop \n     coal and oil shale gasification technologies, mine the off-\n     shore methane deposits, and set as a goal that nuclear power \n     plants will be licensed as fast as they can be built. \n     Government reviews should be minimal and should help instead \n     of hinder our progress. Wind power should be developed in \n     areas which have minimal impact (look at the INL site--huge \n     area where the Idaho wind blows all the time). Small solar \n     installations could easily be developed as the solar energy \n     industry grows. The very best thing that government could do \n     is to GET OUT OF THE WAY!! Maybe a few insects and frogs will \n     die as a result, but it is better than running out of energy \n     and then trying to figure out what to do in the dark\n     Daryl.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I wanted to briefly share some of the \n     impacts the high fuel prices are having on my family. I drive \n     32 miles one way to work. My car gets about 25 miles per \n     gallon. So it is costing me almost $10 a day just to go to \n     work. My husband is a farmer. We normally purchase 500 \n     gallons of fuel at a time for the farm. We have not been \n     financially able to buy it this spring/summer. He has cut \n     back on the water of the crop because the power bills are so \n     high, which will most likely affect the yield. Fertilizer is \n     skyrocketing. Diesel is ridiculous. Our entire food supply is \n     going to be affected as other farmers face these same \n     problems. We are not buying any extras anymore. Groceries \n     have increased, so non-essentials like chips, candy, boxed \n     cereals, etc. are out. We are not eating out like we used to \n     either. We normally ate out once or twice a week. For the \n     past 18 years, I have planted beautiful potted flowers for \n     the entrance of our home, usually spending around $300. I \n     will not be planting flowers like that this year. We are not \n     buying any new clothes for summer.

The state shall disburse this money within \n     150 days of the passage of this Proposition. There shall be a \n     daily fine of $10 million a day charged to any Refinery that \n     has not paid its share of the refund in the allotted time \n     payable to the State of California general fund.\n       Item 2: All Refineries shall sell off all fuel retail \n     establishments within one year of the passage of this \n     proposition. No Refinery or fuel wholesaler shall be allowed \n     to own or control any fuel retail outlets with the passage of \n     this proposition. The price of these establishments must fall \n     within the current market value within its area. Violation of \n     this item will result in a daily fine of 10 million dollars \n     per day payable to the State of California general fund.\n       Item 3: Any present and future contracts between fuel \n     retail outlets shall be hereby banned and null and void. Any \n     fuel retail establishment shall be able to purchase fuel from \n     any Refinery or fuel wholesaler he or she chooses without \n     restriction. Also any retail outlet shall be able to sell \n     multiple brands of fuel without restriction. Violation of \n     this item by any Refinery or fuel wholesaler will result in a \n     daily fine of ten million dollars per day payable to the \n     State of California general fund until corrected.\n       Item 4: Each Refinery selling fuel in California shall \n     maintain a stored reserve of fuel within the borders of \n     California equal to 1.5 times the monthly volume of fuel it \n     sells within the State of California. This requirement shall \n     be enforced beginning 1 year from the passage of this \n     proposition by the State of California. Violation of this \n     item by any Refinery or fuel wholesaler will result in a \n     daily fine of 10 million dollars per day payable to the State \n     of California general fund until corrected.\n       Item 5: Beginning 10 days after the passage of this \n     Proposition and for a period of 5 years, wholesale prices of \n     gasoline and diesel per gallon sold to retail establishments \n     in the State of California shall not exceed 1.2 percent of \n     the average price of oil per barrel on the world market. \n     Violation of this item will result in a daily fine of 10 \n     million dollars per day payable to the State of California \n     general fund.\n       Item 6: Beginning 10 days after the passage of this \n     Proposition and for a period of 5 years retail prices of \n     gasoline and diesel per gallon sold in the State of \n     California shall not exceed 2.0 percent of the average price \n     of oil per barrel on the world market. Violation of this item \n     will result in a daily fine of 10 thousand dollars per day \n     payable to the State of California general fund.\n       Item 7: The people of California have determined by the \n     passing of this proposition that the Refineries listed in \n     item one meet the definition of a monoply because of the way \n     fuel prices have risen everywhere in the state of California \n     in unison in the past 4 years, because these refineries \n     dominate the market, and by the documented huge increased, \n     sustained and increasing profits made by these oil \n     refineries. The people of California request the United \n     States department of Justice apply antitrust legal action \n     against the refineries listed in item 1.\n       Item 8: If any Items listed in this proposition are \n     nullified by court action then all other Items shall remain \n     in effect.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: Thank you for asking for my opinion. As I \n     interact with my employees as a business executive, with my \n     fellow church members as a church leader, and as a husband \n     and father, I think the real bottom line is this: The great \n     majority of people have no viable alternative to spending \n     additional money on fuel and many other goods and services \n     that also rise with fuel price increases. Most people are \n     just paying more because there is no alternative. This means \n     that bankruptcy, unemployment, and other severe financial \n     strains will be staved off until they cannot be held off \n     anymore, and then it will collapse. The danger signs of \n     energy dependence are so dire, yet congress does not make any \n     moves. I think the future is bleak for individuals on the \n     edge, and a large ``correction'' is due. I also would not be \n     surprised to see your constituents come after congress with \n     pitchforks and torches, but I have doubts that congress will \n     act.\n     Aaron, Coeur d'Alene.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Today, we had to make the difficult \n     choice of putting fuel in the car or grocery shopping. You \n     see, we needed milk, bread, and some other staples and we \n     needed a tank of gas. Each purchase was going to amount to \n     around $80, and we had to choose one or the other. So we \n     gassed up the car and decided to try to make it until payday \n     with the food that we had at home.\n       I have never felt so sick or downtrodden at the one or the \n     other kind of option we faced today. I went home and also \n     deduced through some back bills that our housing heating and \n     cooling has doubled since 2002. In only six years our gas has \n     gone from $67 a month to $112 and our electric from $87 to \n     $167, despite my keeping our heating at 65 day and 60 night \n     in the winter and our cooling at 75 in the summer. We are \n     hard pressed to pay those bills in addition to gas. This \n     spiral has got to stop or I do not know how we are going to \n     manage.\n           Sincerely,\n     D., Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I commute 52 miles round trip daily to \n     Rexburg from Idaho Falls. Since January I have been car \n     pooling with a co-worker in my department and we are \n     encouraging our employer to let us telecommute at least one \n     day a week. My family has declared two days a week as ``no \n     drive days'' where we don't even turn the key in either of \n     our cars. We save our errands and schedule appointments for \n     other days of the week. This basic routine is helping, but \n     not enough.\n       We recently had a daughter in the hospital in Idaho Falls \n     for seven and a half weeks, and for another four and a half \n     weeks at the University of Utah Medical Center. Those \n     expenses were of course offset by health insurance, although \n     out of pocket expenses still amounted to thousands of \n     dollars. However during those 12 weeks we had no choice but \n     to drive to the hospital daily while fuel prices were \n     skyrocketing. This created a sudden and unexpected burden on \n     our family budget. With the added cost of fuel forecasted to \n     stay high into the future, our financial recovery is nowhere \n     in sight.\n           Thanks for listening.\n     Bob and Beverly, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I own a small retail shop in Salmon, Idaho. \n     Retailers in this area depend on the local economy and on \n     Tourism to make ends. Tourists provide 60% of our sales \n     revenue and the gas prices have dramatically diminished \n     travelers. Whitewater rafting companies are struggling and my \n     retail store is in danger. I am unable to meet my monthly \n     expenses, let alone purchase merchandise to replenish my \n     normal inventory. Consumers cannot afford anything beyond gas \n     and food. Prices have doubled on groceries, shipping and all \n     are related to rising fuel costs. Most of the people I know \n     have no extra from their paychecks and it is killing small \n     businesses all over the Country! Here in the Rocky Mountains \n     we can't drive hybrid cars. The snow, rain and rural homes \n     make cars impossible. We have to have 4 wheel drives and \n     chains just to get out of our driveways and to the grocery \n     store! There is no mass transit and carpooling wouldn't be \n     feasible.\n       Congress seems to be at a loss as to what to do and if \n     something doesn't happen soon we will be facing a major \n     depression! The Speculators are driving prices even higher \n     and the oil producing nations are unwilling to cut their \n     profits. Most of us feel that Congress and the Senate are in \n     bed with the oil companies.\n       Something has to be done to open oil and gas production in \n     this Country. We have Anwar, the Bakkan oil in the North \n     Central States and off shore oil pockets. It is time that our \n     government look out for the American People and stop bucking \n     under to the Environmentalists.\n       Something has to be done quickly. Long-term renewable \n     energy sources will take decades, by that time all the small \n     businesses like mine will be forced to either close or file \n     bankruptcy. Currently my shop is in jeopardy. I am behind on \n     all my bills and my credit has been ruined so I can't even \n     get a loan to get me through the crisis. If our governmental \n     body can't find a solution now, then expect to see small and \n     medium businesses go under. We are the backbone of this land \n     and we need some backbone leadership!!!!\n           Sincerely\n     Donna, Salmon.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I would be more than happy to share our \n     story of high energy prices and the toll it is taking on our \n     family and our finances. My husband and I find it outrageous \n     that environmental groups can have SO much pull in this \n     country to put bans on the construction of oil refineries, \n     liquid coal plants and drilling for our own domestic \n     petroleum. At this point, we are dependant on this \n     abundant and efficient fuel. There is no other alternative \n     right now to take the place of petroleum--at least nothing \n     that is practical, efficient and most importantly--\n     affordable!!! To ignore our vast reserves of coal and oil \n     in this country to leave us dependent on Middle East Fuel \n     is ludicrous. There is wonderful technology out there that \n     can turn coal into liquid fuel that burns cleaner than \n     gasoline! But because your average environmentalist does \n     not understand how this technology works--they are against \n     it because traditionally burnt coal is filthy. They would \n     rather grow food crops to fill their tanks up while people \n     and animals starve.\n       We live in Salmon, Idaho. My husband is a Real Estate \n     Appraiser who frequently travels almost 600 miles in a week \n     simply to reach the properties to do his work. The cost of \n     living necessitates at this point that he take EVERY SINGLE \n     job that crosses his desk--so frequently driving round-trip \n     to Arco and back in a day or over to Missoula, Montana and \n     back in a day is a normal thing. BUT--the drawback is that \n     right now we have an outstanding balance on our Chevron card \n     that is over $1,400 and over limit--so we can't even use the \n     card. We make large payments every month, but with the \n     interest rate we still have not been able to bring the \n     balance low enough to even use the card. So we pay the \n     Chevron bill AND pay for gas out of our regular checking \n     account. The Chevron card went well over limit way back when \n     gas hit $3.50 a gallon, and we have not been able to catch up \n     and bring the balance down. We have a propane bill that is \n     over $1,100 right now that I pay $125 a month on--but this is \n     a balance from an $1,800 fill up of our tank back in November \n     of 2007. I am going to call the gas company this week to see \n     if they will fill the tank now while prices are ``lower''.\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\n     So we will probably have a bill that is over $3,000 for \n     heating our home basically 6 months out of the year. If gas \n     goes any higher--we are going to have to figure out how to \n     get even deeper in debt to find a cheaper way to heat our \n     home in the winter. As you know--Idaho gets cold. We HAVE to \n     heat our home!!! Living in Salmon, we HAVE to drive over 300 \n     miles in a round trip either to Idaho Falls or Missoula \n     Montana for doctors, Costco, clothes shopping etc.--as due to \n     there being a lack of logging or mining anymore there is \n     really no local options for shopping, etc. The very lives of \n     people living here depend on big rig trucks bringing our food \n     etc. For MANY years now, we have been hearing of the Idaho \n     Cobalt Project--but because the environmentalists have such a \n     stranglehold on ALL industries in this country--we are still \n     awaiting word of WHEN or IF this project will start. If it \n     does get clearance, Salmon, Idaho will once again have jobs \n     that pay a living wage for a family. We have a house that we \n     moved out of in downtown Salmon in 2005--it has been sitting \n     empty awaiting a buyer since then. It is in a commercial \n     zone--and commercial is dead in Salmon. We filed paperwork \n     with our mortgage company way back in February to give the \n     house back in a Deed in Lieu--and we are still awaiting \n     word!!! Apparently, the mortgage companies are backlogged \n     about 6 months? We can't afford to visit family in California \n     because we can't afford the gas. My husband's mother and \n     father in California got extremely ill this last year, but he \n     was never able to visit because of the debt load we are \n     carrying and how expensive driving or flying is!! We are \n     working to make payments and catch up on our gas bills that \n     are maxed out right now. We stopped making payments on a \n     house that would not sell for 3 years now--that has left us \n     behind in everything. With fuel costs continuing to rise \n     because we have a Democratic Liberal, Anti-American Congress \n     that continues to ban any sort of domestic drilling for our \n     own petroleum deposits--we don't even have a chance to catch \n     up right now as gas prices continue to rise. We are fortunate \n     though. My husband has a busy and successful business and \n     thankfully at least, we are able to work to make our \n     payments. On Father's Day, we decided against a picnic any \n     further than 5 miles out of town because of the cost of fuel. \n     It is sickening to us that our government cares SO little for \n     the average working American. It is sad that our government \n     has allowed itself to be controlled by secular humanist \n     environmentalists who care more for a spotted owl or a tiny \n     snail than the human family. Just ask anyone here in Salmon \n     how we feel about the forests being shut down to logging--yet \n     it is perfectly fine for the forest that is becoming nothing \n     more than a deadfall tinderbox to burn and choke us with \n     toxic, suffocating smoke for 2 months every summer! Something \n     has to change because if it does not soon--this country is \n     going to enter a depression that makes the Great Depression \n     look like the Good Old Days!!!\n           Sincerely,\n     Brent and Katie, Salmon.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is very hard to understand why the United States, the \n     most powerful Nation on Earth, is begging the Middle East for \n     oil. We need to immediately increase drilling off shore, in \n     Alaska and other States, plus utilize technology available to \n     extract oil from shale deposits in the Rocky Mountains. We \n     have advanced technology sufficiently to be safe for the \n     environment and yet provide for ourselves rather than being \n     dependent upon the Middle East.\n       Is it true that China is drilling off the Florida coast, \n     but we can't? In Idaho Falls, the Chamber is bragging about \n     bringing a French company's new uranium enrichment plant and \n     the corresponding jobs to the area to fuel nuclear power for \n     France. WHAT--we have had the capability of generating \n     nuclear power at the INEL for 35 years. My father worked at \n     the INEL for 35 years. You mean to tell me the \n     environmentalists will allow uranium enrichment for France, \n     but we can't utilize an existing US nuclear plant for power \n     for Idaho?\n       Bio-fuels are not the whole answer, it puts too much \n     pressure on our farmland that we need to crop food crops. The \n     prices of food are going up enough because of the fuel costs.\n       The US has substantial coal deposits, we need to build more \n     coal fired power plants. Combined with the nuclear and wind, \n     we should be able to have more than enough power to re-charge \n     hybrid cars.\n       Besides increasing drilling in the US, we need to invest in \n     some updated/additional refineries.\n       Then, Congress needs to do something about the speculators \n     driving up the price of crude oil. I don't know if you can \n     make it illegal to speculate on oil futures or restrict it, \n     but news media are reporting that $3.00 of every gallon goes \n     to speculators profits buying and selling.\n     Chris, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator: My husband and I own a small business in \n     Lewiston, where we do print advertising and TV/Video \n     productions (among other things). We live close to our \n     business, so although our fuel prices have increased, it's \n     not having a huge impact--YET. However, we frequently have to \n     travel across or out of the state to shoot various jobs, and \n     we are now having to charge such high travel expenses that we \n     are at risk of losing some clients to production companies \n     closer to their location, even though they would prefer to \n     keep working with us. We are bidding on a job right now which \n     falls in that category--a year ago we would have quoted them \n     $200 for mileage, and now we have to quote almost $500. \n     Obviously this will impact our bottom line by the end of the \n     year--something that we really can't afford.\n     Bobri, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I would guess that my story is different \n     than the story you were looking for.\n       In 1974 I graduated from the University of California with \n     a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.\n       The height of the first real Oil Crisis created by OPEC.\n       Because of the skyrocketing price of gasoline, gas lines, \n     and shortages, I purchased a manual transmission diesel \n     Volkswagen for $7,500. That car on average got 52 miles per \n     gallon. Diesel is a cheap byproduct of gasoline refinement. \n     At that time, it cost \\1/2\\ the price of gasoline per gallon.\n       Tell me why it costs more than gasoline now?\n       A few weeks after graduation, I was granted a full \n     scholarship to continue engineering graduate school at UC.\n       In 1979 I graduated from UC with a Ph.D. in Mechanical \n     Engineering, my specialty: thermodynamics, energy, and \n     materials science. My thesis was on the extraction of heat \n     energy from hot geothermal brine solutions.\n       I started working for a startup company purchased by \n     Weyerhaeuser. My project was researching burning lignite \n     (dirty coal) in a fluidized bed reactor to produce clean coal \n     energy. It included the removal of NOX, \n     SOX, and high temperature particulate down below \n     the submicron size.\n       My research burned one train car load of lignite \n     (environmentally the worst coal to burn with the lowest \n     heating value) from West Virginia, in Menlo Park, CA every \n     day 24/7 for nearly 9 months performing experiments under \n     contract with the US DOE. Our work was successful but went no \n     further. During the operation of that combustion system and \n     the associated experiments we passed all EPA combustion gas \n     stream standards. That company years later went bankrupt. I \n     left after 2 years to join Hewlett Packard in their computer \n     systems group. For the past 25 years I've been involved in \n     semiconductor manufacturing.\n       Thirty years have passed and sadly our government is no \n     closer to a long term proactive energy policy than it was in \n     1979.\n       It is a national disgrace and one day will be a national \n     disaster which will make the Great Depression pale in \n     comparison.\n       PLEASE, wait no longer. Turning food stocks into ethanol, \n     waiting for cheap solar, and looking to the wind to solve \n     this global crisis is beyond ridiculous.\n       Drill now in ANWR, Drill off the Coasts of Florida, and \n     California, Turn on the clean coal industry and liquefy coal \n     for fuel, build as many nuclear power plants as fast as \n     possible (then maybe we can avoid the energy depression). I \n     don't believe we have another 30 years to gamble away.\n           Regards,\n     Larry, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mike, I really believe that we don't need to find \n     alternative fuels. America is set up to burn petroleum based \n     products and there are so many drawbacks to all of the \n     ``bio'' fuels. We have lots of oil right off of our own \n     coasts and in the Gulf on Mexico, ANWR and North and South \n     Dakota with oil shale.\n       Our problem to being independent is not supply, Arabs or \n     the environment! It's Congress and the wacko left enviro \n     crowd who would rather see us all on bicycles!\n       I'm 62 years old and I DO ride a bicycle. However, like you \n     mentioned in your opening letter, bikes don't work all the \n     time in Idaho. Matter of fact between October and June, they \n     suck! We had 2\" of snow in Moscow on June 10th this year.\n       Congress needs to just get out of the way and let industry \n     do its thing.\n       Mike, I realize you're only one Senator from a little-known \n     state out West that doesn't matter to everybody East of the \n     Mississippi River but some how we have to find the courage to \n     stand up to the liberal Dems before our economy state and \n     country are turned into a Third World European nightmare like \n     B.

Mr. President, today I recognize Robert \nLingenfelter, affectionately known as ``Link,'' for being named \nDelaware History Teacher of the Year by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of \nAmerican History and Preserve America. Link has dedicated his life to \nthe thousands of school children whose lives he has touched as a \nteacher, as a coach and as a mentor.\n  The History Teacher of the Year Award, now in its fifth year, was \ndesigned to promote and celebrate the teaching of American history in \nclassrooms across our Nation. The award honors one exceptional teacher \nfrom each State and U.S. territory. The selection of the State winner \nis based upon several criteria, including a deep\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\ncareer commitment to teaching American history; evidence of creativity \nand imagination in the classroom that address literacy and content \nbeyond state standards; and evidence of thoughtful assessment of \nstudent achievement. Through Link's 13 dedicated years of teaching, it \nis clear that he embodies all of these criteria and many more.\n  After working for years as a night supervisor for what is now \nAstraZeneca, Link graduated from Wilmington College in 1995 with a \nbachelor's degree in education on a day that I was privileged to \ndeliver the commencement address there. Three years later, he earned \nhis master's of instruction from Wilmington College, which is now \nWilmington University. He was motivated to become a teacher because of \nhis interest in American History, his love of coaching and his passion \nto motivate children to achieve their true potential.\n  His interest in American history was increased in part by his work \nwith me as a volunteer photographer over the past 26 years. During that \ntime, Link also has documented a host of important events throughout \nDelaware. In his own words, he ``created history with his camera \nlens.''\n  In addition to teaching, Link has coached high school baseball for 14 \nyears. He developed a love of the game as a child and wanted to see the \nsame passion he felt for the game in the eyes of the children he \ncoached. He stresses individual success for each of his players and he \nhas always believed that once a child experiences success, they start \nbelieving that anything is possible. Link tries to foster this \n``anything is possible'' mentality in all of his students and players, \ncontinually encouraging them to do their absolute best and settle for \nnothing less.\n  He has been instrumental in the growth of many children, building \ntheir confidence and showing them the path to personal success. His \ndedication to the children he coached is apparent to all who know him \nas he teaches his players lessons that will help them in all walks of \nlife, both on and off the diamond.\n  Noticing his innate ability to connect with students and his drive to \nhelp them grow, Link's friends and players' parents suggested he pursue \na career in teaching. With their encouragement, he decided to combine \nhis love for American history and his commitment to helping children \nsucceed. He became a teacher.\n  Link started his teaching career at Stanton Middle School, where he \nworked from 1995-1998 as a 7th grade social studies and language arts \nteacher. In 1998, he joined Skyline Middle School where he teaches \ntoday. He is an 8th grade American history and social studies teacher \nand also serves as the social studies department chair. In addition, he \nworks as an adjunct professor at Wilmington University.\n  Link has been recognized many times as the Social Studies Teacher of \nthe Year by the Red Clay School District and was named the 2002-2003 \nTeacher of the Year at Skyline Middle School. These awards are a \ntribute to Link's creative teaching style and his genuine desire to \nhelp his students succeed.\n  Link's teaching style is unique and specifically tailored to helping \nstudents not just learn history but relive it. Link and others think of \nhim as more than just a teacher. He is something of an actor, as well. \nHe brings history alive in his classroom with props and costumes and \nengages his students in a way no textbook can. He and his students hold \nsimulations of historical events, assuming the roles of prominent \nhistoric figures and acting out the sequence of the events. His \nstudents reenact the Boston massacre mock trial, the Constitution \nConvention of 1787, slavery and the underground railroad, and even \nbattles of the Civil War. He doesn't simply teach history he engages \nhis students to participate in history, bringing to mind the old \nChinese proverb: Tell me, and I'll forget. Show me, and I may remember. \nInvolve me, and I'll understand.\n  Link also utilizes the historic sites in the area to further instill \nin his students an understanding of America's past. He takes his \nstudents on trips to the Constitution Center in Philadelphia and to \nFort Delaware, as well as to any number of sites in Washington, DC. His \n``classroom museum'' is a place of interactive learning that is far \nfrom a memorization of dates and locations; instead, it is a journey \nthrough American history, with stops and detours along the way where \nstudents fully embrace America's past and its impact on the present.\n  Link is a powerful teacher with a deep love for his students and for \nhistory. He has a lighthearted attitude that allows him to connect with \nstudents on a level that few can. He can always be counted on to have a \njoke ready to break up the stresses of the students he teaches. Using \nhis sense of humor to his advantage, Link constantly builds a closer \nrelationship with his students to the point where they know they can \ncome to him with anything from a history question to a problem with a \nfriend at school.\n  Link is a truly remarkable teacher and human being. He encourages his \nstudents to reach beyond their limits and settle for nothing less. He \ninstills in them the confidence they need to stand up for principles \nthey believe in and become proponents of change in the future. His \nteaching philosophy is one to be admired and emulated as it allows \nstudents to be participants in history as opposed to mere observers.\n  Robert ``Link'' Lingenfelter has become one of the finest teachers in \nDelaware, and he is on his way to becoming one of the finest teachers \nin America. It is with a genuine sense of honor and joy that I rise \ntoday to extend heartfelt congratulations to my good friend for his \naward. There could not be a more deserving recipient. He will always be \na role model, not just to his own students, but to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6012-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6012-S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LeROY KOPPENDRAYER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today, I honor the distinguished \npublic career of LeRoy Koppendrayer, retiring chairman of the Minnesota \nPublic Utilities Commission. LeRoy was appointed commissioner in 1998 \nand chairman in 2003. He has served Minnesotans honorably for 10 years, \nupholding and protecting the interests of Minnesota's utility \nratepayers while enjoying the respect and camaraderie of his fellow \ncommissioners and those who have come to know him.\n  LeRoy's journey to becoming a commissioner has been filled with a \nlifetime of experiences anyone would admire. In the 1990s, LeRoy was \nelected to four terms as a representative in Minnesota's Legislature \nwhere he worked successfully on issues ranging from agriculture to \nenergy to education. He also worked for years as a dairy farmer and \nthen as an international agricultural consultant, spending time in \nSouth America, Africa, Jamaica, Philippines, and Indonesia, consulting \nfarmers and working to develop and improve their economies and their \nlives. LeRoy's appointment to the commission caps his decades-long \ncommitment to public service.\n  LeRoy's work as commissioner includes decisions on a myriad of issues \nfacing Minnesota's utility ratepayers, such as rate cases filed by \nnatural gas, electric, and telephone utility companies, the twin cities \nmetro area code split, the establishment of rules governing reliability \nstandards for electric utilities, renewable energy projects and the \nciting and routing of energy facilities and transmission pipelines, to \nname just a few.\n  LeRoy's committee memberships include the National Association of \nRegulatory Commissioners, known as NARUC; as liaison to NARUC's \nInternational Relations Committee; the NARUC Regulatory Advisory \nCommittee to the Institute of Public Utilities; and the NARUC Committee \non Electricity and Subcommittee on Strategic Issues. He has also served \nas chair of the Nuclear Waste Strategy Coalition and as a member of the \nboard of the Organization of Midwest States, which oversees the Midwest \nelectricity grid.\n  As chairman, LeRoy has ensured the integrity of the commission's \nprocess through thoughtful consideration of issues and a friendly \nrapport with those who appear before the commission. Whether it is a \nlawyer representing a utility or a concerned citizen appearing for the \nfirst time, LeRoy's approach is the same. He treats everyone with \ngenuine respect and professional courtesy and with a sincere interest \nin understanding each person's point of view.\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\n  And on top of it all, LeRoy recently found time to make a 150-mile \nbicycle trip with his wife Carolyn and 10 other family members in \nsupport of MS research.\n  LeRoy is a man of loyalty, conviction, and fortitude. He commands \ngreat respect and great affection. He has an enviable capacity for \nwarmth and kindness and is driven by his value for hard work. He stands \nfirm in what he believes and yet finds common ground where there are \ndifferences, using a welcoming approach and a friendly smile to bring \npeople together. And if all else fails, he'll make you laugh, mostly at \nhis own expense, by poking fun at himself.\n  Today, at this bittersweet moment, it is with gratitude and \nadmiration that I stand before you to honor LeRoy's longstanding \ncontributions to the people of Minnesota through his years of service \nas commissioner of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6013-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BELFIELD, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

From July 11 \nto July 13, the residents of Belfield, ND, will celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Belfield is situated along the banks of the Heart River in western \nNorth Dakota. As the westward expansion of the Northern Pacific \nRailroad progressed, settlers established this community and first \nidentified it as Fort Houston.

From Custer's Trail and Initial Rock, to Belfield Dam and the \nMaah Daah Hey Trail, Belfield has a wealth of outdoor recreational \nactivities. This gateway to the west is also birthplace of North Dakota \nSupreme Court Judge Herbert L. Meschke.\n  To celebrate its 125th anniversary, Belfield is organizing a weekend \nfilled with events such as a parade, class reunions, a demolition \nderby, a steak fry, historical photo and pottery displays, and games \nfor all ages.

Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On June \n21, the residents of Menoken gathered to celebrate their community and \nits historic founding.\n  Menoken is located in Burleigh County, just a few miles from the \nState capital. Although its population is small, Menoken holds an \nimportant place in our State's history. As the first tracks of the \nNorthern Pacific Railroad were being laid across North Dakota, the \nSeventeenth Siding was marked; later to be known as what is now \nMenoken. Upon the completion of the railroad, settlers from Maine \noccupied the territory and named the town Blaine, after Maine Senator \nJames G. Blaine. Once more the town's name was changed to Clark, and \nthen finally secured as Menoken.\n  The citizens of Menoken take great pride in their community enriched \nwith history. The town is home to the Menoken Indian Village, which is \na preserved prehistoric earthlodge village that dates back to the early \n13th century A.D. In addition, the battlegrounds of General Sibley's \ncampaign of 1863 are located near Menoken. These two landmarks are \namong many of the town's sacred keepsakes that resemble the very \nessence of North Dakota.\n  The 125th anniversary celebration included a school tour, fashion \nshow, and parade. It was followed by a horseshoe tournament, tractor \npull, and old-time music. Once evening set in, people witnessed an \nexceptional cavalry reenactment. It was no doubt a day unlike any \nother.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nMenoken, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in \nwishing them well for the future. By honoring Menoken and all other \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering, frontier spirit alive \nfor future generations.

Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating it 125th anniversary. On July 24 \nthrough July 27, the residents of Michigan will celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Michigan is a small town with a population of 345 residents located \nin Nelson County in northeastern North Dakota. It was established on \nJanuary 2, 1883, with the completion of its post office with C.J. \nBondurant as postmaster. Soon after its establishment, railroad tracks \nwere completed, and, in March of 1883, the first train reached \nMichigan. The town quickly became known as a trading center. With the \nrailroads came more people, who built businesses, churches and schools. \nThe settlers began to cultivate the land and raise crops. Agriculture \nsoon became the center of their economy and remains so to this day.\n  Today, Michigan remains a proud community that has a prosperous \neconomy consisting of farming, manufacturing industries, and retail \nbusinesses. Residents of Michigan are known for their honesty, strong \nwork ethic, and living off the land. It is a great place for enjoying \nthe outdoors all year round, including hunting, cross-country skiing, \nfishing, boating, and camping. Michigan Days is a highlight each \nsummer. During Michigan Days, the residents enjoy live music, a \nsoftball tournament, street dances, a tractor pull, and ice cream \nsocials.\n  As part of the weekend anniversary celebration residents will be able \nto go to the interesting Dakota Mysteries and Oddities Museum. Michigan \nwill also hold a golf tournament at the Duffers Club and dedicate the \nVeteran's Memorial Building for all the brave residents of Michigan who \nhave served in past wars.

On July \n18-20, the residents of Milnor will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  During the summer of 1863, Henry Hastings Sibley and his army camped \non the shore of Storm Lake--Camp Buel--and about 20 years later, in \n1883, Milnor was established on that historical site. Milnor was named \nafter William E. Milnor, the first telegrapher at the Milnor Station \nand WM Milnor Roberts, a famous civil engineer of the\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nday. In October 1883, Milnor's post office was established, and it \nbecame a city in 1914.\n  Today, Milnor remains a small, proud community. Each year, the \ncommunity gathers in June for its annual Jamboree. The residents \ncelebrate with a BBQ, golf tournament, street dance, parade and many \nother fun activities. During the summer, many Milnor residents can be \nfound at the local pool, catching up with friends and family, or at the \nLakeview golf course playing a few holes. Two National Wildlife \nRefugees are located near Milnor, the Tewaukon and Storm Lake Refuges. \nMany residents enjoy camping, fishing, and spotting wildlife at these \nbeautiful sites. Milnor also has many other outdoor recreational areas \nlocated nearby, like Buffalo Lake--Kandiotta Lake--and Dead Colt Creek.\n  To celebrate the 125th anniversary, the residents of Milnor will \ngather for many fun and exciting activities, including a parade, a \nstreet dance, and a time capsule unveiling.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nMilnor, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and wishing them \nwell in the future.

On July 25 to 27, the residents of Minto will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Minto is a community of over 600 residents located in the fertile Red \nRiver Valley in northeast North Dakota. The Homestead Act brought the \nfirst settlers to the Minto area, including a Canadian by the name of \nAngus Gillespie, Sr., who left his home in Minto Township, Ontario, to \nfarm in North Dakota. Minto was incorporated in 1883. Twenty years \nlater, Minto was recognized as a city. Minto's links with its Canadian \nforefathers have been renewed as the town of Minto, ND, became the \nsister city of Minto, Ontario, in 2007.\n  The community of Minto is host to many businesses and amenities. \nThere are numerous enterprises dedicated to farming, including \nelevators, implement dealerships, and trucking services. It also offers \nits citizens many leisure activities. Residents of the town and the \nsurrounding area are able to enjoy a meal at the town's cafe and have \ntheir hair done at one of the salons. Families often gather in Minto's \nbeautiful park, which has a baseball field, tennis court, playground, \nand picnic area.

Mr. President, in early July, when nearly 9,000 \neducators are in Washington for the National Education Association's \nannual Representative Assembly, they will posthumously honor one of \nIowa's most dedicated and respected teachers, Paul Mann. Lola Mann, \nPaul's wife of 38 years, will accept the Applegate-Dorros Award on \nbehalf of her late husband at NEA's annual Human and Civil Rights \nAwards Dinner on July 2.\n  The Applegate-Dorros Award is given each year to an individual who \nhas made lasting contributions to the cause of international \nunderstanding, and who has encouraged young people to study the world \nand work for world peace. Over a long and distinguished career spanning \nnearly four decades as a teacher with the Des Moines public school \nsystem, Paul both lived and taught those ideals. He shaped the thinking \nof generations of students, and he was active on the national stage as \na long-time leader of NEA's Midwest Peace and Justice Caucus.\n  I do not believe that democracy is a spectator sport, and neither did \nPaul. As his wife Lola said, ``he felt strongly that he was placed on \nthis earth for a purpose . . . that he was here to help make the world \na better place.'' He challenged his colleagues and students alike to \nget involved in campaigns and in the broader political process. His own \npassion for politics and engagement was infectious.\n  Paul stood up for social justice and the peaceful resolution of \nconflict. Just as Gandhi counseled that ``You must be the change you \nwish to see in the world,'' Paul lived a life that embodied the \nprogressive ideals that he advocated.\n  Paul Mann was born in Onawa, IA on March 12, 1947, graduated from \nCentral Missouri State University in 1969, and earned a master's in \npublic administration from Drake University in 1981. He began teaching \nin Des Moines in 1969 and was an energetic, beloved teacher right up \nuntil his sudden passing in September of 2006. At the time of his \ndeath, he was a teacher of world civilization and government at Central \nAcademy, the magnet school for Des Moines' gifted and talented middle- \nand high-school students.\n  As a teacher, Paul was a consummate professional who had a deep \npersonal commitment to ensuring that every child receives a high-\nquality public education. This commitment led to his activism and \nleadership within the Des Moines Education Association, including 8 \nyears as president. He served in a various leadership positions at the \nlocal, State and national levels within the National Education \nAssociation. He was also active in local and State politics.\n  I have always appreciated what Lee Iacocca said about teachers. ``In \na completely rational society,'' he said, ``the best of us would be \nteachers, and the rest of us would have to settle for something else.'' \nFortunately, in Iowa, so many of our best and brightest do go into \nteaching. And Paul Mann was one of the very finest.\n  To honor his activism in the cause of world peace and understanding, \nthe Paul Mann Memorial School has been established in Chiapas, Mexico. \nIn addition, he has another living legacy: countless former students \nwho are living the noble ideals that he taught in his classroom and \nembodied in his life.\n  Paul Mann lived a life of constant activism and thoughtful action \nboth in and out of the classroom. His life is one worthy of recognition \nand I commend his family and all of his former colleagues for doing \ntheir part in honoring him with the Applegate-Dorros Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6014-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6014-S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF IPSWICH, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I recognize the community of \nIpswich, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. As the \ncounty seat of Edmunds County, the rural community of Ipswich is \ninfused with hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life.\n  The town of Ipswich was founded in 1883, with the railroad industry \njumpstarting the area as a business and transportation center. Ipswich \nwas noted for its many buildings made of native prairie stone, and was \neventually given the nicknames: ``the Home of the Yellowstone Trail,'' \n``the Arch City,'' and ``the Zinnia City.''\n  Today, Ipswich has come a long way from its days as a railroad supply \ncenter. The town now boasts a variety of businesses, including those in \nthe service, manufacturing, and agricultural\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nsectors. For the outdoor enthusiasts, Ipswich offers an abundance of \nlocal hunting and fishing.\n  The people of Ipswich celebrated their Trail Days on the weekend of \nJune 13-15, 2008, with an all-school reunion, a parade, a pie-baking \ncontest, a demolition derby and a street dance. South Dakota's small \ncommunities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the future of \nour state. It is especially because of our small communities, and the \nfeelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I am proud \nto call South Dakota home. Towns like Ipswich and its citizens are no \ndifferent and truly know what it means to be South Dakotan. One hundred \nand twenty five years after its founding, Ipswich remains a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to the wonderful state of South Dakota. I \nam proud to honor Ipswich on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6015-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING ARROWS RESTAURANT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I honor Arrows Restaurant of \nOgunquit, ME, on the occasion of its 20th anniversary and to recognize \nthe tremendous talent and innovative environmental stewardship of its \nowners, award-winning chefs Mark Gaier and Clark Frasier.\n  Quite simply, Arrows is one of America's great restaurants. It has \nreceived recognition from national publications such as Gourmet \nmagazine, which ranked it 14th on its list of ``America's Top 50 \nRestaurants in 2006,'' and Bon Appetit, which named Arrows ``one of the \ncountry's 10 most romantic restaurants.''\n  Arrows has also received some of the highest and most consistent \nratings in the annual Zagat survey. In addition, Mr. Gaier and Mr. \nFrasier were nominated as Best Chefs in the Northeast by the James \nBeard Foundation, a national organization whose annual awards have been \ndeemed the ``Oscars of the food world'' by Time magazine.\n  Arrows has further distinguished itself by its extraordinary garden, \nwhich offers more than 300 varieties of herbs, flowers, fruits, and \nvegetables. It provides Mr. Gaier and Mr. Frasier with the source of \nmost of the ingredients for their menu and serves as a wonderful \nillustration of how sensitive environmental stewardship and \nentrepreneurial spirit can go hand-in-hand. It should come as no \nsurprise that Arrows has been featured on television programs such as \nPBS's ``Victory Garden,'' and NBC's ``Today Show.''\n  Like the restaurant, the garden has received tremendous acclaim in \nthe press. Bon Appetit noted that ``[Arrows] helped pioneer the idea of \ngrowing your own food and paying attention to what's seasonal in a \nplace that is unforgiving in its climate.'' Earlier this year, the \nDaily Green--a Web site that reports on the environmental concerns of \neveryday Americans--praised Mr. Gaier and Mr. Frasier as `` . . . \nstalwart forerunners of the sustainable movement.''\n  As ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am eminently proud of all of Maine's small firms, \nand am particularly impressed by Mr. Gaier's and Mr. Frasier's \ndedication to making Arrows the premier dining establishment that it \nhas become. These two restaurateurs have helped transform American \ncuisine, and have brought the world to Maine--as well as Maine to the \nworld. They are truly deserving of our admiration and praise, and I \nwish them well in all that they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6015-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6015-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States sumitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6015-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13219 OF JUNE 26, 2001, WITH \n                 RESPECT TO THE WESTERN BALKANS--PM 54\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication stating that \nthe Western Balkans emergency is to continue in effect beyond June 26, \n2008.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or \nassisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the \nRepublic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or \n(ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in \nKosovo, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on June 26, \n2001, in Executive Order 13219 and to Executive Order 13304 of May 28, \n2003, has not been resolved. The acts of extremist violence and \nobstructionist activity outlined in Executive Order 13219, as amended, \nare hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe Western Balkans and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions \nto respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to provide oil \nand gas price relief by requiring the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to take action to end excessive speculation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of legislation \non behalf of myself, Senator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Carper \ndealing with the subject of energy speculation. I want to run through a \ncouple charts, and I want to describe the reason for the introduction \nof this legislation.\n  This chart shows the price of oil and what has happened to the price \nof oil. The price of oil has nearly doubled in a year. There is no \njustification for it, no fundamentals of supply and demand that explain \nwhat has happened to the price of oil.\n  These commodity contracts, by and large, are traded in this country \non something called the commodity exchange--NYMEX, it is called. This \nis what it looks like. They trade back and forth, and there are \nlegitimate reasons to trade on the exchanges. Those reasons to trade on \nthe exchanges are for legitimate hedging for actual physical petroleum \nproducts for future delivery. The problem is, with respect to the oil \nmarkets, the legitimate hedging has become a smaller part of what is \ntraded. There is now this unbelievable speculation going on in the \ncommodity markets. That speculation has perverted the market, broken \nthe market, causing the price of oil and gasoline to be well above that \nwhich is justifiable.\n  We have an organization in the Government called the Energy \nInformation Administration, the EIA. They are the ones who know what \nthere is to know about energy issues. As shown on this chart, here is \nwhat they have told us. Back in May of 2007--last year--here is where \nthey said the price of oil would be. Back in July, they said it would \nbe on this line, as shown on this chart; back in September, on this \nline. I hope they were not buying any commodities on the basis of their \nadvice--they would be flat broke in a month. Here is what happened to \nthe price. It went straight up. All the while, the EIA did not seem to \nhave the foggiest notion of where the price was going to go. Why? \nBecause the fundamentals do not justify what is happening.\n  Now I have the EIA coming down to testify before my subcommittee this \nweek. I want to ask them these questions. They insist there is very \nlittle speculation in this marketplace. But most experts insist this \nhas become an unbelievable spectacle of speculation that injures \nAmerica's drivers and consumers, injures our industry, and causes great \ndamage to our economy.\n  A House study, just in the last few days, from the House Subcommittee \non Oversight and Investigations, said here is what has happened to the \ncommodities market with respect to oil. As to the oil futures market: \n37 percent used to be speculators in that market. Now it has gone to 71 \npercent. The speculators have taken over that market.\n  When the Commodity Exchange Act was passed by the Congress in the \n1930s, here is what the congressional report said: This bill authorizes \nthe Commission--the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; that is \nsupposed to be the regulating body--to fix limitations on purely \nspeculative trades and commitments.\n  Hedging is exempted. But for purely speculative positions, we \nprovided the authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \ndeal with that because we did not want this market to be taken over by \nspeculators.\n  I have used these charts many times.\n  This one has to do with Fadel Gheit, the top energy analyst for \nOppenheimer & Co. Here is what he says:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm convinced that \n     oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall. . . . It's \n     open 24/7. . . . Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. . . \n     . This is like a highway with no cops on the beat and no \n     speed limit and everybody's going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  I will not show all the charts I have shown in the past, but the CEO \nof Marathon Oil says:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  It was recently reported Americans drove 4.5 to 5 billion fewer miles \nin the last 6 months than in the previous 6 months. So we are driving 4 \nor 5 billion fewer miles, using less energy. Four of the first 5 months \nof this year, crude oil inventories were up--not down, up. So if the \nsupply of the product is going up and the use of the product is going \ndown, the marketplace would have you believe--or at least you would \nexpect--the price would come down. Instead, the price has gone up, \nwhich demonstrates this is not about market fundamentals. It is about \nan unbelievable orgy of speculation in the marketplace that is not \njustified.\n  Now the question is, Will Congress do something about it or will it \njust apply some lip gloss? Is this just something where we act as if we \nare doing something or are we going to drive the speculators out of \nthis market? I am introducing legislation that is tough and real and \nwill address this issue.\n  The regulating body here is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \nIt has acted like most regulating bodies in recent years. Most of them \nare run by people who came to the Government not liking Government and \nnot wanting to regulate. It all goes back to Mr. Pitt, back in 2001, in \nwhich he said: The Securities and Exchange Commission is going to be a \nbusiness-friendly place. Well, we have seen a lot of these agencies \nthat are business friendly. They just get out of the way and pretend \nthey are in a deep Rip van Winkle sleep, and they are not going to see \nanything and they are not going to know anything and they are not going \nto care much about anything.\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\n  This agency is not much different--the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. The fact is, it has been asleep on its feet, just dead from \nthe neck up. It is time for us to say to this agency: It is your job to \nregulate. The fact is, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when he signed this \nlegislation some 70, 80 years ago, said:\n\n       It should be our national policy to restrict, as far as \n     possible, the use of these exchanges for purely speculative \n     operations.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt knew it. Why doesn't this Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission know it?\n  The legislation I am introducing today does a couple things. No. 1, \nit demands the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by date certain to \ndistinguish between that which represents normal hedging transactions \nbetween producers and consumers of a physical product and the rest, \nwhich is speculation. It says this market is designed for normal \nhedging of risks between producers and consumers of a physical product. \nOthers who are engaged in excess speculation are going to be slapped \nwith a higher margin--a 25-percent margin requirement--that is either \nquadruple or quintuple the current requirement, depending on what is \nassessed between the 5- and 7-percent rate. But this essentially says \nto speculators: It is going to cost you more to speculate in this \nmarketplace if you are one of these folks who just want to speculate to \nmake a lot of money.\n  Will Rogers talked about this long ago. He talked about people buying \nthings they will never get from people who never had it. That is what \nis going on with investment banks, hedge funds, and a lot of others who \nare neck deep in this marketplace. They have never seen a barrel of \noil. They don't want a barrel of oil. All they want to do is speculate \nand make a bundle of money. The problem is, it is damaging this \ncountry.\n  My legislation, No. 1, requires the separation of legitimate traders \nverses speculators. It puts an increased margin requirement on the \nspeculators to try to wring some of that speculation out of the market.\n  No. 2, it requires position limits that are significant, imposed by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  No. 3, it requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to revoke \nor modify any previous actions they have taken in which they have \nprevented themselves from being able to regulate and see the \ntransactions that exist in this futures market.\n  Unbelievably almost, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which \nis the regulator, decided, on its own volition, that it would allow, \nfor example, a London exchange, largely owned by American interests, to \ncome in and trade on computer terminals in Atlanta, GA, and pretend \nthey are not American. So the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nsaid: Do you know what, we will do a letter of no action so we can't \nregulate and can't see it. That is unbelievable, in my judgment. It is \nan unbelievably irresponsible position for a regulator to have taken. \nIt is taken, I suppose, by those who believe ``regulations'' is a four-\nletter word. It is not. If ever we wonder about that, take a look at \nwhat has happened to the price of oil and gas in a situation where \nspeculators have taken over.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is a regulator of this \nmarket. It has done a miserable job. It has nearly all the authority it \nneeds to do the right thing. What I propose to do with the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission is wring the speculators out of this market. \nThey have distorted the market, broken the market, and we end up in a \nsituation now where the price of gasoline is devastating this economy. \nThe price of oil is not justified by supply and demand. When that \nhappens, there is a responsibility for this Congress to act. It is an \nurgent responsibility, in my judgment, now for this Congress to say \nwhat is happening is wrong, it is hurting this country's economy, it is \nhurting industries and the American people, and we need to do something \nabout it. The best start, in my judgment, would be to pass this \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  One final point. I am reaching out to Democratic and Republican \noffices in the hopes that this will be a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that will address a very serious issue on an urgent basis \nand begin to do something that moderates the price of oil and gas that \nmany experts have told us is 20, 30, and in some cases 40 percent above \nthat which is justified by the marketplace. We should not stand for it. \nWe do not have to. We ought to pass this legislation soon.\n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3184. A bill to make grants to States to implement statewide \nportal initiatives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we must do all we can to ensure that our \nyoung people have the skills necessary to compete in today's global \neconomy. My home State of Massachusetts has done an outstanding job \nensuring that educators have access to the high-quality tools necessary \nto adequately prepare our students for the future. In particular, they \nhave been one of a handful of pioneering states that have created a \nstatewide, online education ``portal'', which is a suite of web-based \ntools that enhance the teaching and learning experience for teachers, \nparents, and students.\n  Education portals are a one-stop resource for educators, parents, and \nstudents to support teaching and learning, as well as leadership \nskills. Portals provide access to shared resources and create an entry \npoint to other information and services including: lesson plans; \nresearch-based training resources; model classroom examples; engaging \ninteractive media; listservs; and after-school resources. Among other \nthings, a portal allows educators to quickly search for lesson plans or \nother resources by content standard, grade level, specific student and \nclassroom needs, and/or topic. It also provides a secure, on-line \ncommunity for educators to collaborate and discuss teaching and \nlearning experiences, as well as providing a vital communication tool \nbetween the school and parents.\n  It is for these reasons, I am sponsoring legislation to help my State \nand others secure the funding they need to improve their education \nsystems and prepare their students for success. While it is true that \nCongress has done a lot to promote education technology and set higher \nstandards for teachers, more must be done to address the divide that \nafflicts so many of our rural and urban schools.\n  What is missing is a funding source for states to develop and \nmaintain web-based tools for training, communication, collaboration, \nand curriculum planning. The Empowering Teaching and Learning Through \nEducation Portals Act establishes annual competitive grants that will \nprovide funding on a one-to-one basis for states that wish to implement \nand maintain best-practice education portals. The legislation also \nprovides new tax incentives to private organizations that support State \neducation portal efforts.\n  The Empowering Teaching and Learning Through Education Portals Act \nbridges the urban-rural digital divide by ensuring that all districts \nhave access to the best available resources. It supports high quality \nteaching, professional development and retention of teachers and \npromotes an on-line support network and learning community for teachers \nand administrators. Furthermore, it provides teacher coaching and \nguidance in order to address the challenges of teaching a diverse \nstudent body, and collaborate on winning strategies to address various \nlearning styles, needs, and achievement levels. It offers \nadministrators tools to securely communicate and collaborate with \ndistrict personnel, as well as with the Department of Education, and \ngives them access to formative assessments and other resources. \nFinally, it provides a means to actively engage students in a rich, \nrelevant, multimedia environment that results in improved learning and \nstudent retention.\n  It is imperative that we prepare our children for the sophisticated \nworkforce of the 21st century and an increasingly competitive global \neconomy. This legislation takes some of the brightest ideas for \nmodernizing teaching and learning and matches them with the dollars \nneeded to translate them from paper to practice. That, I believe, is a \ngoal we can all agree on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Empowering Teaching and Learning \nThrough Education Portals Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\n                                S. 3184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 598\n\n       Whereas scientists estimate that approximately \\1/10\\ of \n     the world's known biological diversity is currently in danger \n     of extinction, including at least \\1/4\\ of all mammals, \\1/3\\ \n     of all primates, \\1/3\\ of all amphibians, and \\1/8\\ of all \n     birds;\n       Whereas scientists have concluded that the initial stages \n     of a major worldwide extinction event are occurring now and \n     have estimated that by the end of the 21st century as much as \n     \\2/3\\ of the world's plant and animal species could be in \n     danger of extinction;\n       Whereas scientists estimate that approximately \\3/4\\ of the \n     world's terrestrial plant and animal species reside in whole \n     or in part in developing nations, where in many cases poor \n     management of natural resources has exacerbated the threat of \n     extinction to many species and directly harmed local \n     communities;\n       Whereas, in addition to producing 20 percent of the world's \n     carbon emissions, unsustainable forestry practices and \n     illegal logging operations have led to the destruction of \n     vast areas of forested land around the world, which, in turn, \n     has led to species loss, increased flooding, erosion, insect \n     infestations, and higher incidences of malaria and other \n     infectious diseases;\n       Whereas the degradation of the marine environment and \n     unsustainable fishing practices in many parts of the world \n     have led to dramatic declines of many fish and other marine \n     species;\n       Whereas the introduction of invasive species threatens \n     natural habitats;\n       Whereas scientists have concluded that many species could \n     face an increased risk of extinction from global climate \n     change;\n       Whereas sound natural resource management and the \n     conservation of species and habitats are vital to alleviating \n     poverty for many communities in developing countries that \n     depend on these resources for their livelihoods, food, \n     medicinal compounds, housing material, and other necessities;\n       Whereas there are significant risks to the global and \n     national economies from the destruction of natural resources \n     around the world and the valuable services they provide, such \n     as water and air purification, soil fertility and erosion \n     control, flood and drought mitigation, protection from storm \n     surges, and the sequestration of carbon;\n       Whereas human encroachment into natural ecosystems \n     increases opportunities for the emergence and transmission of \n     new animal-borne diseases that could cause high levels of \n     human mortality and affect major global industries including \n     travel, trade, tourism, food production, and finance;\n       Whereas loss of species can jeopardize important future \n     pharmaceutical discoveries, given that more than \\1/4\\ of all \n     medicinal drugs possess active ingredients from wild species \n     and that at least \\1/2\\ of the most prescribed medicines in \n     the United States are derived from natural compounds;\n       Whereas natural pollinators and the opportunities of wild \n     and domesticated crossbreeding are vital to world and United \n     States agriculture;\n       Whereas poverty aggravated by natural resource degradation \n     contributes to political instability, ethnic and sectarian \n     conflict, and the social conditions that can fuel increased \n     violence and terrorism;\n       Whereas the extinction of plant and animal species raises \n     profound ethical questions, and many religious traditions \n     call upon human beings to act as good stewards of the Earth;\n       Whereas opportunities for sustainably managing natural \n     resources and conserving viable populations of species and \n     their habitats rapidly diminish every year;\n       Whereas a substantial body of academic and field research \n     has identified global strategies and market based approaches \n     for better managing natural resources and protecting \n     biological diversity;\n       Whereas strategic large-scale and site-specific habitat \n     conservation could help to buffer the impacts of climate \n     change on endangered species and human communities;\n       Whereas an effective international conservation effort that \n     ensures the use of natural resources on a sustainable basis \n     and prevents the worst predicted extinction scenarios from \n     unfolding will require commitment and action from all \n     nations; and\n       Whereas the United States's traditional role in confronting \n     international challenges, protecting the environment, \n     expanding opportunities for people, and articulating a moral \n     vision for global action gives the Nation the opportunity to \n     lead an international conservation effort: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government should make full use of Federal laws, \n     regulations and policies, diplomatic agreements, and other \n     appropriate mechanisms to--\n       (A) identify global conservation goals that help ensure the \n     sustainable use of natural resources and protect biological \n     diversity in terrestrial and marine environments of \n     developing countries;\n       (B) focus international conservation efforts on natural \n     areas that are important biodiversity conservation priorities \n     and for which there is a good likelihood of success;\n       (C) raise the international profile of the debate by \n     putting the issue of rapidly declining global biodiversity \n     and poor natural resource management on the agenda of major \n     international decision-making bodies;\n       (D) work with other donor nations to increase funding and \n     other support for global conservation strategies that focus \n     on achieving each of the goals identified in subparagraphs \n     (A) through (C); and\n       (E) achieve meaningful progress in the next 5 years toward \n     the goals identified in subparagraphs (A) through (C);\n       (2) the United States should use diplomatic mechanisms, \n     relevant international institutions and agreements, and other \n     appropriate mechanisms to lead other nations toward the\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\n     goals and actions identified in paragraph (1); and\n       (3) the efforts of Federal agencies should reflect a \n     recognition of the extreme urgency of the problem and \n     recognize that opportunities for increased conservation are \n     rapidly dwindling, by annually providing to the appropriate \n     Committees of Congress progress reports and action plans with \n     regard to the goals and activities identified in paragraphs \n     (1) and (2).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the evidence is clear. We stand at the \nbrink of major losses among the living species on our planet. By the \nend of this century, as many as two out of every three plant and animal \nspecies could be in danger of extinction. This disturbing trend has \nmany causes, but several are clear and manmade--they are our \nresponsibility and they are within our control.\n  Our industrial emissions are changing our world's climate and, in so \ndoing, drastically altering habitats--habitats already threatened by \ndeforestation and other landuse changes. Unsustainable fishing and the \nspread of invasive species due to enhanced global commerce pose similar \nmanmade challenges.\n  That is why I am introducing, along with Senators Snowe, Boxer, \nLugar, Kerry, Specter, Menendez, Brownback, Bayh, Stabenow, and \nFeingold, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the \nUnited States should take a leadership role in protecting international \nbiodiversity. With one out of every ten species facing extinction, with \nhabitats declining, and with developing countries searching to build a \nbetter economic future while protecting their natural environments, now \nis the time for renewed efforts to protect our living world.\n  This morning, my colleagues and I hosted a briefing by Dr. Edward O. \nWilson, renowned University Research Professor Emeritus at Harvard and \nauthor of two Pulitzer Prize-winning books, and Dr. Eric Chivian, who \nshared the Nobel Peace Prize and is Founder and Director of the Center \nfor Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. These \ntwo eminent scientists made the case that biodiversity is not just a \nmoral, ecological, and economic issue, but also one of major importance \nto human health.\n  We often find, Mr. President, that the areas most in danger are in \ndeveloping nations, which have the least ability to protect them. \nDeveloping nations face very real economic and human challenges. Many \nare struggling to provide enough food for their people, especially \ngiven the recent rise in food prices. They now face the choice between \nfeeding their people and preserving their environment. We know how that \nwill turn out. We must give them another choice.\n  To do that, the United States and other wealthy nations must help. \nThe 10 colleagues with whom I worked on this resolution understand that \nprotecting our global biodiversity is actually in our own national \ninterest. Sustainable agricultural practices promise sustainable \neconomies in the developing world. A stable climate will reduce the \nthreat of water shortages, shifting growing seasons, population \nmovements, and resource wars. Protecting habitats not only protects the \nrich diversity of life on earth--protecting habitats will preserve some \nof the most basic building blocks of our economies and societies.\n  Not least, as Dr. Wilson and Dr. Chivian so persuasively argue, the \npreservation of biodiversity is an investment in human health. More \nthan a quarter of the world's medicinal drugs possess active \ningredients from wild species, and more than half of the most \nprescribed medicines in the United States are based on natural \ncompounds. If we hope to advance medicine, to ease pain and suffering \nand to extend lifespans, the bounty of nature offers an indispensable \nguide and resource.\n  Finally, we have a moral obligation to protect biodiversity. Ensuring \nthat we can feed and clothe and shelter millions more people while \npreserving the elaborate tapestry of creation will allow our children \nand grandchildren to inherit the rich planet that we were bequeathed. \nSpecies extinctions are nothing new. But species extinctions that are \navoidable, that are within our power to prevent, extinctions due to our \ngreed, or our ignorance, impose on us a special responsibility. Those \nare mistakes that can never be undone. We must resolve to do all we can \nto replace greed with a better calculation of our long-term interests. \nWe must resolve to replace ignorance with knowledge and with wisdom.\n  That is why my colleagues and I are offering the resolution, to \nexpress the will of the Senate to redouble United States efforts \ninternationally to protect our world in all its complexity, and \ndiversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 599--EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE TO \nTHOSE AFFECTED BY THE TRAGIC EVENTS FOLLOWING THE TORNADO THAT HIT THE \n   LITTLE SIOUX SCOUT RANCH IN LITTLE SIOUX, IOWA, ON JUNE 11, 2008.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \nGrassley) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 600\n\n       Whereas 44 years ago, on June 21, 1964, Andrew Goodman, \n     James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner were murdered in \n     Philadelphia, Mississippi, while working in the name of \n     American democracy to register voters and secure civil rights \n     during the summer of 1964, which has become known as \n     ``Freedom Summer'';\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman was a 20-year-old White anthropology \n     major at New York's Queens College, who volunteered for the \n     ``Freedom Summer'' project;\n       Whereas James Chaney, from Meridian, Mississippi, was a 21-\n     year-old African-American civil rights activist who joined \n     the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1963 to work on \n     voter education and registration;\n       Whereas Michael ``Mickey'' Schwerner, from Brooklyn, New \n     York, was a 24-year-old White CORE field secretary in \n     Mississippi and a veteran of the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas in 1964, Mississippi had a Black voting-age \n     population of 450,000, but only 16,000 Blacks were registered \n     to vote;\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\n       Whereas most Black voters were disenfranchised by law or \n     practice in Mississippi;\n       Whereas in 1964, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael \n     Schwerner volunteered to work as part of the ``Freedom \n     Summer'' project that involved several civil rights \n     organizations, including the Mississippi State chapter of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \n     the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student \n     Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and CORE, with the purpose \n     of registering Black voters in Mississippi;\n       Whereas on the morning of June 21, 1964, the 3 men left the \n     CORE office in Meridian and set out for Longdale, \n     Mississippi, where they were to investigate the recent \n     burning of the Mount Zion Methodist Church, a Black church \n     that had been functioning as a Freedom School for education \n     and voter registration;\n       Whereas on their way back to Meridian, James Chaney, Andrew \n     Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were detained and later \n     arrested and taken to the Philadelphia, Mississippi, jail;\n       Whereas later that same evening, on June 21, 1964, they \n     were taken from the jail, turned over to the Ku Klux Klan, \n     and beaten, shot, and killed;\n       Whereas 2 days later, their burnt, charred, and gutted blue \n     Ford station wagon was pulled from the Bogue Chitto Creek, \n     just outside Philadelphia, Mississippi;\n       Whereas the national uproar caused by the disappearance of \n     the civil rights workers led President Lyndon B. Johnson to \n     order Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to send 200 active \n     duty Navy sailors to search the swamps and fields in the area \n     for the bodies of the 3 civil rights workers, and Attorney \n     General Robert F. Kennedy to order his Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) director, J. Edgar Hoover, to send 150 \n     agents to Mississippi to work on the case;\n       Whereas the FBI investigation led to the discovery of the \n     bodies of several other African-Americans from Mississippi, \n     whose disappearances over the previous several years had not \n     attracted attention outside their local communities;\n       Whereas the bodies of Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and \n     Michael Schwerner, beaten and shot, were found on August 4, \n     1964, buried under a mound of dirt;\n       Whereas on December 4, 1964, 21 White Mississippians from \n     Philadelphia, Mississippi, including the sheriff and his \n     deputy, were arrested, and the Department of Justice charged \n     them with conspiring to deprive Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, \n     and Michael Schwerner of their civil rights, since murder was \n     not a Federal crime;\n       Whereas on December 10, 1964, the same day Dr. Martin \n     Luther King, Jr. received the Nobel Peace Prize, a United \n     States District judge dismissed charges against the 21 men \n     accused of depriving the 3 civil right workers of their civil \n     rights by murder;\n       Whereas in 1967, after an appeal to the Supreme Court and \n     new testimony, 7 individuals were found guilty, but 2 of the \n     defendants, including Edgar Ray Killen, who had been strongly \n     implicated in the murders by witnesses, were acquitted \n     because the jury came to a deadlock on their charges;\n       Whereas on January 6, 2005, a Neshoba County, Mississippi, \n     grand jury indicted Edgar Ray Killen on 3 counts of murder;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2005, a jury convicted Edgar Ray Killen \n     on 3 counts of manslaughter;\n       Whereas June 21, 2008, was the 44th anniversary of Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner's ultimate \n     sacrifice;\n       Whereas by the end of ``Freedom Summer'', volunteers, \n     including Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael \n     Schwerner, helped register 17,000 African-Americans to vote;\n       Whereas the national uproar in response to the deaths of \n     these brave men helped create the necessary climate to bring \n     about passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner \n     worked for freedom, democracy, and equal justice under the \n     law for all; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government should find an appropriate \n     way to honor these courageous young men and their \n     contributions to civil rights and voting rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) encourages all Americans to pause and remember Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner and the 44th \n     anniversary of their deaths;\n       (2) commemorates the life and work of Andrew Goodman, James \n     Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and all of the other brave \n     Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of \n     civil rights and voting rights for all Americans; and\n       (3) commemorates and acknowledges the legacy of the brave \n     Americans who participated in the civil rights movement and \n     the role that they played in changing the hearts and minds of \n     Americans and creating the political climate necessary to \n     pass legislation to expand civil rights and voting rights for \n     all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6026-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6026-S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5030.

I would \nlike also to recognize the bravery and dedication of all the other \nscouts affected by this tragedy and of the emergency crews who \nresponded.\n  All of these remarkable young people had already established \nthemselves as leaders in their community. The loss of four of them is a \ntragedy for Iowa and Nebraska.\n  I would like in particular to express my condolences to the four \nfamilies who have suffered such a devastating loss. My thoughts and \nprayers are with them at this difficult time.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is an organization that never fails to \nexceed expectations. All the Scouts at Little Sioux Ranch that day kept \ntheir courage when all about them was chaos. Many of those who survived \nsuffered considerable injuries. As the storm passed, the Boy Scouts \nimmediately began to administer first aid to the injured and set to \nwork to clear the roads, allowing the emergency crews to move in. In \ntheir bravery and resourcefulness, they did honor to Boy Scouts \nthroughout the country. We are proud of them and humbled by their \nservice.\n  I am saddened that we must be here today at all offering this \nresolution, but I am honored to pay tribute to these young leaders, and \nI extend my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this tragedy.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 3221, the \nHousing reform legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, I express my gratitude to all the Members of this body. We \nbegan proceedings on the motion to invoke cloture earlier today, which \npassed by a vote of 83 to 9, another overwhelming vote in support of \nmoving to the housing bill.\n  Regretfully, we were not able to deal with many amendments today \nbecause there was at least one objection to proceeding to the matter, \npending the outcome of an extraneous matter that had little, if \nanything, to do with housing, regretfully--despite the strong \nbipartisan vote this morning--once again demonstrating that in this \nbody one Senator can disrupt the efforts to achieve a larger result. \nCertainly, that is the Senator's right, and nothing was done illegally \nor unlawfully. It just dramatizes the difficulty in achieving even \nsomething as important as the housing legislation we are working on.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't observe that the Senator from Ohio, the \noccupant of the chair, is a worthwhile member of that committee. I am \ngrateful to him and the other members of the committee for their work \nover the last year and a half since the majority began that work. We \nhave had some 50 hearings on that committee. We adopted some 17 or 18 \npieces of legislation out of the committee--maybe more--more than half \nof which have become the law of the land. A number of others, of \ncourse, have passed the Senate, or passed on out of committee, and we \nhave not been able to resolve all of them.\n  No matter is as significant and as important as the housing reform \nlegislation--to stop the hemorrhaging that is occurring, with more than \n8,400 people a day filing for foreclosure in our country. People find \nthose numbers alarming, and it is intended to be so, because it is \nlarge. Our efforts here are to try to keep people in their homes, and \nfinding a floor, if we can, to this housing problem that continues to \ncascade downward will be a challenge for all of us.\n  Our legislation takes a major step in the direction of dealing with \nthat, along with the reform of the government-sponsored enterprises \nand, of course, the permanent affordable housing program, not to \nmention the efforts we have made in community development block grants, \ncounseling services, mortgage revenue bonds, and tax relief for those \nwho wish to acquire a foreclosed property--all part of a larger piece \nof legislation to deal with the housing crisis. I am hopeful and \nconfident we will get to it. It will take a little bit longer as a \nresult of the objections some are raising.\n  This evening I rise to talk about another matter, which will be the \nsubject of a debate, whether it is in the next few days or weeks. It is \na subject matter which I care deeply and passionately about. It \ninvolves the rule of law, the Constitution of the United States, and \nthe very basic principle that we are a nation of laws, not men; that \neven those in the most lofty of positions in our Government are not \nabove the law; that individuals, corporations, and companies have an \nobligation to respect that law, and those of us charged with guarding \nit in an institution such as the Senate have an obligation to defend it \nand to remind ourselves and the country when there are efforts to \nundermine that rule of law.\n  As I did in December of last year, when the matter first came up, and \nagain in February, when the effort came back to the Senate to change \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and particularly to grant \nretroactive immunity to a handful of telecom companies, which, over the \npast number of years, have gathered up information and private \ninformation of individual citizens in this country, which may have been \nthe single largest breach or personal invasion in the history of our \ncountry, the issue of whether that was done legally ought to be \ndetermined by the courts of our country.\n  The bill that will come before us grants retroactive immunity without \never considering what happened, how it happened, who was responsible, \nwhy it was done, and why was no effort made to go before the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Courts--the FISA courts--which have been in \nexistence since the 1970s. All of those are important questions the \nAmerican people deserve an answer to. Was the rule of law violated? \nWere there individuals who insisted that this invasion of privacy occur \nin this country? I don't think it is asking too much to want to get to \nthe bottom of that. Americans, regardless of ideology or party \npersuasion, ought to be jointly offended when there is an effort here \nto grant retroactive immunity without determining what happened and why \nthese events were allowed to go forward.\n  This evening I am going to take the time allowed to me under the \nrules of the Senate because we are in a postcloture environment. I am \nlimited to the amount of time I am permitted to talk under the rules of \nthe Senate. But I can do this because of the generosity of Senator Jack \nReed of Rhode Island, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, and the \nwillingness of the majority leader, to give me the maximum time allowed \nto talk about this FISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. I will speak about why I am so deeply concerned about it, and what \nI think the precedent-setting nature of this could mean for our \ncountry.\n  There are moments such as this when we are asked to do something \nbecause, we are told, if we don't, we will jeopardize our Nation. \nDuring such times, we have historically made some of the worst mistakes \nin our history. One only needs to go back to the period of World War II \nwhen, because of the fears people had, we incarcerated a lot of very \ngood Americans of Japanese descent, because those who engaged in the \nfear mongering were able to convince even the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States--a majority--to allow for the virtual incarceration of \nliterally thousands of human beings. We know now, today, what a great \nmistake that was, and how courageous it was that people like Robert \nJackson, a Supreme Court Justice, a former Attorney General under \nFranklin Roosevelt, a solicitor general, chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, \none of the sole voices on the Court who objected to that effort to \nrequire these American citizens to be deprived of their homes, personal \nbelongings, and the virtual incarceration in camps in the western part \nof the country. Today, we know what a mistake that was. But because we \nacted out of fear, we made a dreadful error.\n\n  My concern about this FISA bill, while not of that magnitude at this\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\npoint, is that we are about to make another great error because of \nfear, because we fail to understand that balancing legitimate interests \nof our security and our rights ought not to be compromised. That is \nwhat the FISA courts were created to do--to balance rights and fears \nover legitimate concerns about our security being jeopardized.\n  So I rise once again to voice my strong opposition to the misguided \nFISA legislation before us, as it will come in the next day or so. I \nhave strong reservations about the so-called improvements made to title \nI of the legislation. But more than that, this legislation includes \nprovisions that would grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications \ncompanies that apparently have violated the privacy and the trust of \nmillions of our fellow citizens by participating in the President's \nwarrantless wiretapping program. If we pass this legislation, the \nSenate will ratify a domestic spying regime that has already \nconcentrated far too much unaccountable power in the President's hands \nand will place the telecommunications companies above the law.\n  I am here this evening to implore my colleagues to vote against \ncloture when that vote occurs, as it will sometime in the next 24 to 48 \nhours.\n  Let me make it clear at the outset of the debate that this is not \nabout domestic surveillance itself. We all recognize, here and \nelsewhere, the importance of domestic surveillance in an age of \nunprecedented threats. This is about illegal, unwarranted, unchecked \ndomestic surveillance. The difference between surveillance that is \nlawful, warranted, and that which is not, is everything.\n  I had hoped I would not have to return to this floor again under \nthese circumstances. I hoped, in truth, that in these negotiations that \nwent on over the past number of weeks and months we would have been \nable to turn aside retroactive immunity on the grounds that it is bad \npolicy and sets a terrible precedent.\n  As all of my colleagues know, I have long fought against retroactive \nimmunity, because I believe it is simply an abandonment of the rule of \nlaw. I have fought this with everything I have in me, and I have not \nwaged this fight alone.\n  In December, I opposed retroactive immunity on the floor of this \nbody. I spent 10 hours on this floor then. In January and February, I \ncame to the floor time and time again to discuss the dangers of \ngranting retroactive immunity, along with my colleague and friend, Russ \nFeingold of Wisconsin, who has shown remarkable leadership on this \nissue. I offered an amendment that would have stripped retroactive \nimmunity from the Senate bill. Unfortunately, our amendment failed and, \nto my extreme disappointment, the Senate adopted the underlying bill.\n  Since passage of the Senate bill, there have been extensive \nnegotiations on how to move forward. Today we are being asked to pass \nthe so-called compromise that was reached by some of our colleagues and \napproved by the other body, the House of Representatives.\n  I am here this evening to say I will not and can not support this \nlegislation. This legislation goes against everything I have stood \nfor--everything this body ought to stand for, in my view.\n  There is no question some improvements have been made over the \nprevious versions of this legislation. Title I, which regulates the \nability of Government to conduct electronic surveillance, has been \nimproved, albeit modestly. I congratulate those who were involved with \nit. I say, very quickly, that it is my hope a new Congress and a new \nPresident will work together to fix the problems with title I should \nthe Senate adopt this new legislation.\n  But in no way is this compromise acceptable. This legislation before \nus purports to give the courts more of a role in determining the \nlegality of the telecommunications companies' actions. But in my view \nthe title II provisions do little more than ensure without a doubt that \nthe telecommunications companies will be granted retroactive immunity.\n  Allow me to quote the Senate Intelligence Committee report on this \nmatter. It reads as follows:\n\n       [B]eginning soon after September 11, 2001, the Executive \n     branch provided written requests or directives to U.S. \n     electronic communications service providers to obtain their \n     assistance with communications intelligence activities that \n     had been authorized by the President.\n        . . . The letters were provided to electronic \n     communication service providers at regular intervals. All of \n     the letters stated that the activities had been authorized by \n     the President. All of the letters also stated that the \n     activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney \n     General [of the United States], except for one letter that \n     covered a period of less than 60 days. That letter, which \n     like all the others, stated that the activities had been \n     authorized by the President, stated that the activities had \n     been determined to be lawful by the Counsel to the President.\n\n  This is all from the Intelligence Committee report.\n  Under the legislation before us, the district court would simply \ndecide whether the telecommunication companies received documentation \nstating the President authorized the program and that there had been \nsome sort of determination it was legal. But as the Intelligence \nCommittee has already made clear, we already know this happened. We \nalready know the companies received some form of documentation with \nsome sort of legal determination.\n  But that is not the question. The question is not whether these \ncompanies received a document from the White House. The question is, \nWere their actions legal? Were they above the law or not?\n  It is a rather straightforward, surprisingly uncomplicated question. \nThe documentation exists. Was it legal or not? Either the companies \nwere presented with a warrant or they were not. Either the companies \nand the President acted outside the rule of law or they followed it. \nEither the underlying program was legal or it was not--not a \ncomplicated question. Was it legal or wasn't it?\n  The suggestion that they had documentation is then supposed to be a \njustification for the legality of it is not for us to decide. That is a \nmatter for the courts, the coequal branch of Government called the \njudiciary. We are asked to determine that this was legal because \ndocuments were sent, not because some adjudication as to whether there \nhad been a legal basis for these documents. Yet we are told that with \nthe adoption of this legislation, accept it as a conclusion and move \non. I don't believe we ought to do that. I believe it is a mistake and \na mistake of significance.\n  Because of this legislation, none of the questions will be answered. \nBecause of the so-called compromise, the judge's hands will be tied and \nthe outcome of these cases will be predetermined by our votes. Because \nof this so-called compromise, retroactive immunity will be granted and, \nas they say, that will be that. Case closed.\n  No court will rule on the legality of the telecommunications \ncompanies' activities in participating in the President's warrantless \nwiretapping program. None of our fellow Americans will have their day \nin court. What they will have is a Government that has sanctioned \nlawlessness, at least as far as we know.\n  I refuse to accept that argument. I refuse to accept the argument \nthat because the situation is too delicate, too complicated, this body \nis simply going to go ahead while sanctioning lawlessness. I think we \ncan do better than that. I think we have an obligation to do better \nthan that.\n  If I have needed any reminder of that fact, simply look to those who \nhave joined this fight--my colleagues and the many Americans who have \ngiven me an awful lot of support and strength for this fight, strength \nthat comes from the passion and eloquence of citizens who don't have to \nbe involved but choose to be involved.\n  They see what I see in this debate--that by short-circuiting the \njudicial process, we are sending a dangerous signal to future \ngenerations. They see us as establishing a precedent that Congress can \nand will provide immunity to potential lawbreakers if they are \nimportant enough.\n  Some may be asking: Why is retroactive immunity too dangerous? What \nis the issue? Why should you care at all? Allow me to explain by \nproviding, if I can, a bit of context. I remind my colleagues what I \nsaid about the bill months ago because the argument against providing \nretroactive immunity remains unchanged. Nothing has changed since last \nDecember, January or February.\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n  Unwarranted domestic spying did not happen in a panic or short-term \nemergency, not for a week, a month or even for a year. If it had, quite \ncandidly, I would not be standing here this evening. I understand, in \nthe wake of 9/11, there were actions taken because of the legitimate \nfears we had, given the circumstances of that attack, that some actions \nsuch as this for a week, a month, a year, I think I would have accepted \nas normal, understandable behavior as a government overreacting in \nhaste and in the emotions of the moment. But that is not the case. We \nnow know this spying by the administration went on relentlessly for \nmore than 5 years.\n  I might not be here as well if it had been the first offense of a new \nadministration. Maybe not if it had been the second or third. Again, \nunderstanding mistakes can be made. No one is perfect. Again, in the \nhaste of the moment, the emotions, these things can happen. But that is \nnot the case either.\n  Indeed, I am here tonight because with one offense after another \nafter another, I believe it is long past time to say enough is enough. \nI am here this evening because of a pattern--a pattern of abuse against \ncivil liberties and the rule of law, against the Constitution of the \nUnited States, of which we are custodians, temporary though that status \nmay be.\n  I would add that had these abuses been committed by a President of my \nown party, I would have opposed them as strongly as I am this evening. \nI am here this evening because warrantless wiretapping is merely the \nlatest link in a long chain of abuses.\n  So why are we here? Because it is alleged that giant telecom \ncorporations worked with our Government to compile Americans' private, \ndomestic communications records into a database of enormous scale and \nscope.\n  Secretly, and without warrant, these corporations are alleged to have \nspied on their own customers, the American people. Here is only one of \nthe most egregious examples, according to the Electronic Frontier \nFoundation:\n\n       Clear, first-hand whistleblower documentary evidence \n     [states] . . . that for year on end, every e-mail, every text \n     message, every phone call carried over the massive fiber-\n     optic links of 16 separate companies routed through AT's \n     Internet hub in San Francisco--hundreds of millions of \n     private, domestic communications--have been . . . copied in \n     their entirety by AT and knowingly diverted wholesale by \n     means of multiple ``splitters'' into a secret room controlled \n     exclusively by the NSA.\n\n  The phone calls and the Internet traffic of millions of Americans \ndiverted into a secret room controlled by the National Security Agency. \nThat allegation still needs to be proven in a court of law. But it \nclearly needs to be determined in a court of law and not by a vote in \nthe Senate.\n  I suppose if you only see cables and computers there, the whole thing \nseems almost harmless, certainly nothing to get worked up about; one \nmight say a routine security sweep and a routine piece of legislation \nblessing it.\n  If that is all you imagine happened in the NSA secret room, I imagine \nyou will vote for immunity. I imagine you would not see much harm in \nvoting to allow the practice to continue either.\n  But if you see a vast dragnet for millions of Americans' private \nconversations conducted by a government agency that acted without a \nwarrant, acted without the rule of law, then I believe you recognize \nwhat is at stake. You see that what is at stake is the sanctity of the \nlaw and the sanctity of our privacy. And you will probably come to a \nvery different conclusion.\n  Maybe that sounds overdramatic to some. Perhaps they will ask: What \ndoes it matter at the end of the day if a few corporations are not \nsued? These people sue each other all the time.\n  Others may say: This seems a small issue. Maybe the administration \nwent too far, but this seems like an isolated case.\n  Indeed, as long as this case seems isolated and technical, then those \nwho are supporting this will win. As long as it appears to be about \nanother lawsuit buried in our legal system and nothing more, then they \nwill win as well. The administration is counting on the American people \nto see nothing bigger than that--nothing to see here.\n  But there is plenty to see here, and it is so much more than a few \nphone calls, a few companies, and a few lawsuits. What is at stake is \nnothing less than equal justice--justice that makes no exceptions. What \nis at stake is an open debate on security and liberty and an end to \nwarrantless, groundless spying.\n  The bill does not say trust the American people, trust the courts and \njudges and juries to come to a just decision. Retroactive immunity \nsends a message that is crystal clear: Trust me. And that message comes \nstraight from the mouth of an American President: Trust me.\n  What is the basis of that trust? Classified documents, we are told, \nthat prove the case for retroactive immunity beyond a shadow of a \ndoubt. But we are not allowed to see them, of course. I have served in \nthis body for 27 years, and I am not allowed to see them. Neither are a \nmajority of my colleagues. We are all left in the dark.\n  I cannot speak for my colleagues, but I would never take the ``trust \nme'' for an answer, not even in the best of times, not even from a \nPresident on Mount Rushmore. I cannot put it better than this:\n\n       ``Trust me'' government is government that asks that we \n     concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man; that we trust \n     him to do what's best for us. My view of government places \n     trust not in one person or one party, but in those values \n     that transcend persons and parties.\n\n  Those words are not spoken by someone who took our national security \nlightly. They were spoken by Ronald Reagan in 1980. They are every bit \nas true today. President Reagan's words--let me repeat them:\n\n       ``Trust me'' government is government that asks that we \n     concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man; that we trust \n     him to do what is best for us. My view of government places \n     trust not in one person or one party, but in those values \n     that transcend persons and parties.\n\n  Those words of Ronald Reagan, 28 years ago, were right and those \nwords are right today in the year 2008. They are every bit as true \ntoday, even if times of threat and fear blur our concept of \ntranscendent values, even if those who would exploit those times urge \nus to save our skins at any cost.\n  But again, why should any of us care, I suppose. The rule of law has \nrarely been in such a fragile state. Rarely has it seemed less \ncompelling. What, after all, does the law give us, anyway? It has no \nparades, no slogans. It does not live in books or precedents. We are \nnever failed to be reminded the world is a very dangerous place.\n  Indeed, that is precisely the advantage seized upon, not just by this \nadministration but in all times, by those looking to disregard the rule \nof law. Listen to the words of James Madison, the father of our \nConstitution, words that he said more than two centuries ago:\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  With the passage of this bill, the words of James Madison will be one \nstep closer to coming true. So it has never been more essential that we \nlend our voices to the law and speak on its behalf.\n  What is this about? It is about answering the fundamental question: \nDo we support the rule of law or the rule of men? To me, this is our \ndefining question as a nation and may be the defining question that \nconfronts every generation, as it has throughout our history.\n  This is about far more than a few telecoms. It is about contempt for \nthe law, large and small.\n  I have said that warrantless wiretapping is but the latest link in a \nlong chain of abuses when it comes to the rule of law. This is about \nthe Justice Department turning our Nation's highest law enforcement \noffices into patronage plums, turning the impartial work of indictments \nand trials into the pernicious machinations of politics. Contempt for \nthe rule of law once again.\n  This is about Alberto Gonzales, the Nation's now-departed Attorney \nGeneral, coming before Congress to give us testimony that was, at best \nwrong and at worst, outright perjury. Contempt for the rule of law by \nthe Nation's foremost enforcer of the law.\n  This is about a Congress handing the President the power to designate \nany individual he wants as an unlawful enemy combatant, hold that \nindividual indefinitely, take away his or her right to habeas corpus, \nthe 700-year-old right to challenge anyone's detention.\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n  If you think the Military Commissions Act struck at the heart of the \nConstitution, you would be understating this. It did a pretty good job \non the Magna Carta while it was at it.\n  If you think this only threatens a few of us, you should understand \nthat the writ of habeas corpus belongs to all of us. It allows anyone \nto challenge their detention.\n  Rolling back habeas corpus endangers us all. Without a day in court, \nhow can you prove you are entitled to a trial? How can you prove you \nare innocent? In fact, without a day in court, how can you let anyone \nknow you have been detained at all?\n  Thankfully, and to their great credit, the Supreme Court recently \nrebuked the President's lawlessness and ruled that detainees do have \nthe right to challenge their detention.\n  Mr. President, the Military Commissions Act also gave President Bush \nthe power some say he wanted most of all: the power to get information \nout of suspected terrorists by virtually any means, the power to use \nevidence gained from torture.\n  I don't think you could hold the rule of law in any greater contempt \nthan sanctioning torture. Because of decisions made by the highest \nlevels of our Government, America is making itself known to the world, \nunfortunately, for torture, with stories like this one:\n  A prisoner at Guantanamo--to take one example out of hundreds--was \ndeprived of sleep for over 55 days, a month and 3 weeks. Some nights, \nhe was doused with water or blasted with air-conditioning. After week \nafter week of this delirious, shivering wakefulness, on the verge of \ndeath from hypothermia, doctors strapped him to a chair--doctors, \nhealers who took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm--pumped him full of \nthree bags of medical saline, brought him back from death, and sent him \nback to his interrogators.\n  To the generation coming of age around the world in this decade, that \nis America--not Normandy, not the Marshall Plan, not Nuremberg, but \nGuantanamo. Think about it.\n  We have legal analysts so vaguely defining torture, so willfully \nblurring the lines during interrogations that we have CIA \ncounterterrorism lawyers saying things like, ``If the detainee dies, \nyou're doing it wrong.'' We have the CIA destroying tapes containing \nthe evidence of harsh interrogations--about the administration covering \nits tracks in a way more suited to a banana republic than to the home \nof great freedoms. We have an administration actually defending \nwaterboarding, a technique invented by the Spanish Inquisition, \nperfected by the Khmer Rouge, and in between originally banned for \nexcessive brutality--listen to this--by the Gestapo.\n  Still, some way waterboarding is not torture. Oh, really? Listen to \nthe words of Malcolm Nance, a 26-year-old expert in intelligence and \ncounterterrorism, a combat veteran, and former chief of training at the \nU.S. Navy Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School. While \ntraining American soldiers to resist interrogation, he writes:\n\n       I have personally led, witnessed, and supervised \n     waterboarding of hundreds of people. Unless you have been \n     strapped down to the board, have endured the agonizing \n     feeling of water overpowering your gag reflex, and then feel \n     your throat open and allow pint after pint of water to \n     involuntarily fill your lungs, you will not know the meaning \n     of the word. It does not simulate drowning, as the lungs are \n     actually filling with water. The victim is drowning. How much \n     the victim is to drown depends on the desired result and the \n     obstinacy of the subject. Waterboarding is slow motion \n     suffocation. Usually the person goes into hysterics on the \n     board. When done right it is controlled death.\n\n  That is from a soldier, a combat veteran, testifying about what \nwaterboarding was about--controlled death. That is not torture? Not \naccording to President Bush's White House. They have said waterboarding \nis legal and that if it chooses, America will waterboard again.\n  Surely, then, our new Attorney General would condemn torture. Surely \nthe Nation's highest law enforcement officer in the land, coming after \nAlberto Gonzales's chaotic tenure, would never come before the Congress \nand defend the President's power to openly break the law. Well, think \nagain.\n  When he came to the Senate for his confirmation, Michael Mukasey was \nasked a simple question, bluntly and plainly: Is waterboarding \nconstitutional? He replied: ``If waterboarding is torture, torture is \nnot constitutional.''\n  One would hope for a little more insight from someone so famously \nwell versed in national security law, but Mr. Mukasey pressed on with \nthe obstinacy of a witness pleading the fifth: ``If it's torture, if it \namounts to torture, it is not constitutional,'' he said. And that is \nthe best this noted jurist, this legal scholar, longtime judge, an \nexpert on national security law had to offer on the defining moral \nissue of this Presidency. Claims of ignorance. Word games.\n  Now-Attorney General Mukasey was asked the easiest question we have \nin a democracy: Can the President of the United States openly break the \nlaw? Can he, as we know he has already done, order warrantless \nwiretapping, ignore the will of Congress, and then hide behind nebulous \npowers he claims to find in the Constitution? The response of the \nnominee to become Attorney General: The President has ``the authority \nto defend the country.'' In one swoop, the Attorney General conceded to \nthe President nearly unlimited power, just as long as he finds a lawyer \nwilling to stuff his actions into the boundless rubric of ``defending \nthe country''--unlimited power to defend the Nation, to protect us as \none man sees fit, even if that means listening to our phone calls \nwithout a warrant, even if it means holding some of us indefinitely. \nThat is contempt for the rule of law.\n  So this is very much about torture--about enhanced interrogation \nmeasures and waterboarding. It is also about extraordinary rendition--\noutsourced torture of men this administration would prefer we didn't \neven know exist.\n  But now we do know. One was a Syrian immigrant raising his family in \nCanada. He wrote computer code for a company called MathWorks and was \nplanning to start his own tech business. On a trip through New York's \nJFK Airport, he was arrested by U.S. federal agents. They shackled him \nand bundled him onto a private CIA plane and flew him across the \nAtlantic Ocean to Syria. This man spent the next 10 months and 10 days \nin a Syrian prison. His cell was 3 feet wide--the size of a grave. Some \n300 days passed alone in that cell, with a bowl for his toilet, another \nbowl for his water, and the door only opened so he could wash himself \nonce a week--though it may have been more or less because the cell was \ndark and he lost all track of time. The door only opened for one \nreason: for interrogators who asked him again and again and again about \nal-Qaida.\n  Here is how it was described:\n\n       The interrogator said, ``Do you know what this is?'' I \n     said, ``Yes, it's a cable,'' and he told me, ``Open your \n     right hand.'' I opened my right hand, and he hit me like \n     crazy. It was so painful, and of course I started crying, and \n     then he told me to open my left hand, and I opened it, and he \n     missed, then hit my wrist. And then he asked me questions. If \n     he does not think you are telling the truth, then he hits you \n     again.\n\n  The jail and the torturers were Syrian, but America sent this man \nthere with full knowledge of what would happen to him because it was \npart of a longstanding secret program of ``extraordinary rendition,'' \nas it is called. America was convinced that he was a terrorist and \nwanted the truth beaten out of him.\n  No charges were ever filed against him. His adopted nation's \ngovernment, Canada, one of our strongest NATO allies, cleared him of \nall wrongdoing after a year-long official investigation and awarded him \nmore than $10 million in government compensation for his immense pain \nand suffering--but not before he was tortured 10 months, 10 days in a \n3-foot by 3-foot cell the size of a grave. Does his torture make us \nsafer? Did his suffering improve our security? Of course not.\n  I would note that our own Government has shamefully refused to even \nacknowledge that his case exists.\n  We know about a German citizen as well, living in the city of Ulm \nwith his wife and four children. On a bus trip through Eastern Europe, \nhe was pulled off at a border crossing by armed guards and held for 3 \nweeks in a hotel room, where he was beaten regularly. At the end of 3 \nweeks, he was drugged and shipped on a cargo plane to Kabul, \nAfghanistan. For 5 months, he was held in the Salt Pit--a secret \nAmerican prison staffed by Afghan guards. All he had to drink was \nstagnant water from a filthy bottle. Again and again,\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\nmasked men interrogated him about al-Qaida, and finally, he says, they \nraped him. He was released in May of 2004. Scientific testing confirmed \nhis story of malnourishment, and the Chancellor of Germany publicly \nacknowledge he was wrongly held. What was his crime? Having the same \nname as a suspected terrorist.\n\n  Again, our own Government has shamefully refused to even acknowledge \nthat this case exists.\n  So we do know, Mr. President. We know because there aren't enough \nwords in the world to cover all the facts.\n  If you would like to define torture out of existence, be my guest. If \nyou would rather use a Washington euphemism--``tough questioning,'' \n``enhanced interrogation''--feel free. Feel free to talk about \nfraternity hazing, as Rush Limbaugh did, or to use a favorite term of \nVice President Cheney's, ``a dunk in the water.'' You can call it \nwhatever you like. But when you are through, the facts will be waiting \nfor you: controlled death, outsourced torture, secret prisons, month-\nlong sleep deprivations, the President's personal power to hold \nwhomever he likes for as long as he likes. It is as if you had awakened \nin the middle of some Kafka-esque nightmare.\n  Have I gone wildly off topic, Mr. President? Have I brought up a \ndozen unrelated issues? I wish I had. I wish that none of these stories \nwere true. But we are deceiving ourselves when we talk about the U.S. \nattorneys issue, the habeas issue, the torture issue, the rendition \nissue, or the secrecy issue as if each were an isolated case, as if \neach were an accident. When we speak of them as isolated, we are \nkeeping our politics cripplingly small. And as long as we keep this \nsmall, the rule of men is winning.\n  There is only one issue here; that is, the rule of law, the law \nissue. Does the President of the United States serve the law or does \nthe law serve the President? Each insult to our Constitution comes from \nthe same source. Each springs from the same mindset. If we attack this \nconcept for the law at any point, we will wound it at all points.\n  That is why I am here this evening, Mr. President. Retroactive \nimmunity is on the table for discussion over these next several days, \nbut also at issue is the entire ideology that justifies it, the same \nideology that defends torture and executive lawlessness. Immunity is a \ndisgrace in itself, but it is far worse in what it represents. It tells \nus that some believe in the courts only so long as their verdict goes \ntheir way; that some only believe in the rule of law so long as \nexceptions are made at their desire. It puts secrecy above sunshine and \nfiat above the law.\n  Did the telecoms break the law? I don't know. I can't say so. But \npass immunity, and we will never know. A handful of favored \ncorporations will remain unchallenged. Their arguments will never be \nheard in a court of law. The truth behind this unprecedented domestic \nspying will never see the light of day, and the cases will be closed \nforever.\n  ``Law'' is a word we barely hear from the supporters of immunity. \nThey offer neither deliberation about America's difficult choices in \nthe age of terrorism nor a shared attempt to set for our times the \nexcruciating balance between security and liberty. They merely promise \na false debate on a false choice: security or liberty but never, ever \nboth.\n  I think differently, and I believe some of my colleagues do as well. \nI think America's founding truth is unambiguous: security and liberty, \none and inseparable and never one without the other, no matter how \ndifficult the situation, no matter what threats we face. Secure in that \ntruth, I offer a challenge to immunity supporters: You want to put a \nhandful of corporations above the law. Could you please explain how \nyour immunity makes any one of us any safer at all?\n  The truth is that a working balance between security and liberty has \nalready been struck. In fact, it has been settled for decades--for 30 \nyears, in fact. FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has \nprevented executive lawbreaking and protected Americans, and that \nbalance stands today.\n  In the wake of the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, the Senate \nconvened the Church Committee, a panel of distinguished former Members \nof this body determined to investigate executive abuses of power. Not \nsurprisingly, they found that when Congress and the courts substitute \n``trust me'' ideas for real oversight, massive lawbreaking can result. \nThe Church Committee found evidence of the U.S. Army spying on the \ncivilian population, Federal dossiers on citizens' political \nactivities, a CIA and FBI program that opened hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans' letters without warning or warrant. In sum, Americans had \nsustained a severe blow to their fourth amendment rights ``to be secure \nin their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures.'' At the same time, the Senators of the Church \nCommittee understood surveillance was needed to go forward to protect \nour people.\n  Surveillance itself is not the problem. Unchecked, unregulated, \nunwarranted surveillance was. What surveillance needed, in a word, was \nlegitimacy. And in America, the Founders understood power becomes \nlegitimate when it is shared. Congress and the courts check that \nattitude which so often crops up in the executive branch--``if the \nPresident does it, it is not illegal.''\n  The Church Committee's final report, ``Intelligence Activities and \nthe Rights of Americans,'' put the case very powerfully indeed.\n\n       The critical question before the committee was to determine \n     how the fundamental liberties of our people can be maintained \n     in the course of the government's efforts to also protect our \n     people. The delicate balance between these basic goals, two \n     absolutely essential goals of our system of government, is \n     often difficult to strike, and it is never perfect, but it \n     can, and must, be achieved.\n\n  A sense of balance between liberty and security, security and \nliberty.\n\n       We reject the view that the traditional principles of \n     justice and fair play have no place in our struggle against \n     the enemies of freedom. Moreover, our investigation has \n     established that the targets of intelligence activity have \n     ranged far beyond persons who could properly be characterized \n     as enemies of freedom.\n\n  The Church Committee went on:\n\n       We have seen segments of our government, in their attitudes \n     and actions, adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy, and \n     occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian \n     regimes. We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs \n     initiated with limited goals, such as preventing criminal \n     violence or identifying foreign spies, were expanded to what \n     witnesses characterized as ``vacuum cleaners,'' sweeping in \n     information about lawful activities of American citizens.\n\n  The Church committee Senators concluded:\n\n       Unless new and tighter controls are established by \n     legislation, domestic intelligence activities threaten to \n     undermine our domestic society and fundamentally alter its \n     nature.\n\n  What a strange echo from three decades ago we hear in those words. \nThey could have been written yesterday; could have been written \ntonight.\n  Three decades ago, our predecessors in this Chamber, Republicans and \nDemocrats, responding to an abuse of power, crafted a wonderfully \nbalanced idea between security and liberty. They did it in this very \nChamber, coming together. They understood that when domestic spying \ngoes too far it threatens to kill just what it promises to protect--an \nAmerica secure in her liberty. That lesson was crystal clear 30 years \nago. Why is it so clouded today?\n  Before we entertain the argument that everything has changed since \nthose words were written, remember: The men who wrote them had \nwitnessed a World War, the Cold War, had seen Nazi and Soviet spying, \nand they were living every day under the cloud of a nuclear holocaust. \nIt was indeed a dangerous time. Certainly, the argument that we have to \ntake extraordinary measures to protect ourselves against those who \nwould do us great injury--those were not easy times. Yet those \nRepublicans and Democrats, our predecessors in this Chamber, struck \nthat balance and reminded us that our security was important, but it \nneeded to be tempered and understood in the context of our freedoms and \nour liberties.\n  So I ask this: Who will chair the commission investigating the \nsecrets of warrantless spying years from today? Will it be a young \nSenator in the body today who maybe has just joined us in the last 2 \nyears? Will it be someone not yet elected? What will that Senator say \nwhen he or she comes\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nto our actions, maybe three decades from now, as I just quoted from a \nreport 30 years ago, which is so wonderfully written and captures \nexactly the essence of what I am arguing for this evening? What will \nthat Senator say when he or she reads about the actions of a Senate \nhere--reads in the records how we let outrage after outrage slide with \nnothing more than a promise to stop the next one? I imagine that \nSenator will ask of us: Why didn't they do anything? Why didn't they \nfight back? What happened between the 1970s and the year 2008, that two \nSenates in 30 years time could go from standing up for the rule of law \nand liberty in the face of executive abuses--what happened to that \nCongress that decided 30 years later that they would do just the \nopposite; in fact, retreat from that fight?\n  In June of 2008, when no one could doubt any more what this \nadministration was doing, why did they sit on their hands and do almost \nnothing? In fact, go further. Why did they grant immunity to companies \nthat had engaged in warrantless wiretapping?\n  Since the time of the Church Commission, the threats facing us have \nmultiplied and grown in complexity, but the lesson has been immutable: \nwarrantless spying threatens to undermine our democratic society unless \nlegislation brings it under control. In other words, the power to \ninvade privacy must be used sparingly, guarded jealously, and shared \nequally between the branches of our Government.\n  Or the case could be made pragmatically. As my friend, Harold Koh, \ndean of Yale Law School, recently argued:\n\n       The engagement of all three branches tends to yield not \n     just more thoughtful law but a more broadly supported public \n     policy.\n\n  Three decades ago, our predecessors in this Chamber embodied that \nsolution in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA law. \nFISA confirmed the President's power to conduct surveillance of \ninternational conversations involving anyone in the United States, \nprovided that the Federal FISA Court issued warrants ensuring that \nwiretapping was aimed at safeguarding our security and nothing else. \nThe President's own Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, \nexplained the rationale in an interview last summer:\n\n       The United States did not want to allow [the intelligence \n     community] to conduct . . . electronic surveillance of \n     Americans for foreign intelligence unless you had a warrant, \n     so that was required.\n\n  As originally written in 1978 and as amended numerous times, I might \nadd, FISA has accomplished its mission. It has been a valuable--\ninvaluable tool for conducting needed surveillance of those who would \ndo us great harm and those who would harm our country. Every time \nPresidents have come to Congress openly to ask for more leeway under \nFISA, our Congresses have worked with them. Congress has negotiated, \nand together Congress and the executive branch have struck a balance \nthat safeguards America while doing its utmost to protect our privacy.\n  Last summer, Congress made a technical correction to FISA enabling \nthe President to wiretap without a warrant conversations between two \nforeign targets, even if those conversations are routed through \nAmerican computers. For other reasons, I believed that this past \nsummer's legislation went too far, and I opposed it. But the point is \nthat Congress once again proved its willingness to work with the \nPresident on FISA.\n  Isn't that enough?\n  Just this past October and November, the Senate of the U.S. \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees worked with the President to \nfurther refine FISA and ensure that, in a true emergency, the FISA \nCourt would do nothing to slow down intelligence gathering.\n  Wasn't that enough?\n  And, as for the FISA Court, between 1978 and 2004, according to the \nWashington Post, the FISA Court approved--and listen to these numbers--\n18,748 warrants from 1978 to 2004--18,748 warrants. It rejected 5; \n18,748 warrants were approved; 5 were rejected between 1978 and 2004. \nThe FISA Court has sided with the executive branch 99.9 percent of the \ntime. Wouldn't you think that would be enough? Is anything lacking? \nHave we forgotten something here? Isn't all of this enough to keep us \nsafe? There were numerous amendments in 30 years to a piece of \nlegislation to strike the balance between security and liberty.\n\n  Of course, we all know the answer we have received. This complex, \nfinely tuned machinery, crafted over 3 decades by 3 branches of \nGovernment, 4 Presidents, and 12 Congresses, was ignored for 5 long \nyears. It was totally ignored. It was a system primed to bless nearly \nany eavesdropping a President could conceive of, and spying still \nhappened illegally--18,748 warrants approved from 1978 on; 5 were \nturned down. Yet this administration completely disregarded the FISA \nCourt in seeking the warrantless wiretapping by the telecom industry.\n  If the shock of that decision has yet to sink in, think of it this \nway: President Bush ignored not just a Federal court but a secret \nFederal court; not just a secret Federal court but a secret Federal \ncourt prepared to sign off on his actions 99.9 percent of the time. A \nmore compliant court has never been conceived. Yet still that wasn't \ngood enough.\n  I ask my colleagues of this body candidly, and candidly it already \nknows the answer: Is this about security or is it about power? Why are \nsome fighting so hard for retroactive immunity? The answer, I believe, \nis that immunity means secrecy, and secrecy means power. It is no \ncoincidence that the man who proclaimed ``if the President does it, it \nis not illegal''--Richard Nixon--was the same man who raised executive \nsecrecy to an art form. The Senators of the Church committee 30 years \nago--bipartisan, by the way--expressed succinctly the deep flaw in the \nNixonian executive: ``Abuse thrives on secrecy,'' they said, and in the \nexhaustive catalog of that report, they proved it.\n  In this push for immunity, secrecy, I believe, is at the center of \nit. We find proof in immunity's original version, a proposal to protect \nnot just the telecoms, but everyone involved in the wiretapping \nprogram. Remember that in the original proposal of what is before us \ntoday, or will be before us, that is what they wanted to immunize--\nthemselves. The administration asked that everyone be immunized. To \ntheir credit, the Intelligence Committee rejected that request, but it \nought to be instructive that the Bush administration requested total \nblanket immunity for everyone involved in that program.\n  What does that tell you about their intentions or their motivations? \nThink about it. It speaks to their fear and perhaps their guilt, their \nguilt that they have broken the law and their fear that in the years to \ncome they would be found liable or convicted.\n  They knew better than anyone else what they had done. They must have \nhad good reason to be concerned.\n  Thankfully, immunity for the Executive is not part of this bill, and, \nagain, I congratulate the committee. But don't ever forget it was asked \nfor. That will tell you something about motivations.\n  The original proposal tells us something very important, that this is \nand always has been a self preservation bill. Otherwise, why not have \nthe trial and get it over with? If the proponents of retroactive \nimmunity are right, that the documentation alone is all you need to \nprove legality, the corporations will win in a walk. After all, in the \nofficial telling, the telecoms were ordered in documents to help the \nPresident spy without a warrant, and they patriotically complied. We \nhave even heard on this floor the comparison between the telecom \ncorporations to the men and women laying their lives on the line in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  But ignore comparison which, frankly, I find deeply offensive. Ignore \nfor a moment the fact that in America we obey the laws, not the \nPresident's orders. Ignore that not even the President has the right to \nscare or bully you into breaking the law, though it seems that tactic \nhas proven surprisingly fruitful. Ignore that the telecoms were not \nunanimous. One of them, Qwest, wanted to see the legal basis for the \norder, never received it, and so refused to comply. Not everyone \ndecided that documentation alone was a legal justification for 5 years \nof vacuuming up the private information of American citizens.\n  Ignore that a judge presiding over the case ruled:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\n\n  Ignore all of that: If the order the telecoms received was legally \nbinding then they have a easy case to prove. The corporations only need \nto show a judge the authority and the assurances they were given and \nthey will be in and out of court in 5 minutes. If the telecoms are as \ndefensible as the President says, why doesn't the President let them \ndefend themselves? If the case is so easy to make, why doesn't he let \nthem make it?\n  It can't be that they are afraid of leaks. Our Federal court system \nhas dealt for decades with the most delicate national security matters, \nbuilding up an expertise in protecting classified information behind \nclosed doors, ex parte and in camera. We can expect no less in these \ncases. No intelligence sources need be compromised. No state secrets \nneed to be exposed. After litigation at both the district court and \ncircuit court levels, no state secrets have been exposed.\n  In fact, Federal district court judge Vaughn Walker--a Republican \nappointee, I might point out; the quotes are from him--has already \nruled that the issue can go to trial without putting state secrets in \njeopardy. Walker reasonably pointed out--Ronald Reagan's appointee to \nthe bench, I point out--the existence of the terrorist surveillance \nprogram is hardly a secret at all.\n\n       The Government has [already] disclosed the general contours \n     of the ``terrorist surveillance program,'' which requires the \n     assistance of a telecommunications provider.\n\n  As the state secrets privilege is invoked to stall these high-profile \ncases, it is useful to consider that privilege's history. In fact, the \nprivilege was tainted at its birth by a President of my own party, \nHarry Truman. In 1952, President Truman successfully invoked the new \nprivilege to prevent public exposure of a report on a plane crash that \nkilled three Air Force contractors. When the report was finally \ndeclassified, 50 years later I might add, decades after anyone in the \nTruman administration was within reach, it contained no state secrets \nat all, only facts about the repeated maintenance failures that would \nhave seriously embarrassed some important people. So the state secrets \nprivilege began its career, not to protect our Nation, but to protect \nsome powerful people.\n  In his opinion, Judge Walker argued, even when it is reasonably \ngrounded--let me quote him:\n\n       . . . the state secrets privilege still has its limits. \n     While the court recognizes and respects the executive's \n     constitutional duty to protect the nation from threats, the \n     court also takes seriously its constitutional duty to \n     adjudicate the disputes that come before it. To defer to a \n     blanket assertion of secrecy here would be to abdicate that \n     duty, particularly because the very subject matter of this \n     litigation has been so publicly aired.\n\n  Again, that is not some wild-eyed liberal judge drawing the \nconclusion in this case. That is a sober conservative judge who reminds \nus of the balance that is necessary; why there is a coequal branch \ncalled the judiciary, where that body, not elected representatives in a \nvoting Chamber, should determine the legality of this action taken by \nthese companies.\n  He went on to say--the judge's words:\n\n       The compromise between liberty and security remains a \n     difficult one. But dismissing this case at the outset would \n     sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security.\n\n  That is a judge reminding this body that to suggest somehow we grant \nblanket immunity to these companies is to dismiss this case at the \noutset, as he points out, sacrificing liberty with no apparent \nenhancement of our security.\n  And that ought to be the epitaph of this administration: \n``sacrificing liberty for no apparent enhancement of our security.'' \nWorse than selling our soul, we are giving it away for free.\n  It is equally wrong to claim that failing to grant this retroactive \nimmunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate with \nsurveillance in the future. Baloney. I do not believe it. The truth is, \nafter the 1970s, FISA has compelled telecommunications companies to \ncooperate with surveillance when it was warranted. What is more, it \nimmunizes them. It has done that for more than a quarter of a century. \nSo cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today, and \ndespite the claims of supporters of immunity, it never has been. \nCollusion in warrantless illegal wiretapping is. And the warrant makes \nall the difference, because it is precisely the court's blessing that \nbrings Presidential power under the rule of law, even when that \nwarrant, as we permit, is granted after the surveillance has already \nbegun, as you can under the FISA law.\n  In sum, we know that giving the telecoms their day in court, giving \nthe American people their day in court, would not jeopardize an ounce \nof our security. It does jeopardize our liberty. And it would only \nexpose one secret: the extent to which the rule of law has been \ntrampled upon. Does documentation qualify as legal authority? Again, \nthat is not a matter for a majority in this Chamber to decide by a \nvote. It is a matter for our courts to determine: Were these letters \nthat were transmitted--was there a legal justification? Why didn't the \nadministration go to the FISA Court, where 18,748 requests have been \nmade since 1978 and granted, and only 5 rejected, a secret Federal \ncourt where a warrant could have been granted after the fact of the \nsurveillance actually having begun? Why didn't they do that? Why did \nthey send out letters? Why didn't they go before that court? I am not \nconcluding they did it wrongfully, but I don't know they didn't do it \nwrongfully. That ought to be determined by the courts of law, not to be \nabove the law.\n  That is the choice at stake today: Will the secrets of the last years \nremain closed in the dark, as they will once we grant this immunity, or \nwill they be open for generations to come? What will they think of us? \nI revere what this Congress did in 1978, Democrats and Republicans, \nstanding up to executive powers and abuses. They fashioned a law that \ngranted us greater protection over those who would do us harm while \nsimultaneously protecting our rights and liberties. What a great \nSenate. What a great Congress that had the courage to stand up and put \naside partisan differences and stand up for 200 more years of this \nNation's history of liberty, of freedom.\n  What will be said about this Congress? When a future generation looks \nback at this hour, what did we do when faced with a similar fact \nsituation and were confronted with that choice? Or will we be open to \nthe generations to come, as I said, to our successors in this Chamber \nso they can prepare themselves to defend against future outrages, as \nthey will surely occur, of power and usurpations of law from future \nPresidents of either party? As I stand here this evening, I promise you \nit will happen. It has never not happened in the past; it will in the \nfuture. That is why we have these shared powers to maintain that \nbalance. We are going to concede that by suggesting that in this most \nimportant of all cases we are going to grant retroactive immunity. For \nwhat? For what? Can anyone even begin to make the case that our \nsecurity gets enhanced because we deprive Americans who feel they may \nhave been wronged by determining whether the actions taken by these \ncompanies at the behest of an administration were legal?\n  Now, 30 years after the Church committee, history has repeated \nitself. If those who come after us are to prevent it from happening \nagain, they need the full truth. That is why we must not allow these \nsecrets to go quietly into the night. I am here this evening because \nthe truth is no one's private property; it belongs to every one of us. \nIt demands to be heard.\n  ``State secrets,'' ``patriotic duty,'' those, as weak as they are, \nare the arguments the telecoms' advocates use when they are feeling \nhigh-minded. When their thoughts turn baser, they make their arguments \nas amateur economists.\n  Here is how Mike McConnell put it:\n\n       If you play out the suits at the value they're claimed, it \n     would bankrupt these companies. So we have to provide \n     liability protection to these private sector entities.\n\n  To begin with, that is a clear exaggeration. We are talking about \nsome of the wealthiest, most successful companies in America. Some of \nthem have continued to earn record profits and sign up record numbers \nof subscribers at the same time as this very public litigation, totally \nundermining the argument that these lawsuits are doing the telecoms \nsevere reputational damage, as Mike McConnell suggested. Companies of \nthat size could not be completely wiped out by anything but the most \nexorbitant and unlikely judgment. To assume that the telecoms\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\nwould lose, and that their judges would then hand down such back-\nbreaking penalties, is already to take several leaps.\n  Opponents of immunity, including myself, have stated that we would \nsupport a reasonable alternative to a blanket retroactive immunity. No \none seriously wants to cripple the telecommunications industry. The \npoint is to bring checks and balances back to domestic spying. \nAccepting that precedent would hardly require a crippling judgment. It \nis much more troubling, though, that the Director of National \nIntelligence would even suggest such an argument. I might understand if \nthe Secretary of the Treasury made that case, or some economist at the \nWorld Blank or the IMF or the Federal Reserve. But to have the \nIntelligence Director of our country suggest liability protections for \nprivate sector entities, even to speak of that, is rather incredible. \nThis is not the Secretary of Commerce we are talking about but the head \nof our Nation's intelligence efforts.\n  For that matter, how does that even begin to be relevant to letting \nthis case go forward? Since when did we throw out entire suits because \nthe defendants stood to lose too much? It astounds me that some can \nspeak in the same breath about national security and bottom lines. \nApprove immunity, and Congress will state clearly: The richer you are, \nthe more successful you are, the more lawless you are entitled to be. A \nsuit against you is a danger to the Republic.\n  And so, at the rock bottom of its justifications, the telecoms' \nadvocates are essentially arguing that immunity can be bought. The \ntruth is, of course, exactly the opposite, or it should be. The larger \nthe corporation, unfortunately, the greater the potential for abuse.\n  No one suggests that success should make a company suspect. Companies \ngrow large and essential to our economy because they are excellent at \nwhat they do, and most of them are overwhelmingly well managed. But the \nsize and wealth open the realm of possibility for abuse far beyond the \nscope of the individual.\n  After all, if the allegations are true, we are talking about one of \nthe most massive violations of privacy in American history. Shouldn't \nthere be some retribution or penalty? If reasonable search and seizure \nmeans opening a drug dealer's apartment, the telecoms' alleged actions \nwould be the equivalent of strip-searching everyone in the building, \nransacking their bedrooms, and prying up all of the floorboards.\n  The scale of these corporations opens unprecedented possibilities for \nabuse, possibilities far beyond the power of the individual. What the \ntelecoms have been accused of could not be done by one man or even 10. \nIt would be inconceivable without the size and resources of a large \ncorporation, the same size that makes Mike McConnell fear the \ncorporation's day in court. That is the massive scale we are talking \nabout. And that massive scale is precisely why no corporation must be \nabove the law.\n\n  On that scale, it is impossible to plead ignorance. As Judge Walker \nruled:\n\n       AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in \n     its position could have believed that the alleged domestic \n     dragnet was legal.\n\n  Again, Ronald Reagan's appointee to the Federal bench. But the \narguments of the President's allies sink even lower. Listen to words of \na House Republican leader spoken on FOX News. They are shameful:\n\n       I believe that they deserve immunity from lawsuits out \n     there from typical trial lawyers trying to find a way to get \n     into the pockets of American companies.\n\n  Of course, some of the ``typical greedy trial lawyers'' bringing \nthese suits actually work for a nonprofit. And the telecoms that some \nwant to portray as pitiful little Davids actually employ hundreds of \nattorneys, retain the best corporate law firms, and spend multimillion \ndollar legal budgets every year.\n  But if the facts actually mattered to immunity supporters, we would \nnot be here. For some, the prewritten narrative takes precedence far \nabove the mere facts; and here it is the perennial narrative of the \ngreedy trial lawyers.\n  With that, some can rest content. They can conclude that we were not \never serious about law, or about privacy, or about checks and balances; \nit was all about money all along.\n  There can no longer be any doubt: One by one the arguments of the \nimmunity supporters, of the telecoms' advocates, fail.\n  I wish to spend, if I could, a few minutes reviewing in detail those \nclaims and their failures. I will put up some of these quotes here for \nyou.\n  The first argument is: The President has the authority to decide \nwhether the telecoms should be granted immunity.\n  The facts are the judiciary, not the executive branch, should be \nallowed to determine whether the President of the United States has \nexceeded his powers by obtaining from the telecoms wholesale access to \ndomestic communications of millions of ordinary citizens. That is one \nof the arguments of those who argue that the granting of immunity is a \nPresidential prerogative. I argue quite the opposite. The court should \nnot simply be in the business of certifying that the companies received \nsome form of documentation, some letters that they received; rather, \nthey should be allowed to evaluate the validity of the legal arguments \nattested to in the document. Was the request legal or not? Is a letter \na legal document that requires you to cooperate?\n  Remember, the administration's original immunity proposal protected \neveryone, as I said a moment ago, involved in the wiretapping program, \nnot just the companies. In their original proposal to the Congress, \nthey wanted to immunize themselves as well. As I said, thankfully the \ncommittee disregarded that request. They made it. But, again, I think \nthat is instructive.\n  The second argument: Immunity supporters claim that only foreign \ncommunications were targeted, not Americans' domestic calls.\n  And here, litigation against the telecom companies is based upon \nclear, firsthand evidence, authenticated by those corporations in \ncourt. Every e-mail, every text message, every phone call, foreign or \ndomestic carried over the massive fiber optic links of 16 separate \ncompanies, routed through AT's Internet hub in San Francisco, have \nbeen knowingly diverted by AT by means of multiple splitters into a \nsecret room controlled exclusively by the NSA. There may be other such \nrooms as well.\n  This was given to the courts by the individual who was involved \ndirectly in the program. So the argument was only conversations between \nforeign targets that they have argued is completely and factually \nwrong.\n  The third argument immunity supporters make is that: A lack of \nimmunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate.\n  Again, I made this case a moment ago. But for more than 25 years the \nFISA legislation has compelled the telecommunications companies to \ncooperate. This is not a choice if, in fact, the FISA courts demanded \nit. In fact, when they have done that, what they do is they also \nimmunize, so they can protect these companies against future litigation \nthat can occur from people who claim they have done something wrong in \nthe process.\n  But to argue somehow these companies might never again be helpful is \nto not understand existing law. For 25 years they have, in fact, been \ncompelled to comply and, in fact, we provided the immunity when they \nhave done so.\n  Why in this case, after 25 years, did the Bush administration \ncompletely disregard this? And instead of compelling their compliance, \nand providing the immunity they would have gotten immediately, they \ndecided to send a letter instead, without any legal documentation, \nwithout any argument at all. But they are relying on that thin reed of \na letter saying, ``You should do this.'' ``We want you to do this.''\n  Not all of them complied. Qwest said: Wait a minute, that is not \nlegal. A letter is not enough. They did not comply, and obviously they \ndid not get involved in the program and they were not asked to do so \nfurther. So I am rather mystified. Shouldn't we know the answer to that \nquestion? Is it wrong for us to say: I think you ought to explain why \nyou think that was legal?\n  Why was a document legal? The fact that we are immunizing, in effect, \nthrough retroactive immunity, their actions, what sort of precedent are \nwe setting? That we are in a sense, if you\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\nwill, almost sanctioning that action. While we are saying it should \nnever happen again, I will almost guarantee you that someday someone \nwill do something like it and will refer to this Congress's decision \nto, in effect, sanction the use of letters alone without documentation \nto determine the legality of their actions.\n  The fourth argument: Immunity supporters argue that telecoms can't \ndefend themselves without exposing State secrets. This is highly \noffensive. Again, Judge Walker has already ruled the issue can go to \ntrial. In fact, he was incensed, as I quoted earlier.\n  ``The Government,'' he said, ``has [already] disclosed the general \ncontours of the `terrorist surveillance program,' which requires the \nassistance of a telecommunications provider.''\n  The suggestion that State secrets--I know the Presiding Officer is a \nformer attorney general, and I am preaching to the choir on these \nmatters, but I am confident he knows that for decades Federal courts \nmeeting ex parte in camera have religiously guarded State secrets when \nthey have been asked to make judicial decisions about matters involving \ninformation that could fall into the area of State secrets. I don't \nknow of any example where leaks have occurred. So the suggestion that \nif you allow this to go into Federal court to determine the legality of \nthis action, actions that now are publicly well known, that somehow we \nare going to have a leak of State secrets, there is not a scintilla of \nevidence that has ever been the case. It is a phony argument to suggest \nthat somehow State secrets would be jeopardized.\n  Five: Immunity supporters claim they are already protected by common \nlaw principles. In this case, of course, the fact is that common law \nimmunities do not trump specific legal duties imposed by statute, such \nas the specific duties Congress has long imposed on the \ntelecommunications companies to protect customer privacy and records. \nIn the pending case against AT, the judge already has ruled \nunequivocally that AT cannot seriously contend that a reasonable \nentity in its position could have believed the alleged domestic dragnet \nwas legal. Even so, the telecommunications company defendants can and \nshould have the opportunity to present these defenses to the courts, \nand the courts--not Congress preemptively--should decide whether they \nare sufficient. Again, common law does not trump specific legal duties \nimposed by statute.\n  The sixth argument immunity supporters claim is that leaks from the \ntrial might damage national security. I have already talked about this. \nI said that the Federal courts over the years have handled matters very \nwell, and this is a red herring. When, if ever, then, can we challenge \nthe legality of actions in Federal courts? If the case is made in this \ncase, if this is upheld and we buy into that argument on this matter, \nwhich is already publicly known but also, in a sense, siding, if you \nwill, with this argument by granting retroactive immunity, then in \ncases where, in fact, national security information may, in fact, be at \nrisk, I suspect the same argument will be made, and they will be \nrelying on the actions taken by the Senate, in this case, involving the \ntelecom companies. This is the kind of precedent-setting action that \ncould occur by our vote to grant retroactive immunity, if we buy into \nthis very argument, which is a dangerous argument, indeed, to suggest \nsomehow that our Federal courts are incapable of providing the kind of \nsecurity where national security leaks could occur. We can be \nincreasingly confident that these cases will not expose State secrets \nbased on history.\n  The seventh argument made by the supporters of this effort to grant \nretroactive immunity, they claim that litigation will harm the telecoms \nby causing them reputational damage. I hesitate to even make an \nargument against this, it is so offensive to me. The fact that the \nDirector of the National Security Agency would suggest somehow there \nwas a financial loss to the companies if we went further with this, \nthat is not the kind of argument I expect to be made by someone who is \nin charge of intelligence. That is an economic argument. It doesn't \nhold up, in my view. We are talking about wealthy companies. But even \nso, I don't know if anyone is suggesting that these actions, if, in \nfact, they prove to be true, that, in fact, there was an illegal action \ntaken here, would necessarily warrant an overexcessive judgment that \nwould somehow cripple these 17 companies from their financial well-\nbeing.\n  There is plenty of evidence that they are doing tremendously well. \nBut the idea somehow that a company ought not to be sued, that a \nplaintiff ought not to bring a case because you might win and there \nmight be damage financially, that is a ludicrous argument on its face \nto make when we are talking about millions of people's rights of \nprivacy being invaded for 5 years by 17 companies vacuuming up every \nbit of information, that you might be damaged because the plaintiffs \nmight win. It is a foolish argument and a dangerous one to make as \nwell.\n  The eighth argument, immunity supporters claim the lawsuits will \nbankrupt the companies. It is the same argument as I made about \nfinancial damage. The fact is, if we accept that premise about \nfinancial damage or reputational damage, if we could conceive of a \ncorporation so wealthy, so integral to our economy that its riches \nplace it outside the law altogether, that is a frightening concept, and \nI hope it will be rejected by our colleagues. Ensuring a day in court \nis not the same as ensuring a verdict. When that day comes, if it \ndoes--and I doubt it will, in light of the votes that have been cast \nin the past--I have absolutely no investment in a verdict either way. \nBut I am bothered by it. I am bothered that the administration didn't \ngo to the FISA Court, as others had 18,748 times since 1978, and on \nfive occasions the warrants were rejected, and in 18,748 cases, the \nwarrants were granted, that this administration decided not to go that \nroute, I have my doubts. But nonetheless, what I am calling for is not \na verdict by this body. All I am calling for is to allow a judgment to \nbe rendered by a court of law, allow plaintiffs to make their case, \nallow a Federal judge in that coequal branch of government to determine \nwhether what occurred was legal. If it was legal, case over. If it was \nnot, then allow the plaintiffs to make their case and be rewarded \naccordingly.\n\n  But by a vote of 51 to 49 or whatever the vote may be here, we are \ngoing to superimpose our judgment for a legal argument. I think letting \na political judgment replace a legal judgment is a dangerous precedent \nindeed. This is a big matter. We ought to have the courage to stand up \nto this administration, after a litany of abuses over the last 7 years. \nAs I said some time ago, if this had been for a week, a month, a year, \nafter 9/11, I would not be here tonight. I am a reasonable, practical \nperson. The emotions were high; fears were great after we were \nattacked. The fact that someone might have rushed in and done something \nlike this, I might not like it, I may worry about it, but I wouldn't \nprejudge it. Emotions could be such that one would take those actions. \nBut this went on for 5 years and would still be going on if a \nwhistleblower hadn't stood and said: This is what is happening. And it \nwas reported widely in the national media. That is the only reason it \nstopped. If not, it would be still going on. So it wasn't one of these \nearly events that can sometimes happen in which reasonable people ought \nto be able to step back and say: I understand why that happened.\n  If we were talking about an administration that had been upholding \nthe rule of law over the last 7 years or had been defending it, I might \nalso not be standing here. But how many lessons do we have to learn \nabout an Attorney General politicizing U.S. attorneys, rendition, \ntorture, walking away from habeas corpus, walking away from the Geneva \nConventions? How many more examples do we have to have of how this \nadministration regarded the rule of law? And yet at the end of all \nthat, within months of this administration leaving town, this body is \ngoing to say: We are going to side with the administration, grant \nimmunity, and we will never find out what went on here. Why did this \ncrowd seek immunity for itself, if it wasn't fearful about a judgment \nor a court of law examining what happened here? When letters became the \nlegal basis rather than going to the very court that had been around \nfor 30 years, that had provided warrants over and over again in 99.9 \npercent of the cases, why did this administration decide not to go that \nroute and seek that\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nkind of a warrant from the very secret court established to strike that \nbalance between the needed security and surveillance we should have and \nbalancing those rights so the judgments could be rendered?\n  Just as it would be absurd to declare the telecoms clearly guilty, it \nwould be equally absurd to close the case in Congress without a \ndecision. That is immunity.\n  Throughout this debate, telecoms' advocates have needed to show not \njust that they were right but that they are so right and that they are \nso far beyond the pale that we can shut down the argument right here \nand now with a vote, grant them immunity. That is a burden they have \nclearly not met, in my view, in any of the arguments, all eight of \nthem, that they have made. They cannot expect to meet it when a large \nmajority of our colleagues who will make that decision have not even \nseen the secret documents that are supposed to prove the case for \nretroactive immunity.\n  My trust is in the courts, in the cases argued openly, in the judges \nwho preside over them, and in the juries of American citizens who \ndecide them. They should be our pride, not our embarrassment. They \ndeserve to do their jobs. That is what the Founders created. It has \nbeen a great system of checks and balances, coequal, three coequal \nbranches of Government--an executive, a legislative, and a judicial \nbranch. We have an executive branch that took action. We are going to \nhave a legislative branch that is going to sanction it by granting \nimmunity without ever allowing that coequal branch of Government to \ndetermine the legality of their actions. We are depriving what the very \nFounders of our country insisted upon.\n  This isn't about being a Democrat, a Republican, a liberal or a \nconservative. It is about whether you understand the rule of law, that \nno man, not even the President, is above it. Whether this President was \nof my party or anyone else's, I would stand here with the same degree \nof passion in making this case. A case I know I have lost in the past \nbut I care so deeply about that I want my children and my grandchildren \none day to know that their father and grandfather at this moment stood \nfor the rule of law. And I believe my colleagues, if given the chance \nto think about this, will reach the same conclusion.\n  This is one of those moments. They don't happen very often, but they \ndo happen here. We have learned about them only after the fact too \noften. But this one is before us as it has been over the last number of \nmonths. We owe it not only to ourselves but to future generations to \nstand for these timeless principles of the rule of law, liberty, and \nsecurity. As complex, as diverse, as relentless as the assault on the \nrule of law has been, our answer to it is a simple one. Far more than \nany President's lawlessness, the American way of justice remains deeply \nrooted in our character that no President can disturb.\n  So on this evening, I am full of hope, on a dark day, when it may \nseem we are going to lose this case once again, I would like to have \nfaith that we can unite security and justice because we have already \ndone it. It is not a choice, one or the other. It can never be that. \nThat is a false choice and a false dichotomy. Justice and security is \nwhat our forebears have given us, what our predecessors have struggled \nwith, and which we now must wrestle with ourselves. It is never \nperfect. There is always one side maybe a bit more weighty than the \nother, but it is our responsibility to try and strike that balance, to \nkeep us secure in the face of those who would do us great harm and to \ndo so at a time without giving up our rights and liberties. To do so is \nto change the very nature of who we are as a people. To succumb to the \nfears of those who would suggest that you have to make choices about \nbeing more secure or being free, I don't believe that.\n  In fact, I think if we give up freedoms, we become far less secure \nand far less safe. That is the judgment we must now make, whether we \ncan be secure and free and guarantee those liberties to go forward.\n  My father was the executive trial counsel at the Nuremberg trials in \n1945 and 1946. I have never forgotten the example he set, as Justice \nRobert Jackson said in the opening statement at the Nuremberg trials, a \nstatement, by the way, that my parents made us memorize as children \nbecause it captured the essence of the Nuremberg trials. The rule of \nlaw is what motivated those who insisted upon that trial. The \noverwhelming majority of people did not want a trial. Why should you \nspend the money giving these 21 defendants a lawyer? Fifty-five million \npeople had died at the hands of the Nazis and their allies; 6 million \nJews had been incinerated in the concentration camps; 5 million others \nhad the same fate befall them because of their political affiliation, \ntheir ethnicity, their sexual orientation; 11 million people \nincinerated; 45 million died at their hands. Why in the world would you \never give them a trial?\n  Why not, as Winston Churchill suggested, just line them up and shoot \nthem? Just line them up and shoot them. They did not deserve civility. \nBut Robert Jackson; Henry Stimson, the Secretary of War under Franklin \nRoosevelt--a Republican, I might add; the only one in Roosevelt's \nCabinet--Samuel Rosenman, a great speechwriter for Franklin Roosevelt; \nRobert Jackson, a Supreme Court Justice, and a handful of others stood \nup and said: No, that war was not about treasury or treasure or land, \nit was about values and principles, and the principle of the rule of \nlaw is something we stood for.\n  So despite all of the appetite for vengeance, we are not going to \ngive these defendants that which they gave to their victims. We are \ngoing to prove the difference. We are going to give them that which \nthey never gave their victims. They are going to get a day in court. \nThey are going to live with the rule of law.\n  Robert Jackson, speaking to that Court, in the summer of 1945, said \nthe following, which I memorized years ago. Speaking about the Soviet \nUnion, the French, the British, and ourselves, he said the following:\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily \n     submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is \n     one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid \n     to Reason.\n\n  It is a remarkable sentence, and it captured the essence of \nNuremberg--the rule of law. From that experience, America led the way \nin creating the structures in architecture that gave us almost 70 years \nof global peace. The IMF, the World Bank, Bretton Woods, the expansion \nof the United Nations, NATO--all of those institutions occurred because \nof the moral high ground we achieved by insisting upon the rule of law.\n  It was Nuremberg, in many ways, that conjured up the image of who we \nwere as a people. Compare that with the words ``Guantanamo,'' ``Abu \nGhraib,'' ``renditions,'' ``torture,'' ``habeas corpus,'' ``walking \naway from the Geneva Conventions.'' This is not who we are. Nuremberg \nwas who we are, not Guantanamo, not giving retroactive immunity where \nthe rule of law is being abused, or potentially being abused. That is \nwhy we are here.\n  Each generation has been asked to defend these principles and values, \nand each generation in its own way has done that. I believe our \ngeneration can and must as well. Therefore, the challenge before us is \nnot a simple one, but an easy one, in my view; that is, to stand up for \nthis principle.\n  The world is not going to collapse, the sky is not going to fall if \nsome companies have to face some plaintiffs and explain why they \nvacuumed up all their private information for more than 5 years. What \nwas the legal justification for that action? To grant retroactive \nimmunity would, in fact, do just that.\n  So what is the tribute that Power owes to Reason? That America stands \nfor a transcendent idea, the idea that laws should rule, and not men, \nthe idea that the Constitution does not get suspended for vengeance, \nthe idea that this Nation should never tailor its eternal principles to \nthe conflict of the moment, because if we did, we would be walking in \nthe footsteps of the enemies we despised.\n  The tribute that Power owes to Reason is due today as well. I know we \ncan find the strength to pay it. And if we cannot, we will have to \nanswer for it, I fear.\n  There is a famous military recruiting poster that comes to mind. A \nman is sitting in an easy chair with his son\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nand daughter on his lap, after some future war has ended. His daughter \nis asking him, ``What did you do in the war?'' And his face is shocked \nand shamed because he knows he did nothing.\n  My little daughters, Grace and Christina, are 6 and 3. They are \ngrowing up--I hope sound asleep at this hour, as I speak in the late \nnight hours here, but they are growing up in a time of two great \nconflicts: one between our Nation and its enemies, and another between \nwhat is best and worst in our American soul. And someday soon, I know I \nam going to hear that question: What did you do at the time when this \nconflict was emerging? What side did you take? I want more than \nanything else, when that day comes, to give the right answer, that I \nstood for the rule of law.\n  That question is coming to each and every one of us in our own way. \nEvery single one of us will be judged by a jury from whom there is no \nhiding: our sons and daughters and grandchildren. Someday soon, they \nwill read in their textbooks the stories of a great nation--one that \nthrew down tyrants and oppressors for two centuries, one that rid the \nworld of Nazism and Soviet communism, one that proved that great \nstrength can serve great virtue, that right can truly make might.\n  And then they will read how, in the early years of the 21st century, \nthat nation could have lost its way. We do not have the power to strike \nthat chapter. But we cannot go back. We cannot un-destroy the CIA's \ninterrogation tapes. We cannot un-pass the Military Commissions Act. We \ncannot un-speak Alberto Gonzales's testimony before the Congress. We \ncannot un-torture innocent people. We, perhaps, sadly and shamefully, \ncannot stop retroactive immunity. We cannot undo anything that has been \ndone in the last 6 years for the cause of lawlessness and fear. We \ncannot block out that chapter. But we can begin the next chapter, even \nthis evening, even in the days to come, as we debate this issue. And \nlet its first words read: Finally, in the month of June of 2008, the \nSenate of the United States--Democrats and Republicans--said: Enough. \nEnough is enough.\n  I implore my colleagues to write it with me. I implore my colleagues \nto vote against retroactive immunity and vote against cloture when that \nopportunity arrives in the next day or so. I think it would be a \nmistake to grant it. I think we can do better. I think we can reform \nthe law. But we ought not to have any decision be above the law, as is \nthe danger here.\n  Mr. President, I want to, if I can, share with my colleagues, and \nthose who may be listening to all this, some articles because their \neloquence is far greater than mine when they talk about the importance \nof all of this, and they are worth noting and reading as we examine \nthis question before us.\n  There have been editorials and others that have addressed this issue. \nThere is an editorial in the New York Times from June 18, entitled: \n``Mr. Bush v. the Bill of Rights.''\n\n       In the waning months of his tenure, President Bush and his \n     allies are once again trying to scare Congress into expanding \n     the president's powers to spy on Americans without a court \n     order.\n       This week, the White House and Democratic and Republican \n     leaders on Capitol Hill hope to announce a ``compromise'' on \n     a domestic spying bill. If they do, it will be presented as \n     an indispensable tool for protecting the nation's security \n     that still safeguards our civil liberties. The White House \n     will paint opponents as weak-kneed liberals who do not \n     understand and cannot stand up to the threat of terrorism.\n       The bill is not a compromise. The final details are being \n     worked out, but all indications are that many of its \n     provisions are both unnecessary and a threat to the Bill of \n     Rights. The White House and the Congressional Republicans who \n     support the bill have two real aims. They want to undermine \n     the power of the courts to review the legality of domestic \n     spying programs. And they want to give a legal shield to the \n     telecommunications companies that broke the law by helping \n     Mr. Bush carry out his warrantless wiretapping operation.\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance act, or FISA, \n     requires that government to get a warrant to intercept \n     communications between anyone in this country and anyone \n     outside it. The 1978 law created a special court that has \n     approved all but a handful of the government's many thousands \n     of warrant requests.\n       Still, after Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush bypassed the FISA \n     court and authorized the interception of international calls \n     and e-mail messages without a warrant. Then, when The Times \n     disclosed the operation in late 2005, Mr. Bush claimed that \n     FISA did not allow the United States to act quickly enough to \n     stop terrorists. That was nonsense. FISA always gave the \n     government the power to start listening and then get a \n     warrant--a grace period that has been extended since Sept 11.\n       More fundamental, Mr. Bush's powers do not supersede laws \n     passed by Congress or the constitution's protections against \n     unreasonable searches and seizures.\n       The ensuing debate did turn up an Internet-age problem with \n     FISA: It requires a warrant to eavesdrop on foreign \n     communications that go through American computers. There was \n     an easy fix, but when Congress made it last year, the White \n     House muscled in amendments that seriously diluted the \n     courts' ability to restrain the government from spying on its \n     own citizens.\n       That law expires on Aug. 3, and Mr. Bush is demanding even \n     more power to spy. He also wants immunity for the \n     telecommunications companies that provided the government \n     with Americans' private data without a warrant after Sept. \n     11.\n       Lawsuits against those companies are the best hope of \n     finding out the extent of Mr. Bush's lawless spying. But \n     Democratic leaders in Congress are reported to have agreed to \n     a phony compromise drafted by [one of our colleagues], the \n     Republican vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n       Under the so-called compromise, the question of immunity \n     would be decided by federal district court--a concession by \n     Mr. Bond [our colleague from Missouri], who originally wanted \n     the FISA court, which meets in secret and is unsuited to the \n     task, to decide. What is unacceptable, though, is that the \n     district court would be instructed to decide based solely on \n     whether the Bush administration certifies that the companies \n     were told the spying was legal. If the aim is to allow a \n     court hearing on the president's spying, the lawsuits should \n     be allowed to proceed--and the courts should be able to \n     resolve them the way they resolve every other case. \n     Republicans, who complain about judges making laws from the \n     bench, should not be making judicial decision from Capitol \n     Hill.\n       This week, House and Senate leaders were trying to allay \n     the concerns of some lawmakers that approving the immunity \n     would be tantamount to retroactively declaring the spying \n     operation to have been legal. Those lawmakers are right. \n     Granting the corporations immunity would send that exact \n     message.\n       The new bill has other problems. It gives the government \n     too much leeway to acquire communications in the United \n     States without individual warrants or even a showing of \n     probable cause. It greatly reduces judicial review, and it \n     would remain in force for six years, which is too long.\n       If Congress cannot pass a clean bill that fixes the one \n     real problem with FISA, it should simply extend the temporary \n     authorization. At a minimum . . .\n\n  It talks about what other steps can be taken.\n  There are several other articles I want to share with colleagues, but \nlet me also say to my colleagues, we are in a postcloture environment \nhere on the housing bill. We will be in cloture until tomorrow evening \non the 30 hours required under the housing bill, unless some \nintervening action is taken. I know we are supposed to consider voting \non cloture on this bill sometime tomorrow morning. I reserve the right \nto use whatever vehicle is available to me. While I am upset we are not \ndealing with the housing bill--I believe that is a priority on which \nAmericans expect something to be done. You have 8,400 people filing for \nforeclosure every day in this country. It is a massive economic issue \nthat is crippling the livelihood and the future wealth and security of \ntoo many American families. I would object to any unanimous consent \nrequest to go to the FISA bill. If we do get to a cloture motion, I \nwill be urging my colleagues to vote against cloture, to send this bill \nback to the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and craft \nsome reforms of FISA, but stay away from this retroactive immunity. It \nis not needed. It is unnecessary. It is shameful it is even being \nrequested in this bill for all the reasons I have identified earlier.\n  Let me read, if I can, from the New Jersey Star-Ledger. Again, this \npaper calls for rejecting the wiretap bill, as well. This editorial \nsays:\n\n       The House of Representatives is to vote today on a \n     wiretapping bill that would give some of America's biggest \n     and richest companies a get-out-of-jail card for breaking the \n     law and that also would help the government carry out \n     unsupervised snooping for years in the future.\n       But Verizon and other telecommunications companies should \n     not be rewarded with immunity against lawsuits for agreeing \n     to perform President Bush's illegal eavesdropping. They \n     should answer for their actions in court, just like any other \n     citizen.\n       And Congress should not gut the current law that says a \n     federal judge's review is essential to avoid the very abuses \n     of power that Bush's White House embraced.\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\n       The House ``compromise'' wiretapping bill is not a \n     compromise at all. It would give the telecommunications \n     companies absolute immunity from the suits pending against \n     them for wiretapping if they can simply show that the Bush \n     administration told them at the time that the snooping was \n     legal. Which everyone agrees the administration did indeed \n     do.\n\n  It is not a debate. They sent letters. The question is, were the \nletters and the documentation a legal justification? We already know \nthey sent the letters, so all they are providing for us in here is \ntantamount to acknowledging what we already know occurred. What we are \nnot getting to is the legal conclusion that those documents not seeking \nthe warrants of the FISA court was a legal justification for their \nactions. It does not take a legal scholar to see the danger in this \napproach. It means that the law becomes whatever the President wants it \nto be, never mind what the statutes or even the Constitution may say. \nThat is why the courts exist. That is why you have Federal judges to \nmake those determinations.\n  This editorial goes on to say:\n\n       The President also very much wants the other major part of \n     the new wiretapping law, the section that amounts to an \n     aggressive broadening of federal surveillance powers. The \n     provisions would emasculate the ability of federal judges to \n     review wiretapping orders, especially if the orders were for \n     a general information ``dragnet'' as opposed to targeting \n     specific persons.\n       Snooping government agents would be officially free to plug \n     into phone and data lines and copy and review untold millions \n     of calls and e-mails, all without serious adult supervision. \n     Effective checks and balances in government this is not.\n       Bush and Attorney General Michael Mukasey want the new \n     law--\n\n  The editorial goes on to say--\n\n     and they want it now. House Members--\n\n  Talking about the House-passed bill--\n\n     should not give it to them. Government wiretapping is now \n     operating under a series of interim laws set to expire in \n     early August.\n       There is no evidence that these interim rules are too \n     anemic to protect the Nation for a while longer. Congress \n     should extend them. If the wiretapping law needs major \n     revisions, these can be done under a new President.\n       One who, unlike Bush, didn't begin a secret, illegal \n     wiretapping months before September 11, 2001.\n\n  This is from the Denver Post. I wonder why I chose that one to read \nto the Presiding Officer, my good friend and colleague from Denver, CO. \nI suspect he may have seen this one himself, so I apologize if I am \nreading an editorial he has already probably read himself. This is \ndated June 5. ``Another Dose of Courage Needed on FISA'' is the title.\n\n       Congress once again is discussing a compromise on a long-\n     stalled rewrite of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     with the idea of getting something passed before its August \n     recess.\n       The White House assuredly will play the national security \n     card again as it seeks retroactive immunity for telecoms that \n     give in to demands for information under the President's \n     warrantless wiretapping program.\n       We hope Congress stands firm as it did in February. Frame \n     it any way you want, but the issue is accountability.\n       Proponents are making a last-ditch effort--\n\n  The Denver Post says--\n\n     to squelch some 40 lawsuits that could bear witness to the \n     breadth of Bush administration spying that took place outside \n     the auspices of FISA.\n       Congress must not capitulate on this key point.\n       It's important to keep in mind how this country came to \n     have FISA. Enacted in 1978, FISA was a response to widespread \n     government abuse of wiretaps in the name of national \n     security. The act set rules for government spying on foreign \n     powers on their agents.\n       A secret FISA Court hears government eavesdropping requests \n     and almost without exception approves them. The \n     administration can even wiretap without a FISA warrant and \n     get one later.\n       After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush decided to do an end \n     run around the FISA Court, shifting approval for wiretaps \n     from the judiciary to the executive branch. That program was \n     secret until 2005 when the New York Times exposed its \n     existence.\n\n  As I pointed out earlier, conceivably it would still be operating \ntoday but for that revealing by the whistleblower.\n\n       Last year, the administration employed fear mongering and \n     convinced Congress--\n\n  The Denver Post says--\n\n     to legitimize the program through the Protect America Act, a \n     temporary provision that expired this year.\n       The battle now is over a permanent extension, the \n     centerpiece of which would be lawsuit immunity for the \n     telecommunication companies that cooperated with the \n     warrantless spying program.\n       Administration officials say they are very concerned about \n     getting cooperation from the communications companies unless \n     the companies have immunity.\n       We find it hard to believe that these telecoms would refuse \n     to comply with the FISA Court order. FISA has been in \n     operation for 30 years and that seems to have not been a \n     problem in the past.\n\n  Let me just cut in here and point out that over the past 25 years, as \nI noted earlier, the FISA Courts have compelled companies to provide \ninformation and simultaneously granted them immunity when doing so. So \nthis idea that we hope they will willingly cooperate--the courts have \nthe power to compel cooperation when we want surveillance of \nindividuals that could be doing us harm. So the argument that if we \ndon't grant immunity they might not show up again when we ask them to \nprovide surveillance that we need in order to guarantee our security--\nwe hope they will cooperate, but if they don't, we have the ability to \ncompel cooperation.\n  Back to the editorial. It concludes by saying:\n\n       It's also important to keep in mind that the Federal courts \n     where these telecom lawsuits are being heard can--and have--\n     dismissed some actions on the grounds that they could \n     endanger national security. So it's not as if there is no \n     protection at work.\n       The last time immunity was debated in Congress, House \n     Democrats held firm, saying that they thought the \n     administration's modifications would amount to a suspension \n     of the Constitution. We hope they have the same courage of \n     their convictions this time around.\n\n  I applaud the Denver Post for its brilliant and thoughtful editorial \nin that regard.\n  This is an editorial from the Register-Guard in Eugene, OR, so we get \nthe breadth of this across the country. This one is entitled ``Sinking \nthe Boat: House Approves Flawed Electronic Surveillance Bill,'' June \n24, 2008.\n\n       Congressional leaders have crafted a deeply flawed bill on \n     electronic eavesdropping, caving once again to White House \n     warnings that failure to give the executive branch broad \n     license to spy on U.S. citizens without a warrant would make \n     it harder to protect Americans from terrorists.\n       In one of the most disappointing votes of the 110th \n     Congress, the House on Friday approved a compromise over a \n     contentious intelligence surveillance bill. The House measure \n     would allow the Federal Government to intercept international \n     telephone calls or e-mails without prior court approval if \n     the executive branch claims it is necessary in an emergency. \n     It would also grant de facto immunity to telecommunications \n     companies that cooperated in the administration's secret and \n     blatantly unconstitutional surveillance program after the \n     September 11 attacks.\n       Congressman Peter DeFazio deserves credit for voting, along \n     with 127 other Democrats, against the House bill. ``We do not \n     trample over the U.S. Constitution in order to protect \n     Americans from terrorism--that is akin to sinking the boat so \n     the enemy can't sink it,'' the Oregon Democrat said.\n       After September 11, President Bush authorized the National \n     Security Agency to monitor, without the prior court approval \n     required by the Constitution, e-mails and phone conversations \n     between suspected terrorists of United States residents. \n     Called the Terrorist Surveillance Program, the initiative \n     ignored the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which \n     required a special Federal court to authorize electronic \n     spying on Americans.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       The Bush administration grudgingly accepted judicial \n     oversight of the program only after its existence was leaked \n     to the media and Congress howled in outrage. That outrage has \n     since been muffled by a White House campaign intended to \n     scare Americans and to allow the administration to further \n     expand the chief executive's powers and erode civil \n     liberties. And, oh, yes, to ensure that no one is held \n     accountable for the illegal wiretapping that Bush ordered \n     after September 11.\n       The House bill is a modest improvement over the earlier \n     versions. While it unwisely allows the administration to \n     authorize monitoring of international calls or e-mails, it \n     requires the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     to review and enforce protections for U.S. residents, and it \n     bars surveillance until those procedures are approved \n     except in ``exigent circumstances.''\n       The Senate should improve the House bill by requiring court \n     supervision of any surveillance that can involve American \n     citizens or others in the United States. That's a \n     constitutional red line the Bush administration--or any \n     other--should not be allowed to cross.\n       The Senate should also make certain that the courts are \n     allowed to decide whether telecommunication companies \n     violated the\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\n     law by handing over data to the government over the past five \n     years without a court order. The Senate should also demand a \n     full accounting to Congress of all surveillance conducted \n     since September 11--accounting the White House has refused to \n     provide, telling lawmakers and the American public to instead \n     ``trust us'' with their freedoms.\n       Congress still has a chance to make certain that the \n     Federal Government Surveillance Program complies with the \n     rule of law. History would suggest the failure to do so could \n     leave the door open to lawless behavior as long as the \n     current President remains in office--\n\n  And, I would argue, set a precedent for future administrations where \nthat could occur as well.\n  Again, let me suggest here that what we are talking about is not the \nchoice between security and liberty. This is not an issue that ought to \ndivide people based on our party affiliation or how one is \ncharacterized and where they sit in the political spectrum. This is an \nissue that goes to the heart of who we are. It is talking about the \nrule of law and the Constitution. Everyone here takes an oath of office \nto protect and defend our country and to protect the Constitution. \nCertainly that is what this ought to involve.\n  Are the courts going to make a determination about the legality of \nthis effort? Again, I don't know of another instance in our Nation's \nhistory where for 5 long years, 17 companies were allowed to virtually \nsweep up every phone call, every e-mail, every fax, every text message \nthat was sent by every citizen of this country, and that is exactly \nwhat happened and would still be ongoing if it hadn't been revealed.\n  Do we require that there be some justification as to whether this was \nlegally occurring? That ought not to be a matter of political choice. \nThat ought to be a matter for the courts. That is why we established \nthe third branch of government--the judiciary--to determine the \nconstitutionality and legality of actions taken by the executive or \nlegislative branches. We are shortcutting in the legislative branch, at \nthe request of the executive, the ability of that branch to make that \ndetermination. We are sanctioning, in effect. We are closing the door, \nnever to know why this happened, who ordered it, why did they avoid \nFISA, what was behind their thinking. That is a dangerous step for us \nto take.\n  That is the only case I am making. I have my doubts, as I said, about \nthe legality of it, but that is just one Senator. I have the right to \ncertainly have my doubts about certain actions. I don't have the right \nto determine the legality of it. I am a Senator, I am not a Federal \njudge. I don't sit in that third branch, I sit in the second branch. I \nsit in the Congress of the United States. It is my job here to stand up \nand see to it that we don't take actions that would deprive that \nbranch--the legal branch, the judicial branch--from asserting its \nrights under our Constitution--exactly what the Founders intended.\n  So while I know there are those who are going to argue and make the \ncase that those of us who stand up here to defend the rule of law, \nsomehow we are weak-kneed when it comes to terrorism, that is hardly \nthe case. I don't want to give terrorists a greater victory. As \nprofoundly sad, as tragic, and as violent as the attack was on 9/11 \nthat destroyed so much and showed us how dangerous the world is today, \nto grant them the power--those terrorists--to allow them to deprive us \nof our liberties is to grant them a victory even greater than they \nachieved that day. It must be our common determination to see to it \nthat we stand up and not allow these rights and these liberties we \nenjoy as citizens to be eroded at our own hand.\n  Let's say to terrorists around the world: We will fight you and \ndefeat you as you try to do us and others great harm, but you will not \nbring down the pillars of our constitutional form of government and the \nrule of law. That is what this is all about, while it is argued and we \nare told that we have to do this and if we don't do it, that somehow we \nare succumbing to those terrorists who wish to do us great physical \nharm.\n  Let me, if I can, sort of wrap up because I know I am taking a little \nbit of time. I want to leave some time to argue my housing bill. I am \nconsuming the time on my housing bill to do this, but I want people to \nunderstand, at least from my perspective, why this is a dangerous \nconclusion, why we ought to vote against cloture, and why I am going to \nuse my power as a Senator to object to going to that cloture vote, at \nleast as long as a cloture vote exists on dealing with the housing \nlegislation.\n  I think retroactive immunity is a disgrace. In the last months, I \nbelieve we proved that beyond any doubt whatsoever. As I said, I \nbelieve it is more disgraceful in all that it represents. It is the \nmindset that the Church Committee summed up so eloquently three decades \nago. As I read these words--they are no longer with us. A lot of these \nMembers have long since left us, not only from this Chamber but who \nhave since passed away. But it is worthwhile for us to read their \nwords, these Democrats and Republicans. There were those who suggested \nsomehow they were weak-kneed when it came to giving the President the \npower to protect our national security. But listen to their words of \nthree decades ago:\n\n       The view that the traditional American principles of \n     justice and fair play have no place in our struggle against \n     the enemies of freedom, that view created the Nixonian \n     secrecy of the 1970s.\n\n  The Church committee wrote those words in part as a rebuke to our \npredecessors in this Chamber who for years allowed secrecy and \nexecutive abuses to slide. But today those words take on new meaning. \nToday, they rebuke us, in a way. Today they shame us for a lack of \nfaith that we can, at the same time, keep our country safe and our \nConstitution whole.\n  As I said before, when the 21st century version of the Church \ncommittee convenes to investigate the abuses of the past years, how \nwill we be judged? When it reads through the records of our debates--\nnot if, Mr. President, but when--what will they find? When the \nPresident asked us to repudiate the Geneva Conventions and strip away \nthe rights of habeas corpus, how did we respond? What was our Congress? \nWhat did we say about that? When stories of secret prisons and \noutsourced torture became impossible to deny, what did that Congress do \nin 2008 and 2007? In June of 2008 when we were asked to put \ncorporations explicitly outside the law and accept at face value the \nargument that some are literally too rich to be sued, how did that \nCongress, how did that Senate vote on that matter?\n  All of these questions are coming to us, Mr. President. All of them \nand more. And in the quiet of his or her own conscience, each Senator \nknows what the answers are.\n  Remember, this is about more than a few telephone calls, a few \ncompanies, or a few lawsuits. If the supporters of retroactive immunity \nkeep this argument a technical one, they will win. A technical argument \nobscures the defining question: the rule of law or the rule of men? \nThat question never goes away. As long as there are free societies, \ngenerations of leaders will struggle mightily to answer it. Each \ngeneration must ascertain an answer for itself. Just because our \nFounders answered it correctly doesn't mean we are bound by their \nchoice. In that, as in all decisions, we are entirely free.\n  The burden falls not on history but on each one of us--the 100 of us \nwho serve in this remarkable Chamber. But we can take counsel, listen \nto those who came before us, who made the right choice even when our \nNation's survival was at risk. They knew the rule of law was far more \nrooted in our character than any one man's lawlessness. From the \nbeginning, they advised us to fight that lawlessness whenever we found \nit. At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison said:\n\n       The means of defense against foreign danger historically \n     have become the instruments of tyranny at home.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of \n     the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments \n     of those in power than by violent and sudden assertion.\n\n  As long as we are temporary custodians of the Constitution, as we \nare, we have a duty to guard against those gradual and silent \nencroachments. That is exactly what this is. It is a gradual and silent \nencroachment. It doesn't come in a burst, it comes slowly. Our Founders \nknew these threats were coming. They could predict, persuade, and warn, \nbut when it comes time to stand up against those threats in our own \ntime, they cannot act for us. They can only teach us, they\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\ncan warn us, they can remind us that they would come. And they have. \nThey are here. They are before us. They cannot act for us. The choice \nis ours and ours alone.\n  Tomorrow or the following day, when we are asked to vote on this, the \nchoice will be ours. We have been warned and cautioned by history. The \ndecision now rests with each and every one of us to decide whether we \nhave listened to them and not only answer them but provide the answer \nfor generations to come, as generations before us have answered that \nquestion. May we rise to that moment, Mr. President, and defeat this \nlegislation. May we reject this retroactive immunity for a handful of \ncompanies so that we may determine whether their actions were legal or \nwhether they were above the law or whether they were the rule of law or \nthe rule of men. That is the important choice we will have to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6095-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6095-S6096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMEMORATING THE 44TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATHS OF CIVIL RIGHTS \n      WORKERS ANDREW GOODMAN, JAMES CHANEY, AND MICHAEL SCHWERNER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 600, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 600) commemorating the 44th \n     anniversary of the deaths of civil rights workers Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner in Philadelphia, \n     Mississippi, while working in the name of American democracy \n     to register voters and secure civil rights during the summer \n     of 1964, which has become known as ``Freedom Summer.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our Nation owes a tremendous debt of \ngratitude to all of those who risked their lives in the pursuit of \nmaking America a more perfect union. This week, we commemorate the 44th \nanniversary of the day three brave civil rights workers--James Chaney, \nMichael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman--paid the ultimate price in the \nstruggle to secure civil rights and expand our democracy for all \nAmericans.\n  On June 21, 1964, these three young men were abducted, brutally \nbeaten, and shot to death by Ku Klux Klansmen for simply attempting to \nregister African-Americans voters. Their deaths touched the conscience \nof our country and inspired events that changed the course of our \nhistory. The public outcry over the initial disappearance of these \nworkers drew national and international attention to the violence \nassociated with efforts to register African-American voters. It spurred \nefforts to desegregate the voting delegates at political party \nconventions. And it served as a catalyst for Congress to pass the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, key legislation \nthat would eliminate segregation and usher in a new era of equal \nopportunity and access to our democracy for all Americans.\n  Unfortunately, our march toward equal justice under law is not yet \ncomplete. Three years ago, Edgar Ray Killen was convicted for the \ndeaths of the three civil rights workers we honor today. Almost two \ndozen other men were involved in this crime; some are still alive, yet, \nnone have ever been held charged with this murder. Even more troubling, \nthe families of hundreds of other Americans who lost their lives in the \nfight for equal rights still await justice.\n  As we pass this resolution, we must recognize that it is long past \ntime to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which \nwould strengthen our ability to track down those whose violent acts \nduring a period of national turmoil remain unpunished. Last year, the \nHouse overwhelmingly passed this bill. Yet, one lone Republican Senator \nhas prevented this important bill from passing. As we commemorate the \ndeaths of three of the most celebrated civil rights activists of the \npast, let us remember this does not obviate our need to solve the \nhundreds of less recognized civil rights crimes of that era.\n  Today's resolution is an important gesture for us to remember the \ncivil rights misdeeds of the past. But it is also an opportunity for \nCongress to show the country that we will not tolerate similar \noffenses. As we pass this resolution, it is fitting to carry this \nprinciple to the present and act in kind to prevent hate crimes and \ncivil rights abuses occurring now in this country and around the world.\n  The powerful inscription on the grave of James Chaney reads: ``There \nare those who are alive, yet will never live; there are those who are \ndead, yet will live forever; great deeds inspire and encourage the \nliving.'' By remembering Mr. Chaney, Mr. Schwerner, and Mr. Goodman \ntoday, I hope we all can be inspired to renewed action in this \nCongress. Let us pass the Till bill to ensure that those who sacrificed \ntheir lives in pursuit of justice are not forgotten and the \nperpetrators of these crimes are held accountable.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 600) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 600\n\n       Whereas 44 years ago, on June 21, 1964, Andrew Goodman, \n     James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner were murdered in \n     Philadelphia, Mississippi, while working in the name of \n     American democracy to register voters and secure civil rights \n     during the summer of 1964, which has become known as \n     ``Freedom Summer'';\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman was a 20-year-old White anthropology \n     major at New York's Queens College, who volunteered for the \n     ``Freedom Summer'' project;\n       Whereas James Chaney, from Meridian, Mississippi, was a 21-\n     year-old African-American civil rights activist who joined \n     the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1963 to work on \n     voter education and registration;\n       Whereas Michael ``Mickey'' Schwerner, from Brooklyn, New \n     York, was a 24-year-old White CORE field secretary in \n     Mississippi and a veteran of the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas in 1964, Mississippi had a Black voting-age \n     population of 450,000, but only 16,000 Blacks were registered \n     to vote;\n       Whereas most Black voters were disenfranchised by law or \n     practice in Mississippi;\n       Whereas in 1964, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael \n     Schwerner volunteered to work as part of the ``Freedom \n     Summer'' project that involved several civil rights \n     organizations, including the Mississippi State chapter of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \n     the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student \n     Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and CORE, with the purpose \n     of registering Black voters in Mississippi;\n       Whereas on the morning of June 21, 1964, the 3 men left the \n     CORE office in Meridian and set out for Longdale, \n     Mississippi, where they were to investigate the recent \n     burning of the Mount Zion Methodist Church, a Black church \n     that had been functioning as a Freedom School for education \n     and voter registration;\n       Whereas on their way back to Meridian, James Chaney, Andrew \n     Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were detained and later \n     arrested and taken to the Philadelphia, Mississippi, jail;\n       Whereas later that same evening, on June 21, 1964, they \n     were taken from the jail, turned over to the Ku Klux Klan, \n     and beaten, shot, and killed;\n       Whereas 2 days later, their burnt, charred, and gutted blue \n     Ford station wagon was pulled from the Bogue Chitto Creek, \n     just outside Philadelphia, Mississippi;\n       Whereas the national uproar caused by the disappearance of \n     the civil rights workers led President Lyndon B. Johnson to \n     order Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to send 200 active \n     duty Navy sailors to search the swamps and fields in the area \n     for the bodies of the 3 civil rights workers, and Attorney \n     General Robert F. Kennedy to order his Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) director, J. Edgar Hoover, to send 150 \n     agents to Mississippi to work on the case;\n       Whereas the FBI investigation led to the discovery of the \n     bodies of several other African-Americans from Mississippi, \n     whose disappearances over the previous several years had not \n     attracted attention outside their local communities;\n       Whereas the bodies of Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and \n     Michael Schwerner, beaten and shot, were found on August 4, \n     1964, buried under a mound of dirt;\n       Whereas on December 4, 1964, 21 White Mississippians from \n     Philadelphia, Mississippi, including the sheriff and his \n     deputy, were arrested, and the Department of Justice charged \n     them with conspiring to deprive Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, \n     and Michael\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\n     Schwerner of their civil rights, since murder was not a \n     Federal crime;\n       Whereas on December 10, 1964, the same day Dr. Martin \n     Luther King, Jr. received the Nobel Peace Prize, a United \n     States District judge dismissed charges against the 21 men \n     accused of depriving the 3 civil right workers of their civil \n     rights by murder;\n       Whereas in 1967, after an appeal to the Supreme Court and \n     new testimony, 7 individuals were found guilty, but 2 of the \n     defendants, including Edgar Ray Killen, who had been strongly \n     implicated in the murders by witnesses, were acquitted \n     because the jury came to a deadlock on their charges;\n       Whereas on January 6, 2005, a Neshoba County, Mississippi, \n     grand jury indicted Edgar Ray Killen on 3 counts of murder;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2005, a jury convicted Edgar Ray Killen \n     on 3 counts of manslaughter;\n       Whereas June 21, 2008, was the 44th anniversary of Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner's ultimate \n     sacrifice;\n       Whereas by the end of ``Freedom Summer'', volunteers, \n     including Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael \n     Schwerner, helped register 17,000 African-Americans to vote;\n       Whereas the national uproar in response to the deaths of \n     these brave men helped create the necessary climate to bring \n     about passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner \n     worked for freedom, democracy, and equal justice under the \n     law for all; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government should find an appropriate \n     way to honor these courageous young men and their \n     contributions to civil rights and voting rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) encourages all Americans to pause and remember Andrew \n     Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner and the 44th \n     anniversary of their deaths;\n       (2) commemorates the life and work of Andrew Goodman, James \n     Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and all of the other brave \n     Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of \n     civil rights and voting rights for all Americans; and\n       (3) commemorates and acknowledges the legacy of the brave \n     Americans who participated in the civil rights movement and \n     the role that they played in changing the hearts and minds of \n     Americans and creating the political climate necessary to \n     pass legislation to expand civil rights and voting rights for \n     all Americans.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, our colleague in the other \nChamber, John Lewis, joined us for lunch and brought along several \nFreedom Riders who knew very well the wonderful young people we are \nrecognizing by this resolution who lost their lives in the quest for \nfreedom and democracy during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. It \nwas a moving opportunity to listen to these remarkable individuals who, \ntoday, are gray in hair and getting older, but in their youth they \nstood up for democracy and freedom. It is worthy that this institution \nis recognizing them. I wanted to mention that this evening, as we \nagreed to this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/24/senate-section/article/S6096-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 25, 2008\n\n  Mr. DODD.
