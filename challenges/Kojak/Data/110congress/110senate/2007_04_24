Mr. President, may I, before I begin my comments \nprepared for today, make two quick comments.\n  No. 1, I note the passing of Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia and a \nmajor figure in the transition between the Communist rule and the \npresent democracy that exists in Russia. Like many Members of the body, \nI had the opportunity to meet Boris Yeltsin. That is one of the \nprivileges we have as Senators--we get to meet important people from \naround the world. I can't pretend to know him at all. I simply shook \nhis hand and said hello. But I was in Russia not long after he took \npower, spent time in the U.S. Embassy there, and noted the impact he \nhad on helping bring Russia into the modern world, the world of \ndemocracy, and out of the ancient world, the world of tyranny. He had \nhis faults. He had his problems. But he played a pivotal role, and we \nshould take a moment to recognize that fact.\n  The one quote attributed to him that I enjoyed personally with \nrespect to our life here has to do with the Library of Congress. When \nmy constituents come to Washington, I tell them: You need to go see the \nLibrary of Congress, the Jefferson Building. Aside from the\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nCapitol itself, it is the most beautiful building on Capitol Hill, and \nmaybe in Washington. Boris Yeltsin is said to have gone into the \nLibrary of Congress and looked around at that magnificent lobby and \nthen questioned: How did you get a building like this? You didn't have \nany czars.\n  Having been to the buildings in the Kremlin and seeing the kinds of \nthings the czars built, I understand that the Library of Congress \nprobably would have impressed him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4866-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

I felt touched by the things he asked on our \nbehalf. They were the kinds of things I need from our Heavenly Father. \nI was grateful to the Chaplain for his ability to touch on those.

Mr. President, I rise to turn my attention to a report \nthat was released yesterday, the annual report of the Board of Trustees \nof the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Disability \nInsurance Trust Funds. Those are fancy names for what we call Social \nSecurity.\n  With yesterday's release, they once again changed their projection as \nto what the future might hold with respect to Social Security, thus \nunderlying a point I have tried to make in my career in the Senate ever \nsince I arrived; that is, all projections about the future are wrong. I \ndon't know whether they are wrong on the high side or on the low side, \nbut they are always wrong. The closer we get to reality, the more we \nhave to adjust those projections and say: Well, it is closer to this, \nthat, and the other.\n  The most reliable projections are those which are 30 days out. The \nnext most reliable are those which are 3 months out and then those \nwhich are 6 months, those which are a year. Those which are 20 years or \n30 years out are all very much subject to challenge. We are seeing that \nhere. We have had projections on which we have based our speeches and \nour actions. Now we are seeing those projections get changed. But there \nis one projection that is not subject to change that has bearing on the \nissue of Social Security. I would like to put up a chart which \ndemonstrates that.\n  The reason this one is not subject to change is that all of the \npeople represented here are already born. These are people who are \nalready alive. These are not projections about demographics. These are \nnot projections about economics. These are the facts with respect to \nthe American population. This is a chart showing the percentage of \nAmericans who are over 65. Back in 1950, it was around 5 percent of \nAmericans who were over 65. Then it increased gradually over the years. \nNow it is closer to 10 percent. There was a dip in the percentage that \noccurred between 1990 and now. That dip represented the birthrate back \nin the Great Depression when people, for their own reasons, curtailed \nthe having of children. One could say it was primarily economic. \nChildren have ceased to be economic assets; they have become consumer \ngoods. When times are hard, you cut back on your consumer goods.\n  Then we had what we demographers call the baby boom. The GIs came \nhome from World War II. They started families. They started their \ncareers. They were filled with optimism, and they were willing to take \non some extra consumer goods. They had larger families. Those children \nare now reaching retirement age.\n  Starting in 2008, something is going to happen in America that has \nnever happened before in our history: The percentage of Americans over \nretirement age is going to double in a 20-year period. Then it will \ntaper off again, after we have absorbed the impact of the baby boom \ngeneration, and continue to increase but at a relatively minor rate. It \nis this phenomenon, this projection, which is a reliable one--because \nall of these people have been born--that is driving the crisis in \nSocial Security. It is not the Republicans who are driving the crisis. \nIt is not the Democrats who are responsible for the crisis. We should \nstop talking in partisan terms about this and recognize the reality. \nThis is a demographic reality. This is a demographic projection upon \nwhich we can rely.\n  Social Security is a program that covers everybody who works. It \ncovers the single mom who works as a waitress at the minimum wage, and \nit covers Oprah Winfrey and Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. The \nmultibillionaires receive Social Security. They receive Social Security \non the basis of the amount they pay into the program. The amount they \npay into the program is substantially more than the amount the single-\nmom waitress pays in. Because it is structured in that fashion, Oprah \nWinfrey will receive more than the single-mom waitress--indeed, \nsignificantly more. The question arises, under those circumstances, in \norder to deal with the shortfall that is described in the report issued \nby the trustees, do we need to continue that idea; that is, that Oprah \nWinfrey, with her billions, still should get more Social Security than \nthe single-mom waitress who, when she retires, has no personal safety \nnet whatsoever. I am not suggesting that what we do is penalize Oprah \nWinfrey or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates. I don't want to pick on Oprah \ntoo much, but she is perhaps the most visible all of these billionaires \nabout whom I speak.\n  There is something in the Social Security system that we should \naddress and that people on both sides of the aisle should address; that \nis, the way Social Security benefits are currently figured has in that \nmathematical formula a method of increasing the benefits to compensate \nfor inflation. The formula that is there increases the benefits more \nthan inflation goes up. We don't know that. Americans aren't aware of \nthat. We say: Here is the benefit line, and it should increase by so \nmuch with respect to inflation, and that is only fair. It increases \nmore than inflation actually goes up.\n  The late Senator Moynihan from New York used to say the way to deal \nwith this reality of the doubling of Americans over retirement age is \nto simply adjust the inflation adjustment to true inflation.\n  We are paying out more than inflation would justify. If we just back \nit down to pay out exactly what inflation would justify, then we solve \nthe problem. Then the report from the trustees says there will be \nenough money. It is the fact we have adjusted it higher than inflation \nthat is causing the money to disappear, causing the projections to be \nas bad as they are.\n  Let me show you what happens if we do not make some kind of \nadjustment. Here is another chart that takes the information that comes \nfrom the trustees and puts it in perspective. This flat line is the \nincome coming into the Social Security system. This blue line is the \npayout. As you will see, starting at about 2014, the amount paid out \nwill be more than the amount coming in.\n  How do we make up the difference? Well, it is in the trust fund. It \nis a commitment made by the Congress. So the Congress will put up the \nmoney. We will honor the commitment of the trust fund.\n  Then, around about 2040, 2041, all of a sudden the trust fund is \nexhausted, and, by law, you cannot pay out more than you have coming \nin--unless you dip into the trust fund. So if there is no trust fund, \nand you cannot pay out any more than you have coming in, the amount of \nbenefits drops dramatically back to the level of the income. That is \nwhere we are, and that is roughly a 25-percent cut across the board to \neverybody.\n  That is a 25-percent cut to the woman who waited on tables as a \nsingle mom and is now at retirement age and sees her benefits cut 25 \npercent. It is a 25-percent cut for Oprah Winfrey, who will not notice \nit. Indeed, she probably won't even be aware the Social Security check \nis coming in because in her billions that check gets lost.\n  This dotted line shown on the chart is what the benefits should have \nbeen if we had enough money. But we will not have enough money, and \nthat is where we will be.\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  Instead of waiting until 2041 to deal with this reality, what we \nshould do now is listen to what Senator Moynihan had to say--but with \nthis amendment, he said: Change the adjustment for inflation to match \nreal inflation, and you get enough money to keep the two together.\n  I say: Leave the present overly generous adjustment for inflation in \nplace for the single mom; that is, leave the present situation in place \nfor the bottom third of people who pay into the trust fund. Then say to \nOprah Winfrey and Bill Gates: You are going to have to struggle by with \njust inflation as it really is. We are not going to give you the \ninflation-plus energizer that we give to the bottom third.\n  Now, for those of us who fall somewhere in between the bottom third \nand Bill Gates, we can have a blend. We can have a mixture of the more \ngenerous benefits paid to the bottom third and the less generous \nbenefits paid to the top 1 percent. By simply making that kind of \nadjustment now--now, not waiting until 2041--we can avoid the crisis in \n2041.\n  Now, I have had conversations with my friends across the aisle about \nthis proposal for several years. I have introduced it as a piece of \nlegislation and discussed it with people around this Congress of both \nparties. This is the reaction I get: Bob, this is a good idea. This is \nsomething we probably ought to do. But we won't address the problem \nuntil after the next election.\n  Mr. President, the next election never comes. There never is an \n``after the next election.'' We are constantly demagoging the Social \nSecurity issue for political advantage and putting off the time when we \nmust deal with it.\n  So triggered by the occasion of the report released by the trustees \nof the Social Security trust funds, I say today, the time has come for \nboth parties to recognize this is a problem that will not go away. This \nis a projection we can trust, and it is time for us to put partisan \nadvantage or perceived partisan advantage aside and deal with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4867-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4867-S4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last night we had our first and only \nconference committee meeting where all the members from both \nAppropriations Committees who are on the conference committee, \nincluding members on the House side, had an opportunity to come \ntogether for their first gathering. I predict it will be the only \ngathering. Everything else in that supplemental has been worked out \nbehind doors, and a lot of us were not privy to it until legislation \nwas proposed in the conference committee yesterday.\n  I am very disappointed in that piece of legislation. There is a huge \nincrease in the amount of dollars being spent to try to placate some of \nthose who may otherwise oppose the legislation.\n  But my main concern with that legislation is it has timelines and \nbenchmarks in it that are going to tend to micromanage the conflict in \nIraq. I think that is a bad idea. In fact, I have indicated I am not \nwilling to sign the conference report that is going to come out of that \nparticular committee because of the language in there that does lay \ndown timelines and benchmarks. That creates a problem for our \ncommanders in the field in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, it was not very many months ago the Senate unanimously \napproved General Petraeus to head our efforts in Iraq. Many Members \nhave extolled the virtues of the general--his education, his \nleadership, and his commitment to his soldiers.\n  Unfortunately, we are still confronted with the reality that some \nwant to tie General Petraeus's hands. Confusingly enough, they want to \nreject the strategy General Petraeus has proposed in Iraq even before \nhe has been given the full opportunity to perform his mission.\n  I ask again: Why would we support him and recognize his stellar \ncareer with a unanimous nomination vote but not give him the means to \nget the job done? For what reason did my colleagues agree to send him \nto Iraq as the commander of our forces? His strategy in Iraq was made \nvery clear, both publicly and privately, and yet we are not willing to \nsupport it. It is vexing.\n  We need to avoid micromanaging the war from the floor of the Senate. \nLet our Commander in Chief perform his duties, and let our military \nleaders do their jobs. If we do not support them fully in the \nsupplemental bill, then I must continue to vote against any legislation \nthat sets arbitrary deadlines and thresholds in Iraq--and plead with my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  We cannot afford to set a deadline and walk away from Iraq. The cost \nof failure is too great to our future long-term national security. It \nis in America's security interests to have an Iraq that can sustain, \ngovern, and defend itself. Too much is at stake to simply abandon Iraq \nat this point. The price of failure is simply too great.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we have seen terrible results from \npolitical motives being placed above military necessities--the attempt \nat rescuing the American Embassy hostages from Tehran, or Beirut in the \n1980s, and Somalia in the 1990s. Leaving Iraq in the current situation \nwould be like the ending of our efforts in those areas as well. Our \nwithdrawal from these countries embolden the terrorists. Bin Laden \nhimself is on record after these withdrawals criticizing our lack of \nwill and questioning our commitment to fighting these zealots. We have \nto learn from our mistakes in the past.\n  How have we gotten to this point? Well, many of my colleagues in the \nSenate continue to beat the drum of the Iraq Study Group Report. They \ncontinue to state that their withdrawal proposal follows the report's \nrecommendations.\n  I would simply like to point out something to my colleagues. Unlike \nthe supplemental bill that will soon be voted on--or what I would like \nto call our surrender document--the Iraq Study Group Report does not \ncall for us to walk away from our mission. They do not call for us to \nwalk away from our mission. In fact, the Iraq Study Group Cochair, \nJames Baker, recently had this to say about artificial deadlines:\n\n       The [Iraq Study Group] report does not set timetables or \n     deadlines for the removal of troops, as contemplated by the \n     supplemental spending bills the House and Senate passed. In \n     fact, the report specifically opposes that approach. As many \n     military and political leaders told us, an arbitrary deadline \n     would allow the enemy to wait us out and would strengthen the \n     positions of extremists over moderates.\n\n  So here we are, a must-pass bill that flies in the face of what the \nIraq Study Group has recommended. But the Democratic majority is well \naware of what effect slowing down passage of the supplemental means to \nthe Department of Defense as a whole. Particularly, the House of \nRepresentatives has dragged its feet in appointing conferees to the \nbill, knowing full well the President intends to veto this legislation. \nIn fact, just yesterday, President Bush stated he would strongly object \nto any deadlines, stating that:\n\n       An artificial timetable of withdrawal would say to an \n     enemy, ``Just wait them out.'' It would say to the Iraqis, \n     ``Don't do hard things necessary to achieve our objectives.'' \n     And it would be discouraging to our troops.\n\n  He also stated he does not want ``Washington politicians trying to \ntell those who wear the uniform how to do their job.'' I agree with the \nPresident wholeheartedly.\n  By placing the President in the precarious position of vetoing this \nbill, even in the dire financial straits it places the Department of \nDefense, the other side of the aisle has chosen to play politics rather \nthan fund a clean bill that gives our soldiers in the field the \nresources they need.\n  The question remains, if the other side truly believes the war is \nlost, then why not cut off funding for the war entirely? The power of \nthe purse is in our constitutional authority as a Congress. If the \nmajority party wants to dictate Iraq policy to the President, rather \nthan put limitations on our military in Iraq, which would be a \ndisaster, they should attempt to no longer fund our efforts.\n  But I doubt that will happen because they know they do not have the \nvotes or the support for such a precipitous withdrawal. Instead, the \n``slow bleed strategy'' will continue from our colleagues in the Senate \nand the House that will, in my opinion, leave our troops dejected and \nless safe than before. This ill-advised strategy will clearly hand Al \nJazeera its propaganda message.\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\n  There is no doubt we face extremely difficult challenges in Iraq. We \nhave not made enough progress. Citizens of Iraq must be willing to \nfight for their own freedom. The President recognizes this, and his new \nplan is the result of increased commitments from the Iraqi Prime \nMinister. The President has developed a new plan with new leadership. \nWe should not jerk the rug out from under those we have put in charge \nin Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this bill and let us craft a clean \nfunding bill that will meet the priorities and needs of our men and \nwomen in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I want to follow on the remarks of my \ndear friend from Colorado related to the current situation in Iraq. It \nappears some movement has been made on the war supplemental. \nUnfortunately, it is a flawed piece of legislation, one the crafters of \nit well know will be vetoed by the President. It will be vetoed for \ngood reasons--because it contains completely unacceptable language, as \nwas just being pointed out.\n  It is impossible for us to micromanage what is happening in the \nfield. It is a bad idea for politicians in Washington to tell generals \nwhen and how they can move forces in a battle. It is a bad idea for us \nto slow-bleed our military as they face an unrelenting enemy. It is a \nbad idea for us to simply not have the wherewithal to stick with the \nfight at a time when it is difficult. The President this week again \nreiterated his commitment that he would veto a bill that had artificial \ntimetables for withdrawal and that would empower the enemy. It gives \nthe enemy hope and an opportunity to wait us out. There is no question \nabout that. A deadline simply tells the enemy by what date they need to \nknow that the American commitment is over.\n\n  Imagine the confusion for someone in Iraq trying to make a decision \nwhether to cast their lot which, in fact, may mean the death of himself \nor herself, and their family, to support our effort there toward a \ndemocratic country. If they had no anticipation that our commitment was \nequal to theirs, they might simply wait it out. So how can we ever turn \nthe political tide in our favor in Iraq if we don't show the commitment \nthe people of Iraq must have in order to make a commitment to our \nstated goals?\n  General Petraeus is here. He met with the President yesterday; he \nwill be meeting with Members of Congress. It is important that we ask \nhim his assessment of the current situation.\n  I know there are many who would be ready to suggest that the surge is \nnot working. In fact, the full surge is not in place because all of the \ntroops are yet to be deployed for the surge, but some who already said \nit wouldn't work are now saying it hasn't worked. I wish to have \nGeneral Petraeus's assessment of it. I want to know what the general on \nthe ground--not a politician in Washington--thinks about the effort of \nsuccess we are meeting with our effort at this point in time.\n  The Iraq Study Group has been mentioned. Congress should drop fixed \ndeadlines for withdrawals of U.S. forces. As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident needs flexibility on draft deployments. This is from the \ncochair of the Iraq Study Group, Democrat Lee Hamilton.\n  It is important that we recognize the Iraq Study Group not only when \nit is convenient but also when it might be inconvenient.\n  I think it is very important that we not sound the voice of defeat. \nImagine the surprise that must have come to our enemies--and whether we \nlike it or not, we have enemies--imagine the delight that must have \ncome when, from the halls of the Congress, from the leader of the \nSenate, they were told that they had, in fact, won; that the war was \nlost.\n  This is not the right thing to say at a time when our troops are \nengaged in battle. Nine U.S. soldiers lost their lives in the last 24 \nhours alone. This is a difficult time. It is not a pleasant time. It is \nnot an easy assignment. So for us to simply tell our troops in the \nfield they have been defeated when they in fact have not, and for us to \ntell our enemies that in fact they have won when in fact they have not, \nis not a good idea. I believe it is terribly important that we attempt \nsomehow in the midst of this rancor and debate that is so classic of \nmodern day Washington that we find it within ourselves to look beyond \nthe current moment of politics, beyond the political advantage that \nmight be gained at any one moment or another, and seek within the \ndepths of our souls the opportunity for us to begin to work together to \ntry to find a solution to this very difficult problem.\n  It is a sure thing that we, in fact, have a problem on our hands, \nthat Iraq is a difficult situation. There is no question they must \nreach a political settlement. There is no question that they must do--\nthe Iraqis themselves--the hard work of peace. However, as we do that, \nwe need to also find it within ourselves to find a way of shaping a \npolitical consensus, for us to find a way to begin to talk to one \nanother, not past one another, about how we resolve the issues in Iraq \nin a way that will enhance America's strength. It is not about \ndefeating a point of view. It is not about defeating President Bush. A \nloss in Iraq would be a defeat for the United States of America. So how \ndo we find a way to empower America to be a stronger country, to be a \nunited country as we seek to defeat the enemies of our country, which \nsurely are there, continuing to fight against us, wishing us to be \nunsuccessful, and wishing for our country to be defeated? We should \npull together, Republicans and Democrats all, to try to find the common \nground that will bring us to a sensible solution, to a sensible \noutcome, so America is not defeated, but the enemies of America are \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4868-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4868-S4869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BIPARTISANSHIP STARTS AT THE TOP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my good personal \nfriend and colleague from Florida, if we want to solve this and other \nproblems, we have to have some genuine bipartisanship, and that \nbipartisanship has to start at the top. There has to be an atmosphere \nof mutual respect and willingness to work together, and it has to start \nin the White House.\n  I have shared these comments publicly and privately. Whenever you \nface something as contentious as the matters we face--matters of war \nand peace, the making of Medicare financially solvent, the question of \nprescription drugs and their cost--you simply can't do it by taking a \nunilateral position over and over on either side of this aisle; it has \nto be that people have to come together and work it out. There also has \nto be a sense of mutual trust, of people telling the truth to each \nother, of doing what the standards were in the old days where a man's \nword was his bond. Until we get that, we are going to continue to have \ndifficulty.\n  We see the problems right now in a war that is certainly a difficult \none. We all share the same goal: that the interests of America are \nfurthered if we can stabilize Iraq. How do we get there? There has been \nso much mistrust and suspicion that has been bred because of all the \ninconsistencies and lack of information and misinformation and massaged \ninformation. But that is then; now is now. What do we do? Thus far, it \nlooks as though the White House and the leadership in Congress can't \ncome together. There is too much distrust.\n  I have said before and I will say again, thank goodness the Secretary \nof State is out on a new diplomatic initiative. It is not catty to say \nit is about time, because there certainly have been those forces within \nthe administration that have wanted this much more in the past, but I \nthink the Secretary of State is making a very valiant effort now, \nbecause you are not going to solve the problem in Iraq unless you can \nget all the neighbors in the region involved to make a political \nsolution stick.\n\n  Is a political solution viable? This Senator cannot say at this point \nthat it is a viable prospect because of the sectarian hatred we have \nseen play out over these last several months. But this hasn't just been \ngoing on for months; this has been going on for 1,327 years, ever since \nthe Battle of Karbala. I say to my colleague, who is my friend, and the \ntwo of us work together very well all the time, that a lot less \nrhetoric coming from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue would help this\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\nproblem, but I don't see it changing right now. I think that is a sad \ncommentary on the state of affairs.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I appreciate the Senator's comments, and I so much \nvalue our relationship and our ability to work across the aisle, \nbecause we seem to get a lot done when we do that. It is an encouraging \nsign on one of the very difficult issues of our day, which is \nimmigration, that we do seem to be working in a bipartisan way, and it \nis amazing what can be accomplished when we do work bipartisanly.\n  I can't help but be shaped by my own life experience, and I remember \nas I came to America and was learning the ways of this country, and I \nadmired so much this new land of mine, that I would marvel at the \nphrase: ``Politics ends at the water's edge.'' That used to be the \nstandard. There were these towering giants of another day who occupied \nthese very desks we now use as ours who seemed to find it within \nthemselves to reach a little higher to work across party lines in those \npostwar years, in the Cold War years when it was so essential.\n  I think what we need to adopt as a country is the understanding that \nthis struggle against this enemy is long term, that we are going to be \nin this fight for a long time, probably the time of your service and \nmine. I hope not, but perhaps. If we are going to be successful in that \nendeavor, we have to set politics aside. We have to find a way that we \ncan think of America first and whatever label we wear in a secondary \nway. I am not preaching to my colleague from Florida or anyone in \nparticular. Frankly, the blame lies on both sides of the aisle, with \nRepublicans as well as Democrats. We have to find a way we can move \nbeyond the momentary gain we might make over a 24-hour news cycle for \nthe longer term good of the Nation and the longer term good of what \nAmerica stands for to the world.\n  Anyway, maybe the Senator and I began a rare moment here this morning \nin talking about Iraq where we are not yelling at each other and we are \nactually talking about how we can bridge our differences and find \nconsensus as something that will help the American people.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, work in \nyour sphere of influence and this Senator will try to do the same. What \nwe have is an approaching train wreck, because if the Congress passes \nthis emergency funding bill for the war that has this language in it, \nif that passes this week, then the President is going to veto it next \nweek and that is going to leave us right back where we are, with both \nsides making a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric, but that doesn't get \nus any closer to where we are going. So I say to my colleague, look \nover the horizon beyond this week and see where we can come together.\n  I thought the most promising prospect was when Jim Baker and Lee \nHamilton came down with the Iraq Study Commission report. They showed, \nin a bipartisan way among very prominent people of both parties, how \nyou should approach this Iraq situation, and yet, that was last \nNovember or December when it came out, and here we are 4 months later \nand still we have not come together in common ground. So I would \nencourage my colleague to keep working.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4869-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KIDS AND CAR SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to talk about a sad \nsituation we can do something about. A year ago this little girl, \nVeronica Rosenfeld, and her mom were walking in their Boca Raton \nneighborhood. This little girl, Veronica, was about 5 feet ahead of her \nmother on the sidewalk when a neighbor, not seeing little Veronica, \nbacking out of the driveway, backed out over her and killed her. Her \nmother was right there, and there was nothing she could do about it. It \nis every parent's nightmare to certainly see their child die, but how \nmuch more horrible to lose them and be totally helpless in preventing a \nsenseless accident--an accident that could be prevented.\n  Let's talk about that, the prevention of the accident. Look what has \nhappened in the last 6 years. There has been a 138-percent increase in \nthe last 6 years in the number of children killed in these noncrash \nfatalities in which people back over a child because they can't see the \nchild. Several children are killed every week in the United States, and \nsadly--and this is why I bring it up again; I have brought it up \nseveral times to the Senate--this past weekend in Florida, two more \nchildren died in their driveways. In Hollywood, FL, a 3-year-old died \nwhen her father accidentally backed over her with his cargo van, and in \nFort Myers, a 5-year-old was killed by her 16-year-old brother when he \nwas parking the family car.\n  Mr. President, this month alone, April, there have been 11 children \nbacked over and killed in this country. These injuries and deaths \ncontinue to occur, even though we have the technology to prevent many \nof them. But we need legislation to put this technology to use. In \nApril alone--and we are not even to the end of April--they have \nhappened in Indiana, New York, Georgia, three in Florida, two in Texas, \ntwo in California, and one in Hawaii thus far. And it is only April 24.\n  This is why a bunch of us have gotten behind the Cameron Gulbransen \nKids and Cars Safety Act. It is a bipartisan bill that would provide \ndrivers with the means of detecting a child behind their vehicle. This \nbill would also ensure that power windows would automatically reverse \ndirection to prevent a child from being trapped and mandate a car's \nservice brake to engage to prevent rollaways. We have this technology \nin a lot of vehicles. We have been in the vehicles where there is a \nsignal that goes beep, beep, beep, and it becomes more frequent when an \nobject is detected behind the car. The technology is there, and it is \nalready being used. The same thing for windows. A child's head is in a \nwindow and suddenly the window goes up. It hits resistance and it \nreverses, and a parking brake automatically engages to prevent a \nrollaway on an incline.\n  Consumer groups have teamed with the parents of victims to suggest \nways that are relatively simple and inexpensive in order to ensure that \nmore parents won't have to endure the pain of losing a child. The \ntechnology is there. We all want to be safe behind the wheel of a car, \nespecially when we back up. How many times, when we back out of our \ngarage, do we have that nagging thought: Is there a child behind this \nvehicle I cannot see? Why go through this trauma anymore? Let's pass \nthis Kids and Cars Safety Act, and then we can stop a lot of these \nneedless deaths.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will proceed in morning business. I \nbelieve I have time allotted to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, President Bush has spent the last 2 weeks \ntalking up the ``progress'' we are making in Iraq and talking down the \nDemocrats and some of our Republican colleagues for trying to bring \nthis war to a responsible end. But sometimes that is a problem because \nyou have to deal with the facts. The facts are not as the President \nwants them to be but as they exist on the ground. The fact is, the \nPresident is totally out of touch with reality. He is out of touch with \nthe American people and with America's interests in the region.\n  I have been here a while, and I can say I have never seen a President \nas isolated since Richard Nixon. The President appears to be totally \nremoved from reality. He tells us that Attorney General Gonzales has \ndone a great job, when anybody who watched it views it as one of the \nleast impressive appearances of an Attorney General. He tells us that \nthe President of the World Bank, an American, is doing a great job, \noblivious to the damage being done to America's reputation around the \nworld. And against the advice of some of the most gifted military men \nand women in a generation,\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nhe has adopted a policy in Iraq that is a disaster.\n  The President argues that the surge is succeeding, but with every \nwelcome development he cites there is an equally unwelcome development \nthat gives lie to the claim that we are making any progress. For \nexample, while death squad violence against Iraqis is down in some \nBaghdad neighborhoods where we have surged, suicide bombings have \nincreased by 30 percent over the last 6 weeks. Violence is up \ndramatically in the belt ringing Baghdad. The civilian death toll has \nincreased 15 percent from February to March. When we squeeze a water \nballoon in one place, it bulges somewhere else. Moqtada al-Sadr has not \nbeen seen, but he has been heard, rallying his followers with anti-\nAmerican messages and his thugs to take on American troops in the \nsouth. Last week, he pulled his ministers from the coalition \ngovernment, and intelligence experts believe his militia is simply \nwaiting out the surge.\n  Closing markets to vehicles has precluded some car bombs, but it also \nhas prompted terrorists to change tactics and walk in with suicide \nvests. The road to the airport to Baghdad may be safer, but the skies \nabove it are more lethal; witness the ironic imposition of ``no-fly \nzones'' for our own helicopters.\n  Tal Affar is the most damaging evidence of the absolute absurdity of \nthis policy. The President cites it as progress.\n  Architects of the President's plan called Tal Affar a model because \nin 2005 we surged about 10,000 Americans and Iraqis to pacify the city. \nThen we left, just as our troops will have to leave the Baghdad \nneighborhoods after calm is established, if it is.\n  But what happened in Tal Affar? It was the scene of some of the most \nhorrific sectarian violence to date. A massive truck bomb aimed at the \nShiite community led to a retaliatory rampage by Shiite death squads, \naided by Iraqi police. Hundreds were killed. The population of Tal \nAffar, which was 200,000 people just a year or two ago, is down to \n80,000.\n  There is an even more basic problem with the President's progress \nreport, and it goes to the heart of the choices we now face in Iraq. \nWhatever tactical progress we may be making will amount to nothing if \nit is not serving a larger strategy for success. The administration's \nstrategy has virtually no prospect for success, and his strategy, in a \nnutshell, is the hope that the surge will buy President Maliki's \ngovernment time to broker the sustainable political settlement that our \nown military views as essential, and that is premised upon the notion \nof a central government in Baghdad with real power.\n\n  But there is no trust within the government, no trust of the \ngovernment by the people it purports to serve, and no capacity on the \npart of the government to deliver security or services. There is \nlittle, if any, prospect that this government will build that trust and \ncapacity any time soon.\n  How many times have colleagues heard, beginning in January, how there \nis an oil agreement, that they have gotten that deal? Has anybody seen \nthat deal, after we heralded it time and again as essential to pulling \nthis country together?\n  In short, the most basic premise of the President's approach--that \nthe Iraqi people will rally behind a strong central government, headed \nby Maliki, in fact will look out for their interests equitably--is \nfundamentally and fatally flawed. It will not happen in anybody's \nlifetime here, including the pages'.\n  If the President won't look at a program that is different than he is \nnow pursuing if his plan doesn't work, what will he do? History \nsuggests there are only a couple of ways, when there is a self-\nsustaining cycle of sectarian violence, to end it, and it is not to put \nAmerican troops in the middle of a city of 6.2 million people to try to \nquell a civil war.\n  Throughout history, four things have worked. You occupy the country \nfor a generation or more. Well, that is not in our DNA. We are not the \nPersian Empire or British Empire. You can install a dictator, after \nhaving removed one. Wouldn't that be the ultimate irony for the U.S. to \ndo that after taking one down. You can let them fight it out until one \nside massacres the other--not an option in that tinder box part of the \nworld. Lastly, you make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them \ncontrol over the fabric of their daily lives. You separate the parties, \nyou give them breathing room, and let them control their local police, \ntheir education, their religion, and their marriage. That is the only \npossibility. We can help Iraq change the focus to a limited central \ngovernment and a Federal system, which their constitution calls for. I \ncannot guarantee that my strategy will work, but I can guarantee that \nthe road the President has us on leads to nowhere with no end in sight.\n  We have to change course to end this war responsibly. That is what we \nare trying to do in Congress. Later this week, we will send to the \nPresident an emergency supplemental bill on Iraq that provides every \ndollar our troops need and more than the President requested. It also \nprovides what the majority of Americans expect and believe is \nnecessary: a plan to start to bring our troops home and bring this war \nto a responsible end, not escalate it indefinitely.\n  If the President vetoes the emergency spending bill, he is the one \nwho will be denying our troops the funding they need. He is the one who \nwill be denying the American people a path out of Iraq. The President's \ndouble talk on Iraq is reaching new heights of hypocrisy. I don't say \nthat lightly.\n  On April 16, the President claimed that setting a timetable to start \nbringing our troops home would ``legislate defeat.'' Just 2 days after \nthat, 2 days later, his own Secretary of Defense had this to say:\n\n       The push by Democrats to set a timetable for U.S. \n     withdrawal from Iraq has been helpful in showing Iraqis that \n     American patience is limited . . . that this is not an open-\n     ended commitment.\n\n  Then, in arguing against the supplemental, the President claimed that \nby sending him a bill he would somehow be forced to veto, the military \nwould run out of money for Iraq in mid-April--which is not true, by the \nway--and as a result, he would have to extend the tours of duty of the \ntroops already in Iraq.\n  Extending those tours, the President said, ``is unacceptable.'' \n``It's unacceptable to me, it's unacceptable to our veterans, it's \nunacceptable to our military families, and it's unacceptable to many in \nthis country.''\n  Unacceptable? The very next day, the administration announced its \nplans to do the ``unacceptable'' and extended the tours of every \nAmerican ground troop in Iraq by 3 months.\n  Talk about hypocrisy: Telling us the path out of Iraq is a way which \nis forcing him to veto a bill that will require him then to extend \ntours because of that veto and that is unacceptable, and the very next \nday he extends the tour of every person on the ground. Once one gets \nover the hypocrisy, that announcement is an urgent warning that the \nadministration's policy in Iraq cannot be sustained without doing \nterrible long-term damage to our military.\n  If this administration insists on keeping this many troops in Iraq \nuntil next year, we will have to send soldiers back for third, fourth, \nand fifth tours, extend deployment times from 6 months to a year for \nmarines, from 12 months to 16 to 18 months for the Army. The military \nwill also be forced to end the practice of keeping troops at home for \nat least 1 year between deployments, to fully mobilize the National \nGuard and Reserve, and to perpetuate this backdoor draft.\n  This President is breaking--is breaking--the military. We don't have \nto guess at the impact on this relentless readiness, its impact on \nretention and recruitment. This month, we learned that recent graduates \nof West Point are choosing to leave Active-Duty service at the highest \nrate in more than three decades. This administration's policies are \nliterally driving some of our best and brightest young officers out of \nthe military.\n  Instead of working with Democrats in Congress in a way forward, this \nPresident, divorced from reality, is accusing us of emboldening the \nenemy and undermining our troops. I have a message for you, Mr. \nPresident: The only thing that is emboldening the enemy is your failed \npolicy. Mr. President, the only mission you have accomplished is \nemboldening the enemy with your failed policy.\n  Instead of escalating the war with no end in sight, we have to start \nbringing this to a responsible conclusion. If the administration \ninsists on keeping this many troops next year, we are in serious, \nserious jeopardy.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n  I conclude by saying that I believe it is my obligation as a \nSenator--and I hope the obligation of everyone else--to keep \nrelentless, unending pressure on this President to come to grips with \nreality, to continually push every single day to say: Mr. President, \nstop; stop this policy of yours.\n  It is my hope, even though he is likely to veto this bill, that we \nwill keep the pressure on and ultimately convince at least a dozen of \nour Republican colleagues it is time to stop backing the President and \nstart backing the troops. It is time, Mr. President, to begin to \nresponsibly bring this war to an end.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4871-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

That will take a moment. Then we will go \nforward, if that is all right with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  We had a good discussion yesterday on the America COMPETES Act. To \nremind all Senators, this is the Reid-McConnell legislation, with 56 \ncosponsors, which seeks to help our country keep our brainpower \nadvantage so we can keep our jobs. It is the result of 2 years of work \nwithin this body through three committees principally but really five \nor six.\n  We asked the National Academy of Sciences to tell us exactly what we \nneed to do to keep our competitive advantage in the world in \ncompetition with China and India so our jobs don't go there, so we can \nkeep this remarkable situation we have of producing 30 percent of all \nthe money each year for 5 percent of the people, with at least half of \nthat based on our technological advantage. The National Academy of \nSciences gave us a list of recommendations in priority order. The \nCouncil on Competitiveness formed the basis of a Lieberman-Ensign bill, \nthe President made his own recommendations, and all that now has been \nworked through into this legislation.\n  I see Senator Bingaman. If I may, I would like to finish 3 or 4 \nminutes of remarks and then go to Senator Bingaman. \n\n  Yesterday, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Domenici, all of \nwhom have been leaders on this legislation, spoke on the floor. Senator \nChambliss as well spoke on the floor. Senator Bingaman, of course, has \nbeen a leader from the very beginning, asking the questions that helped \nproduce this result. So we have before us a leadership bill on a \nsubject that is as important as any.\n  Almost all Members of the Senate over the last 2 years have had \nplenty of opportunity to influence this bill, and most have in one way \nor the other. It has been a remarkable exercise. But there still is \ntime today and tomorrow for us to consider more options.\n  The President, last night by e-mail--someone in the White House--sent \na Statement of Administration Policy to Capitol Hill which outlines the \nadministration's views on the pending legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe President's remarks on January 31, 2006, from his State of the \nUnion Address in which he spoke about the importance of the \ncompetitiveness initiative.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As a courtesy to the administration, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the administration's Statement of \nAdministration Policy following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know how important the President \nbelieves this is. I have talked with him about it at least a half dozen \ntimes personally, usually in bipartisan sessions with a number of \nSenators, sometimes individually. I know the Vice President has been \ndeeply involved.\n  When there is some more time on the floor this afternoon, if we have \na lull in the debate, I will go through the Statement of Administration \nPolicy and talk about it a little bit. Basically, it is very helpful to \nus. It points out that there is not much difference between the amount \nof money the President proposes to spend over the next 4 years and the \namount we would propose to authorize to spend in this bill. As one \nmight expect, the President likes his new programs but doesn't like \nsome other new programs, and there are some other suggestions that are \nwell taken that we can talk about, perhaps accept amendments, at least \ndiscuss with the Democratic majority those amendments, and there will \nbe some amendments that are offered on the Senate floor.\n  I will reserve my comments on the President's Statement of \nAdministration Policy. It is good to have it. We will make it part of \nthe debate--and taking the President at his word--given the President's \nstatement and the administration policy statement that ``The \nadministration looks forward to working with Congress to address these \nvarious policy concerns as the legislative process moves forward.''\n  I defer to Senator Bingaman, if I may. Senator DeMint is ready to \noffer amendments and speak about them whenever that is appropriate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       State of the Union Address by the President, Jan. 31, 2006\n\n       ``And to keep America competitive, one commitment is \n     necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in \n     human talent and creativity. Our greatest advantage in the \n     world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious \n     people--and we're going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce \n     an American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage \n     innovation throughout our economy, and to give our Nation's \n     children a firm grounding in math and science.\n       First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the \n     most critical basic research programs in the physical \n     sciences over the next 10 years. This funding will support \n     the work of America's most creative minds as they explore \n     promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and \n     alternative energy sources.\n       Second, I propose to make permanent the research and \n     development tax credit--to encourage bolder private--sector \n     initiatives in technology. With more research in both the \n     public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of \n     life--and ensure that America will lead the world in \n     opportunity and innovation for decades to come.\n       Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and \n     science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough \n     to compete with other nations. We've made a good start in the \n     early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is \n     raising standards and lifting test scores across our country. \n     Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to \n     lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring \n     30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, \n     and give early help to students who struggle with math, so \n     they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we \n     ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will \n     ensure that America succeeds in the world.\n       Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that \n     all of us can share. I urge you to support the American \n     Competitiveness Initiative, and together we will show the \n     world what the American people can achieve.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 2007.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n     S. 761 America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote \n          Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act\n\n                (Sen. Reid (D) Nevada and 55 cosponsors)\n\n       One of the more important domestic priorities of the \n     Administration over the last two\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n     years has been the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), \n     a comprehensive strategy to keep our Nation the most \n     innovative in the world by increasing investments in research \n     and development (R), strengthening education, and \n     encouraging entrepreneurship. Thus, the Administration shares \n     the goals of S. 761 to ensure the continued economic \n     competitiveness of the United States through research and \n     education and has been encouraged by the bipartisan support \n     for addressing this vital topic. However, the Administration \n     has serious concerns with S. 761 in its current form. The \n     Administration believes that the bill does not prioritize \n     basic research, authorizes excessive and inappropriate \n     spending, and creates unnecessary bureaucracy and education \n     programs. The Administration looks forward to working with \n     Congress to address these various policy concerns as the \n     legislative process moves forward.\n       The research component of the ACI is a targeted effort to \n     focus increased funding on enhancing physical sciences and \n     engineering research at the three highest-leverage agencies--\n     the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of \n     Energy's (DOE) Office of Science, and the Department of \n     Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     (NIST). Unfortunately, the Senate bill creates at least 20 \n     new programs across many agencies that, if enacted, would \n     divert resources from and undermine and delay the priority \n     basic research. The Senate bill would cost over $61 billion \n     over the next four years--about $9 billion more than the \n     President's ACI proposals. The bill conflicts with the \n     Administration's well regarded Research and Development \n     Investment Criteria by diverting funds from critical basic \n     research to commercially-oriented research and other efforts \n     that are less deserving of Federal support.\n       The education components of the ACI are targeted toward \n     filling clear and specific gaps in the Federal funding \n     portfolio with programs that will improve the quality of math \n     and science education in the Nation's K-12 schools. The \n     Administration appreciates that the bill authorizes most of \n     the Department of Education programs the President called for \n     in the ACI. These include authorizations for: (1) The \n     Advanced Placement Program to increase the number of teachers \n     instructing and students enrolled in advanced placement or \n     international baccalaureate courses in mathematics, science, \n     or critical foreign languages; (2) the Math Now programs to \n     improve instruction in mathematics; and (3) part of the \n     President's National Security Language Initiative proposal to \n     strengthen the teaching and study of critical foreign \n     languages. However, the Administration is disappointed that \n     the bill does not authorize the President's Adjunct Teacher \n     Corps, to encourage math, science, and other professionals to \n     teach in our neediest middle and high schools.\n       Also, the Administration is concerned that the bill expands \n     many existing science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics (STEM) education programs that have not been \n     proven effective and creates new STEM education programs that \n     overlap with existing Federal programs. In its soon-to-be-\n     released report, the Academic Competitiveness Council has \n     identified 105 existing STEM education programs spending over \n     $3 billion annually, including 45 programs that support \n     training of STEM teachers, and found that very few of these \n     programs demonstrated evidence-based effectiveness. Given \n     this, the Administration believes it is premature to expand \n     or begin new STEM education programs that do not have a plan \n     in place for rigorous, independent evaluation or are \n     duplicative of existing Federal programs.\n       In addition to the excessive authorization levels, lack of \n     focus on basic research, and unnecessary new bureaucracy, \n     created by S. 761, the specific provisions of serious concern \n     include the following:\n       Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy (ARPA-E). The \n     Administration supports the conceptual goal of ARPA-E ``to \n     overcome the long-term and high-risk technological barriers \n     in the development of energy technologies.'' However, the \n     Administration continues to strongly object to this provision \n     due to serious doubts about the applicability of the national \n     defense model to the energy sector and because a new \n     bureaucracy at the DOE would drain resources from priority \n     basic research efforts. The Administration believes that the \n     goal of developing novel advanced energy technologies should \n     be addressed by giving the Secretary of Energy the \n     flexibility to empower and reward programs within existing \n     DOE offices to fund unique, crosscutting, and high-risk \n     research.\n       Innovation Acceleration Research. The Administration \n     strongly objects to requiring each Federal science agency to \n     set aside 8 percent of its research and development budget--a \n     new program of over $10 billion of the Federal R budget at \n     dozens of agencies--for projects that are ``too novel or span \n     too diverse a range of disciplines to fare well in the \n     traditional peer review process.'' Such a large earmark of \n     the agencies' ongoing research efforts would certainly have \n     negative, unintended consequences and could well impede the \n     ability of these agencies to carry out their missions.\n       Equitable Distribution of New Funds. The Administration \n     strongly objects to a requirement specifying particular \n     funding increases for Education and Human Resources (EHR) \n     activities at NSF. This is especially inappropriate while the \n     Administration is responding to the findings and \n     recommendations of the Academic Competitiveness Council to \n     ensure that funding is targeted toward programs with plans to \n     demonstrate effectiveness.\n       Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology. \n     The Administration believes that additional resources \n     provided to NIST should focus on existing internal \n     innovation-enabling research activities and strongly objects \n     to creating new programs that would drain resources from such \n     activities.\n       Specialty Schools for Mathematics and Science. The \n     Administration strongly objects to creating a responsibility \n     for DOE to establish or expand K-12 schools.\n       Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. \n     The Administration strongly objects to using DOE funds to \n     support State and local economic development activities. In \n     addition to diverting funds from priority research areas, \n     such a focus on commercialization is not a priority of the \n     Federal government and could result in putting the government \n     in the position of competing with private investment and \n     influencing market decisions in potentially inefficient and \n     ineffective ways.\n       Experiential-Based Learning Opportunities. The \n     Administration objects to creating new K-12 education \n     programs unless the need is clear and compelling, which is \n     not the case for this program. As illustrated by the Academic \n     Competitiveness Council's findings, the solution to improving \n     the Federal government's impact on STEM education must come \n     from identifying what works and improving the effectiveness \n     of existing efforts before starting new programs.\n       Federal Information and Communications Technology Research. \n     The Administration objects to the creation of a new program \n     specifically aimed at ``enhancing or facilitating the \n     availability and affordability of advanced communications \n     services.'' Such an industry- and sector-directed program is \n     well beyond NSF's traditional role of advancing the frontiers \n     of knowledge in the academic disciplines.\n       National Laboratories Centers of Excellence. The \n     Administration objects to the use of DOE funds to establish \n     Centers of Excellence at K-12 schools. The establishment of \n     school-based centers is not a proper role for DOE and would \n     divert national laboratory resources that currently benefit \n     their surrounding communities. The Administration believes \n     that the President's Adjunct Teacher Corps proposal is a more \n     promising approach to bringing subject experts into our \n     neediest schools.\n       Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research \n     (EPSCoR). The purpose of the EPSCoR program is to build \n     research capacity; it is not an education program. If EPSCoR \n     funds are diverted for the purpose of hiring faculty or \n     providing supplemental K-12 courses to precollege students, \n     there will be less money available for increasing the \n     research capacity in EPSCoR States.\n       Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. NSF's Robert \n     Noyce scholarship program is too new to have been evaluated \n     for its impact on improving the efficacy or retention of \n     teachers who are program graduates. Therefore, it is \n     unreasonable to increase the authorizations of appropriations \n     at the pace and magnitude called for in this provision.\n       NASA Funding for Basic Science and Research and Aeronautics \n     Research Institute. The Administration objects to the \n     redirection of unobligated balances from existing NASA \n     programs, because it would disrupt funding for ongoing \n     activities. The establishment of an Aeronautics Institute for \n     Research within NASA is objectionable because it would be \n     duplicative of the agency's existing Aeronautics Research \n     Mission Directorate.\n       Constitutional Concerns. Several provisions of the bill \n     incorporate classifications and preferences based on race, \n     national origin, or gender that are subject to the rigorous \n     standards applicable to such provisions under the equal \n     protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n     Amendment. (See sections 1405(d), 2003(a) and (d), 4005(b), \n     and 4009.) Unless the legislative record adequately \n     demonstrates that those standards are satisfied, those \n     provisions are objectionable on constitutional grounds.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I thank the \nSenator from South Carolina for their courtesy.\n  My understanding is that the Senator from South Carolina wishes to \nset aside the pending amendment and offer an amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I wish to bring up \nthree amendments and briefly speak on them, if I can.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will have to object to offering three \namendments. I have no problem if he wants to set aside the pending \namendment and bring one amendment up, whichever amendment he would \nlike, and we will deal with them one at a time. I think that will be \nthe appropriate procedure for us to follow.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is fine. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 928\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent to bring up amendment No. 928.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint], for himself, \n     Mr. Martinez, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Ensign, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 928.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with respect to \n      smaller public company options regarding internal controls)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SMALLER PUBLIC COMPANY OPTION REGARDING INTERNAL \n                   CONTROL PROVISION.\n\n       Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. \n     7262) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Smaller Public Company Option.--\n       ``(1) Voluntary compliance.--A smaller issuer shall not be \n     subject to the requirements of subsection (a), unless the \n     smaller issuer voluntarily elects to comply with such \n     requirements, in accordance with regulations prescribed by \n     the Commission. Any smaller issuer that does not elect to \n     comply with subsection (a) shall state such election, \n     together with the reasons therefor, in its annual report to \n     the Commission under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities \n     Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)).\n       ``(2) Definition of smaller issuer.--\n       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of this subsection, and \n     subject to subparagraph (B), the term `smaller issuer' means \n     an issuer for which an annual report is required by section \n     13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)), that--\n       ``(i) has a total market capitalization at the beginning of \n     the relevant reporting period of less than $700,000,000;\n       ``(ii) has total product and services revenue for that \n     reporting period of less than $125,000,000; or\n       ``(iii) has, at the beginning of the relevant reporting \n     period, fewer than 1500 record beneficial holders.\n       ``(B) Annual adjustments.--The amounts referred to in \n     clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be adjusted \n     annually to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index \n     for all urban consumers, United States city average, as \n     published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.''.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ngiving me time to speak on this important issue. The issue of American \ncompetitiveness is very important to me, as I know it is to all \nAmericans. It is the security of our jobs and our economic future. I am \nhere today to propose some amendments. I will begin with one that I \nthink will improve the bill.\n  I wish to first discuss Sarbanes-Oxley and how it relates to \ncompetitiveness in America. The bill we are discussing, which is S. \n761, the America COMPETES Act, seeks to improve America's international \ncompetitiveness by strengthening the quality of our labor force. \nHowever, labor is only one component of economic growth. Capital \ninvestment is another critical component of any vibrant and growing \neconomy. America's competitiveness is being challenged by other \ncountries, not only on the labor front but with capital formation as \nwell.\n  We could say, as Senator Alexander mentioned, this bill focuses on \nbrainpower. What we are trying to do is say brainpower plus capital \nequals success in America.\n  In 2000, $9 out of every $10 in stock offerings from foreign \ncompanies were invested inside the United States. In 2005, that number \ncompletely flipped, and $9 of every $10 in stock offerings from foreign \ncompanies were invested outside the United States. Some might argue \nthis is simply the result of foreign companies wishing to list closer \nto home, but I am afraid that is not the case. Cross-border listings \nare at an alltime high, and we are losing the competition for foreign \ncapital.\n  This chart demonstrates how the United States is doing compared to \nothers when it comes to attracting foreign capital. We begin in 2002 \nwhen Sarbanes-Oxley took effect. One can see this dark-blue line at the \nbottom is the U.S. exchanges, which have stayed basically flat, while \nmarkets in Hong Kong, London, and Singapore have continued to grow. \nThere is no reason we should continue to lose ground to these other \ncountries when it comes to investing.\n  We need to remember as Americans that the dollars which are used for \nresearch and development come from investment capital. There is no need \nfor us to be spending billions and billions of dollars to encourage \nAmericans to be better at math and science if the research and \ndevelopment is moving to other countries.\n  Some say these trends are simply the result of more sophisticated \nmarkets springing up abroad, but the evidence suggests otherwise. When \none speaks with international CEOs making the decisions to list on \nforeign exchanges, they repeatedly cite Sarbanes-Oxley as the reasons \nthey have listed abroad. That is why a report commissioned by Senator \nSchumer and Mayor Bloomberg cited section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley as the \nreason international companies are no longer bringing their capital to \nthe United States.\n  Section 404 requires public companies to conduct an additional audit \non their internal controls. These audits are most expensive for smaller \ncompanies. Numerous reports have found that section 404 produced a \nheavy cost upon small, publicly traded companies without a proportional \nbenefit. As a result, the regulatory burdens of section 404 on small \nbusinesses and companies--well, companies are choosing to raise capital \nin other markets.\n\n  A recent GAO study, requested by Senator Snowe, found the cost for \nsmall public companies to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley has been \ndisproportionately higher than for large companies. Small businesses in \nthe United States, afraid of complying with the complicated provisions \nof Sarbanes-Oxley, are choosing not to grow by listing publicly and \nare, instead, staying small and remaining private. This prevents \ncapital formation, it stunts job growth, and it makes our country less \ncompetitive in the global economy.\n  This is why Alan Greenspan recently said:\n\n       One good thing; Sarbox requires a CEO to certify the \n     financial statement. That's new and that's helpful. Having \n     said that, the rest we could do without. Section 404 is a \n     nightmare.\n\n  This is not a politically inspired amendment. This is an amendment \nthat recognizes we are hurting ourselves and we need to fix it. This is \nwhy an SEC advisory committee recommended that small businesses be \nexempt from section 404, and this is why I am offering the amendment \ntoday.\n  My amendment, No. 928, would make section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley \noptional for smaller companies with market capitalization of less than \n$700 million, revenue of less than $125 million, or fewer than 1,500 \nshareholders. Section 404 reporting would be optional for these smaller \ncompanies, but they would have to notify their shareholders in their \nannual report.\n  The Senate's Committee on Small Business held a hearing on this topic \nthis past week, and I applaud Senator Kerry for looking into this \nimportant issue. As my colleagues may know, both Republicans and \nDemocrats have suggested the need for reform, which makes my amendment \nconsistent with the bipartisan nature of this bill. My proposal has \nbeen introduced as a freestanding bill in this Congress as well as the \nlast Congress. It has also been introduced as part of a bill in the \nHouse by Representative Gregory Meeks, Democrat from New York, and \nenjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  Despite broad bipartisan support for my amendment, I expect some will \nobject to it based on timing. They may believe the Securities and \nExchange Commission is preparing to deal with this problem, so we \nshould give them more time to work. This is something I believed \nseveral years ago. But that is not only a weak excuse, it is a complete \ncopout. It has been 5 years since Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted, and each \nyear that goes by we are chasing more capital out of our country.\n  The SEC has a responsibility to address this issue, but so do we. We \nwrote the law. Congress created this problem, and we should not hide \nbehind some regulation when we have the ability to fix it. Furthermore, \nit is not clear that future action by the SEC will solve the problem. \nAccording to the Independent Community Bankers of America, the proposed \ninternal control guidance\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nunder section 404 is unlikely to reduce audit costs, particularly for \nsmaller public companies.\n  Some may also object because this provision has not been fully \nexamined in the committee of jurisdiction. This is a poor excuse as \nwell. American competitiveness should not suffer because a committee in \nCongress has failed to do its job. A bill such as Senate Bill 761, \nwhich seeks to improve the competitiveness of our labor force but does \nnothing for capital formation, may result in a highly qualified labor \nforce but without capital to spur economic growth and create the jobs \nthey need to make.\n  This is a competitiveness issue. It should be debated on this bill \nand we should all support it. There is no plan to consider this \nlegislation later this year, and it is probably the last opportunity we \nwill have to address it before the next election. My amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Martinez, Cornyn, and Ensign, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the thought that has gone \ninto the amendment, but, frankly, this is an amendment that is in the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee. Obviously, the Sarbanes-Oxley \nlegislation came out of the Banking Committee and it is squarely within \ntheir jurisdiction. We are informed they have not had a chance to \nreview the amendment, have not had a chance to have hearings on the \namendment, and wish a chance to come to the floor and discuss it before \nthere is any vote. There is some objection to going to any kind of vote \non it at this point, so I am not prepared to discuss the merits of it. \nI do believe we need to provide an opportunity for those Senators on \nthe Banking Committee who want to come and discuss the merits to come \nand engage in that debate.\n  However, I mention to the Senator from South Carolina, I am informed \nhe also has an amendment related to looking at the Tax Code for \npossible problems with barring innovation; is that correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are not in a position to say yet--we \nare trying to talk to the Finance Committee, because, of course, they \nhave jurisdiction over tax issues--but we are trying to determine if \nthere is any objection to Senator DeMint's amendment relating to taxes.\n  Perhaps the right thing to do, since the majority leader has tried--\nnot just on this bill but as a general matter--to avoid the \ncircumstance where we are bringing up amendments, setting aside \namendments; bringing up amendments, setting aside amendments, without \never having disposed of anything for a long period, perhaps the Senator \ncould go ahead and describe this other amendment related to taxes. By \nthe time he has completed that, we might know whether we are in a \nposition to proceed to some kind of action on that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. So the Senator would prefer my not bringing it up but \nonly describing it?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As I say, if it is another amendment that is going to \nrequire a debate and vote here, I think maybe we would want to go ahead \nand try to get the Banking Committee people here to deal with the \nSarbanes-Oxley amendment before we get the Finance Committee people \nhere to deal with the Tax Code amendment.\n  Perhaps the Senator could put the Senate on notice as to what the \namendment entails, and by the time he is through with that discussion, \nwe may know enough to be able to tell him whether we could accept the \namendment or whether there is going to be objection.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I think he will \nfind this amendment has a lot of bipartisan support. It actually was a \npart of the original bill. It is amendment No. 929, and it expands the \nstudy on barriers to innovation, which is in section 1102 of the bill.\n  What we do is ask that this study include the impact of the IRS Tax \nCode on innovation. It is very consistent with the bill. My amendment \ndoes not remove anything currently called for in the study, it simply \nadds the provision that allows this study to include the effect of our \nTax Code on innovation in America.\n  Specifically, the amendment calls on the Director of the Office of \nScience and Technology, through the National Academy of Sciences, to \nstudy all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including \ntax provisions, compliance costs, and reporting requirements that \ndiscourage innovation.\n  The IRS code increasingly overwhelms Americans with its growing \ncomplexity. It stymies entrepreneurship and economic growth, and it \nthreatens to prevent future generations of Americans from enjoying the \nsort of upward mobility their parents and grandparents enjoyed. This \nimportant provision was originally included in the study in last year's \nbill but it was dropped. My amendment puts it back in, and it will help \nus identify ways the IRS Tax Code is discouraging innovation and \nweakening American competitiveness.\n  I ask the Senator if he would still prefer I not bring it up? In the \ninterest of time, it may be helpful to have it on the table, and we \ncould perhaps then agree to it at a later time. Would the Senator still \nprefer I wait to bring it up?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Tennessee has \nsome comments on the amendment. Maybe we could continue with that \ndiscussion and debate for a few more minutes to see if we can get a \nlittle more of a response from people in the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor for the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his amendments and for his initiative for being here and \noffering them. He is helping us jump-start the discussion, and I want \nhim to know what we are doing is working on ways to get to action on \nhis bills, not the reverse.\n  In fact, as far as his suggestion about considering the impact of \ntaxes as barriers to innovation, I think he is right about that. That \nwas a part of the original legislation. It had 70 sponsors at one time, \nthe PACE Act. It was the Domenici-Bingaman act at that time. It is also \na part of the Augustine report. These were the recommendations of the \nNational Academy of Sciences team, which included 21 individuals who \nspent the entire summer and early fall of 2005 looking at exactly what \nwe needed to do, and they recommended tax incentives for U.S.-based \ninnovation.\n  This was a practical group, this Augustine committee. They made 20 \nrecommendations. They knew there were a number of things that, if they \nrecommended them, we wouldn't pass because we would have differences of \nopinion about them. So they stayed away from some areas. For example, \nsince kindergarten through the 12th grade was their No. 1 priority in \nterms of improving education and encouraging innovation there, they \nmight have felt giving low-income families scholarships or vouchers to \ngo to private schools would be a good thing to do. But they didn't put \nthat in their top 20 because they knew it was unlikely we would be able \nto agree on that here.\n  I think the same is true here with taxes. They specifically said on \npage 10 of the summary of their ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' \nthat while they recommended making permanent the research and \ndevelopment tax credit as one change in tax policy, they realized that \nwasn't enough to consider it. They mention other alternatives that \nshould be examined to see if it would be beneficial to the United \nStates. These alternatives, the summary said:\n\n       . . . could include changes in overall corporate tax rates \n     and special tax provisions providing research of high-\n     technology and manufacturing equipment, treatment of capital \n     gains, and incentives for long-term investment innovation. \n     The Council of Economic Advisers and the Congressional Budget \n     Office should conduct a comprehensive analysis to examine how \n     the United States compares with other nations as a location \n     for innovation and related activities with a view to ensuring \n     the United States is one of the most attractive places in the \n     world for long-term innovation related investment and the \n     jobs relating from that investment from a tax standpoint.\n\n  That is not now the case, is what the Augustine report said. So I \nbelieve the Senator from South Carolina is making a real contribution \nto the debate here. His amendment which he proposes to bring up would \nimprove the bill, in my\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nopinion. It was once a part of the legislation that was similar, and I \nam hopeful the Finance Committee will recognize this simply amends a \nstudy that is already in the bill so tax barriers can be included as \npart of that study.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the response by the Democratic \nmanager as to how we shall proceed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed we do not have a clear \nresponse from the Finance Committee. I agree with the substance of what \nthe Senator from Tennessee said. I don't see this causes any difficulty \nin the overall thrust of the legislation, so I would be inclined to \nurge the Senator from South Carolina to go ahead and ask permission to \nset aside the pending amendment, bring this up, and then conclude any \ndebate he wants to on this amendment related to the study, and then we \ncan dispose of it--by voice vote, as far as I am concerned, unless the \nSenator wants a recorded vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 929\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 929.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 929.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the study on barriers to innovation to include an \n   examination of the impact of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on \n                              innovation)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 7 through 9, and insert the \n     following:\n       (10) all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     including tax provisions, compliance costs, and reporting \n     requirements, that discourage innovation;\n       (11) the extent to which Federal funding promotes or \n     hinders innovation; and\n       (12) the extent to which individuals are being\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have explained what this amendment does. \nIt is very simple. In addition to a study, if we are commissioning a \nstudy and paying for it, to find out what obstacles we have to \ninnovation, the Tax Code is certainly something that is cited often by \nfolks who invest and do the research and development, who are actually \nassociated with innovation in the marketplace, so it makes sense that \nwe include any obstacles in the Tax Code or any opportunities we may \nhave, as the Senator from Tennessee suggested, to create incentives for \ninvestment and innovation.\n  There is a relationship between this amendment and the first one I \nbrought up. I think we all know that investment, incentives for \ninvestment, are the catalyst for the research and development that \nresults in innovation in the marketplace. As a nation, if we do not do \nmore to attract capital, if we do not do more to encourage investment \nin our country, then those investments are not going to be here.\n  For many years we have been concerned that because of certain trade \npolicies and other things we do internally, we have lost low-wage jobs. \nBut increasingly we are hearing that because the investment dollars are \nmoving overseas, behind those investment dollars go the high-tech jobs \nthat are involved with research and development.\n  Both of these amendments are important. I would particularly like \nvotes on this because it was stripped out once. I am concerned that if \nwe do not have a vote and give the Members an opportunity to show \nsupport, particularly for this tax study, it will disappear again in \nconference.\n  My hope is we can have a vote and the yeas and nays on these \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we need to determine when we would want \nto go ahead since, as I understand the Senator, he wishes a rollcall \nvote. We want to have a chance to check with our floor managers, the \nassistant majority leader, and determine when this is appropriate, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 930\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in the interest of time--I know we are \ndiscussing two other amendments and the bill managers have asked me not \nto bring up a third. I will not bring it up at this time but I wish to \nspeak on it, if that would expedite procedures here on the floor.\n  My third amendment, which is amendment No. 930, which we will bring \nup at a later time, establishes a 60-vote point of order against \nappropriations bills that contain congressional earmarks for funds \nauthorized in this bill, S. 761, the America COMPETES Act.\n  The goal of this amendment is to ensure that funds authorized in the \nbill are allocated according to a competitive or merit-based process. \nAs my colleagues know, congressional earmarks circumvent the normal \ncompetitive or merit-based process and award funds based on politics. \nMy amendment is consistent with the stated intent of the bill, which \nsays on page 183 that nothing in divisions A or D shall be interpreted \nto require the National Science Foundation to ``alter or modify its \nmerit-review system or peer-review process'' or ``exclude the awarding \nof any proposal by means of the merit-review or peer-review process.''\n  My goal here is to make sure this new fund does not become a new pot \nfor earmarks, that we start directing this new money back to our States \nor congressional districts because we put new funds on the table. If \nthese and other funds authorized in the bill are going to be allocated \nin the most efficient and most competitive way, the Senate must take \nsteps to discourage the use of earmarks when appropriating funds for \nthese programs. My amendment will not only preserve the integrity of \nthe competitiveness allocation process but it will make America more \ncompetitive by making these programs more effective.\n  In a bill that is about competition, this amendment makes sure the \nmoney is allocated on a merit-based competitive system instead of \nturning it into a new slush fund for Congress.\n  Out of respect for the managers, I will not bring that amendment up \nat this point but I hope to do that at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly speak to the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Carolina related to earmarks. I obviously would \nhave to object to it. I think he will find probably any and all \nSenators involved with appropriations would have to object to it. The \nway I read it, it says it is not in order to consider any bill that \nproposes a congressional earmark on appropriated funds unless you have \n60 votes. The definition of a congressional earmark is contained in the \nlegislation, but any appropriations bill that comes to the floor \nvirtually by definition is going to contain something that falls into \nthis definition of congressional earmark. It is one thing to be \nconcerned about the addition of earmarks once the Appropriations \nCommittee has presented legislation to the Congress or to the full \nSenate. But to say we cannot bring up a bill, an appropriations bill, \nif it has anything in it that might meet this definition is \nsubstantially more onerous than I would think would be good policy.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DeMINT. For a clarification. The way this amendment is written, \nit is not all appropriations bills, just appropriations bills that are \nappropriating money for this act, the America COMPETES Act. We are not \nbringing in all the appropriations bills that will be brought to the \nfloor.\n  The point is, we are creating this new fund for competition. Instead \nof us in the future redirecting these funds in all directions, the bill \nhas been very careful to lay out where this money will go in a way that \nwe think is most efficient. This money will be allocated on a merit-\nbased system. We have seen some of it before, how the National Science \nFoundation and others are merit based. We want to keep it that\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nway. What we are trying to do is avoid, in the future, that this new \nmoney we have authorized starts being redirected. If something comes up \nthat is important, that we agree on, we can always overcome a 60-vote \npoint of order. But if we allow this to fester, as we have seen in the \npast, instead of going to create competition in America, it will be \ngoing off to special projects. So it focuses on this bill and prevents \npolitically driven earmarks.\n\n  Certainly we have directed the money for this whole bill. It doesn't \nchange that. This is all authorized. We are not talking about \nauthorized dollars, we are talking about redirecting it based on \npolitical motives in the future.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing that clarification.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the \nclarification, but I do think the problem remains because this bill is \nfar reaching because this bill covers quite a few Federal agencies and \ntries to lay out a blueprint for what we hope we will be able to \nprovide by way of appropriations to these agencies in the future, \nwhether it is the National Science Foundation, whether it is the Office \nof Science in the Department Energy, whether it is the Department of \nEducation, Health and Human Services--there are various agencies that \nwould obtain funding to carry out the purposes of this legislation if \nwe are successful through the appropriations process.\n  For us to be putting a provision in this authorizing bill saying you \ncannot bring an appropriations bill to the floor that contains anything \nwe would define as a congressional earmark is unduly restricting the \nauthority and the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee in \nputting together legislation they think makes sense.\n  I am well aware there are three sort of distinct hurdles that need to \nbe surmounted in order for us to actually get funds to be spent on \nthese good purposes that are outlined in this bill. One of those \nhurdles is the Budget Act. We need to be sure there is room in the \nBudget Act for the funding we are calling for in this legislation. We \noffered an amendment to do that. We got very good support here in the \nSenate. Senator Alexander and I offered that and I think that was a \nmajor step forward.\n  The second hurdle, of course, is trying to authorize these programs \nso if the funds are appropriated for these purposes nobody can raise an \nobjection that these are not authorized uses of the funds.\n  Then the third and perhaps most difficult is, each year over the next \nseveral years, the period that is covered by the legislation--each year \nwe are going to have to try to see that the funds are properly \nappropriated for these agencies to carry out the work as outlined in \nthis bill.\n  I think it would be foolhardy for us to be requiring that before you \ncan bring a bill to the floor that contained funding related to this \nauthorization bill, if it could be construed to fall under this \ndefinition of congressional earmark, you would have to have 60 votes to \nproceed to that appropriations bill. That would be an unprecedented \nprocedure for us in the Senate and one that would be very wrongheaded. \nAs I say, people involved in the appropriations process would probably \nsee it that way as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can I make a comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding the Senator is not calling up the \namendment but is only speaking to it for the Record.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Could I make one additional comment?\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator's remarks, and obviously we don't \nwant to tie the hands of Congress unnecessarily, but when we are \nspeaking of earmarks--and we defined it in this amendment ourselves. \nWhen we take this bill that was created for the purpose of improving \ncompetitiveness in America and we earmark, which means we target it to \na specific State, locality, or congressional district other than \nthrough a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive \naward process--when we take what we have done and basically pervert it \ninto a system where I want it to go to South Carolina, or the Senator \nwants it to go to Tennessee, that has nothing to do with the original \nintent of the bill, we call that an earmark. We would like to prevent \nthat if we could with this one bill, but I appreciate the courtesy of \nboth managers to allow us to explain. I hope we will have an \nopportunity to bring it up and offer it later.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation. All of us understand we have an obligation in Congress to \ndevise policies and means by which the American economy can compete and \ncreate good-paying jobs. Whether one lives in Pennsylvania or Illinois \nor New Mexico or Tennessee, we have lost a lot of good manufacturing \njobs over the last few years. We know there have been growth \nindustries. We can look at the whole Silicon Valley phenomena. Whether \nit is information technology or computers, the United States has taken \na leadership position. But in many areas, we are not in leadership \npositions.\n  Senators Alexander and Bingaman came together over a year ago to sit \ndown with some of the experts in Washington and talk about what we \nneeded to do to make America more competitive, the next generation of \ngood-paying jobs, the horizons we ought to look to to build for the \nfuture. They put together a strong bipartisan bill. If Members read the \ncosponsors, they will find plenty of support on both sides of the \naisle. This may be one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation \nwe have had in the Senate so far this session. I hope we have more. I \nam honored to support it and be a cosponsor.\n  I hope we can move beyond the many amendments that are going to be \noffered and consider this bill on a timely basis. It is the nature of \nthe Senate that it is a deliberative body. Occasionally, when there is \na lapse, we actually break into real debate on the Senate floor. People \nacross the Nation applaud when they hear that happen. In this \nsituation, I am not suggesting that we should not debate amendments to \nthe bill. In fact, I will describe one in a moment. But I am prepared \nto pull my amendment back because I don't want to stop this bill. I \nwant it to pass the Senate and the House. I want it enacted into law. I \nhope other Members who have a positive belief about this legislation \nwill think twice about whether they need to gild the lily and add \nsomething to a positive and substantive bill.\n  The issue I would like to speak to is one I believe in very strongly. \nI have an amendment, but I won't stop this bill to offer it. If it \nappears to have any objection or resistance, I will save it for another \nday. It is one that fits into this competitiveness issue.\n  The United States graduates some of the world's best engineers, \nscientists, and mathematicians. However, countries such as China and \nIndia are catching up. They are educating a higher proportion of their \nstudents in these fields.\n  We have heard the statistics from the National Academy of Sciences \nreport ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' In 2004, China graduated \n600,000 engineers. India graduated 350,000 engineers. The United States \ngraduated 70,000. In 2004, only a third of the undergraduate degrees \nawarded in the United States were in science or engineering. In China, \nthe number was 59 percent; in Japan, 66 percent in science and \nengineering.\n  Our country can understand when our economic security and our future \nare at stake, and we have risen to the occasion. I remember back in the \n1950s when the Russians launched Sputnik. We didn't think they were \ncapable of that. When they put the first satellite in space, it caused \ngreat fear across the United States. As a result, Congress did \nsomething it had never done before: It created Federal assistance to \nhigher education. It created a loan program to encourage students to go \nto college. I know about that program because that is the way I went to \ncollege. It was called the National Defense Education Act. I borrowed \nenough money to get through college and law school, paid it back at a \nmodest interest rate, and believe it was a good investment. I have had \na pretty good life as a result of it and maybe have added something to \nthis great country in the process. Thousands of others went through the \nsame experience. Congress responded.\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nWe knew we needed to invest in our country by first investing in \neducation.\n  The same thing is true with competitiveness. We can talk about a lot \nof actions that might achieve our goals, but education is the starting \npoint. We have documented the technological challenges to our country \nfrom many different angles. The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates; the \nchairman of Intel, Craig Barrett; a journalist, writer Tom Friedman; \nand the National Academy of Sciences have all told us this. All agree \nwe need to strengthen students' proficiency in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and foreign languages. The America COMPETES Act \ninvests in the R and education our country needs to make sure we \nremain the world's technological innovator.\n  In our increasingly global economy, we need more youth to pursue \nmath, science, engineering, technological, and critical foreign \nlanguage degrees. Our young people also need an appropriate knowledge \nand understanding of the world beyond our borders. You have heard me \nspeak many times on the floor about one of our Nation's greatest public \nservants, my predecessor, the late Senator Paul Simon. Paul understood \nthat our country needed to invest in math and science. He also \nenvisioned a United States populated by a generation of Americans with \na greater knowledge of the world, a generation of our Nation's future \nleaders that has been abroad and has a personal connection to another \npart of the world.\n  In the months before his untimely death, Senator Simon came to \nWashington. I met with him. We talked as well with his former \ncolleagues about the need to strengthen our Nation's international \nunderstanding in the 21st century. Paul Simon knew that America's \nsecurity, global competitiveness, and diplomatic effforts in working \ntoward a peaceful society rest on our young people's global competence \nand ability to appreciate language and culture beyond the United \nStates.\n  I filed as an amendment to this bill an amendment which we have \nentitled the ``Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act.'' It is \nan initiative that honors Paul's commitment to international education \nand brings his vision one step closer to reality. The Simon Act \nencourages and supports the experience of studying abroad in developing \ncountries, countries where people with a different culture, language, \ngovernment, and religion will give a person a different life \nexperience. It aims to have at least 1 million undergraduate students \nstudy abroad annually within 10 years and expands study-abroad \nopportunities for students currently underrepresented.\n  The Simon Act establishes study abroad as a national priority and \nprovides the catalyst for the education community to commit to making \nstudy abroad an institutional priority. An independent public-private \nentity, the Senator Paul Simon Foundation, would carry out the goal of \nmaking studying abroad in high-quality programs in diverse locations \naround the world routine rather than the exception. Students who were \npreviously unable to study abroad due to financial constraints would be \neligible for grants. The grants would also provide colleges and \nuniversities and other nongovernmental institutions financial \nincentives to develop programs that make it easier for college students \nto study abroad.\n\n  We can't afford not to invest in thoughtful Federal initiatives that \nfoster innovation. We must ensure that future leaders understand \nscience and engineering and the world in which they live. The future of \nour country depends on having globally literate citizens. I believe the \nPaul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act would help to achieve that goal.\n  There is one other area that would be helpful when it comes to \ncompetitiveness. Most of us know today what a miracle computers have \nturned out to be. They really bring so much information to our \nfingertips which long ago was hard to find. I can recall as a college \nstudent walking across the street to the Library of Congress, sending \nin the little slips of paper and ordering a big stack of books and \nsearching through them to find information which I can now Google in a \nmatter of seconds. That is great. That information is helpful. But if \none is going to be able to take advantage of that opportunity, one \nneeds to have access to high-speed computers.\n  There are many parts of America--Washington and Capitol Hill would be \ngood examples--that have broadband access now. We take it for granted. \nI represent a diverse State, Illinois, which has the great city of \nChicago as our largest city but also has a lot of small towns and rural \nareas, not unlike Tennessee or New Mexico. It is important for the \ndevelopment of education, health care, and business for us to expand \nbroadband access in America to areas that are currently not served.\n  I have introduced a bill, which is being considered before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, on broadband access. I would like to share a \nstatistic which Members might consider. According to the OECD, the \nUnited States fell from 4th in the world in broadband access per capita \nin 2001 to 12th in 2006. As of 2006, the International \nTelecommunication Union listed the United States 16th worldwide in \nterms of broadband access. We are now behind South Korea, Belgium, \nIsrael, and Switzerland, among other nations.\n  In today's highly competitive international markets, our children, \nbusinesses, and communities are competing with their peers around the \nworld for jobs, market share, business, and information. It concerns me \nthat with the size and dynamism of our economy, we are falling behind \nin an area where we should have a natural advantage. As we committed \nourselves to a National Defense Education Act to make sure we had \ntrained people, educated people to compete against the Soviet Union in \nthat era and now in the world, we also need to make sure the tools for \ncompetition are available.\n  I will be offering this broadband access act not as an amendment to \nthis bill but at a later date. I hope those representing States across \nthe Nation who believe there are digital divides will join me in making \nsure this important tool is available to every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:17 \np.m., the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to amendment No. \n929; that at 2:15 p.m., there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween Senators Baucus and DeMint or their designees and that no \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that upon the \nconclusion of the vote, Senator Kennedy be recognized to speak on the \nbill; that following Senator Kennedy, Senator Coburn be recognized as \nprovided for under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me inquire of the parliamentary \nsituation. I believe, under the agreement, we will now go off this \nlegislation, and we are ready to have some remarks with regard to the \njudicial nomination for the Southern District of Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that is to begin at \nnoon.\n  Mr. LOTT. So are we ready to proceed? I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to begin my remarks in support of this nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4877-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4877-S4880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF HALIL SULEYMAN OZERDEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure be here to speak on behalf \nof the confirmation of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\nCourt for south Mississippi. I am truly pleased that the President has \nnominated this outstanding young attorney to this position in \nMississippi. I thank the Judiciary Committee for the expeditious \nhandling of the nomination. I particularly thank the chairman, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator \nSpecter, for moving the nomination forward.\n  I made it a particular point of pronouncing his name and trying to \nget it correct because this is a very highly qualified nominee but an \nunusual one. I believe he will probably be the only Turkish American to \nserve on the Federal judiciary anywhere in America. We didn't select \nhim because of that, but it is a fact. He has an outstanding record, \nand he will be an outstanding member of the judiciary.\n  Long before I knew this young man, I met his father. Sul is the son \nof a Gulfport, MS, doctor, psychiatrist, a Turkish immigrant, and \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. He was truly a well respected citizen in the \ncommunity as well as a doctor.\n  I met him back when I was in the House of Representatives, years ago, \nin the 1970s, as a matter of fact. His father came to visit my office \non the Mississippi gulf coast one day to thank me for a controversial \nvote I had cast, one that was particularly unpopular with a lot of my \nconstituents. Well, now, House Members are not used to people actually \ncoming to their office and thanking them for casting a vote a lot of \npeople disagree with, so I took a particular liking to this doctor, and \nI stayed in touch with him and his family over these past 30 years.\n  But I was particularly impressed, as I watched the doctor's son grow \nup and achieve such a tremendous record.\n  I began hearing about Sul, his professional accomplishments, and the \nimpact that he was having on the gulf coast community. Now one of the \nmost respected young lawyers in Mississippi, Sul may soon have the rare \nopportunity to serve both his community and his country as a Federal \njudge.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to deal with \ncountless judicial nominees. Seldom have I seen a nominee who comes as \nhighly recommended--and who is as highly credentialed--as Sul Ozerden.\n  This young man graduated from what was then a very large high school \nin Mississippi, Gulfport High School, in 1985. He was salutatorian in \nhis class. He then attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign \nService on a Navy ROTC scholarship, graduating magna cum laude and Phi \nBeta Kappa in 1989.\n  Following graduation, he served 6 years active duty as a commissioned \nofficer and naval flight officer in the U.S. Navy, where he achieved \nthe rank of lieutenant as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator. He was \nawarded the Navy Commendation Medal for missions flown over Iraq during \nOperation Southern Watch and Somalia during Operation Restore Hope.\n  After his military service, he earned his law degree from Stanford \nLaw School, where he served as associate editor for the Stanford Law \nReview. Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable Eldon \nFallon, U.S. district court judge in New Orleans, before returning home \nto enter the private practice of law in Gulfport.\n  That is an incredible record, outstanding record--in high school, in \ncollege, in the military, and law school, and he served as a clerk to a \nFederal judge. He has all the credentials that will qualify him for \nthis position.\n  He then returned to the gulf coast as a shareholder in one of the \ngulf coast's most respected firms, Dukes, Dukes, Keating & Faneca, \nwhere his practice has focused on general civil defense litigation, \nrepresentation of local law enforcement and governmental entities, and \ncommercial transactions and litigation.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Sul is also involved \nin his community, as his father was. He has served as a mentor in the \nGulfport Public School District. He has been named ``Volunteer of the \nYear'' by the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce, an area where we have had a \nlot of voluntarism in the last 2 years to help people and help our \ncommunities recover from Hurricane Katrina. He served on the board of \ndirectors--and as president--of the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce. He \nalso served as the president of the Gulfport Business Club. He was also \nnamed as one of the Sun Herald newspaper's ``Top 10 Business Leaders \nUnder 40'' for the southern part of the State of Mississippi.\n  He is active in his church, St. Peter's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church, \nwhere he is on the church's building committee--an extremely important \nposition within a church seeking to rebuild from devastation caused by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  President Bush has nominated one of south Mississippi's finest to \nfill one of Mississippi's most important positions. Sul's academic \ncredentials, brilliant mind, analytical ability, legal skills, world \nexperiences and common sense are rare qualities in one person. The \nFederal judiciary is lucky to have the opportunity to secure the \nservices of Sul Ozerden, and I look forward to his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I do not know when I have supported a nominee to be a \nFederal judge in Mississippi more than I do this one. I am very proud \nof this nomination, and he will surely be overwhelmingly confirmed in a \nfew minutes. Sul Ozerden, of Gulfport, MS, will be a credit to his \nparents, the community, and to the Federal judiciary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased this nomination is now \nbefore the Senate. The nominee is very well qualified to serve as a \nFederal judge. He is a highly respected lawyer with a keen sense of \nfairness. I think he will reflect great credit on the Federal \njudiciary.\n  Sul graduated magna cum laude from the Georgetown University School \nof Foreign Service, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  After graduating from Georgetown, he attended the U.S. Navy Flight \nSchool in Pensacola, FL, and then served for 5 years as a naval \nofficer. He served as a bombardier and navigator aboard A-6E Intruder \naircraft and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for missions flown \nover Iraq and during Operation Restore Hope in 1992 and 1993. He also \ncompleted deployments to the Western Pacific and to the Persian Gulf \naboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk from 1992 to 1994.\n  Sul is also a graduate of the Stanford University School of Law, \nwhere he served as an associate editor on the Law Review.\n  He then served as a law clerk to the Honorable Eldon E. Fallon, U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  He then joined the law firm of Dukes, Dukes, Keating & Faneca in \nGulfport, MS, a highly respected law firm in our State. He has \npracticed in State and Federal courts throughout the Southeast and \nserved as lead counsel in a wide range of complex cases.\n  Sul is ranked by his fellow lawyers at the highest levels of \nprofessional accomplishment. He received a unanimous ``qualified'' \nrating from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I have come to know this nominee well and his family \nmembers who are outstanding citizens of the gulf coast area, of the \nState of Mississippi. I am very pleased he accepted the nomination and \nis prepared to take his place on the bench of the Federal court in our \nState. I am very pleased to urge the confirmation of this nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Halil \nSuleyman Ozerden to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District \nof Mississippi, which until recently had been considered a judicial \nemergency. By approving yet another lifetime appointment, we continue \nto proceed promptly and efficiently to confirm judicial nominees.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 16 lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench so far this year. There were only 17 \nconfirmations during the entire 1996 session of the Senate. This means \nwe have already confirmed almost the entire total of confirmations for \nthe entire 1996 session, and we are still in April of this year.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial \nvacancies, yet the President has sent us only 27 nominations for these \nvacancies. Twenty one of these vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. \nOf the 16 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nbe judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for \n6 of them. That means more than a third of the judicial emergency \nvacancies are without a nominee.\n  I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle \non our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and \nconfirm these judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and \nimprove the administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts. \nThe nomination we consider today has the support of both Senator \nCochran and Senator Lott.\n  Mr. Ozerden is just 40 years old, quite young for a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench. Mr. Ozerden has worked for the past 8 \nyears as a commercial litigator for the Gulfport, MS, law firm of \nDukes, Dukes, Keating & Faneca, P.A. Before pursuing a legal career, he \nserved for 6 years on active duty as an aviator in the U.S. Navy.\n  I have urged, and will continue to urge, the President to nominate \nmen and women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity of \nAmerica. Mr. Ozerden is the son of a Turkish immigrant. I am encouraged \nwhen we can reflect positively on the diversity of our Nation and the \ncontributions of immigrants.\n  The Senate will confirm Mr. Ozerden. It will not repeat the slurs \nthat many used against Senator Obama. Whether a person's middle name is \nSuleyman, Hussein, or Ali, that person should be considered on merit, \nnot through the eyes of prejudice. Our Nation must rise above mean-\nspiritedness and the shortsighted politics of fear. Consistent with our \nheritage as a nation of immigrants, we should recognize the dignity of \nall Americans whose work contributes to building a better America. The \ndiversity of our Nation is a strength for our country and remains one \nof our greatest natural resources.\n  That said, I understand the disappointment of members of the African-\nAmerican and civil rights communities that this administration \ncontinues to renege on a reported commitment to appoint an African \nAmerican to the Mississippi Federal bench. In 6 years, President Bush \nhas nominated only 19 African-American judges to the Federal bench, \ncompared to 53 African-American judges appointed by President Clinton \nin his first 6 years in office. With an ever-growing pool of \noutstanding African-American lawyers in Mississippi, it is not as if \nthere is a dearth of qualified candidates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to add my \nendorsement for the confirmation of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The \ndistinguished Senators from Mississippi have already spoken at length \nabout his outstanding qualifications, and I associate myself with their \nremarks.\n  It is a matter of considerable distinction to be a magna cum laude \ngraduate from Georgetown University. And a law degree from Stanford is \nimpressive. His service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, with the \nimpressive service he has performed there, has been specified in some \ndetail.\n  He was unanimously rated ``qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation. The vacancy to which he has been nominated has been \ndesignated as a ``judicial emergency'' by the nonpartisan \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. I urge my colleagues to vote to \nconfirm this very distinguished nominee.\n  I note we have a significant number of vacancies at the present time. \nWe have 14 vacancies on the courts of appeals. Six nominees have been \nsubmitted to the Judiciary Committee, and it is my hope we will process \nthese nominees promptly. There have been a number of blue slips not \nreturned by Senators. Under the practice of the committee, the \nnomination will not be processed until blue slips are returned by the \nSenators. So I will be communicating directly with the Senators \ninvolved, urging them to return the blue slips so we may go forward.\n  There are six of those vacancies where nominations have been \nsubmitted. There are eight vacancies without nominations. I have \ndiscussed this matter personally with the President and have written to \nhim in addition so the letter could be disseminated among the various \nWhite House officials who are charged with the responsibility for \nproceeding there.\n  On the district courts, there are 34 vacancies. Twenty-two \nnominations have been received, and it would be my hope they would be \nprocessed promptly. Twelve are awaiting nominees. The vacancies \nconstitute a substantial number.\n  The total number of authorized circuit judges is 179. There are 14 \nvacancies, for a 7.8 vacancy percentage. The total number of authorized \ndistrict judges is 674. There are 34 vacancies, for a 5-percent vacancy \nrate. It is important these vacancies be filled.\n  Where we do not have judges--and quite a few of these vacancies are \njudicial emergencies--there cannot be the processing of these cases. As \na lawyer with substantial experience in the courts, I can attest \nfirsthand to the importance of having judges on the job. When the \nvacancies are present, other judges are compelled to do extra duty.\n  So I urge my colleagues to cooperate in the processing of these \nnominations and vacancies. I, again, renew my urging of the White \nHouse, the President, to submit nominations for these vacancies.\n\n\n                      Complimenting Senator Casey\n\n  In conclusion, may I note how much I appreciate the Presiding \nOfficer, the other Senator from Pennsylvania. I do not call him the \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania, although he has been here a lesser \nperiod of time than I have. I think the difference is 26 years and 3 \nmonths to 3\\1/2\\ months. But Senator Casey has already made a \ndistinguished mark on the Senate.\n  I think it not inappropriate to note for the record that he and I \nmeet on a weekly basis and have held joint hearings on the juvenile \ngang problem in Philadelphia and on the issue of the proposed merger of \nIndependence Blue Cross and Blue Shield with Highmark from the western \npart of the State, that we were together in Pittsburgh recently for the \ninduction of a court of appeals judge and a district court judge.\n  My compliments to Senator Casey on his distinguished service already.\n  Mr. President, I note the time has arrived for the vote, so I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Halil Suleyman \nOzerden, of Mississippi, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are operating \nunder a time agreement that has been proposed by the Senate leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for such time as he \nwishes to consume.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I commend my friend and colleague, \nSenator Bingaman, as well as Senator Alexander and the group that came \ntogether in support of this idea of competitiveness legislation. I \nthink it is one of the most important issues we will consider on the \nfloor of the Senate, and it is something that commands the kind of \nbroad support that it is getting.\n  What underlines this legislation is a recognition that the United \nStates is competing in a global economy. If we are going to compete in \na global economy, we have to make a decision as a nation to the prepare \neach and every individual American to stand with the winds in a global \neconomy. This legislation says that we are going to equip every man, \nwoman, and child in the United States to be able to deal with the \nchallenges of a global economy, and I think that is a very important \nnational purpose.\n  Throughout history, this country, when it saw that it was challenged, \nturned to education to stay competitive. After the Second World War, we \nneeded to build a new, peacetime economy. We passed the G.I. Bill to \nenable those who served in battle to rebuild their lives at home. For \nevery dollar we invested, the Greatest Generation returned $7 to our \neconomic growth.\n  In 1957, we were challenged again. The launch of Sputnik sparked the \nSpace Age, and we rose to the challenge by passing the National Defense \nEducation Act and inspiring the nation to ensure that the first \nfootprint on the moon was left by an American. We doubled the Federal \ninvestment in education. When individuals have their skills uplifted \nand when they have their skills enhanced, they find out their \nparticipation in the economy works a great deal better. They are more \nproductive, they are more useful, they are more creative and more \nimaginative and able to compete more effectively. This bill is \nenormously important for all Americans and very important for our \ncountry in terms of the whole challenge of globalization.\n  Secondly, it is enormously important in terms of our national \nsecurity. This legislation ensures that we are going to encourage those \nforces that enhance our capability in the areas of math, science and \nresearch--all of which are enormously important to make sure we are \ngoing to have the best technology for those who are going to serve in \nthe Armed Forces. In the Armed Forces we want the best trained and best \nled men and women, but we also want the best in technology. This is a \ncompetitiveness bill and a national security bill.\n  I believe it is going to be enormously helpful and valuable in terms \nof our democratic institutions, in making sure we are going to have men \nand women in this country who have the ability and commitment to ensure \nthat our democratic institutions are going to function, and function \nvery well, and that we will be able to maintain our leadership in the \nworld.\n  I, for one, agree with those who believe in each generation, and in \neach decade, the United States has to fight for its leadership in the \nworld. It is not just going to come automatically. We should no longer \nthink we are going to coast in terms of national and world leadership. \nWe have to win it, and we have to win it every single day. The way to \nwin it is with the kinds of investments that are included in this \nlegislation. So I commend all those who have been a part of this \nprocess, and particularly our friends and colleagues, Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Alexander.\n  To go through very quickly now, after those general comments about \nwhy this legislation is so important, if we look at where the United \nStates is: America's 15-year-olds scored below the average in math \ncompared to the youth of other developed nations on a recent \ninternational assessment. On the Programme for International Student \nAssessment, you will see that the U.S. ranks 24th.\n  This chart indicates that since 1975, the U.S. has dropped from 3rd \nto 15th place in the production of scientists and engineers.\n  We are also losing ground in overall high school and college \ngraduation rates. The U.S. has dropped below that average graduation \nrate for OECD countries. Out of 24 nations, the U.S. ranks 14th, just \nahead of Portugal.\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\n  We are going to go to the underlying educational needs when we \nreauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act and higher education \nlegislation. We are going to deal with middle schools and high schools. \nWe are going to try to tie it in and have a seamless web, from the Head \nStart education programs through the K-12 and then universities into \nthe academic world or into the business world. We need to be able to \nbring those elements together.\n  Having said all of that, this legislation is enormously important in \nterms of making sure we reach that goal.\n  This is a chart of research and development investment as a share of \nthe U.S. economy. It demonstrates we are stagnant. This has to change. \nWe know we need to invest in research and development.\n  If you look at some of the countries with which we are going to \ncompete, India and China in particular, and look at the number of \ngraduates they have in math and science, you will find that China \nawards more than 300,000 bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer \nscience. We award a little over 100,000.\n  This is about research and development, but the investments in our \npeople, investments in our research and development are two sides of \nthe same coin. They are both essential. What this demonstrates is we \nhave to do better if we expect to compete.\n  Fast-growing economies such as China, Ireland, and South Korea are \nrealizing the potential for economic growth that comes with investing \nin innovation. China's investment in research and development rose by \nan average of 18 percent from 2000 through 2003. Over the same period, \nthe increase in U.S. investment averaged only 2 to 3 percent annually. \nIn the last decade, China has nearly doubled the share of their economy \nthey spend on research and development, and they have replicated our \nNational Science Foundation.\n  This bill puts us on a path to double the basic research funding at \nNSF in 5 years, double the basic research funding at the Department of \nEnergy over the next 10 years, and double the funding at NIST, the \nNational Institute for Standards and Technology. The bill also creates \na President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, to bring \ntogether the heads of Federal agencies with leaders in business and \nuniversities to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation.\n  If you look at where we are, to give some further illustrations, math \nand science classes in high-poverty schools are much more likely to be \ntaught by teachers who do not have a degree in their field. Fifty-six \npercent of science classes in high-poverty schools are taught by \nteachers without a relevant degree, compared to just 22 percent of \nclasses in low-poverty schools. More than a third of math classes in \nhigh-poverty schools are taught by an out-of-field teacher, compared to \njust 18 percent of classes in schools with a low-poverty rate.\n  I was interested the other day in the testimony of Mr. Gates, who \ncommented on a lot of subjects. He was talking about school dropouts. \nThere are some who think that school dropouts are children who are \nunable to comprehend the curriculum. He said, Oh, no, I am worried \nabout the dropouts, the minds we are losing--able, gifted minds that \nare unchallenged because they had an inferior teacher, no books, or \nchallenging conditions at home, such as missing meals because they are \npoor. We cannot afford to lose any of those.\n  What we are looking for is high quality teachers. The bill recognizes \nand responds to the shortage of high quality math, science, technology \nand engineering teachers, particularly in high poverty schools. The \nbill expands scholarships and stipends, and creates a new NSDF teaching \nfellow program to bring high quality math, science, technology, and \nengineering teachers into high-need schools. It also expands the \nTeacher Institutes for the 21st Century Program of the NSF to provide \ncutting-edge professional development programs for teachers who teach \nin high-need schools. These programs are peer reviewed and have \ndemonstrated to be successful.\n  The bill creates a summer institute at the Department of Energy to \nhelp math and science teachers, to enable them to go to a number of \nareas that deal with energy because that is an agency so focused in \nterms of these issues in math and science.\n  There is a high cost to failing to address our education concerns. \nThe nation loses over $3.7 billion a year in the cost of remedial \neducation and lost earning potential, because students are not \nadequately prepared to enter college when they leave high school.\n  The bill provides grants to states to align elementary and secondary \nschool standards, curricula, and assessments with the demands of \ncollege, the 21st century workforce and the Armed Forces. The grants \nsupport state P-16 councils to bring together leaders in the early \neducation, K-12, and higher education communities, in the business \nsector, and in the military.\n  It is also increasingly important for students to be exposed to and \nimmersed in foreign languages and cultures. Only one-third of students \nin grades 7-12 and a mere 5 percent of elementary school students study \na foreign language.\n\n  If we are going to talk about our ability to be involved in a world \neconomy, we are fortunate because we have so many who have come from \nsuch different cultures and traditions. I was reminded a few days ago \nin our Education Committee, of the number of languages they speak in \nSt. Paul, Minnesota. Thirty-seven languages are spoken in Everett, MA. \nIf we are going to compete in the world economy, we are going to have \nto do a lot better than we are doing in terms of communication and \nlanguage.\n  This is a balanced program. It has been reviewed by the Academy of \nScience, at the Institute of Engineers. It has been recommended by a \nwonderful American patriot, Norm Augustine, one of the great American \nleaders, corporate leaders, but also someone enormously knowledgeable \non American defense interests and also international competition. This \nlegislation has been tailored to try to take the very best ideas out \nthere.\n  We are going to have to fill in the underlying work that needs to be \ndone. This is primarily focused on what we are going to need to be able \nto compete internationally. We have to be sure the schools at every \nlevel are providing students with a high quality education. We want to \nbe sure those graduating from our universities will have the skills and \ntalents and education to move them into the American economy and the \nlarger economy they will face in the future.\n  This bill represents the beginning of a strong commitment that we \nmust sustain and build on if America is to remain competitive in the \nyears ahead. The legislation has strong support for a renewed \ncommitment to help the current generation meet and master the global \nchallenges we now face.\n  I welcome the opportunity to join with my colleagues and friends, the \nprincipal cosponsors, to commend this legislation, and hopefully we \nwill be able to complete it.\n  I know there are other amendments. I have had an opportunity to \nreview them briefly. A good many of them deal with other issues we \nought to be dealing with at another time. I hope the membership will \nrecognize this is special legislation. There is a special need. This is \na result of an extraordinary effort on the part of the principal \nsponsors of this bill. It deserves to pass and get through. I am very \nhopeful it will be done expeditiously.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 940\n\n  Mr. President, I send a HELP Committee amendment to the bill which I \nthink further strengthens the math and science programs. We have gone \nover this in considerable detail with our colleagues, since they are \nmembers of the committee. I thank them for their attention. I am \ngrateful for their support of these particular provisions. Again, I \ncommend them for the legislation. Hopefully this amendment will be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object--I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 940.\n\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes before \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy, the chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Senator \nEnzi, who was chairman last year, when all this began. I hope our \ncolleagues can see that these senior Members of the Senate--in the case \nof Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, they have a large amount of \njurisdiction over this subject; Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, who \nspoke yesterday, have a large amount of jurisdiction over this subject; \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman, who introduced legislation last year \nthat attracted 70 cosponsors--a number of their ideas are within this \nlegislation, but they have also demonstrated something you don't see \nevery day with Senators, which is a forbearance.\n  In other words, they recognize this is a big, 208-page bill with the \nPresident's ideas and those of the Council on Competitiveness and the \nAugustine Commission. It is well and carefully crafted, but not every \nsingle section is exactly the way every single Senator would like it. \nAlso, it has permitted us to have a procedure that brings this bill to \nthe floor so it has a good chance of being enacted this week. I thank \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, who really have the largest amount of \njurisdiction, for forbearing, being active, leading, and showing a \nsense of urgency about this subject by permitting it to come to the \nfloor in the way it has, and then, in addition to the other \ncontributions they have made, we have the Kennedy-Enzi HELP Committee \nmanagers' package which is now before the Senate for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. McCaskill). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know my friend from Oklahoma is \nprepared to speak. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, just a few minutes ago, Vice President \nCheney attacked the Senate majority leader on Iraq. He accused him of \nmaking ``uninformed and misleading'' statements, of defeatism, and of \nplaying politics with the war.\n  Senator Reid's interest is in protecting our troops and our national \nsecurity and bringing the war to an end. He is rightly responding to \nthe American people by demanding a change in our failed policy in Iraq. \nHe is right to insist that the Iraqis take responsibility for their own \nsecurity and their own future and that our troops need begin to \nwithdraw from Iraq.\n  It is Vice President Cheney who has been wrong--and deadly wrong--\nabout Iraq.\n  Even more, Vice President Cheney is the last person in the \nadministration who should accuse anyone of making uninformed and \nmisleading statements.\n  The Vice President misled the American people in August 2002, when he \ninsisted that we ``know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \nnuclear weapons'' and that ``many . . . are convinced that Saddam will \nacquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.''\n  The Vice President misled the American people in March 2003, when he \nsaid that Saddam Hussein ``has a long-standing relationship with \nvarious terrorist groups, including the al-Qaeda organization.''\n  The Vice President misled the American people when he insisted that \nour troops would ``be greeted as liberators.''\n  The Vice President misled the American people when he insisted that \nthe insurgency is ``in the last throes.''\n  He and the entire administration continue to mislead the American \npeople when they insist that progress is being made in Iraq.\n  The facts speak for themselves. Iraq is sliding deeper and deeper \ninto the abyss of civil war.\n  Violence and casualties are increasing. Already 3,335 American \nsoldiers have been killed, and more than 320 of them have been killed \nsince the surge began.\n  Civilians continue to flee the violence in Baghdad as the violence \nthere continues unabated.\n  Senator Reid is right to insist that we change the mission for our \ntroops in Iraq and set a target date to bring them home. The American \npeople agree.\n  America never should have gone to war when we did, the way we did, \nand for the false reasons we were given. It is the Vice President who \nhas been playing politics with the war in Iraq for more than 4 years. \nThe American people understand this and will rightly reject the Vice \nPresident's fingerpointing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the bill we have before us today is a \nwell-intentioned, thoughtful exercise to try to change the future for \nour country. The Commission this bill is based on, the work and \nexperience of those who have helped coauthor the bill, is rightly so in \ntheir concern for the future of our competitiveness. There is one \nproblem, however. The biggest dole on our competitiveness today has to \nbe the largesse of the Federal Government. Let me give a few examples.\n  Last year, the American people spent $224 billion paying interest on \nthe national debt. Last year, the American people, through our actions, \nspent $350 billion more than we had, which further increased that debt. \nIn the last 6 years, the individual debt owned by American citizens--\nwhat they are required to pay--has risen from $21,000 to almost \n$30,000. At the same time, the average wage in those same 6 years \nincreased by less than $5,000. So when we think about competitiveness, \nwe ought to pay close attention to the drags on what will be our \ncompetitive situation.\n  The No. 1 drag today is the Federal Government. That is not to demean \nthis bill. I would have loved to have seen a different bill, a bill \nthat says: Here is what we are doing right. Here is what we are doing \nwrong. Here are some new ideas on how to fix what we are doing wrong \nand, by the way, here are some things we need to do to keep us \ncompetitive. We didn't do that.\n  The Department of Education right now has 10 percent of its programs \nthat are totally ineffective. The Department of Energy, with its $5 \nbillion budget, has 10 percent of its programs that are highly \nineffective. In other words, they are not accomplishing anything. None \nof that was looked at, deauthorized, or eliminated in this bill. \nConsequently, according to OMB, we have approximately $80 billion that \nis going to be authorized to be spent--some of that is reauthorization, \nI understand--over the next 4 years that is going to be added to the \ndebt.\n  People will say: This is an authorization. That doesn't mean we are \ngoing to spend the money.\n  Why are we passing the bill if we don't intend to spend the money? We \nare going to spend the money. The problem with the way we spend money \nis we don't make the same choices the average American makes. We just \nchalk it up to our kids and grandkids. So I don't know where the money \nis going to come from.\n  This bill is obviously going to pass. It is going to be conferenced, \nand it is probably going to be signed. But we will have missed a great \nopportunity to fix many major programs that are not working well today. \nThis bill creates 20 new Federal programs. It doesn't eliminate one \nFederal program that isn't working well today. It doesn't modify, to a \nsignificant extent, those programs which are deemed ineffective and not \nworking.\n  What we have is great intention and great legislation, save for the \nfact that we are not looking at the whole story. We are not looking at \nthe whole picture. Should Congress have to do what every family in this \ncountry does every month--make a choice? Where do we prioritize our \nspending for this month? Where do we spend more? What are the things on \nwhich we can't afford to spend because we don't have the money? We \ndon't do that. We authorize programs. Then we appropriate funds.\n  By the way, the discretionary portion of the Federal Government has \ngrown about $600 billion in the last 7 years. Senator Carper and myself \nheld 48 hearings in the last Congress in the\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nSubcommittee on Federal Financial Management of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. What we found was an astounding \n$200 billion of waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication. There was great \nopportunity to take that information and do something about it. We have \nnot done it.\n  The Department of Education is not compliant in terms of improper \npayments. They don't know where they are paying things wrong or paying \nthings right. The Department of Energy is noncompliant in terms of \nimproper payments. They don't know where they are paying things right \nand paying things wrong. We have at least 20 percent of the Department \nof Energy's budget that is earmarks. They don't get to decide where \nthey spend the money; the Members of Congress tell them where they have \nto spend the money. There is not a sense of prioritizing what our \nenergy needs are, what our education needs are within the Department of \nEnergy. There is no commonsense approach to what we are doing. \nConsequently, the biggest problem we have in terms of competitiveness, \nwhich this bill won't solve, is more government. It creates more \ngovernment rather than less government or the same amount of government \nthat is more efficient and more effective.\n  I don't intend to impugn the desires or the sincerity of the Members \nof this body who helped put this bill together. There is no question we \nneed to address the issues that are encompassed in the legislation. \nThat is not my criticism. My criticism is that when we have an \nopportunity to fix things with a bill such as this which cuts across \nmultiple agencies, we don't do it. What we do is set up a system where \nmore programs will be created without eliminating the ones that are not \nworking.\n  As a matter of fact, in this bill, in the National Science \nFoundation, we have a setaside. Where before the National Science \nFoundation did everything on peer review--everything on peer review, \nthere was no politics saying what you have to do--we are taking $1 \nbillion and setting it aside and we are going to tell them what to do. \nWe know better than the scientists where we ought to be spending our \nmoney? I seriously doubt that.\n  We claim that what we want to do is reestablish the competitiveness \nof the United States. I have no doubt that certain segments of this \nbill will go a long way in doing that. I am not critical of the intent \nof the bill. But I believe--and I raised this on the last bill we \nconsidered--we continue to authorize new spending. We continue to put \nat risk, in the name of competitiveness, the future.\n  The No. 1 risk for competitiveness is our debt. The fact is, we are \nsucking capital out of the capital markets like crazy, making it very \ndifficult for small businesses that compete in the capital markets on \nideas, innovation, and sole-proprietorships and people who want to take \na risk on their own.\n  The other thing we didn't do is fix IDEA. One of our problems with \neducation is, we passed a law that said school districts will do this \nfor individuals with disabilities. What we promised when we passed that \nlaw--much as we will hear in 2 or 3 years as to what we promise with \nthis law--was that we would fund 40 percent of the costs in education \nfor IDEA. That would be the Federal load. This last year, we funded 18 \npercent. So we wonder why the schools can't compete, why they can't put \nthe money into math and science, the money into competitiveness, when \n$16 billion a year is being absorbed by the school districts to do \nsomething we mandated them to do, which means $16 billion isn't \navailable for them to teach and mentor math and science, for them to \ncreate greater opportunities to raise interest in the sciences.\n  So I think if our past actions speak at all about what the future \nwill bring, you will see we will not keep our word with this bill \neither. We will say things, we will do things, we will put at risk the \nnext two generations, and we will have felt good because we did \nsomething, but we did less than what we could do.\n  That is what we are doing with this bill. We are doing less than what \nwe could do. We could, in fact, fix what is wrong in many of those \nprograms in the Department of Education and in the Department of Energy \ntoday with this bill. It could have been done. It could have been done, \nbut it was not. So, consequently, we are going to fund ineffective \nprograms as we authorize and create and fund new programs, many of \nwhich are designed to do the exact same things, but we are not going to \neliminate the programs that are not working.\n  And lest you think I am an alarmist and known as ``Dr. No,'' think \nabout what the obligations are of every child who is born in this \ncountry today--just today. What is it? April 24, 2007. When that baby \nis delivered and placed in its mother's arms, you are going to see \nsmiles of joy and tears--none of them with a realization the child who \njust came into this world is faced with $453,000 in unfunded \nliabilities the moment they take their first breath.\n  The contrast should be, we are talking about competitiveness. How do \nwe create a future? What kind of future is it when we create a bill but \ndo not address the underlying problems that are limiting our \ncompetitiveness in the first place? No. 2, even if we are trained in \nmath and science, we are going to be so debt ridden we won't have the \nmoney to put into it.\n  According to the Government Accounting Office, that 8 percent in \ninterest, that $224 billion we spend now, in the year 2025--a mere 18 \nyears from now--will be 25 percent of the budget and close to $1 \ntrillion. Now, think about that. Should we do the hard work of \neliminating the wasteful and duplicative programs before we create \nanother?\n  It is easy to pass legislation that does something good. It is very \nhard to get rid of programs that are ineffective and highly \ninefficient. The reason is because everybody has an interest group that \nsupports that program, and we find ourselves adverse to challenging \nthat group.\n  But the real choice is between our grandchildren and today's present \ninefficiencies. The real choice is whether we are truly going to be \ncompetitive and create an opportunity for the next two generations to \nexperience the same kind of blessings we have been fortunate enough to \nexperience as a nation.\n  The real question is, will we leave a heritage that is similar to the \nheritage that was left with us? I tell you, my feelings and my thoughts \nare I do not see movement in this body or in the Congress as a whole to \nstart addressing the underlying problems that are facing us. It is not \na question of partisanship, Democrats or Republicans. It is a question \nof expediency. It is hard to tell people no when something is not \nworking well. It is easy to ignore it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 917\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and call up amendment No. 917.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  No objection, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 917.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress has a moral \n     obligation to offset the cost of new Government programs and \n                              initiatives)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The national debt of the United States of America now \n     exceeds $8,500,000,000,000.\n       (2) Each United States citizen's share of this debt exceeds \n     $29,000.\n       (3) Every cent that the United States Government borrows \n     and adds to this debt is money stolen from future generations \n     of Americans and from important programs, including Social \n     Security and Medicare on which our senior citizens depend for \n     their retirement security.\n       (4) The power of the purse belongs to Congress.\n       (5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending and creates new mandatory spending \n     programs.\n       (6) For too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and \n     more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want \n     Congress to live within its means, using the same set of\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n     common sense rules and restraints Americans face everyday; \n     because in the real world, families cannot follow Congress's \n     example and must make difficult decisions and set priorities \n     on how to spend their limited financial resources.\n       (7) Last year, the interest costs of the Federal debt the \n     government must pay to those who buy U.S. Treasury bonds were \n     about 8 percent of the total Federal budget. In total, the \n     Federal government spent $226 billion on interest costs alone \n     last year.\n       (8) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     interest costs will consume 25 percent of the entire Federal \n     budget by 2035. By way of comparison, the Department of \n     Education's share of Federal spending in 2005 was \n     approximately 3 percent of all Federal spending. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services was responsible for \n     approximately 23 percent of all Federal spending. Spending by \n     the Social Security Administration was responsible for about \n     20 percent of all Federal spending. Spending on Medicare was \n     about 12 percent of all Federal spending. Spending in 2005 by \n     the Department of Defense--in the midst of two wars in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan and a global war against terrorism--comprised \n     about 19 percent of all Federal spending. Thus, if we do not \n     change our current spending habits, GAO estimates that as a \n     percentage of Federal spending, interest costs in 2035 will \n     be larger than defense costs today, Social Security costs \n     today, Medicare costs today, and education costs today.\n       (9) The Federal debt undermines United States \n     competitiveness by consuming capital that would otherwise be \n     available for private enterprise and innovation.\n       (10) It is irresponsible for Congress to create or expand \n     government programs that will result in borrowing from Social \n     Security, Medicare, foreign nations, or future generations of \n     Americans without reductions in spending elsewhere within the \n     Federal budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of \n     new Government programs and initiatives.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is a simple amendment. We are going \nto find out what your Senator believes with this amendment. We offered \nthis amendment on the last bill. We had some inside baseball excuses \nwhy they would not vote for it. This is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. It does not carry any force of law or anything. All it says \nis the Senate agrees that before we spend new money, we ought to get \nrid of the wasteful programs, we ought to get rid of the ones that are \nnot working well, or we ought to make them better before we spend \nanother $60 billion to $80 billion on another set of programs.\n  That last amendment got 59 votes against it. Only 38 people in the \nSenate thought we ought to do that. I will tell you, I think the vast \nmajority--greater than 95 percent--of the American public thinks we \nought to do that.\n  So this is a simple amendment. The catch with the amendment is, if \nyou vote for the amendment and then do not change this bill to do what \nneeds to be done to eliminate the other programs, you are going to have \na tough time explaining that you agreed to this and then did something \nelse when you voted for the passage of this bill.\n  There is a day coming when we will not have the luxury to wait \naround. The financial markets will tell us what we will do. We will not \nhave the freedom within the Senate to make those choices. We will do it \nunder the duress of extreme financial conditions that will affect our \ncountry.\n  So this is a simple amendment, very similar to the last one. I took \nthe authorizing language out of it that some of the appropriators \nobjected to, so it is very simple.\n  The final statement in the amendment is:\n\n       Sense Of The Senate.--\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has a moral \n     obligation to offset the cost of new Government programs and \n     initiatives.\n\n  Now, with a budget deficit last year that was claimed to be $160 \nbillion, under Enron accounting--which was truly $350 billion, if you \nlooked at what happened to the addition to our debt, what our kids are \ngoing to pay--it is going to be pretty hard to say we should not add \nmore to the debt. We have a lot of people who will say the debt does \nnot matter; whatever the debt is, is a percentage of GDP. That is fine \nif the underlying assumption is we have great economics, and we are not \ngoing to have contractions of the economy, we are always going to be \nable to compete, we are always going to be able to finance our debt. \nThe fact is, as the Government Accounting Office says, we cannot, and \nthe interest costs associated with that will be massive.\n  Why would I come out here and fight friends and foes alike all the \ntime to do this? Because I think the one shortfall of our body is that \noverall we are not looking at the big picture and the long run. This \nlooks at the long run, but it does not look at the big picture.\n  Unless we do that, we are going to find ourselves very apologetic to \nthe next two generations because what, in essence, we will have said is \nwe cared more about us, we cared more about our comfort, we cared more \nabout our next election than we did any of the next two generations.\n  So I put it to my colleagues: Vote against this and vote for the bill \nand be honest. But if you think if we create new programs we ought to \neliminate other programs so we do not continue to expand the Federal \nGovernment running a deficit, then you ought to vote for this amendment \nand not vote for this bill, until it is made right, until it has \ncaptured the opportunities that are inherent within it to fix what is \nwrong in the Department of Energy, to fix what is wrong in the \nDepartment of Education, to fix what is wrong with all these grant \nprograms that need to be fixed today.\n  Let's hold us accountable. That is what the American people are \nexpecting from us. I want to leave the Senate not being known for \nanything other than knowing what I did was to try to create and make \nsure we maintain the heritage this country has given to us.\n  With that, Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, as I understand what we are doing: We \nhave a few amendments pending. We are working to clear those amendments \nso we can come to a vote on Senator Coburn's amendment. In the \nmeantime, Senator Sununu has more than one amendment. He has one he \nwants to talk about today. He wants to bring it up as soon as he can \nand schedule it for a vote. It is a meritorious amendment. I hope we \ncan do that as soon as possible.\n  Senator Coburn has reserved the rest of his time. But as I understand \nthe procedure, Senator Sununu could go ahead and speak until the next \nscheduled speaker, who is scheduled to speak at 4 o'clock; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, with deference \nto the Senator from Tennessee, that prior to the vote on my amendment I \nbe given 2 or 3 minutes to speak on it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No objection. Could we have 4 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Any objection? Prior to the vote, if and when the vote \nis set?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise to speak on the legislation in \ngeneral terms. As the Senator from Tennessee indicated, I filed three \ndifferent amendments. I certainly wish to call at least one of those \namendments up at the appropriate time. They address a number of \nconcerns I have with the underlying legislation.\n  But let me begin by saying I do appreciate the complexity of the \nchallenge the Senator from Tennessee has undertaken in trying to \nassemble from different committees of jurisdiction the components of \nthis bill. I think, unfortunately, dealing with this legislation has \nlaid to bare some of the weaknesses and problems with the way we are \norganized in Congress because it has been, unfortunately, an \ninefficient process in many ways.\n  There are five or six different committees that have jurisdiction in \ndifferent areas of this legislation. They all want to try to leave \ntheir mark on\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nthe legislation. As a result, the Senator from Tennessee and others \nhave had to deal with duplication and overlap in many cases with \ninitiatives begun by different committees that have effectively the \nsame goal and the same end. Over the past 12 or 18 months, I think they \nhave eliminated a number of these problems from the legislation but \nmany remain. I am one of the only, if not the only, engineer in the \nSenate. At least I was an engineer; I worked as an engineer during my \nprevious work experience. I would like to think that I am still \nemployable as an engineer perhaps someday in the future. I do value \nvery much this experience and this background in science and technology \nwhen we are dealing with problems on the Commerce Committee having to \ndo with telecommunications or spectrum allocation or policies on \nenvironmental issues with particulate matter or pollution standards. I \nlike to think it helps to have at least some grounding in a lot of the \ntechnical matters that underlie the basic legislation.\n\n  I think it is essential, when we are looking at policy to encourage \nand inspire students to pursue science and mathematics and to try to \nimprove our competitiveness in fields of science and engineering, that \nwe focus on a few core principles. I begin with the basic objective of \nmaximizing research in the most basic areas of math and science. In \nthis effort we are talking about the funds that go to the National \nScience Foundation and the funds that go to the National Institutes of \nHealth. These are investments in basic sciences: in the case of the \nNational Science Foundation, in physics, chemistry, physical science, \nand computational mathematics. They are peer-reviewed, which is \nintended to insulate them from political forces, legislative forces, \nand allow those with expertise in these areas to decide what sorts of \nresearch projects and programs receive funding in any given year.\n  It is essential we maintain that independent peer review process at \nthe National Science Foundation, just as it is important at the \nNational Institutes of Health because if we allow politics to enter \nthis process, we are going to do these areas a great injustice.\n  Commensurate with that focus on physical sciences and computational \nmathematics as we pursue research in science and engineering, it is \nalso important that we avoid policies that try to pick winners or \nlosers within our economy. Here I point to various programs that over \nthe years have subsidized product development for profitable companies, \nproduct development for products being introduced into the existing \nmarketplace today that effectively picks one firm and one firm's \nproducts at the expense of others. Some people would say, well, that is \nresearch. But it certainly isn't the kind of peer-reviewed research \nthat does and should take place at the National Science Foundation. It \nis product development work. Any time we start subsidizing product \ndevelopment for companies that are competing in the marketplace selling \ngoods and services to consumers, we distort the marketplace, we provide \nunnecessary subsidies, and in programs like the advanced technology \nprogram we have done just that time and time again.\n  The companies that have received these subsidies are good firms with \ngood employees, but I think putting funds in this area at the expense \nof physics and chemistry and mathematics at the National Science \nFoundation is a grave mistake. We need to maximize that research, make \nsure it is peer-reviewed, don't pick winners and losers in private \nindustry, and focus on educational programs where it can make the \nbiggest difference in inspiring young students in these careers in math \nand science.\n  I look back on my own experience and ask the very basic question: \nWhat led me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering when I was an \nundergraduate in college? I didn't make that decision when I was a \nfreshman in college. I didn't even make that decision to pursue \ninterests in math and science when I was in high school. I would argue \nfor most students it happens in sixth and seventh and eighth grade. \nThey realize they have an interest in math and science. More often than \nnot it is because they have had a strong, credible, inspirational \nteacher in math and science, and my experience is no different. Jane \nBatts and Blake Richards, my math and science teachers in fourth and \nfifth grade, I think set me on that path that ultimately brought me to \na mechanical engineering degree. So if we are going to look at \neducational programs that are meant to inspire students in math and \nscience, they had better be focused on those key years: sixth, seventh, \nand eighth grade.\n  Finally--this is a point that Senator Coburn was speaking to--we need \nto look at the programs that are already in place and ask honest \nquestions about how effective they are. How many do we have that deal \nwith these areas of math and science education? How many do we have \nthat deal with the areas of research? And, in particular, I think we \nshould look to the work done by the American Competitiveness Council.\n  What they found is that in the areas of science, technology, \neducation--science, technology, engineering and mathematics--stem \nprograms--there are 106 different programs within 8 or 10 different \nagencies, including the Department of Transportation, the Department of \nCommerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, 35 at the National Science Foundation, 12 at the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  In this legislation before us we do ourselves a disservice if we \ndon't look at these programs and ask the questions: How effective are \nthese programs? How can they be improved? How can they become more \nfocused or better focused on inspiring those young students? As the \nAmerican Competitiveness Council looked at these programs, they came up \nwith a series of recommendations and findings. They made that very \nargument: that there was overlap in these science, technology, \nengineering, and math educational programs; that communication and \ncoordination among agencies could be improved; and that current \nprograms tended to be focused on short-term support rather than longer \nterm impact. Those are the very findings we should be trying to \nimplement and execute as part of this legislation, but I don't see it \nin the underlying bill.\n  So the amendments I have focused on, first, the overlap and \nduplication and lack of focus within those educational programs, to try \nto strengthen them, measure their effect, and ensure that they have a \ngreater impact on those students; and, second, to make sure we are \nappropriately focused on basic, fundamental research within the \nNational Science Foundation and that we are maintaining its \nindependence and that we ensure the peer review process is what \ndetermines how and where funds are allocated.\n\n  I know we are working on an agreement on the Senate floor, so I am \nnot able to offer my amendment at the moment, but let me speak to what \nit attempts to do. I have an amendment that strikes section 4002 of \nthis legislation. Section 4002 does two things within the National \nScience Foundation that I think set the wrong precedent.\n  First, it establishes a set-aside, a minimum allocation for \neducational and human resources within the National Science Foundation \nof $1.05 billion. I recognize the educational initiatives within the \nNational Science Foundation are important, but I certainly can't say, \nand I don't think any Member of the Senate can say, whether $1.05 \nbillion is exactly the right number. But more important, we shouldn't \nbe mandating in law that the National Science Foundation direct a \nspecific amount of money to any area. We should, to the greatest of our \nability, allow those decisions to be set on a yearly basis by the \nexperts and the leadership of the National Science Foundation. If we \nthink they are not doing a good job, they should probably be replaced. \nBut they are hired specifically because they have the best and most \nadvanced understanding of what our needs are, what the most valuable \nareas of research are, and what the best kinds of partnerships might be \nfor education related to physics, chemistry, mathematics, and material \nscience. So I would strike that set-aside, not because we don't think \nany money should be going to this area--of course, money should be \ngoing to this area--but because it is a dangerous precedent for \nlegislators to start carving up pieces of the National Science \nFoundation for specific initiatives.\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\n  Second, this particular section of the legislation mandates--it \nrequires--that there be a specific percentage increase in this one \nparticular area each year between now and 2011. While I don't know \nwhether that percentage increase will turn out to be the right amount \nor the wrong amount over the next several years, I think it is a bad \nprecedent to require as part of the legislation that a designated \nportion of money go to any of the specific areas supported by the \nNational Science Foundation. Once we move away from the peer review \nprocess, once we move away from independence within the National \nScience Foundation to allocate funds as the leadership there sees fit, \nthen I think we run the risk of undermining the great strength that the \nNational Science Foundation has represented over the past several \nyears.\n  I began speaking about doubling resources for the National Science \nFoundation 4 or 5 years ago because it has been so successful in \nproviding resources for basic research in key areas of physical \nsciences, and I am extremely concerned that if we adopt the provisions \nof section 4002 and start carving out pieces we think are politically \npopular at a particular point in time, we will dramatically undermine \nits effectiveness and have the unintended consequence of weakening the \norganization's ability to inspire the next generation of engineers and \nscientists.\n  I look forward to offering these amendments at the appropriate time, \nand I thank you, Madam President, for the time this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Entitlement Programs\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, let me step over to the chair from which \nthe junior Senator has been speaking.\n  I wanted to speak about a couple of issues. The first issue I want to \ntalk about is the recent report which came out yesterday from the \nMedicare trustees which said that the Medicare trust fund is in dire \nstraits. The Medicare trustees are required under law to report to the \nSenate and to the Congress and to the American people what the economic \nstatus is of the trust fund as it looks out into the future.\n  A lot of us have been talking for a long time about the problems with \nthe entitlement programs we have--specifically Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security--and the fact that these three funds are headed toward \na meltdown, which is going to take with them the economy of this \ncountry. The practical effect of these three funds in their present \nspend-out situation is that they have approximately $70 trillion of \nunfunded liability--$70 trillion over their actuarial life.\n  Now, $1 trillion is a number that a lot of us have a problem \ncomprehending. To try to put that number into perspective, if you took \nall the taxes paid in the United States since we became a country, I \nthink we have paid about $46 trillion in taxes. If you take the entire \nnet worth of America--all our assets, including all our cars, all our \nhomes, all our stocks--that, again, is in the $45 trillion to $50 \ntrillion net worth.\n  So what we have on the books as a result of the projected costs of \nthe Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security system is a cost that \nexceeds all the taxes paid in the history of this country and exceeds \nthe net worth of this country.\n  Why is that? Why are we confronting this problem? Well, it is \nbasically a function of demographics. The postwar baby boomer \ngeneration, of which I am a member, the largest generation in American \nhistory, is beginning to retire.\n  By the year 2020, 2025, the number of retired citizens in this \ncountry will double from the present number who are retired today. It \nwill go from about 35 million retired citizens up to about 70 million \nretired citizens. The number of people working to support those retired \ncitizens will drop commensurately. So both Social Security and \nMedicare, and to some extent Medicaid, were programs designed with the \nconcept that there would be a lot of people working for every person \nretired. They were essentially pyramids.\n  In fact, in 1950, there were about 12.5 people working for every \nperson retired. So 12 people were paying into Social Security for every \n1 person taking out. Today, there are about 3.5 people paying into \nSocial Security and Medicare for every one person taking out. Social \nSecurity is running into surplus. But as this baby boom generation \nretires, that number changes radically. We go from those large numbers \npaying in and a small number taking out to a large number taking out \nand a small number paying in. There will be about two paying in for \nevery one person taking out by about 2025. We go from a pyramid to a \nrectangle and the system cannot support itself.\n  This chart reflects the severity of the problem. These three \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as a percentage of \nspending of the GDP, by the year 2025, or 2028, will absorb almost 20 \npercent of GDP. Why is that a problem? Today, and historically, the \nFederal Government has only spent 20 percent of gross national product. \nSo the practical implications are that by 2025, or 2028, the total \nspending of these three programs alone will absorb all of the money \nthat has historically been spent by the Federal Government, which means \nthat nothing else could be spent--no other money--on things such as \nnational defense, the environment, and education. It would all be going \nto these three programs, assuming you maintain the Federal share of the \nGDP at its present level.\n  Things get worse, unfortunately, as the baby boom generation \naccelerates into the 2030 period, when paying for those programs alone \nreaches 27, 28 percent of GDP by about 2040. Obviously, it is not a \nsustainable situation. Obviously, it is a situation where if we \ncontinue on this path, we would essentially be saying to our children \nthat we are going to subject you to a cost that far exceeds anything \nyou could afford and basically hit you with a tax burden that would \nessentially mean that you--our children and grandchildren--in order to \nsupport this retired generation, would be unable to send your children \nto college, buy your home, purchase your cars, live your lifestyle in \nthe manner our generation has been able to live. The money is going to \nhave to be spent by taking taxes out of your pocket.\n  A lot of us have been talking about and some people have even tried \nto address this issue--specifically, the administration. The biggest \npart of this problem is not Social Security, ironically; it is \nMedicare. Now, the Medicare trustees yesterday made the point once \nagain that if we don't do something and start to do it fairly soon in \naddressing the Medicare problem, we will bankrupt our children and our \nchildren's children's future with the cost of this program. This was \ntheir obligation as trustees. They are supposed to look at it \nobjectively, and they have. They said this program is headed toward \nabout $35 trillion of unfunded liability, that that is a huge number \nand we need to correct that. Ironically, and fortunately, a couple of \nyears ago we put into place a law that requires that when the Medicare \nProgram starts to go in the direction of insolvency at a rate that \nmeans it is going to take a significant amount of money from the \ngeneral taxpayers' pockets versus money from the wage earner, as they \npay their hospital insurance, that at that point the Federal Government \nis supposed to act.\n  The way it works is this: If more than 45 percent of the Medicare \ntrust fund is being supported by general fund dollars, what does that \nmean? Well, the Medicare trust fund theoretically was supposed to be \nthe Parts A and B, the hospital and doctor part; that was supposed to \nbe supported primarily by insurance premiums being paid on your \nhospital insurance tax taken out of your salary every week. But, of \ncourse, under the Part B program, we have never done that. We have \nended up subsidizing that program with general funds instead of having \nit come out of the payroll tax. What this law says is when those \ngeneral fund subsidies exceed 45 percent of the total cost of the \nMedicare system, it is an excessively dangerous situation and it has to \nbe addressed. If this happens 2 years in a row, where the cost of \nMedicare is exceeding 45 percent of the general funds coming from the \nFederal Treasury, that means people's income taxes, the taxes people \npay every day--then at that point the administration is supposed to \nsend up--whatever administration is in power--a proposal to correct the \nproblem.\n  That is what the Medicare trustees concluded. Last year, they \nconcluded\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\nthe trust funds were in severe strain and we are going to hit the 45-\npercent level. This year, they have concluded the trust funds are under \nsevere strain, and it is going to hit the 45-percent level. The \npractical effect of that is now the administration is required, prior \nto the next budget, to send up a proposal to correct the problem. \nUnfortunately, under the law, even though the administration is \nrequired to send up such a proposal, the Congress is not required to \nact on it.\n  Ironically, the administration, in an act of true fiscal \nresponsibility to our children and our children's children, this year \nsent up a proposal to try to correct this problem, or at least begin to \ncorrect the problem, although not fully. They suggested this year that \nthere should be two adjustments in the Medicare trust fund, neither of \nwhich would have a significant impact on beneficiaries. In fact, for \nthe most part, it would have absolutely no impact on the beneficiaries, \nand unless you were a beneficiary in a very high-income situation, with \nmore than $85,000 of personal income, or if you are married and have \nmore than $160,000 of joint income, it would not affect you at all. \nThere are two proposals that insulate beneficiaries. The first proposal \nwas that we do an accurate reimbursement to providers. Under the \npresent law, the health care professionals have estimated that provider \ngroups are getting about a 1.2 percent extra payment over what they \nshould be getting as a result of the fact that there have been new \nefficiencies introduced into the provider repayment systems, through \ntechnology primarily, that have reduced costs, but that reduction in \ncost has not been reflected in the reimbursement. So we are actually \npaying more than we should be paying in these accounts.\n  The administration didn't suggest that they capture all that money. \nThey suggested let's take half of that--leave the provider groups with \nhalf of that money--I don't want to use the word windfall, but as a \nbonus to them. Let's take the other half and use it to try to bring the \nMedicare trust fund into some sort of solvency. That was the first \nproposal of the administration. It was a reasoned proposal in light of \nthe fact that all of the professional groups have concluded that this \noverpayment is occurring.\n  The second proposal they made was that people getting Part D, the \ndrug benefit--if they are very high-income individuals--should pay part \nof the premium for that drug benefit. Under the Part D premium, there \nwas no contribution required, unlike Part B, which has a means test--\nvery limited, but it has one. Part D did not. The administration said, \nlisten, if you are a retired Senator, you should not be subsidized by \nsomebody who is working in a restaurant, or in a gas station, or on a \nmanufacturing line, which is what happens today. The way the law works \ntoday, a person who is out there working for a living, maybe trying to \nraise their children, is actually having to pay to subsidize retired \nSenators who are getting Medicare or, for that matter--I don't want to \npick on Bill Gates' father as an example, but Bill Gates' father, or \nWarren Buffet--millionaires and billionaires--are being subsidized by \npeople who are making an everyday wage and trying to make ends meet for \ntheir families. So the administration suggested if you have more than \n$80,000 of personal income as an individual, or $160,000 of joint \nincome as a family, then you should be required to pay a portion--just \na portion--of your Part D premium. That is a very reasonable approach.\n  Those two proposals together would have reduced the outyear \ninsolvency of the Medicare trust fund by almost a third. It would have \ntaken tremendous pressure off of the trust funds, especially the \nMedicare trust fund. They were both rejected out of hand by the other \nside of the aisle. They were demagoged. People came to the floor and \nsaid this would savage Medicare, would destroy Medicare, that it was \ngoing to undermine the rights of senior citizens to get Medicare. \nOutrageous statements were made on the other side of the aisle, and \nthey continue to be made relative to these proposals that were \nreasonably benign, that didn't affect beneficiaries, and would have \nactually put Medicare on a solvency footing instead of insolvency, \nwhich is where it is headed now.\n  Now the trustees have done their job and said, the administration is \nabsolutely right. If we don't correct this problem, we are going to \nhave a Medicare system that cannot be afforded by our children and \ngrandchildren. As a result, we will have a major contraction in the \nsystem. Yet even though the Medicare trustees have said that--and they \nare a pretty objective group and they are required under the law to be \nso--we have the leading Senator on the other side, Senator Schumer, \ntaking the position that that is just politics, that Medicare is fine, \nand instead of peddling an ill-conceived Social Security privatization \nplan that has already been overwhelmingly rejected by the American \npeople, the administration should turn its attention to strengthening \nMedicare.\n  Where was Senator Schumer when this amendment was offered on the \nfloor? He voted against it. When the administration suggested something \nthat was responsible, such as making high-income individuals pay a part \nof their premium on Part D, Senator Schumer rejected it. When this \nadministration came forward and suggested we should reimburse providers \nhonestly and directly and fairly but not overly reimburse them--not too \nmuch overly reimburse them--and take the savings and use it to make the \nMedicare system more solvent, where were Senator Schumer and his \ncolleagues? They rejected that.\n  Now they have the audacity to come forward and attack the Medicare \ntrustees, whose job it is to present the facts as they are, and the \nfacts are the Medicare system is going into bankruptcy, and him saying \nthat is politics and trying to hyperbolize it into privatization, which \nhas nothing to do with Medicare--how outrageous and irresponsible for \none generation not to face up to the problems it is giving the other \ngeneration. Senator Schumer is a baby boomer, as I am. It is our \nproblem we are passing on to our kids. We are the problem. We exist and \nwe are going to retire in massive numbers, and then we are going to \nturn the bill over to our children. We have a responsibility as a \ngeneration but, more importantly, we have a responsibility as \npolicymakers in the Senate to act, especially when the Medicare \ntrustees have told us the problem is there, it is legitimate, and it is \npretty obvious to anybody because we are all alive.\n  We have a bill, a law on the books, that says specifically this \nproblem must be addressed when the Medicare trustees, 2 years in a row, \nhave determined there is a problem, that 45 percent of the General \nTreasury or more is being used to support Medicare, and we need to \nadjust the system to effectively address that issue and to make the \nsystem solvent and affordable for our children. And especially we \nshould act when reasonable proposals are brought to the floor, \nproposals that have no maliciousness to them, have no political agenda \nto them, have no purpose other than putting in place policies which are \ngoing to make the system more solvent and more affordable. Yet they are \nrejected--rejected with partisan rhetoric of the worst order because it \nhas nothing to do with the Medicare plan; privatization is thrown at \nthe suggestion that we correct the Medicare system by making rich \npeople pay more of their costs by getting the reimbursement formula \ncorrect. That is subject to pejorative privatization by the Senator \nfrom New York, with no proposals at all--none--from the other side of \nthe aisle to correct this problem which is looming. Other than fighting \nterrorism and the threat of an Islamic fundamentalist detonating a \nweapon of mass destruction in one of our cities or somewhere in \nAmerica, there is probably no problem which is more significant to the \nfuture of this Nation than the pending fiscal meltdown which we are \ngoing to confront as a result of the cost of these programs which we \nput on the books and which, in their present process, cannot be \nafforded.\n\n  If we just wait until we arrive at the cliff--and we will be going \npretty fast when we reach that cliff; we are not going to be able to \nstop--and only try to deal with it then, what will be our\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\noptions? They will be so few and they will be so painful that they will \nhave a dramatic and dislocating effect not only on the generation that \nhas to pay the costs but on the generation that receives these \nbenefits.\n  We can, today, put in place changes which are gradual, which are \nreasoned, and which will accomplish the type of adjustments that are \nnecessary to make this program work--work well for the beneficiaries so \nwe have a strong, solvent Medicare system and work well for those who \npay the taxes to support them. But if every time the issue is raised \nthat there has to be legitimate action in this area, especially when it \nis being raised by the Medicare trustees, who do not have a political \nagenda but are simply reporting a factual assessment of an actuarially \nexisting fact pattern--which is there are so many people alive today \nwho are baby boomers that when they retire, they are just going to \nbasically overwhelm the system--if every time those red flags are \nraised, they are going to be responded to by the leadership on the \nother side with pejoratives and partisanship and the use of phrases \nsuch as ``privatization,'' then we are not going to accomplish anything \naround here. All we are going to see is that we can deal with the next \nelection but we can't deal with the next generation. You might win the \nnext election, which I guess is the purpose of Senator Schumer, but it \nis going to leave our kids one heck of a mess, and seniors who retire \nin the 2020 period are going to also be in a pretty horrific way. Total \nirresponsibility in the remarks of the Senator from New York in \nresponse to the very responsible warnings brought forth by the Medicare \ntrustees.\n  On a second issue to which I wish to speak briefly--actually, not so \nbriefly--which is the issue before us, the competitiveness bill, this \ncompetitiveness bill is well-intentioned. We all know that we as a \nnation are confronting some very severe issues relative to our capacity \nas a culture to compete in this world and be successful. We also know \nthat the essence of our capacity to compete is tied directly to our \ncapacity to produce an intelligent, thoughtful, knowledge-based \nsociety. We are, without question, a country where success in the \nglobal competition is not going to be built off of excessive manpower \nor a dramatic amount of resources. It is going to be built off of \nhaving brighter and smarter people who add value to products and \nproduce items that people around the world need and want, and they are \ninventive and creative. The great genius of America is our creativeness \nand our inventiveness. So the goal of this proposal is appropriate, \ngenuine, and well-intentioned, but the question becomes whether the \nexecution of that goal, on balance, accomplishes its purpose.\n  The Congress has this tendency--and I have seen it innumerable \ntimes--when it sees a problem, to create a plethora of different little \nprograms, most of them not too big, all across the spectrum, which are \nbasically the ideas of a bunch of different people who came to the \ntable, but because there wasn't one cohesive idea that was dominant, \neverybody's idea got into play. I guess that is the problem when you \nhave the committee designing the horse. That famous story--if a \ncommittee designs a horse, you end up with something that doesn't look \nlike a horse. That is what happens when you have a proposal which puts \na large chunk of money on the table and then says: Here, let's spend \nit. That, unfortunately, is where this proposal ends up to a large \ndegree.\n  Ironically, this proposal has a lot of specific initiatives in it \nwhich we already tried before or which are duplicative programs we have \ntried before, the irony being pretty apparent in items such as the \nManufacturing Extension Program, which, during the first few years of \nthis administration, it sent up proposals to basically zero it out. \nThat is a program the purpose of which was to create these \nmanufacturing extension centers around the country, which we did--they \nare called the Hollings centers--but we also understood they would be \nself-sustaining centers once the Federal Government got them up and \nrunning. We now find they are not, so this bill essentially continues \nthem. Also, it basically restarts something called the ATP program. It \ngives it a new name and title. It creates a brandnew series of \neducation initiatives in the Department of Energy which are pretty much \nduplicative of initiatives in the Department of Education, and some \neducation initiatives in the National Science Foundation. It creates \nnew directives to the NOAA which are almost identical to what NOAA \nalready does but in addition are completely duplicative of what the \nOceans Commission concluded should be done and which was put into \naction about 2 or 3 years ago as a result of the Oceans Commission.\n  As well-intentioned as this bill may be, in the end what it does is \nit increases spending by $16 billion. That is the proposal: $16 billion \nover 4 years. What it buys is a whole lot of little initiatives all \nover the country which are the interests of this Senator or that \nSenator but which in their totality have very little cohesion to them, \ndirection to them, or purpose to them and, as a practical matter, are \nnot paid for.\n\n  Here is the situation we confront. It is not as acute as the issue I \nwas talking about before in the Social Security entitlement accounts, \nbut the situation is this: We are spending a lot of money we don't \nhave. In the nondefense discretionary accounts, we have been fairly \ndisciplined over the last few years, but we are still spending a lot of \nmoney we don't have.\n  What this proposal says is, even though we are spending a lot of \nmoney we don't have, we are going to spend more money we don't have \nbecause these are feel-good initiatives, and if we just sprinkle a \nlittle crumbs all over the place, we can put out good press releases \nand feel content that we have addressed the competitiveness question in \nthis country.\n  The competitiveness question in this country is not going to be \ndramatically improved by spending $16 billion we don't have and then \nsending the bill to our kids. If we want to improve competitiveness in \nthis country, we should be doing fairly substantive things that will \nimpact a lot of different areas and won't necessarily cost us too much \nmoney.\n  We might start, for example, with tort reform, where we see a massive \namount of money spent inefficiently in this culture because we have to \nfear lawsuits that are, quite honestly, in many instances frivolous and \nthat end up causing people to do defensive activities. Correct the tort \nsystem, and that would create a fair amount of efficiency and \nproductivity in this economy.\n  Correct the regulatory morass we have. The fact is that to can get an \nefficient powerplant on line--which we need a lot of in this country if \nwe are going to have an efficient economy--it literally takes years and \nyears of regulatory hoops to jump through, many of which are \nduplicative, before you can get a decent powerplant up and running. \nWhen was the last time a nuclear powerplant was brought on line in this \ncountry? Well, I think it was 1988. Nuclear power is by far the most \nefficient way and the most environmentally sound way to bring large \namounts of power online. Yet we can't license nuclear powerplants. \nSenator Domenici, in a recent bill he produced in this Senate, which \ndidn't pass the Congress, has tried to streamline the effort. \nHopefully, it will result in more powerplants coming on line.\n  The simple fact is that we regulate ourselves into \nnoncompetitiveness. So if we want to correct the issue of \ncompetitiveness, let's address some of these regulatory issues. They \ndon't have to be broad. It doesn't have to be a broad exercise. It can \nbe reasonably narrow.\n  In the area of immigration policy, we know there are very bright, \ncapable people around this world who want to come to America and be \nproductive. As Bill Gates described them in testimony before the HELP \nCommittee, he looks at them as job-setters. When he brings one of these \nreally bright people from someplace else in the world and puts them to \nwork at Microsoft, the way he sees that is that person is generating \njobs. It is the opposite of outsourcing; it is insourcing. If you bring \nsomebody in with special talents and abilities, especially in the \nscience and mathematics areas, that person becomes a job center around \nwhich other jobs are created because of their creativity and their \nabilities.\n  And what do we do to those folks? We tell them they can't come to the \nUnited States even though they want\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nto, even though they have jobs here. We say: I am sorry, we can only \nhave 65,000 people with that talent in this country. That is it--even \nthough there may be 150,000 or 200,000 who would like to come to this \ncountry and all of whom could come into this country from the \nstandpoint of being safe, sound, good contributing citizens and all of \nwhom, if they were here, would probably be giving us economic added \nability which would create jobs. It doesn't cost us any money to bring \nthese people in. In fact, it gives us more economic activity, which \ngives us more jobs, probably more tax dollars from these people, \ngenerating more taxes to the Federal Treasury. That is something we can \naddress if you want to improve the productivity of this Nation.\n  The idea that the Federal Government is going to sprinkle $16 billion \naround to various programs--and it is sprinkled all over, a lot of \nprograms here, many of which either existed before or are being \nrecreated--and it is going to result in significantly more \ncompetitiveness--well, it might work, but the only way you could \njustify it is if you paid for it by reducing $16 billion somewhere else \nin inefficiencies before you move down this road. The irony of this is \nwe have done it so many times before, and it hasn't worked because the \nFederal Government can't command and control the economy. That is why \nit doesn't work.\n  I was Governor when President Bush 1, who was very concerned about \neducation and wanted to be known as the education President, called a \nconference of Governors together--the first time it happened since \nLincoln--I believe in Charlottesville, VA. The purpose of the \nconference was to figure out how we as a nation were going to capture \nand reform the education agenda. This was in 1989. I was Governor at \nthe time. Do you know what the first conclusion of that Governors \nconference was? I think we came up with 10 directives. The first \nconclusion was that we would lead the world in math-science education \nin the elementary and secondary school systems by the year 2000 because \nat that time we were 14 out of 16 countries of the industrialized \nworld.\n  I heard Senator Kennedy a while ago doing his presentation on this \nissue on the Senate floor, and he put up a chart. I think he said we \nwere 24th out of 24 industrialized countries. We actually lost ground \nif that is true. I don't know what the number is, but we are certainly \nnot at the top. Yet throughout this period we have created program \nafter program after program.\n  There is an initiative in here for the National Science Foundation to \nreenergize its directorate on education. I was here the last time we \ndid that. I was in the House. It is a good idea, especially if you have \nthe funds to pay for it. But the fact is, it is a sprinkling effort. \nThe marketplace, in creating an atmosphere where there is competition, \nis the way you make yourself more competitive. Spreading money over a \nwhole plethora of new programs might produce some results, but unless \nyou pay for it, in the end it is going to end up costing us \nsignificantly. It is going to end up costing the next generation \nsignificantly. So as well-intentioned as this proposal may be, I have \nserious reservations about its effectiveness.\n  I would probably be willing to support it if it were paid for, but it \nisn't paid for, and it is just going to add $16 billion to the debt. \nNow, we will hear from others that this is just an authorized number, \nbut I can assure everyone that all we will hear about once this \nauthorized number is passed is that we need to appropriate the money to \nmeet those needs. So that is a straw dog argument. If you put on the \ntable that you are going to spend $16 billion more, that you don't \nhave, the odds are the Congress is going to spend $16 billion once it \ngets authorized to do so.\n  At this time I understand we are not taking amendments, but if we \nwere in the process of taking amendments, I would offer an amendment to \ndo something substantive in the area of competition and making our \ncountry more viable, and that would be to lift the cap on the H1B visa \nprogram from 65,000 to 150,000. A very simple action. It would bring in \na large group of people who would be constructive citizens with science \nand technology backgrounds that we need.\n  We would not be replacing people who are in jobs, but we would \nactually be creating more jobs--probably a lot more jobs in the arenas \nin which they work--and that would actually have an immediate impact on \ncompetitiveness in this country. We wouldn't have to wait another 10 \nyears to have another conference by another Presidency or another \nCongress that says we are not caught up in the competitiveness area and \ntherefore we have to address math and science education. We would \nactually have the people here next year who would have the math and \nscience skills and who would be able to contribute constructively.\n  So that would be the amendment I would offer, and I certainly hope to \nhave the opportunity to offer that amendment before this bill leaves \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand my junior colleague has a \nrequest before I proceed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be recognized for up to 15 minutes, that Senator Sanders would \nfollow him for up to 20 minutes, and that Senator Ensign would follow \nhim for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair hears \nnone, and it is so ordered.\n  Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure I will take the whole 15, although I \nhave been speaking on this issue for a long enough time that one would \nthink I might have spoken out, but I haven't. I am very excited about \nthe bill, and so I am afraid I will use every 1 of the 15 minutes \nbecause there is a lot I want to say.\n  First of all, let me say that I have the greatest respect for those \nwho oppose this bill, such as the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, chairman of the Budget Committee in the past, who has spoken \neloquently about the problems of Social Security and spoken his piece \ntoday about this bill.\n  On the other hand, for myself, I want to say that the time has come \nfor a new bill to get passed, and I want it to be bipartisan and I want \nRepublicans to join Democrats on the bill that I believe we will look \nback on and say it was the biggest, most significant, most important \npiece of legislation that we have ever passed, that added to the brain \npower of the American people, and particularly added to the brain power \nof the young people coming along who are going to try to keep us the \nmost productive Nation on Earth by getting educated properly.\n  We are trying to pass this bill after having been told by the best of \nAmericans who took a look at our country, who looked at our laws, and \nthen recommended that we do 20 things. They were all recommendations \naimed at the proposal that we were going backward; that we were in \nreverse gear as far as giving our young people the education they \ndeserve in the areas of math, science, physics, engineering, and the \nlike.\n  We were advised by the very best Americans. They did this as a \ngratuity. They weren't paid. They used their time to tell us what was \ngoing wrong and what could be fixed in terms of brain power development \namong our people. They said, essentially, our biggest problem is, after \ngrade 4 and through grade 12 our young people are not getting educated \nin math, science, physics, and the like by teachers who are educators \nin those subjects; that huge percentages of the teachers don't even \nknow the subject matter. Yet they are required to teach because they do \nnot have anybody else. So they teach math even if they haven't studied \nmath. They told us we should fix that. This bill will fix that, we \nhope.\n  They told us a number of other things. They said put them into law \nand try to get these things passed, and over the next 5 to 10 years you \nwill see a big difference. The National Science Foundation should \nreceive much more money for the hard science research projects; that \nthe budget of the Department of Energy, which has a science fund, \nshould get more money for the science that it does in the great \nlaboratories of the United States; and to help bring up the education \nfor those youngsters we are talking about by giving them exciting \nopportunities in the summer months and elsewise, and give the teachers \nthose times to get educated so they can pass on much more\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\nbrain power and excitement about these subjects to our young people.\n  Now, there is no doubt what is in this bill could be done better if \none person, or two, who were knowledgeable and fair were doing it and \nfollowing the recommendations of those who told us to do so. But we \ncan't do that here. We have to go to committees eventually and ask \nSenators who have vested interests. So we don't have a perfectly drawn \nbill in comparison to the 20 ideas propounded by the National Academy \nand the special bill that was produced by the ex-president of Lockheed \nMartin, Norm Augustine. Now, that part is so. It is true it is a good \nbill in that regard. So we have to argue about some other points that \ncome in, such as we should not pass any new legislation so long as we \nhave a deficit.\n  One Senator, a Senator from Oklahoma, has an amendment. I have great \nrespect for him. He says it is the sense of the Senate that the \nCongress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of new government \nprograms and initiatives. First of all, let me suggest to the \ndistinguished Senator that this bill does not spend money. If it spent \nmoney, it would be subject to a point of order under the budget and \nwould fall because it is new spending. Nobody has raised that. Even the \ngreat, distinguished, former chairman of the Budget Committee has not \ndone that. He did not stand up and say this bill falls under the Budget \nAct because it spends money. Why didn't he? Because it doesn't spend \nmoney.\n  There still has to be another act before this spends money. It has to \nbe appropriated. And any authorization bill is the same way. It does \nnot spend money. It does not need approval of the Budget Committee \nbecause it doesn't spend money. However, when we try to spend the \nmoney, then we better have it in the budget or it will fall under a \npoint of order. That is the truth, and there is nothing moral or \nimmoral about it.\n  The truth is, when the Senator says we have to offset the cost of \ngovernment programs and initiatives, and that we have an obligation to \nour citizens to do so, certainly he ought to recognize we shouldn't \nhave to do it when there is no money being spent because if that is the \ncase, then we are just talking about words. They have no effect. We are \ntalking about words. These words are talking about programs that don't \nspend money, and the Senator is trying to suggest that since they might \nspend the money, we ought to do something about it in advance. We would \nnever pass anything around here if we added another requirement to \nlegislation that before it is ever a spending bill it once again clear \nsome new hurdle.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma would like to do that, he \nought to go after the Budget Act of the United States and provide that \nthere is a way to raise a point of order against authorizing \nlegislation. We already have enough, but if he wants to do more, more \nbudget points of order, he could put that in there and have a nice \ndebate and see what the Senate thinks of adding that provision to the \nBudget Act on an authorization.\n  My good friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, talked about a lot of \nthings that we could be doing that would help our country become a more \ncompetitive country, which is what this is all about: putting more \nbrain power in our young people, helping them get more excited about \nthe good things that prepare them innovatively in order to create great \nthings. He spoke of a number of things he would do and could do outside \nthis bill. I agree with him. In fact, I could rewrite a bill we just \nfinished on energy. And if everybody were with me, I could add five or \nsix things to it--even though it is only a year and a half old--that \nwould help with our energy independence. But we have to do things we \nare asked to do around here, and we have to do them the best we can.\n  This bill will cost $60 billion, if we decide to spend it, over the \nnext 4 years--if we decide to spend it. Of that, $16 billion represents \nnew programs that are not currently in existence. Now, if anybody can \ntruly, with a really straight face, tell the American people that is \nwhat is going to break America--this $16 billion that isn't even spent, \nthat we might spend--it is really going to harm America's economic \nfuture, then I don't know what to tell them about what is happening to \nour budget naturally, about how much is spent for Social Security and \nother things that just come as a natural matter because of the way the \nlaws are written and that they spend freely on their own.\n  I want to close by saying to those who oppose the bill, I believe the \ntime has come to pass this bill. It is new, to some extent, and the \nnewness is what is good about it. I believe the time has come to take a \nchance on some new ways to educate our young people and see if we can't \nget more brain power developing in the young people of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 936\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an amendment, amendment \nNo. 936, which I have filed to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators \nas cosponsors of this amendment: Senator Baucus, Senator Leahy, and \nSenator Lincoln.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, for introducing S. 761, \nthe America COMPETES Act, and bringing it to the floor, along with the \nminority leader, Senator McConnell, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, \nand a number of other Senators in a true spirit of bipartisanship.\n  There is no question the Congress has to do a better job in making \nsure the United States is able to compete in the global economy. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act will begin to accomplish this important \nundertaking by doubling the investment in basic research at the \nNational Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science in the \nnext 5 to 10 years.\n  I am also pleased this bill will improve teacher training in math and \nscience and help low-income students succeed in college preparatory \ncourses. I applaud these provisions and thank my colleagues for working \non this important piece of legislation.\n  But in my opinion, if we truly want to provide the tools necessary \nfor American workers to compete in the global economy, much more needs \nto be done. That is why I will be offering this amendment, which I hope \nwill attract bipartisan support.\n  This amendment is simple and it is straightforward. At a time when \nthe United States has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs, at a time \nwhen we are on the cusp of losing millions more of high-paying \ninformation technology jobs, this amendment would begin to reverse that \ntrend by providing employees with the resources they need to own their \nown businesses through employee stock ownership plans and eligible \nworker-owned cooperatives.\n  Specifically, this amendment would authorize $100 million to create a \nU.S. employee ownership competitiveness fund within the Department of \nCommerce to provide loans, loan guarantees, technical assistance, and \ngrants to expand employee ownership throughout this country.\n  Why is it so important for the Senate to provide incentives to expand \nemployee ownership in this country? The answer is pretty simple: \nEmployee ownership is one of the keys to creating a sustainable economy \nwith jobs that pay a living wage. This amendment has the strong support \nof the ESOP Association, a nonprofit organization serving approximately \n2,500 employee stock ownership plans throughout the country. Let me \nquote from a letter they recently sent to my office:\n\n       Your amendment is a modest first step in awakening our \n     government to the fact that in the 21st Century the inclusion \n     of employees as owners of the companies where they work in a \n     meaningful manner should be a key component of any national \n     competitiveness program. If the Senate adopts your amendment \n     and it eventually becomes law, we assure you that the ESOP \n     community will work constructively to ensure that the loan \n     and grant program you propose works effectively to benefit \n     the employee owners, the employee-owned companies, and our \n     American economy.\n\n  The concept of an ESOP or a worker-owned company is not a radical \nidea.\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nNot only are there some 11,000 ESOPs in our country, but there are some \nmajor corporations that everybody is very familiar with, including \nProcter & Gamble and Anheuser-Busch, that are also ESOPs.\n  Interestingly, the Tribune Company, one of the major publishers in \nAmerica, is in the process of becoming a 60-percent employee-owned \ncompany.\n  Every day we read in the papers about plants that are being moved to \nChina, Mexico, and a number of other low-wage countries. Since a number \nof these factories were making profits, they were doing well in the \nUnited States. Shutting them down was unnecessary and could have been \navoided if these plants were sold to their employees through ESOPs, or \nworker-owned cooperatives. In other words, in my State, the State of \nVermont, and throughout this country, there are companies, large and \nsmall, that are making a profit where owners--who may be retiring, who \nstarted a company and now they are retiring--want to be able to leave \ntheir companies to their employees if these workers had the resources, \nif they had the technical assistance and legal advice to know how to \nput together that transaction--which in many cases is pretty \ncomplicated.\n  Further, study after study has shown when employees own their own \ncompanies, when they work for themselves, when they are involved in the \ndecisionmaking that impacts their jobs, workers become more motivated, \nabsenteeism goes down, worker productivity goes up, and people stay on \nthe job for a longer period of time because they are proud of and \ninvolved with what they are doing.\n  Most important to the communities throughout this country is when \nworkers own the place in which they work, shock of all shocks, they are \nnot going to shut it down and move the plant to China.\n  Since 2000, the U.S. manufacturing sector has lost 3.2 million good-\npaying manufacturing jobs. Put another way, since President Bush was \nelected President, this country has seen one out of every six factory \njobs disappear--one out of every six.\n  In addition, the Associated Press recently reported a study by \nMoody's which found: ``16 percent of the nation's 379 metropolitan \nareas are in recession, reflecting primarily the troubles in \nmanufacturing.''\n  I suspect this problem is even worse in rural areas in my own small \nState of Vermont. We have lost about 20 percent of our manufacturing \njobs in the last 5 years. Let me give an example of some of the jobs we \nhave been losing as a country and why, in fact, we need to be \ncompetitive and why, in fact, we need to encourage ESOPs and worker-\nowned industry. From 2001 to 2006, the United States of America has \nexperienced a loss of 42 percent of our communication equipment jobs, \n37 percent of our jobs have been lost in the manufacture of \nsemiconductors and electronic components, 43 percent of our textile \njobs have disappeared, and about half of our apparel jobs have \nvanished.\n  Not only are we losing good-paying manufacturing jobs, we are also \nlosing high-paying information technology jobs.\n\n  While the loss of manufacturing jobs has been well documented, it may \ncome as a surprise to some that from January of 2001 to January of \n2006, the information sector of the American economy lost over 640,000 \njobs, or more than 17 percent of its workforce.\n  The trends there are pretty ominous. Alan Blinder, the former Vice \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, has recently concluded that between 30 \nmillion to 40 million jobs in the United States are vulnerable to \noverseas outsourcing over the next 10 to 20 years. While, of course, we \nhave to invest in math and science, of course, we have to educate our \nstudents as best we can, we cannot ignore the significant impact \nglobalization is having on our blue-collar factory jobs and on our \nwhite-collar information technology jobs.\n  Today there are some 11,000 employee stock ownership plans, hundreds \nof worker-owned cooperatives, and thousands of other companies with \nsome form of employee ownership. Many of them are thriving. In fact, \nemployee ownership has been proven to increase employment, increase \nproductivity, increase sales, and increase wages in the United States. \nYet despite the important role that worker ownership can play in \nrevitalizing our economy, the Federal Government has failed to commit \nthe resources needed to allow employee ownership to realize its true \npotential, and that is why this amendment is so important.\n  While this issue may be new to this bill, I have actually been \nworking on it for several years. In the House, when I was the ranking \nmember of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, \nI was able to hold a hearing on this issue nearly 4 years ago and we \nhad some wonderful testimony.\n  I fear in the next 10 to 20 years, if we do not change course, there \nwill not be a major automobile industry in this country. We must not \nallow that to happen. We must protect good-paying jobs in this country. \nI believe employee ownership may be one of the ways we can keep good-\npaying jobs in America.\n  Let me conclude by saying in my opinion it would be much more \nimportant to provide this assistance to employees who could be creating \nand retaining jobs right here in the United States by the expansion of \nemployee ownership. This is a very important issue. There is a lot of \nexcitement all over the country about it. Let us protect American jobs. \nLet us give working people in this country the opportunity to own the \nplaces in which they are working. Let us make this country more \neconomically competitive. I very much hope my colleagues will be \nsupporting this amendment when it is offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 928\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for regular order with respect to \nthe DeMint amendment No. 928.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 947 to Amendment No. 928\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask to call up the Dodd-Shelby \namendment No. 947. It is a second-degree amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. Dodd, \n     for himself and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     947 to amendment No. 928.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to small \n                  business growth and capital markets)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH \n                   AND CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the most fair, most transparent, \n     and most efficient capital markets in the world, in part due \n     to its strong securities statutory and regulatory scheme;\n       (2) it is of paramount importance for the continued growth \n     of our Nation's economy, that our capital markets retain \n     their leading position in the world;\n       (3) small businesses are vital participants in United \n     States capital markets, and play a critical role in future \n     economic growth and high-wage job creation;\n       (4) section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has \n     greatly enhanced the quality of corporate governance and \n     financial reporting for public companies and increased \n     investor confidence;\n       (5) the Securities and Exchange Commission (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Commission'') and the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board (in this section referred to as \n     the ``PCAOB'') have both determined that the current auditing \n     standard implementing section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n     of 2002 has imposed unnecessary and unintended cost burdens \n     on small and mid-sized public companies;\n       (6) the Commission and PCAOB are now near completion of a \n     2-year process intended to revise the standard in order to \n     provide more efficient and effective regulation; and\n       (7) the chairman of the Commission recently has said, with \n     respect to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, \n     that, ``We don't need to change the law, we need to change \n     the way the law is implemented. It is the implementation of \n     the law that has caused the excessive burden, not the law \n     itself. That's an important distinction. I don't believe \n     these important investor protections, which are even now only \n     a few years old, should be opened up for amendment, or that \n     they need to be.''.\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Commission and the PCAOB should complete \n     promulgation of the final rules implementing section 404 of \n     the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request here \nwhich I will propound at this point, that sets out a procedure for us \nto follow this evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:10 p.m. the Senate resume debate \nwith respect to the Dodd-Shelby amendment, No. 947, and the DeMint \namendment No. 928, with the time divided 5 minutes each for Senators \nDodd and Shelby, and 10 minutes under the control of Senator DeMint, to \nbe debated concurrently; that no amendments be in order to either \namendment and that the Dodd amendment be modified to be a first-degree \namendment; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Dodd-Shelby amendment, as modified; \nthat there be 2 minutes between the votes equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Dodd and DeMint or their designees, to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to the DeMint amendment; that upon the \nuse of that time, the Senate, without further intervening action or \ndebate, vote in relation to the DeMint amendment; that upon disposition \nof the DeMint amendment, the Senate resume the Coburn amendment No. \n917, and that the previous order with respect to the debate time prior \nto the vote be in order, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Bingaman and Coburn or their designees; and without \nfurther debate the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Coburn \namendment No. 917; that no amendment be in order to the Coburn \namendment; that upon disposition of these amendments it be in order to \ncall up the Sununu amendment No. 938 and the Sanders amendment No. 936, \nand the Senate then return to the regular order of amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I did not realize that the time was \nreserved between now and 5:10. Is it reserved? My impression was that \nthe floor was open for Senators to speak or offer amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Ensign was supposed to \nspeak after Senator Sanders.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Ensign will not be here. Senator Hutchison and \nthen Senator Cornyn would like to take that time. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn be allowed to take \nthe time between now and 5:10 when the vote begins.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could we clarify what the request is? I \nam sorry. I was not able to pay full attention.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I asked that Senator Hutchison have 10 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Cornyn for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Could we modify that request to provide that Senator \nCornyn's intention is to offer and then withdraw an amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, that is my intention.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Could we ask the intention of the senior Senator from \nTexas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I intend to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator from \nTexas being allotted 10 minutes and then the other Senator from Texas, \nMr. Cornyn, going ahead with his comments and the offering and \nwithdrawal of an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the America COMPETES Act. \nI thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Bingaman, and Senator Cornyn. I have worked with all of them to \ntry to focus first on what the problems are with regard to higher \neducation and then to look at K-12 education. Certainly, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, having been the Secretary of Education and the Governor \nof Tennessee, has dealt with education issues and has taken a major \nlead on trying to reform our education system so that it does meet the \nneeds of the future generation.\n  Having the National Academy do a study, resulting in the report \ncalled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' was exactly the right \nthing to do. I would never have thought we could have such a clear \nmessage from the National Academy about what we do right, what we do \nwrong, what is missing, and what we have to improve.\n  Norm Augustine, former chairman of the board of Lockheed Corporation, \nwas chairman of the committee. It was a distinguished group, including \nthe former president of Texas A who is now Secretary of Defense. \nThere were others. I was so pleased to see that they saw the problem.\n  The problem is that fewer than 30 percent of U.S. fourth- and eighth-\ngrade students performed at a proficient level or higher in \nmathematics. The United States placed near the bottom 20 percent of \nnations in advanced mathematics and physics in testing. The United \nStates is 20th among nations in the proportion of its 24-year-olds with \ndegrees in science or engineering. The United States graduates about \n70,000 engineers every year. India is matriculating about 250,000, and \nin China the number is even greater. Within a few years, approximately \n90 percent of all scientists and engineers in the world will live in \nAsia. If we have fewer innovators, we are going to have fewer \ninnovations.\n  America has staked its economy on being the creators for the world. \nWe have had the innovators. We have had the engineers, the scientists, \nthe researchers. Yet we are now falling back in K-12, and our \ninstitutions of higher education are not getting students with the \nproper prerequisites to go into those course studies. We have to start \nfrom the beginning. The bill before us takes those steps. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor.\n  There are three areas: research, education, and innovation.\n  First, research. The bill increases the research investment by \ndoubling the authorized funding levels for the National Science \nFoundation. It also substantially increases funding in the Department \nof Energy's Office of Science, and it brings NASA into the equation, \none of our premier research institutions. We are going to increase the \nemphasis on science in NASA because we already have the infrastructure. \nWe have paid for the infrastructure, but we are shortchanging the \nscience. So that is a part of this bill as well.\n  The second focus is education, specifically in the fields of science, \ntechnology, engineering, math, and critical foreign languages. We offer \ncompetitive grants to States to promote better coordination of \nelementary and secondary education. We want to strengthen the skill of \nteachers by giving them incentives to major in their course curriculum \nand then get education certifications in the same college degree but as \na secondary part of their degree rather than the primary focus of their \ndegree, because if we have math majors teaching math instead of \neducation majors teaching math, we know the student is going to have a \nbetter opportunity to excel. We want to give the people who have \nalready chosen teaching the opportunity to get a higher degree in their \ncourse curriculum, go back and get a master's degree and help them with \ngrants to do that, because if they will commit to continuing to teach, \nthen we will have better qualified teachers.\n\n  Innovation is the third focus of our bill. Since the beginning of the \nindustrial revolution, America has been the innovator in the world. \nEconomic studies have shown that as much as 85 percent of the measured \ngrowth in per\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\ncapita income has been due to technological change. But these \ntechnologies did not appear out of thin air; they were designed and \ndeveloped by scientists and engineers at innovative companies such as \nEDS, Dell, Apple, Microsoft, and through Government investment in NASA \nand the National Science Foundation.\n  With that in mind, our bill ensures that both NASA and the National \nScience Foundation are able to expand their strong traditional roles in \nfostering technological and scientific excellence. We have increased \nNASA funding to support basic research and foster new innovation, but \nthe NASA budget is being starved with infrastructure requirements. They \nare not able to do the science that would make the investment in the \ninfrastructure pay off. We have to bring NASA back to its original \nscientific purpose. We have the Innovative Partnerships Program. We \nhave the NASA Education Program. We are beginning to focus on exactly \nwhat we need to do.\n  This is a bipartisan effort sorely needed in Congress today, \nsomething on which we can all agree. America is falling behind. We are \nfalling behind in education. We are falling behind in innovation. We \nare importing technological jobs that we ought to be creating ourselves \nwith our own American students, but we don't have enough qualified \nstudents graduating from our colleges to fill these technical jobs. We \nneed to upgrade our education system. That is exactly what this bill \ntoday is trying to do. We are attempting--both sides of the aisle--to \nmake America better, to reclaim our prowess in education, K-12 as well \nas higher education, and to make sure we continue to be the innovators \nof the future as we have been in the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Let's work on \namendments. Let's get them through, but let's come to a conclusion. I \nknow the President would like to sign a bill that moves our country \nforward in something as important as education.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 902\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \n     increase competitiveness in the United States)\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment, call up amendment \n902, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 902.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I told the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, it is my \nintention to withdraw this amendment following my remarks. But I \nbelieve it is important, when we are talking about America's \ncompetitiveness, to talk about people with some of the very most \ndesirable skills and education and how it is that we might attract them \nto live and work and create jobs here in America.\n  First, I express my gratitude to both Senator Bingaman and Senator \nAlexander for their leadership on this issue. It is not often enough \nthat we have an opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis on something \nthat is so right and so good and so meritorious as this. It feels good. \nI think we ought to do it more often.\n  I do wish to talk about this amendment which is called the Securing \nKnowledge, Innovation, and Leadership Act amendment, otherwise known as \nthe SKIL bill. This was a component of the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill that passed the Senate last year. Of course, that did not \ngo anywhere. We are back again. I assure my colleagues that we will be \ncoming back time and time again until we get this matter voted on.\n  In the past 2 years, there has been much focus by Congress and the \nadministration on restoring America's competitive edge. While some have \nviewed the SKIL bill, as it is called, as an immigration issue, I \nbelieve it should be considered as a competitiveness issue, not just an \nimmigration one. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences included \nsimilar recommendations in its study ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm.'' This very report was the original, the genesis of America \nCOMPETES and several other bills introduced in the 109th Congress. That \nreport recommended to Congress that it should ``continue to improve \nvisa processing for international students and scholars to provide less \ncomplex procedures and continue to make improvements on such issues as \nvisa categories and duration, travel for scientific meetings, the \ntechnology-alert list, reciprocity agreements, and changes in status.'' \nThe report also recommended that Congress should ``institute a new \nskills-based, preferential immigration option. Doctoral-level education \nin science and engineering skills would substantially raise an \napplicant's chances and priority in obtaining U.S. citizenship'' under \nthis particular legislation.\n  The United States has always been blessed by recruiting the best and \nthe brightest from all around the world, whether they be scholars, \nscientists, or researchers. As we all know, the United States is now \nengaged, though, in a global competition for these very same \nscientists, scholars, and researchers.\n  In this global economy, there are only three ways for us to retain \nthe most brilliant workforce in the world: No. 1, we can grow our own \ntalent, which is the intent of the bill we are debating right now; No. \n2, we can continue to recruit the top students from around the world \nfrom other nations; or, No. 3, we can watch our companies move their \nworkforce and jobs to other countries in order to find that talented \nworkforce and to remain competitive. I don't know if there are any \nother choices than those--grow our own talent, import the best talent, \nor see our jobs go overseas. Those are the choices we have. The \ncountries that can attract and retain the best and the brightest will \nobviously have an advantage over other countries in this global \ncompetition.\n  As we have heard, the United States does not produce enough \nengineers. Over half of master's and Ph.D. degrees in the United States \ngo to foreign students each year, foreign students who study in the \nUnited States. China graduates four times as many engineers as we do, \nand within a few years approximately 90 percent of all scientists and \nengineers in the world will be in Asia.\n\n  Foreign students help us fill the gap right now--a gap we are going \nto try to make up through growing more of our own talent right here \nthrough the great provisions of this legislation--but then our \nimmigration policy, as currently constituted, forces these best and \nbrightest students, these foreign students, to return home because \nthere are no high-tech visas.\n  Our immigration policy has not adapted to the changing international \nenvironment or this global competition. Only 65,000 visas are issued \neach year to this category of the best and the brightest. For the past \nfew years, the cap has been reached before the fiscal year even begins. \nBut this year, on April 1, 2007, there was a loud outcry for immediate \nrelief in our highly skilled immigration policies because that was the \nday the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service announced the 2008 cap \nfor H-1B visas was met. That is right, because the United States has \nalready met the cap for H-1B visas, foreign students graduating from \nour universities this spring are virtually shut out of the U.S. job \nmarket. We hit that cap on the very day the opportunity for filing for \nthose types of visas was presented.\n  This situation is unprecedented. What it means is employers cannot \nhire highly educated workers for up to 1 year, until the next allotment \nof visas becomes available. With global competition, of course, these \nworkers have a lot of other options as to where to go. They can go to \nEngland. They can go to France. They can go to India. They can go to \nChina. In short, they can go to our global competitors and work there \nand take the jobs that\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\ncould be created here in America with them.\n  This SKIL bill has important protections for American workers, and I \nhope my colleagues will listen to this because there is, frankly, a lot \nof misconception about foreign students and foreign workers coming here \nand taking American jobs at a lower wage. In fact, high-tech visas \ngenerate fees to pay for U.S. worker training programs. Every time an \nemployer sponsors a foreign worker, that employer must contribute to a \nfund to train U.S. workers. Of course, under our law, they cannot be \nhired to come in and work at a lower wage than would have to be paid to \na comparable U.S. worker. Immigrant professionals actually create jobs \nhere in the United States. The founder of Intel is a prime example. He \nwas an immigrant from Hungary and has created hundreds of thousands of \njobs at his company here in America.\n  So sound policy will start by retaining foreign students who are \neducated here in the United States, particularly in the most sought \nafter areas of math, science, and engineering.\n  We should exempt from the annual visa limit any foreign student who \ngraduates from a U.S. university with a master's degree or a Ph.D. \ndegree in these essential fields. It is simply a matter of economic \nsurvival and competition for the United States. Also, insourcing \ntalented workers, as I pointed out, is preferable to outsourcing those \njobs and the associated economic activity that goes with it to other \ncountries. We should make it easier for those who do comply with our \nimmigration laws to travel in and out of our country as well. We must \nalso attract the best and brightest who are working in other countries \nto come here and do their work in the United States so those jobs can \nstay here.\n  In the long run, we have to improve our schools and encourage more \nU.S. students to study engineering and mathematics, and the America \nCOMPETES Act, as it is currently written, does just that. But in the \nshort term, we have to adapt our immigration policy so when those U.S. \nstudents are educated in engineering fields, there will be jobs right \nhere in the United States for them to perform. Then we can reap the \nbenefits of the most outstanding college and university education in \nthe world, which students travel from all around the world in order to \nbe able to obtain, and then that they not have to go home after they \ngraduate from college if they are in the essential fields of math, \nscience, and engineering.\n  If we do not act, America's technology industry, its health care \nindustry, higher education, research institutions, financial services \nindustries will be harmed and our economy will suffer. The intersection \nof our immigration policy and our country's ability to compete for \nglobal talent is critical, and we cannot wait years to address this \nissue. It is imperative we address it as soon as possible.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 902, withdrawn\n\n  My only regret is we are unable to do so on this bill because it \nbelongs on this bill. But I understand the practical ramifications of \ncontinuing to insist upon a vote on this particular amendment at this \ntime. So it is with some regret that I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment but urge my colleagues to continue to work to \nsupport H-1B visa reform and see that the SKIL bill, as currently \npresented as an amendment to this bill, is ultimately enacted into law \nbecause, frankly, it is in the best interest of the United States and \nAmerican jobs right here at home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Texas is withdrawn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor.\n  Yhe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, within 3 or 4 minutes, we will be \nmoving to amendments as described by the Senator from New Mexico. But \nbefore he speaks, let me thank the Senator from Texas both for his \nleadership on the amendment and for his spirit of cooperation and \nwillingness to withdraw the amendment.\n  It is my hope that this is not the end of that discussion. I strongly \nagree with him. Our immigration laws are archaic in this regard. We \nhave 650,000 legal new citizens every year, and we should, in our own \ninterests, allow highly skilled men and women--the brightest people in \nthe world who come here to study, earn these degrees in science, \ntechnology, math--to stay here and create jobs instead of going home \nand creating jobs. We should do that. So he has highlighted that. The \nSenate adopted that last year. I hope we will have a chance to adopt it \nagain before Memorial Day. I salute the Senator for that, and I hope \nthis is just the beginning of his insistence on this and other types of \nlegislation that would reform our immigration policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me also commend the Senator from \nTexas and thank him for his support for the underlying legislation. I \ndo think the substance of what he is trying to get accomplished with \nregard to the immigration laws of the country--I very much support \ntrying to facilitate allowing people who get an education here to stay \nhere and use those talents and skills and knowledge they have acquired \nto benefit our country. So we need to work on that. I think the \nappropriate place to do that is as part of the debate we will do on \nimmigration, which is coming up. The majority leader has indicated he \nplans to get to that issue in May, so I think, clearly, that is coming \nup very soon. But I commend the Senator from Texas for his willingness \nto withdraw his amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not going to take any time. In \nfact, I just want to do something I very rarely do, but it seems \nappropriate based on the arguments I have made this day. So I am going \nto ask for a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair. My parliamentary \ninquiry is, would this bill, with any of the amendments that have been \nadopted so far, be subject to a point of order under the Budget Act of \nthe United States?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of any such points of \norder against this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 908, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to amendment No. \n908 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 55, lines 21 and 22, strike ``engineering)'' and \n     insert ``engineering and technology)''.\n       On page 56, line 8, after ``engineering'' insert ``and \n     technology''.\n       On page 56, line 24, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, engineering, and technology''.\n       On page 59, line 6, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, and, to the extent applicable, \n     technology and engineering''.\n       On page 59, line 15, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 60, line 6, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 60, line 10, before ``that'' insert ``in \n     mathematics, science, and to the extent applicable, \n     technology and engineering''.\n       On page 60, line 24, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, and to the extent applicable, \n     technology and engineering''.\n       On page 61, lines 8 and 9, strike ``mathematics and \n     science'' and insert ``mathematics, science, and, to the \n     extent applicable, technology and engineering''.\n       On page 62, line 14, strike ``mathematics or science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, or engineering''.\n       On page 65, lines 16 and 17, strike ``MATHEMATICS AND \n     SCIENCE'' and insert ``MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND \n     ENGINEERING''.\n       On page 65, line 19, strike ``MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE'' and \n     insert ``MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENGINEERING''.\n       On page 66, lines 8 and 9, strike ``Mathematics and \n     Science'' and insert ``Mathematics, Science, Technology, and \n     Engineering''.\n       On page 67, line 9, strike ``Mathematics and Science'' and \n     insert ``Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Engineering''.\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n       On page 67, lines 16 and 17, strike ``math and science'' \n     and insert ``mathematics, science, and technology''.\n       On page 68, lines 21 and 22, strike ``mathematics or \n     science (including engineering)'' and insert ``mathematics, \n     science, or engineering''.\n       On page 69, lines 4 and 5, strike ``mathematics or \n     science'' and insert ``mathematics, science, or technology''.\n       Beginning on page 69, line 25 through page 70, line 1, \n     strike ``mathematics and science'' and insert ``mathematics, \n     science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 70, lines 10 and 11, strike ``mathematics and \n     science'' and insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and \n     engineering''.\n       On page 71, line 7, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 71, line 10, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 71, line 18, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, and, to the extent applicable, \n     technology and engineering''.\n       On page 72, line 23, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and engineering''.\n       On page 73, line 14, strike ``mathematics and science'' and \n     insert ``mathematics, science, and to the extent applicable, \n     technology and engineering''.\n       On page 73, lines 18 and 19, strike ``mathematics and \n     science'' and insert ``mathematics, science, and to the \n     extent applicable, technology and engineering''.\n       On page 73, lines 23 and 24, strike ``mathematics and \n     science'' and insert ``mathematics, science, technology, and \n     engineering''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed to act on this \nmodified amendment at this point. This is the managers' package from \nthe Energy Committee, and it clarifies several points that are of a \ntechnical nature. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment, as \nmodified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the managers' amendment, as \nmodified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 908), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 940\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also call up amendment No. 940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again, this is a managers' package from \nthe HELP Committee. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi are cosponsoring \nthis. I would urge that the Senate agree to this amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 940) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know Senator Dodd \nand Senator Shelby are here ready to speak, and Senator DeMint as well, \nwith regard to their respective amendments.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 947 and 928\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 947 is \nmodified to be a first-degree amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Dodd has 5 minutes, \nSenator Shelby has 5 minutes, and Senator DeMint has 10 minutes under \nthe order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly first thank my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, the former chairman of the Banking Committee, \nwho will also be offering this amendment for the consideration of our \ncolleagues.\n  Our markets, I think all of us know, are the most fair and efficient \nin the world due to many reasons, but in large part to our strong \nstatutory and regulatory schemes in the country. The amendment we are \noffering recognizes the very significant role of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \nof improving and maintaining the integrity of the capital markets of \nthis country, as well as the important role of small businesses in \neconomic growth and job creation. We all remember and understand very \nwell the debate that went on a number of years ago as a result of some \nof the disasters that occurred in Enron and WorldCom to make sure our \npublic companies would be more accountable and more responsive to the \nconcerns of the shareholders.\n  The SEC and the PCAOB have determined that the existing \nimplementation of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has not \nfully achieved the intent of the statute. Last December, they proposed \nmanagement guidance and revised auditing standards to more \nappropriately implement the statute, without having an unintended or \ninappropriate impact on small businesses.\n  The amendment I offer with my colleague from Alabama expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board continue their rulemaking and \nfinalize their ongoing rulemaking process. These two agencies are \ncurrently considering about 200 comments and letters from the public \ncommenting on their proposed regulations dealing with section 404. The \nletters come from a wide variety of interested parties, offering views \non the strengths of the proposals and suggestions for those \nimprovements. The capital markets and all businesses, including small \nbusinesses, will be better served by a deliberative process of \nrulemaking conducted by these agencies.\n  I commend Chris Cox for the fine job he is doing at the SEC. They \nhave responded very well to the concerns about the section 404 \nrequirements, particularly the smaller public companies.\n  SEC Chairman Cox has recently said:\n\n       We don't need to change the law.\n\n  I am quoting him now, Mr. President.\n\n       We need to change the way the law is implemented. It is the \n     implementation of the law that has caused the excessive \n     burden, not the law itself. That is an important distinction.\n\n  He goes on to say.\n\n       I don't believe these important investor protections, which \n     are even now only a few years old, should be opened up to an \n     amendment, or that they need to be.\n\n  I agree with Chris Cox, President Bush's appointee to head up the \nSEC. They are doing a very fine job. I think it would be irresponsible \nfor us at this juncture to jump in and basically reduce by 80 percent \nthe number of companies that would have to comply with section 404. Let \nthe SEC do their job. That is what we have asked them to do. They are \nresponsible. They are a responsible agency in charge of looking at \nthis. If and when they come back, and there are those of us here who \nfeel they haven't gone far enough, that those burdens still exist, then \nI would welcome an opportunity to address that. But it is very \npremature to jump in at this juncture while the SEC is doing the job we \nasked them to do, acting responsibly, and performing their public \nfunctions under good leadership. It seems to me this is not a moment \nfor us to jump into the middle of this and by a vote of small margins \ndecide we are going to tell these agencies what to do with the \nprofessional staffs they have and the commentary process where the \npublic has an opportunity to address and comment on the suggested rule \nchanges that Christopher Cox and his staff at the SEC and the other \ncommissioners are considering at this moment.\n  So for all of those reasons, we are offering this amendment which \noffers us an opportunity to express our concerns about where this is \nheaded. Let's send a message that we are watching very carefully, we \ncare about this, but avoid the situation of this body engaging in a \nregulatory process, which is properly left to the agencies charged with \nthat responsibility. For those reasons I urge the adoption of the Dodd-\nShelby amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland, the chairman of the subcommittee, as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that we are \nfamiliar with has provided real benefits to the capital markets. On the \nother hand, there is no question that its implementation has been too \ncostly, particularly for small public companies. We know this. This is \na given.\n  That is why I am encouraged that the securities regulators charged \nwith implementing this legislation at the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB are near the end of a 2-year\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\nprocess to make significant changes that are likely to reduce the \nunacceptable costs and burdens of section 404 compliance which Senator \nDodd alluded to.\n  This body, I believe, ought to give the regulators, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard a chance to fix this problem, because they have been involved in \nthis for over a year now. It is very complex. Both the SEC and the \nPCAOB acted last December, just a few months ago, to propose \ninitiatives aimed at reducing the costs associated with section 404 of \nSarbanes-Oxley. These actions are the most significant to date and \nshould lower costs on investments while at the same time preserving the \nbenefits of effective internal controls.\n  In testimony before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee last week, Chairman Cox of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission stated:\n\n       Focusing on the implementation of 404, rather than changing \n     the law, is consistent with the SEC's view that the problems \n     we have seen with 404 to date can be remedied without \n     amending the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n  I am willing to give the SEC a limited opportunity to deliver. \nChairman Cox said the Commission's 404 proposal would permit companies \nto:\n\n       Scale and tailor their evaluation procedures to fit their \n     facts and circumstances, and investors will benefit from the \n     use-compliance costs.\n\n  The SEC is expected to adopt the measure in the next few weeks.\n  The PCAOB, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's, proposals \nto repeal auditing standard No. 2 and replace it with a new standard on \nauditing internal control over financial reporting would provide, \naccording to PCAOB Chairman Mark Olson:\n\n       Additional flexibility to promote scalability, avoid \n     unintended consequences, and address other valid concerns.\n\n  The PCAOB is currently reviewing the comments submitted in response \nto its proposal and is expected, along with the SEC, to submit the \nstandard for SEC review and approval next month. Chairman Cox of the \nSEC, whom we have worked with on the Banking Committee a lot, said the \ntwo regulators have worked together to ensure that the new rules are:\n\n       Mutually reinforceable and should significantly improve the \n     implementation of section 404, making it more efficient and \n     effective for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n  That is what we all want. We all agree that unnecessary costs imposed \nby regulations are a real problem for both large and small companies. \nThe regulators have acknowledged this fact and are attempting to \naddress it. On the Banking Committee that Chairman Dodd now chairs and \nwhich I chaired, we have oversight of that, and we have worked with \nthem and have had hearings to give some relief to small businesses \nhere, and they are in the process of doing it. I am willing to give the \nSEC and the PCAOB some additional time, but I am not willing to give \nthem unlimited time. We shouldn't do that. Chairman Dodd and I intend \nto monitor closely their progress and hold them accountable should \nthere be any unnecessary delays.\n  I urge my colleagues this afternoon to support the Dodd-Shelby \namendment with the understanding that we intend to follow closely in \noversight, working with the regulators, their progress and will take \nwhatever action is necessary to ensure the vitality of our small \nbusiness community, which is vital and important to America. I urge \nsupport of the Dodd-Shelby amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will vote on \ntwo amendments related to Sarbanes-Oxley. The first is the Dodd-Shelby \namendment, which is a nonbinding resolution that suggests the SEC and \nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board move ahead with changing \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. My amendment, which will come after \nthat, actually changes the law in one small section of Sarbanes-Oxley, \nwhich would facilitate that happening.\n  Despite what has been reported today, my conversation with some of \nthe regulators and some of the observers of the SEC is there is not \nreal clarity as to how far the SEC can go in changing this one section \nthat is problematic in Sarbanes-Oxley. We know from our work with \nFederal agencies that as long as there is doubt, there is no action. \nWhile there has been good intent from the SEC for many years, this bill \nhas been destroying our capital formation in this country for nearly 5 \nyears. Admittedly, Sarbanes-Oxley has done some good things, but I \nthink it is beyond question particularly for small companies, small \npublic companies, that section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley is doing untold \nharm in this country today. So the difference here is a nonbinding \nresolution which encourages the SEC to act and an amendment that \nactually makes that happen.\n  I am going to support the Dodd-Shelby amendment. While I have some \nproblems with the specific findings, the intent is right. The \nregulators have a responsibility to continue to look at their \nregulations to make sure they encourage competition and good enterprise \nin our country. So I am going to support the amendment. But Congress \nalso has a responsibility to make sure that the laws we pass work, and \nif they are not interpreted properly by our regulatory agencies, that \nwe go back and make those changes to make it work.\n\n  So the ``sense of the Senate'' maintains the status quo for \nregulatory agencies to determine how we deal with Sarbanes-Oxley. While \nI know the chairman and ranking member remain hopeful that something \nwill happen, the same thing was said to me well over a year ago when I \ntalked to Chairman Cox and others that the changes were eminent, but \nsince then in this country we have lost our status as the No. 1 market \nexchange. Instead of 9 out of every 10 IPOs being formed in this \ncountry with foreign capital, it is completely reversed, where 9 out of \n10 are out of this country. Our trade competitors have Sarbanes-Oxley \nfree zones that encourage capital to come that way instead of toward \nus. We cannot leave the responsibility for this law on the regulatory \nagencies.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for both amendments.\n  I thank Senator Martinez, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Ensign for \nsupporting and cosponsoring my amendment. I also thank Democratic \nCongressman Gregory Meeks from New York for having the courage to \nintroduce this measure in the House.\n  I also want to inform my colleagues that my amendment today is \nsupported by the Independent Community Bankers of America. It is also \nbeing key voted by the Americans for Tax Reform, the Club for Growth, \nthe Americans for Prosperity, and many other people who look at our \neconomy across the country and realize it is time for Congress to act. \nWe have waited for the SEC for 5 years and have seen capital chased \nfrom this country. It is time for Congress to take the responsibility \nfor what we did in the first place, and I urge my colleagues to support \nboth amendments.\n  I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Florida, to speak on behalf \nof my amendment.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I add a word of encouragement to our \ncolleagues to support both of these good amendments. I agree \nwholeheartedly with my colleague from South Carolina that it is time we \ntake action. It is time we act.\n  I have heard untold stories for years now as a candidate for the \nSenate and as a Senator of the problems that small companies of America \nare facing over the burdens imposed upon them by section 404, unfair \nburdens that disproportionately fall on small businesses than they do \non large. A recent GAO study requested by our colleague Senator Snowe \nfound the cost of compliance for small public companies to comply with \nSarbanes-Oxley has been disproportionately higher for small businesses \nthan it was for larger companies.\n  Small businesses are vital to the growth of business in America. They \nare where most of our jobs are created in this day and time. The fact \nis for us to idly sit by and hope the regulators will do the right \nthing, hope they go far enough, isn't good enough for me. I want to act \nnow. I want to make sure we support the amendment by Senators Dodd and \nShelby, but I also want to encourage support for our amendment, because \nours will take action and will do it now.\n  What it does is it exempts smaller companies with market \ncapitalization\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nof less than $700 million, with revenues of less than $125 million, and \nwith fewer than 1,500 shareholders from the onerous burdens of section \n404.\n  There are a number of ways to maintain investor protections while \nlowering the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, but we should start by \nexempting small companies from having to comply with section 404 of \nSarbanes-Oxley, the section that requires the double audit.\n  Oftentimes small business cannot even find an accounting firm willing \nto perform the audit, let alone afford to take a significant percentage \nof revenue to conduct a duplicate audit. The fact is this is strangling \nAmerica's business. It is, as Senator DeMint pointed out, not allowing \nus to play the role we have traditionally played in the capital market.\n  Mayor Bloomberg conducted a study in New York about why we were \nlosing our competitive edge vis-a-vis other foreign markets. One of the \nreasons that was found for that, among several others--but it is a \nsignificant reason--was Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.\n  It is time we act. We passed the law and it was a good thing to do; \nit has done a lot of good. But aspects of it are now hurting American \nbusiness and we need to pull those back. That is what the DeMint \namendment does. I encourage my colleagues to do that as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: These bills are \nside-by-sides, correct? This is not a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both amendments are first-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DeMINT. My colleagues can vote for both of these amendments. I \nencourage Members of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, to \nvote for both of them because both are needed. We need the SEC to take \nits responsibility. But since there is some concern as to how far the \nSEC can go to correct this problem, my amendment simply changes one \naspect of Sarbanes-Oxley that allows small companies--companies with \n$125 million in revenue or less, or less than 1,500 shareholders--to \nvoluntarily opt out of the external audit, with notification to their \nshareholders.\n  These are certainly not huge corporations. This certainly doesn't gut \nSarbanes-Oxley. It does what so many economic experts have encouraged \nus to do for years, and that is to fix the one small part of Sarbanes-\nOxley that costs small businesses in a disproportionate way.\n  I thank the managers and those who offered the side-by-side, and I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for both of them.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 38 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, Chris Cox, Chairman of the SEC, pointed out he \ndoesn't want the law changed. He wants to be able to work with the \nCommission and the staff to deal with these issues. The Chairman of the \nSEC has wide latitude within which to operate here. The statute gives \nbroad discretion. Senator Shelby and I believe this matter ought to be \nleft at this juncture. The Commission is relegated to do their job. Let \nthem complete their work and make their recommendations. If we are \ndissatisfied, we can respond.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 seconds.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have been informed by my staff that the \nstaff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, headed by Christopher \nCox, a former Congressman, has reiterated a few minutes ago to our \nBanking Committee staff that they will be done with this work in a few \nweeks. This is premature, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. As I said earlier, I believe we need to let the SEC and \nPCAOB do their work. I agree with Chairman Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dodd-\nShelby-Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Menendez). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 138 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     McCain\n  The amendment (No. 947), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 928\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 928 offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at an appropriate moment, along with my \ncolleague from Alabama, I will offer a motion to table the DeMint \namendment. I do so respectfully of my colleague. We are just about 2 or \n3 weeks away from the SEC issuing regulations regarding Sarbanes-Oxley \non this 404 issue. It would be inappropriate for us to jump in and draw \na conclusion as to what the SEC ought to be doing.\n  Chris Cox is doing a very good job at the SEC. Staff and \nCommissioners are doing the job we asked them to do.\n  To conclude the point here, this is a matter that is being well \naddressed by the SEC under Chris Cox. They have asked to have the \nappropriate time, the remaining 2 or 3 weeks, to finish their \nrecommendations. They may very well come to the recommendation that has \nbeen offered by our colleague from South Carolina, but we ought to \nallow them to do their job. That is what they have been asked to do.\n  We are not a regulatory body. We don't have to agree with them, but \nwe should allow them to complete their work. That is why we are \noffering this amendment. It is premature for us to jump in before they \nhave completed their task.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 30 seconds \nfor my colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Dodd. We work on the \nBanking Committee with this. The SEC has asked us to hold off. We all \nwant to give relief under Sarbanes-Oxley for small businesses. The SEC, \nPCAOB are in the process of doing this, and this is probably going to \nhappen in the next couple of weeks.\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\n  I don't disagree with what Senator DeMint is trying to do, but I \nthink it is premature. The timing is not good. But the timing is always \ngood if we work with the SEC on something they know a heck of a lot \nabout. This is a very complex issue.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the United States has the fairest, \nmost transparent and most efficient financial markets in the world. Our \nNation achieved this status by developing a regulatory approach that \ninsures investors around the world have confidence in our markets. We \ncannot go back to the days of Enron accounting for small businesses.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I oppose the amendment by Senator DeMint to provide \nan exemption from Sarbanes-Oxley regulations for small public companies \nbecause I believe it is premature, would endanger small business \ninvestors and limit access to capital for small public companies in the \nUnited States.\n  Last week, I held a hearing in the committee on the upcoming changes \nto the Sarbanes-Oxley law and how they will affect small business. In \nthat hearing, no Senator or witness expressed any support for providing \na permanent exemption from Sarbanes-Oxley regulations for small public \ncompanies. The Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher \nCox has said that he strongly opposes any type of permanent exemption \nfor small public companies from Sarbanes-Oxley regulations.\n  Here is why. It wasn't too long ago, between the years 1998-2000, \nthat public companies were issuing financial restatements at a rate \nthat was higher than the previous 10 years combined. Too often, public \ncompanies were overstating their income to attract investors. As a \nresult, the trust and confidence of the American people in their \nfinancial markets was dangerously eroded by the actions of WorldCom, \nInc., Enron, Arthur Andersen and others. The shocking malfeasance by \nthese businesses and accounting firms put a strain on the growth of our \neconomy, cost investors billions in assets and hurt the integrity of \nour financial markets around the world.\n  By all accounts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has brought back \naccountability to corporate governance, auditing, and financial \nreporting for public companies. The audit of internal controls over \nfinancial reporting has produced significant benefits and public \ncompany financial reporting has improved. As a result, investor \nconfidence in our capital markets has been restored and our Nation's \neconomic growth continues. Recent published reports show that \naccounting restatements on large companies' financial reports declined \nby 20 percent last year. This is important evidence that Sarbanes-Oxley \nis working.\n  These improvements, however, have not come without some drawbacks. \nToo many small public companies who played by the rules are now \nexpected to deal with the time and financial burden required to comply \nwith the Sarbanes-Oxley law. Last year, small businesses with less than \n$75 million in assets saw the number of financial restatements increase \nby 46 percent. This shows that small businesses getting ready to comply \nwith Sarbanes-Oxley are having trouble. But I believe we will all \nbenefit when small businesses eventually comply with Sarbanes Oxley. \nAccording to a recent United States Government Accounting Office--GAO--\nstudy requested by Senator Snowe, the cost of compliance and the time \nneeded for small public companies to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley \nregulations has been disproportionately higher than for large public \ncompanies. Firms with assets of $1 billion or more spend just thirteen \ncents per $100 in revenue for audit fees, while small businesses are \nforced to spend more than a dollar per $100 in revenue to comply with \nthe same rules.\n  The response to these problems is not to give a permanent blanket \nexemption from these regulations to small public companies, instead we \nneed to assist them in making the transition to comply with the Law. \nThat is why the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board--\nPCAOB--are currently considering final rules and guidance on the \nimplementation of Sarbanes-Oxley that will make it easier for small \nbusinesses to comply with the law.\n  In his testimony to the Small Business Committee, Chairman Cox said \nthree quarters of the comment letters regarding the proposed Sarbanes-\nOxley rule changes from small business interests supported the efforts \nto make it easier for small businesses to comply with the law. \nSpecifically, these small businesses believed that the proposed rules \nwould allow managements to tailor their audits and evaluations to the \nfacts and circumstances of their particular companies and focus on \ntheir areas that are most important to reliable financial reporting.\n  Chairman Olson testified at the same hearing that while the PCAOB is \ncommitted to making the process cost-effective for small businesses, \nthe oversight program it has in place is reducing the risk of financial \nreporting failures and renewing confidence in U.S. security markets. We \nalso heard from Joseph Piche, whose private company Eikos, Inc. \noperates out of Franklin, MA. Mr. Piche's testimony reflected the \nsentiments of so many small business owners--that while the burdens of \ncost make it difficult under the current regulatory structure, \nentrepreneurs rely on capital markets, and capital markets rely on \ntrust. The Sarbanes-Oxley law has helped to restore this trust.\n  So the upcoming changes to Sarbanes-Oxley will save small public \ncompanies time and money. Unfortunately, before these changes are even \nfinalized, the DeMint amendment would provide a permanent exemption to \nmore than 6,000 small public companies from ever having to comply with \nSarbanes-Oxley.\n  As Mr. Piche and other industry witnesses told the Small Business \nCommittee, small businesses aren't resistant to fair and open financial \nreporting, because they know that it leads the way to access to \ncapital. Today, small public companies are vital participants in U.S. \ncapital markets and play a critical role in future economic growth and \nhigh-wage job creation. Once provided with the necessary regulatory \nflexibility, I have no doubt that our small public companies will be \nable to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley law, just as big businesses are \ndoing today. All small public companies know it is in their best \ninterest to have regulations in place that provide transparency and \naccountability. These are the qualities that encourage investor \nconfidence in U.S. markets. It gives them access to more investors and \nincreases the pool of available capital while keeping their competitors \nfrom manipulating the marketplace through faulty accounting.\n  As we move forward, there are additional steps that can be taken to \nassist small business. First, I recently wrote to the SEC and PCAOB \nwith Senator Snowe, urging the regulators to give small businesses up \nto an additional year to comply with the pending changes to the \nSarbanes-Oxley regulations. I believe this added time will help small \nbusinesses adapt to the changing regulatory structure and make it \neasier for those who lack the expertise or financial resources to \ncomply with the law. The SEC has previously supported providing small \npublic companies with additional time to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and \nI hope they will do so again.\n  The DeMint amendment is an overreaching, premature policy reversal \nthat preempts years of thoughtful regulatory consideration on the part \nof the SEC and the PCAOB. It represents a blanket exemption that has \nthe potential to take U.S. capital markets a large step backwards to \nthe days of Enron. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and \nallow the regulators to finish their jobs.\n  As chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nwill continue to closely follow the impact of Sarbanes-Oxley on small \nfirms and look forward to working with Senator Snowe and my colleagues \non the committee to determine what necessary steps Congress can take to \nhelp small public companies abide by the law while simultaneously \nallowing them to focus on what they do best--creating jobs and growing \nour economy by participating in our capital markets. This will help \nsmall businesses achieve the American dream of becoming innovative \npublic companies.\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\n  We can help our small public companies and encourage additional small \nbusinesses to become public companies--while ensuring transparency and \nhonest accounting. This will help ensure that the United States \ncontinues to have the fairest, most transparent and most efficient \nfinancial markets in the world.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am obviously disappointed the chairman \nwill move to table. We have had a good debate on it. The debate on \nSarbanes-Oxley has been going on for almost 5 years, since it was \npassed. Every time someone expresses a problem, they go right to \nsection 404, and just to small businesses that are being hurt most by \nthis.\n  I talked with the SEC well over a year ago. I heard exactly the same \nthing I am hearing today: We are on it. It is going to happen very \nsoon.\n  Let me suggest this to my colleagues. Let us pass this bill today and \nsend it to conference. That will be a few weeks of work. If the SEC \nresponds, then take it out in conference. The Democrats are in control \nof the conference. There is no harm done. But let us not continue to \nallow investment capital to be shipped out of this country without \ndoing anything about it.\n  The only reason the SEC is even talking about it now is that we \nintroduced this bill with Democrats and Republicans in the House. It is \ntime to act now. Please vote for this bill. Let us move it to \nconference and shake up the SEC.\n  Mr. DODD.

Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 917, offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, regarding the amendment we are about to \nvote on, we voted on essentially the same amendment last Wednesday as \nan amendment to the Court Security Improvement Act. The amendment \nprovides that any new program or initiative that is contained in \nlegislation be offset. The point that defeated the amendment last week \nis still valid; that is, we should not be required to offset \nauthorizing legislation. This is authorizing legislation. There is no \nspending in this bill. This does not appropriate funds.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, I will be moving to table the amendment after he completes \nhis statement.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, might I say to the Senator from \nOklahoma, I have watched you in your concern for spending, and I \nappreciate what you are trying to do to cut spending in the Senate.\n  But let me say to the Senate, this afternoon I asked the Chair for a \npoint of order. I asked whether this bill would violate the Budget Act. \nAfter looking at the bill and coming back, I was advised it does not \nviolate the Budget Act. The reason it does not is because there is no \nspending in it. If it were spending money, it would be violating the \nbudget because it is not in the budget, and we passed a budget.\n  Having said that, if we are not spending money, then why should we \nchastise ourselves about spending money and suggesting that we have to \noffset something when, as a matter of fact, there is nothing to offset \nbecause there is no spending? If we get into this game that authorizing \nis spending, then we will have a fourth tier of Government. Instead of \na budget appropriations and direct spending, we will have people \nbringing up a new way to attack it on every kind of authorizing bill. I \ndon't think we need that. We need to get on with business every now and \nthen. This is one time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the reason you ought to vote for this \nsense of the Senate--it doesn't say anything about authorizing. What it \nsays is, and the American people expect, if we are going to create new \nprograms, we ought to get rid of the programs that are not working. We \nspend $84,000 a second. We spent $350 billion we didn't have last year, \nand we charged it to the next generation. We have 10 percent of the \nDepartment of Energy that is ineffective, we have 10 percent of the \nDepartment of Education that is ineffective, and you offset none of the \nprograms as you reauthorize this bill. We doubled up. This says, sense \nof the Senate, if we are going to spend more money and create new \nprograms, we ought to go after the ones that do not work.\n  Vote against it at your own peril.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is the last vote this evening. I am \nglad to see the managers are moving this bill along. We are probably \ngoing to have a vote in the morning, around 11 o'clock. That will be \nthe first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Coburn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico, who \nis doing such a wonderful job on the legislation that is in front of \nus. I wish to compliment everyone who is involved with this legislation \nfor working so hard, including Senator Alexander and Senator Bingaman. \nThis is a wonderful bill. So we congratulate them for that.\n\n\n                           Iraq Supplemental\n\n  I wish to speak this evening about the supplemental appropriations \nbill the Senate will vote on later this week. I also wish to rise with \ngreat concern and, frankly--I am not sure what the word is; \n``disappointment'' is not strong enough for how I feel about what the \nVice President has said today about our leader, our great leader in the \nSenate, who has spoken so passionately and cares so deeply about the \ntroops who are serving us overseas, their families who are here at \nhome, who wants to make sure the strategy is right for them.\n  We all know--and our military experts have told us time and again--\nthat a military victory is not going to happen, that it has to be a \npolitical victory, a political strategy of the Iraqis stepping up and \ntaking control and making the tough decisions they need to make to take \ncontrol of their own security. We have heard that from many experts \nwithin the military and without. Yet today the Vice President was here, \nnot far from this Chamber, unleashing his wrath, as only he seems to be \nable to, about our leader, calling him names and mischaracterizing his \npositions. That is extremely unfortunate because while the men and \nwomen are serving us right now in Iraq, over there doing their best to \nfocus on the mission, they expect us to be at home focusing on the \nstrategy, the resources, and the equipment they need.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to a young man not long ago who had come \nhome from Iraq. I asked him how he felt about the debate going on about \nthe strategy, the debate we were having in the Senate and the House. He \nsaid, frankly, he would expect us to be doing that because that is our \njob. That is our job. They are doing their job. As my husband, who was \nin the Air Force and Air National Guard, reminds me continually, their \njob is to implement the mission. They are doing it. Our job is to get \nit right, to have the right strategy, and to back them up and give them \nthe resources they need.\n  The name calling coming from the Vice President is not going to get \nthe job done. What is going to get the job done is our ability to work \ntogether and look at the facts, not some stubborn sense of \nunwillingness to change or to do more of the same which, unfortunately, \nis what is happening now with this surge. It is more of the same. \nInstead of doing that, we need to be joining together to say: Let's \nlook at the reality of what is going on on the ground. More and more \nAmericans and Iraqis are being killed every day. Let's look at the \nreality of what we need to do to be successful, to bring our troops \nhome safely, to address the success we all would like to see happen in \nterms of a democracy that works, the Iraqi Government being able to \nstep up and to govern their country, which is an incredibly difficult \nand complicated thing to do, obviously.\n  I find it very disappointing. I work with our leader, as we all do \nevery day. There is no one who has spent more time thinking and \nfocusing and discussing and listening on these issues around the war \nthan he has--no one who is more thoughtful or more caring, no one who \nis more concerned about our veterans coming home.\n  We welcome, certainly, the Vice President coming and meeting with us \nand joining in the discussion. But I certainly hope we are not going to \nsee more of what we saw today. It was an effort to attack a great \nleader and, essentially, instead of moving the ball forward, make it \nmore difficult for us to do what we need to do to come together.\n  On this particular bill, the supplemental appropriations bill, I \ncertainly hope the President will sign this legislation, will \nreconsider the position that has been taken and sign this legislation. \nWe are going to be sending a bill to the President that will fund the \ntroops--in fact, it adds dollars to do that--as well as veterans, as \nwell as addressing a number of other critical issues. The question \nbefore the President will be, Will he sign this bill? We are not trying \nto play games. We are sending him an emergency supplemental for the war \nand for other critical American needs--our communities, our families' \nneeds, just as we do every year in an appropriations bill, in a \nsupplemental. The question is whether the President will step up and do \nhis duty and sign this bill so that those dollars can get to the \ntroops.\n  This legislation represents the best opportunity for us to change the \ncourse in Iraq as well as protect our troops and our veterans and to \ngive them what they need now. Unfortunately, the President has put our \ntroops in the middle of an endless Iraqi civil war. We know this to be \ntrue. People in my great State know this is true.\n  Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a situation where our troops are \nin an endless civil war. The American people are paying a huge price \nfor this war, most importantly, in lives, not only family members lost \nbut people coming home with permanent disabilities, with head injuries, \nwith mental health problems. There is a huge price being paid by \nAmericans for what is occurring and has been occurring.\n  We are also paying a huge price in dollars, $10 billion a month, and \nthen we look at the fact that we could fund a program to cover every \nchild with health care in America for $10 billion a year. We know while \nlives are the most important issue, resources for Americans to address \nour needs at home is also a critical issue.\n  We also know we are paying a huge price as it relates to our own \nsecurity interests. The majority of Americans, a bipartisan majority in \nCongress, military experts, and the Iraq Study Group believe this war \ncannot be won militarily and that the current path is not sustainable. \nThe supplemental appropriations bill recognizes it is long past time to \nchange course. The American people know that. That is really what last \nNovember was about. People want a change. They know this isn't working. \nIt is not sustainable. They expect us to step up together and make that \nchange.\n  This bill fully funds our troops. We are passing a bill agreed to by \nthe House and Senate that fully funds our troops and provides a plan to \nresponsibly end the war and bring them home safely. I don't know what \nmore we could ask of the proposal. We are providing the resources and \nalso putting in place a responsible way to provide benchmarks and \nmeasurements and bring a responsible end to the war.\n  Our bill holds the Iraqis accountable for securing their own Nation \nand forging political reconciliation. We know more of the same--more \nsurges, more efforts that have been tried and tried time after time--is \nnot working. I don't believe they can work. But what can work is \nholding the Iraqis accountable for securing their own nation and making \nthe tough decisions that one has to make when they want to have a \ndemocracy. It is not easy. We know that. They are in a very difficult \nsituation. But it is their country, and they\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nneed to step up and make those decisions and bring all parties together \nand find some way to live together.\n  Our bill ensures our troops are combat ready before being deployed to \nIraq. I can't imagine that there is one individual in the armed \nservices or one mom or dad or brother or sister or son or daughter of a \ncombat troop that would not want us, and doesn't expect us already, to \nbe making sure that our troops are combat ready before being deployed.\n  It provides them with all the resources needed on the battlefield and \nwhen they return. We are very committed and, in fact, I am very proud \nof the fact that in our budget resolution passed a few weeks ago, for \nthe first time we meet the dollars needed for veterans health care and \nother critical veterans services identified by the veterans \norganizations themselves. For the first time ever, we put forth the \ndollars that are needed when our troops are coming home. A Presidential \nveto will deny our troops the resources and the strategy they need and \nsend exactly the wrong message to the Iraqi political leaders. We hope \nthe President will join us in giving our troops the resources and \nstrategy they need and deserve. That is what this bill is about.\n\n  After more than 4 years of a failed policy, it is time for this \nNation to change course and Iraq to take responsibility for its own \nfuture.\n  This is a good bill we will have before us. Overall, it provides more \nthan $100 billion for the Department of Defense, primarily for \ncontinued military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It includes a $1 \nbillion increase for the National Guard and Reserves for equipment \ndesperately needed and $1.1 billion for military housing. It provides \n$3 billion for the purchase of mine-resistant, ambush-protected \nvehicles, vehicles designed to withstand roadside bombs. Every day we \npick up the paper and see where more lives have been lost, injuries \nhave been sustained as a result of roadside bombs. It contains more \nthan $5 billion to ensure that returning troops and veterans receive \nthe health care they have earned with their service so that we don't \never have to have another Walter Reed incident.\n  It has $6.9 billion for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as \nwell. We know when we are doing an emergency supplemental, just as in \nevery other year when our colleagues were in the majority, as well as \nwhen we are in the majority, there are a number of emergency needs for \nthe country.\n  One thing in the supplemental has been funding the troops. We have \nadded funding for our veterans and also understand there are some \ncritical needs at home, critical needs that Americans have. Certainly, \nwe all know the resources and the focus on those families who were hit \nby the hurricanes have been shamefully slow in going to that region to \nrebuild American communities, American homes, to support American \nfamilies. Our bill does that.\n  It provides emergency funding also for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program because we have a number of places in the country \nwhere the resources are running out, and we want to make sure children \ncan continue to get health care. That is an emergency at home.\n  Ask any family who is worried about whether their children are going \nto get sick tonight, say a little prayer: Please God, don't let the \nkids get sick because what are we going to do. Our bill addresses \nchildren's health care emergency funding.\n  It also includes homeland security investments totaling $2.25 billion \nfor port security and mass transit security, for explosives detection \nequipment at airports, and for several initiatives in the 9/11 bill \nthat recently passed the Senate. I am very proud of the fact that our \nnew majority placed a priority on passing the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. It was long overdue, but it was a priority for us in \nthe first few weeks of our new majority, and we did it. Now we have the \nresources that go with that. It is not enough to pass the \nrecommendations. We have to make sure the resources are there to keep \nus safe at home.\n  So, yes, this is a supplemental bill to support our troops abroad, to \nsupport their efforts while they are in theater in combat, but we also \nknow we have folks on the front lines at home, our police officers and \nfirefighters and others, and security needs here. We address that.\n  We also know there have been a group of folks waiting for way too \nlong for some disaster assistance related to agriculture, including my \nhome State of Michigan where apple and cherry growers have been \nwaiting. In this legislation, $3.5 billion is provided to help relieve \nthe enormous pressure on farmers and ranchers as a result of severe \ndrought and agricultural disasters. Again, this is about helping people \nat home, putting Americans first when we know there is a disaster. \nWhether it is Hurricane Katrina or whether it is cherry growers in \nnorthern Michigan, our job is to also focus on our people here and \ntheir emergency needs.\n  The conference agreement also includes emergency funding for forest \nfirefighting, low-income home energy assistance, and pandemic flu \npreparations, which we should all be concerned about--again, critical \nneeds for Americans, American families.\n  Finally, there are other items in this bill that are good for workers \nand small business. The bill has an increase in the minimum wage to \n$7.25 an hour, giving hard-working Americans a much deserved raise \nafter 10 years--10 years. It provides almost $5 billion in tax cuts for \nsmall businesses as well. We know the majority of jobs come from small \nbusiness. This supports their efforts as well.\n  So I would say to President Bush: Sign this bill. Sign this bill. \nThis is a bill which funds our troops, which keeps our commitments to \nour veterans, and which addresses other American priorities for our \ncommunities and our families.\n  Mr. President, if you do, we will change course in Iraq, give our \ntroops the equipment they need, the health care they deserve, and \nprovide much needed investments here at home in America.\n  President Bush, if you veto this bill, you are denying funds to the \ntroops in the field and going against the wishes of the majority of the \nAmerican people.\n  It is time for the administration to stop saying no to troops and no \nto the American people. We need the President to say yes to working \nwith us, to support our troops and what they need, which this \nlegislation does, to support the American people, American families, \nand critical emergency needs here at home, and to put in place a \nstrategy for success--a real strategy for success--by focusing on \nefforts that empower and send a message to the Iraqi Government to step \nup. While we are willing to support them, we will not continue to send \nour brave men and women into the middle of a civil war day after day \nafter day and continually say it is OK, everything is going great. It \nis not going great.\n  It is time for a new strategy. We have put forward a strategy in a \nvery responsible way in this legislation, along with meeting our \nobligations and responsibilities to our troops, our veterans, their \nfamilies, and to America as a whole.\n  I hope when President Bush reads this bill--and I hope he will--I \nhope he will look at what is in here with an open mind, and agree with \nus that this is a bill which makes sense for America at home and \nabroad.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (2) such sums as may be necessary for subsequent fiscal \n     years.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also wish to propound a unanimous \nconsent request. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 761 on Wednesday, there be 30 minutes of debate \nwith respect to the Sununu amendment No. 938, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Sununu and Kennedy or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee wants to make a comment. If the Senator from Ohio would \npermit me, I have a very short statement to make concerning an \namendment. It will not take more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and \nthe Senator from Ohio for their courtesy.\n  I simply want to acknowledge the comments of Senator Bingaman from \nNew Mexico and say I think our day has been productive and to say our \ncolleagues have been very helpful in bringing their amendments to the \nfloor.\n  I ask the Senator what he envisions for tomorrow beyond what he \nalready announced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his question \nand his great work on this legislation.\n  The plan for tomorrow, as I understand it, is we will go ahead with \nthis Sununu amendment at around 10:45 and hopefully vote shortly after \n11 o'clock on that amendment. We have talked to Senator Coburn from \nOklahoma about considering three amendments he still has that he is \ncommitted to offering at some time in the 2 o'clock period.\n  We urge other Senators who have amendments they wish to have votes on \nto bring those to the floor for consideration after disposing of \nSenator Sununu's amendment shortly after 11 o'clock. Now, obviously, \nthe Senator's amendment is still pending, as we have indicated, and we \nstill have to get agreement as to how to proceed on that. We are \nworking on that at the present time.\n  But I agree, we have made good progress today. I hope we can complete \nthe remaining amendments tomorrow and proceed to final action on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. \nThe majority leader and the Republican leader would both like us to \nfinish tomorrow, if we can. I think we have a good chance of doing \nthat. Senator Inhofe is staying tonight to talk about an amendment he \nhopes to bring up tomorrow. I talked with Senator Grassley. The number \nof amendments that seem to need to be offered seems to be narrowing \ndown. I would say to my colleagues, with the briefing that is scheduled \nfor tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, we are going to do our best to get \nas many of those as possible in before 4 o'clock so we can finish the \nbill tomorrow, if possible.\n  I am going to defer any other remarks I have until after the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from New York \nhave had a chance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what the Senator from New Mexico is \nsuggesting is exactly what I have in mind. I have an amendment I will \nbe calling up at an appropriate time that is mutually agreeable. It \ndoes affect the taxation end. I have talked to Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley. I believe they are going to be favorable toward it.\n  There are not many one-sentence amendments. That is what this one is. \nLet me read it to you and tell you why I am offering it. Then I will \nwait until tomorrow and hopefully get in the mix.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the law; no federal \n     funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that \n     advocates against tax competition or United States tax \n     competitiveness.\n\n  Let me just give you an example. After World War II, there was an \neffort to implement the Marshall Plan. When that was done, in 1961, an \norganization was formed that was called the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development. This is an international organization \nwhich advocates tax increases for the United States specifically to \nmake us less competitive. They have stated explicitly that low-tax \npolicies ``unfairly erode the tax bases of other countries and distort \nthe location of capital and services.''\n  What we have here is a Paris-based bunch of bureaucrats seeking to \nprotect high-tax welfare states from the free market. That is why the \nOECD goes on to say that free market tax competition ``may hamper the \napplication of progressive tax rates and the achievement of \nredistributive goals.'' Clearly, free market tax competition makes it \nharder to implement socialistic welfare states. The free market, \nevidently, has not been fair to socialistic welfare states. Well, it is \na good thing they have the OECD and nearly $100 million in U.S. \ntaxpayer money to aid them.\n  Noted economist Walter Williams clearly sees the direction in which \nthis is headed when he says that ``the bottom line agenda for the OECD \nis to establish a tax cartel where nations get together and collude on \ntaxes.''\n  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill seconded that when he said that he \nwas ``troubled by the underlying premise that low tax rates are somehow \nsuspect and by the notion that any country . . . should interfere in \nany other country's'' tax policy.\n  So the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has \nissued a report entitled ``Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global \nIssue,'' which establishes a new international body, the Forum on \nHarmful Tax Practices, to implement the measures outlined in the \nreport. The OECD has endorsed and encouraged higher taxes, new taxes, \nand global taxes no fewer than 24 times. They have advocated a value-\nadded tax, a 40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a \nfertilizer tax, ending the deductibility of State and local taxes from \nFederal taxes, and new taxes at the State level.\n  So I believe this is something we will have a chance to debate, and I \nwould think it actually would be accepted. Again, all it is going to be \nis just one sentence. It reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the law; no federal \n     funds shall be provided to any organization or entity that \n     advocates against tax competition or United States tax \n     competitiveness.\n\n  I cannot think of any more appropriate bill to have this on than this \nbill we have before us currently.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from \nOhio, who has stepped aside for me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I also thank the Senator from Ohio for \nletting me make some brief remarks, and then I will yield the floor to \nhim.\n  First, I wish to praise my colleagues from New Mexico and Tennessee, \nwho have done an excellent job on this legislation. I applaud the \nbipartisan group that put together this extraordinary bill we are \nconsidering, the America COMPETES Act, because this legislation will \nprovide invaluable resources to help slingshot our economy forward and \nensure that our great country does not lose step with our global \ncompetitors.\n  I am particularly proud of one provision I authored and has been \nincluded in the managers' amendment that was adopted earlier today. \nThat is what I want to speak about.\n  The program is called the National Science Foundation Teaching \nFellowship, and it will go a long way toward ensuring that our high \nschool students are taught math and science by the best and the \nbrightest.\n  I wish to express my deep gratitude to Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, \nEnzi, and Alexander for including this important provision in the bill. \nI would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Clinton, \nfor her valuable support as a committee member in this process.\n  The NSF Teaching Fellowship is modeled after a highly successful \nprogram in New York City called Math for America. The program recruits \ntop math and science graduates to become teachers and retains them as \nteachers by offering financial incentives. The program will ensure that \nleaders in math and science train future generations of innovators--\ninstead of leaving the classroom for research or other opportunities.\n  It is working in New York City, and it is crucial to expand this \nmodel to the rest of the country. Let me share with you some statistics \nthat will explain why.\n  Our students are not currently prepared to compete in a technological \neconomy. In the 2003 PISA math assessment that compared 15-year-old \nstudents across the world, American students ranked 24th out of the 29 \nparticipating countries--here in America, in math, 24th out of 29. How \nare we going to stay the greatest country in the world when that has \nhappened?\n  Students currently studying math and science will be the fuel that \npowers our economy for the next century, and there is no question we \nare not giving them the tools they need to compete.\n  One reason why our students are not doing well is because only one-\nthird of math teachers and less than two-thirds of science teachers \nmajored or minored in the subject they teach. It is not hard to \nunderstand why. Starting salaries for math and science majors can be as \nmuch as $20,000 higher in the private sector than they are for public \nschool teachers. But by allowing this disincentive to teach to \ncontinue, we are ignoring our responsibility to have our students \ntaught by teachers who know math and science backward and forward. The \nbottom line is the American economic engine may stall if we don't have \na highly skilled workforce to keep it going. Unfortunately, this is \nwhere we are faltering.\n\n  So today the Senate has adopted the NSF Teaching Fellowship program, \nalong with other excellent provisions in the America COMPETES Act, to \nfill in the gap. Here is how the program will work. NSF teaching \nfellows will have to take a test to prove their strengths in math or \nscience. Then they enroll in a 1-year master's degree program in \nteaching that will give them teaching certification, and it is all paid \nfor. They will agree to teach for at least 4 years, and for those 4 \nyears, they will receive bonuses on top of their salaries. These \nindividuals will infuse our schools with a deep passion for and an \nunderstanding of math and science and will share their knowledge with \nother teachers in their school.\n  To retain our current teachers who are outstanding at what they do \nand can provide expertise in the classroom that our teaching fellows \nwon't yet have, there is another category called NSF Master Teaching \nFellows. Master fellows are existing teachers who already have a \nmaster's degree in math or science education. They will also take a \ntest demonstrating they have a high level understanding of their \nsubject area. For the next 5 years they will serve as leaders in their \nschool, providing mentorship for other teachers in their department as \nwell as assisting with curriculum development and professional \ndevelopment. For these 5 years they also will receive bonuses on top of \ntheir salaries.\n  Last year I introduced the Math and Science Teaching Corps Act with \nmy friend Congressman Jim Saxton in the House. Today that bill has \nevolved into a program that has been included in the America COMPETES \nAct.\n  The question is: Will this generation have the skill sets necessary \nto take full advantage of this new economy? Right now our children are \nlagging behind and we must act quickly before businesses need to look \nelsewhere. Math and science skills are the key to\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nmaintaining this country's competitiveness in the global economy, and \nthis legislation will help ensure that.\n  I believe the NSF Teaching Fellowship, as well as the rest of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act, will put us back on track. I am proud to have \nbeen included in the process and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to complete work on this important bill.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, I want also to take 1 more minute to address the \ncomments this afternoon of my friend and colleague Senator Gregg. He \nand I often agree, and I believe we do on this particular issue as \nwell, about the need to shore up Medicare. I think he misunderstood my \ncomments from yesterday and I want to take a moment to discuss them.\n  Yesterday the Social Security and Medicare trustees released their \nannual report showing that Social Security does not face an impending \nfunding crisis, but Medicare funds are less secure. The report \nindicates that the Social Security trust fund would be solvent 1 year \nlonger than was predicted in last year's report, that is until 2041, \nbut Medicare would be exhausted as soon as 2019 in terms of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  The Senator should know I did not and would not attack the \nindependent trustees of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. \nMy statement responded to two things: first, the administration's \nmisguided mission to use any and all news with regard to Social \nSecurity as an opportunity to push for privatizing Social Security; \nsecond, the administration's unwillingness to do something to fix \nunderlying problems in our health care system and reduce budget \ndeficits to shore up Medicare before it is too late.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire pointed out that most of us on this \nside of the aisle voted against some of his amendments. That doesn't \nmean we don't want to fix Medicare; it means we don't agree with the \nway he is proposing. In fact, we have to get a handle on the whole \nhealth care system to fix Medicare, not chop away and slash away at \nMedicare itself. So I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire, we \ncan't leave these problems to future generations. I look forward to \nworking with him on that important issue.\n  I once again thank my good colleague from Ohio for his generosity of \nboth time and spirit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Ohio goes \nforward, I simply say to the Senator from New York I applaud his work \non the math program. I remember last year when we talked about it, and \nI met with his constituents who have done so much good work with that \nmodel.\n  Among the other things which are important about the program is that \nit defines a fair way of identifying a high-need set of teachers--in \nthis case math and science--and when they go into teaching, to pay them \nmore for being good teachers. That is a tough thing to do. It is tough \nto do that in a fair way, but the Senator has found one way to do it. \nWe have a variety of other ways to do it. Senator Durbin and I have \nsupported an amendment, the teacher incentive fund, which encourages \nthat sort of experimentation, a not-made-in-Washington formula.\n  But if we are to have areas of high need such as math and science and \nlow-income children who can't achieve, we are going to have to find \nsome fair ways for outstanding school teaching and leadership. The \nSenator from New York has taken an important step in that direction as \npart of what he has done today, and I congratulate him for that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, during rollcall vote No. 137 today, I was \nat a speaking engagement in another part of the city and was unable to \nreturn in time for the vote. Had I been able to vote, I would have \nvoted for the amendment offered by Senator DeMint.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Majority \nLeader Reid's legislation S. 761, the America Creating Opportunities to \nMeaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education and Science--\nCOMPETES--Act of 2007 to help maintain our Nation's competitive edge in \nthe critical areas of math, science, engineering and technology.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important bill with 57 of my \ncolleagues.\n  This bill will strengthen educational opportunities in math, science, \nengineering, and technology from elementary through graduate school, \nincrease the Federal investment in basic research, and develop an \ninnovation infrastructure--all which is greatly needed in an \nincreasingly competitive global economy.\n  This bipartisan bill reflects recommendations by the National \nAcademies' report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' and the Council \non Competitiveness' ``Innovate America'' report.\n  Both of these reports conclude that action is needed now in order to \nsecure our country's economic and technological leadership in the \nfuture.\n  For example, indicators of the need for action are the following: \nMore than 600,000 engineers graduated from institutions of higher \neducation in China in 2004. In India, the figure was 350,000. In the \nU.S., it was only about 70,000. Science and engineering jobs are \nexpected to grow by 21 percent from 2004 to 2014, compared to a growth \nof 13 percent in all other fields, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics \nreports.\n  Nationwide, about 68 percent of middle school math students were \ntaught by teachers who did not have a major or certification in the \nsubject. For science middle school students, 57 percent were taught by \nteachers who did not have a major or certification in the subject--\nbased on the 2004 report by the National Center for Education \nStatistics.\n  In California, the State also faces a critical shortage of math and \nscience teachers. The State will need to produce more than 16,000 new \nmath and science teachers within 5 years and more than 33,000 over the \nnext decade due to attrition and retirement. This is from the March \n2007 report by the California Council on Science and Technology.\n  This report also concludes that strengthening the teaching of math \nand science is crucial if California is to maintain its competitive \nedge and economic growth.\n  That is why it is imperative that we take steps to ensure that our \nchildren, as our future leaders, are fully prepared with the skills to \ntake on the demands of the country's changing economy and workplace.\n  Specifically, this bill would increase authorized funding for the \nNational Science Foundation from $6.8 billion in fiscal year 2008 to \n$11.2 billion in fiscal year 2011. California receives about 20 percent \nof total funding from NSF grants; increase authorized funding for the \nU.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science from $4.6 billion in \nfiscal year 2008 to over $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011. California \nreceives over 20 percent of total Federal funding; direct NASA to \ntransfer $160 million from its accounts for the funding of basic \nscience and research for fiscal year 2008 and fully participate in \ninteragency activities to foster innovation; authorize $290 million \nover 4 years to establish a Distinguished Scientists Program under the \nU.S. Department of Energy which would be a joint program between \nuniversities and National Laboratories to support up to 100 \ndistinguished scientist positions; authorize $210 million for fiscal \nyear 2008, and such sums as necessary for each of the following three \nyears, for new grants under the U.S. Department of Education to develop \nuniversity degree programs for students to pursue bachelor's degrees in \nmath, science, engineering, and critical foreign languages with \nconcurrent teaching credentials.\n  Also, grants would be used for master's degree programs in these \nfields for current teachers to improve their skills.\n  This model is similar to the University of California's California \nTeach Program which aims to put a thousand new math and science \nteachers annually into the State's classrooms.\n  It will authorize $190 million over 4 years to create a new grant \nprogram to improve the skills of K-12 math and science teachers, under \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, for summer institutes at each of the \nNational Laboratories; authorizes $146.7 million for fiscal year 2008 \nand such sums as necessary for the following 3 years to provide ``Math \nNow'' grants, under the\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nU.S. Department of Education, to improve math instruction for \nstruggling elementary and middle school students; authorize $140 \nmillion over 4 years for a new competitive grant program under the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to assist States in establishing or expanding \nstatewide math and science specialty schools and provide expert \nassistance in teaching from the National Laboratories' at these \nschools; establishes a President's Council on Innovation and \nCompetitiveness and requires the National Academy of Sciences to \nconduct a study to identify barriers to innovation 1 year after \nenactment.\n  America's economy is fueled by innovation, and innovation is enabled \nby a strong foundation in math and science. Our country's math and \nscience foundation is eroding, and our innovative strength is similarly \nweakening.\n  The U.S. trade balance in high-technology products has shifted from a \n$54 billion surplus in 1990 to a $50 billion deficit in 2001.\n  This legislation can help reverse this trend. It will help maintain \nour Nation's global competitiveness and continue to attract the best \nand brightest minds across the country to pursue careers as engineers, \nscientists, technicians, and very importantly, as math and science \nteachers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 761, \nthe America COMPETES Act of 2007. If we consider the people who have \ngiven us the light bulb, the blood bank, the artificial heart, the \nmicrochip processor, and Microsoft, we must acknowledge that access to \nquality education and openness to innovation in America have nurtured \nmany of the most influential inventors and the best trained workforce \nin modern history.\n  But while technological progress has revolutionized the workplace, \nour education system has failed to keep pace; now, many of our Nation's \nschools are unable to provide their students with the scientific, \ntechnological, engineering, and mathematical knowledge and skills the \n21st century economy demands. Without sufficient numbers of well-\ntrained people and the scientific and technical innovations they \nproduce, the United States is in jeopardy of losing its place as the \ncenter for the high-quality jobs and innovative enterprise that have \nbeen part of our national heritage.\n  I applaud Senators Bingaman and Alexander and the other leading \nsponsors of the bill for taking action to ensure that this Nation \nremains a leader for innovation, and I am proud to join them as a \ncosponsor of this bill. I am grateful to the academic and business \nleaders, including Nancy Grasmick, the Maryland State superintendent of \nschools, and Dr. C.D. Mote, Jr., president of the University of \nMaryland, who produced both the National Academies' ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm'' and the Council on Competitiveness' ``Innovative \nAmerica'' reports and recommendations that serve as the foundation for \nthis legislation. I am proud of the legislation the Senate is \nconsidering: it takes significant steps to stimulate and support \ninnovation in our Nation.\n  When I ask young scientists and engineers what triggered their \ninterest, they cite--almost without exception--a teacher, mentor, or \ninternship as the inspiration for their love of science, math, and \ninnovation. I am pleased, therefore, that this bill includes several \nmeasures to improve teacher recruitment and training, develop \npartnerships between schools and laboratories, and encourage internship \nprograms. All of these provisions will increase students' exposure to \ninspirational teaching, talented scientists, and real-world experience.\n  Education research and the anecdotal evidence I mentioned above \nindicate that teacher quality is the most important factor influencing \nstudent achievement. Yet our best teachers are not evenly distributed \namong our Nations communities. Far too many of our highest need school \ndistricts are struggling to recruit and retain experienced teachers. To \naddress this inequity, S. 761 includes important measures to recruit \nand train high-quality math and science teachers for high-need school \ndistricts. The legislation also creates mentorship and apprenticeship \nprograms for women, who are underrepresented in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics careers.\n  The growing gap between what is taught in elementary and secondary \nschools and the skills necessary to succeed in college, graduate \nschool, and today's workforce threatens the implicit promise we have \neach made to our own children and those whom we represent: get good \ngrades in school and you will succeed in life. S. 761 contains \ncompetitive grants to States that will encourage better alignment of \nelementary and secondary curricula with the knowledge and skills \nrequired by colleges and universities, 21st century employers, and the \nArmed Forces, so that high school graduates will be prepared to succeed \nin the world.\n  Those students who choose to pursue high-tech careers require Federal \nfunding to conduct research. Many scientists and mathematicians make \ntheir greatest discoveries early in their careers, before they have \ndeveloped the track records and reputations often required to secure \nresearch grants. The leaders of Johns Hopkins and other great Maryland \nresearch institutions have told me that it is difficult for their young \nand most daring researchers to secure necessary research funding.\n  S. 761 would significantly increase America's investment in research, \ndoubling funding for the National Science Foundation and the Department \nof Energy's Office of Science over the next 4 years and authorizing a \nsignificant increase in funding for the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology. But the legislation goes further by also targeting more \nfunds to young researchers and high-risk frontier research. S. 761 \nwould increase the number of research fellowships and traineeships that \nprovide critical support for science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics graduate students and would require NIST to set aside at \nleast 8 percent of its annual funding for high-risk, high-reward \ninnovation acceleration research.\n  Today, we face enormous technological challenges, which include \nhalting global climate change, achieving energy independence, and \nfinding cures for AIDS, malaria, diabetes, and other devastating \ndiseases. We must equip ourselves with skills and resources to tackle \nthese problems so that our children and grandchildren may inherit a \nworld rich with economic opportunities. Therefore, I am urging my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this critical legislation.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President. I rise today in support of S. 761, the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. This sweeping legislation takes bold steps to \nrecapture America's prowess in the global economy.\n  The demand for talented persons in the areas of science, technology, \nengineering, mathematics, and critical foreign language far exceeds the \nsupply in the United States. The likelihood of finding a job in these \nhigh-need areas after college is almost guaranteed, yet we find \nourselves still lagging behind other countries in producing these \ngraduates. America ranks No. 24 out of industrialized nations in \nmathematical literacy for children entering high school. Right now, \nChina is graduating four times the number of engineers as the United \nStates, with India not far behind.\n  I am deeply concerned with these trends. It is vital to have a \nsuperior science and mathematics education system and workforce. In \n1997, I formed an Advisory Committee on Science, Technology, and the \nFuture in my home State of Kansas. This committee helps me find ways to \nalign Federal and State initiatives to enhance science and technology \nin the State. The advisory committee has been instrumental in \nidentifying high-need high-tech jobs in the State while focusing on \nways to educate, train, and attract talented persons into these fields.\n  Kansas continues to be a State rich with high-tech industry. Wichita \nis the aviation capital of the United States, producing approximately \n50 percent of all U.S. general aviation. This industry needs aviation \nresearchers, engineers, and skilled technicians. My home State is \nrapidly growing in the areas of bioscience, including drug discovery, \nnew treatments for disease, food safety, animal health, and renewable \nenergy. The Roberts Advisory Committee has recognized that while these \nindustries are growing, they have a limited\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\npool of talented employees to choose from.\n  Like many States, Kansas is facing a shortage of math and science \nteacher applicants. I agree with my advisory committee that global \ncompetitiveness lies with our younger generation. It is imperative that \nwe provide them with an education from science and math teachers \npossessing a solid knowledge base and effective teaching skills. We \nalso need to find ways to spark students' interests in math, science, \nand technology while they are in the early years of education. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act addresses these needs by strengthening the skills \nof math and science teachers, creating partnerships between National \nLaboratories and high-need high schools, facilitating the expansion of \nadvanced placement programs, and increasing the number of students who \nstudy foreign languages.\n  Additionally, the bill provides an increase in research investment by \ndoubling the funding for the National Science Foundation, NSF. The \ngrants distributed to States from the NSF are being used to conduct \nextraordinary research in every corner of the world.\n  My advisory committee supports the America COMPETES Act, and so do I. \nIt is only through our commitment to the underlying goals of this bill \nthat we will see success in building our competitive workforce.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues \nSenator Jeff Bingaman, Senator Pete Domenici, Senator Lamar Alexander, \nand Majority Leader Harry Reid for their efforts to move this issue. I \nam so proud of this great bipartisan team of 54 Senators working to \npass this bill. I can't say enough about the appreciation that many of \nus in the Senate feel about my colleagues' initiation of the report, \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which is the basis for this \nlegislation, the America COMPETES Act.\n  America must remain an innovation economy. This legislation creates \nthe building blocks that we need for a smarter America. Our Nation is \nin an amazing race--the race for discovery and new knowledge, the race \nto remain competitive and to foster an innovation society, to create \nnew ideas that lead to new breakthroughs, new products, and new jobs, \nthe innovations that have the power to save lives, create prosperity \nand protect the homeland, the innovation to make America safer, \nstronger, and smarter.\n  This legislation is called the America COMPETES Act or America \nCreating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in \nTechnology, Education and Science. It is divided into three sections: \nresearch, education and innovation. It calls for getting new ideas by \ndoubling Federal funding for research at the National Science \nFoundation and establishing the Innovation Acceleration Research \nProgram to fund frontier research like testing new theories and using \nnew research methods; getting the best minds with scholarships for \nfuture math and science teachers, including $10,000 scholarships from \nthe National Science Foundation for undergraduate students majoring in \nmath or science along with teacher certification; and establishing a \nPresident's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to develop a \ncomprehensive agenda to promote innovation and competitiveness in the \npublic and private sectors.\n  Why is this so important? Because a country that doesn't innovate, \nstagnates. The whole foundation of American culture and economy is \nbased on the concept of discovery and innovation. That is part of our \nculture. When you look at what has made America a superpower, it is our \ninnovation and our technology. We have to look at where the new ideas \nare going to come from that are going to generate the new products and \nworkforce for the 21st century.\n  I want America to win the Nobel Prizes and the markets. This \nlegislation will help to set the framework. It will make sure that \nwe're helping our young people with scholarships and helping our \nscience teachers and those working in science with funding and research \nopportunities. We also are forming partnerships with the private sector \nand building an innovation-friendly Government.\n  The very essence of our culture is innovation and discovery. Remember \nwe got here because someone wanted to discover. When Lewis and Clark \nset out on their expedition, it wasn't the National Geographic Society, \nto find a trail to the Pacific--it was called the Corps of Discovery. \nThat is who we are. That is what our culture is, and that is what we \nneed to maintain.\n  We are a nation of explorers and pioneers always searching for new \nfrontiers. The next generation of pioneers, engineers, and scientists \nis out there. They will help us create jobs and win the markets. Most \nimportantly, they will help us win the amazing race. I will use my \nposition as chair of the subcommittee that funds science to make sure \nthat there is money in the Federal checkbook to support these \nproposals, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have an amendment to S. 761, the America \nCOMPETES Act. My amendment would allow competency-based institutions of \nhigher learning to access grant programs which will help them train \nmath, science, and critical foreign language teachers.\n  I applaud the goals of increasing the numbers of math, science, and \ncritical foreign language teachers in our schools, including high-need \nschools. Our ability to compete as a nation is directly tied to our \nability to educate our young people and retrain those who are in \nindustries that are no longer viable.\n  We now have the finest system of higher education in the world. There \nis no doubt that if we provide the proper incentives, many brilliant \ninnovators and educators will take up the clarion call.\n  I come before this body today to introduce my amendment because many \nof today's teachers are teaching an older generation of students. The \nU.S. economy is in a state of continual change, and with that change \ncomes displacement of workers and a need to retrain and retool. These \nnontraditional students often receive their training from accredited \nschools who assess student development based on a student's ability to \ndemonstrate competency in the material being taught. Under the bill as \ndrafted, these competency-based universities would not be able to \naccess the grant money for teacher development. My amendment would \nremove this bias and allow competency-based universities access to the \nteacher development grant money. This in turn will increase the \nteaching quality in math, science, and critical foreign language, \nthereby providing the students attending these universities with a \nbetter education.\n  Current bill language would prevent participation by well-respected \nand widely recognized institutions, such as Western Governors \nUniversity, WGU. WGU was set up by over 19 Governors to provide \ninnovation in higher education and is now training over 1,000 math and \nscience teachers, the majority of whom are women and minorities. WGU's \ninnovative approach to teacher education has proven very successful.\n  As we set about to ensure that our Nation has the needed highly \nqualified teachers in critical subject areas, we must make certain that \nthese institutions are included in this legislation. Therefore, I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4906-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, recently we learned that the Ohio National \nGuard could face early redeployment. We learned the National Guard is \nbeing asked to train without the proper equipment. Our Guard will do \nthe job well, General Wade and others in Ohio assure me, and their past \nhistory shows they will. Our Guard will do the job well regardless of \nthe circumstances, but it is wrong to send them to Iraq with incomplete \ntraining, with inadequate equipment, with insufficient downtime.\n  The conference report released last night echoes what many of us in \nCongress and what so many military families across our great country \nhave been saying: We need a new direction for Iraq.\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\n  Make no mistake, we take a back seat to no one in supporting the \nbrave men and women fighting in Iraq, and we absolutely support their \nfamilies. But more of the same is not a plan for our troops. More of \nthe same, more involvement in this civil war, will not end the war in \nIraq. This war has made our country, and our world, less safe. The Iraq \nwar has cost 142 Ohioans their lives and wounded another 1,000.\n  GEN Colin Powell, talking about the President's surge, the \nPresident's escalation of this war, has said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work.\n\n  Colin Powell, General Powell, recognizes this is a civil war, \nrecognizes that the surge, the President's escalation will not result \nin a different outcome in Iraq.\n  Congress will continue, of course, to fight for our Nation's military \nby working to see that they have the resources and the support they \nneed and the leadership they deserve. The conference report fully funds \nand fully supports our troops while establishing conditions that will \nbring our troops home. It provides desperately needed funding to the \nVeterans' Administration to help care for the hundreds of thousands of \nnew veterans created by this war.\n  When we think of the carnage brought about by this war, when we think \nof the literally tens of thousands of men and women who serve this \ncountry and who are back from Iraq and who are in the Veterans' \nAdministration health care system, we understand why we need from our \nGovernment literally a 50-year plan. What are we going to do for the \nnext five decades for these injured men and women who have suffered \npsychological injury and physical injury? Yet this administration is \nnot even funding our troops, the health care of our returning troops \nwell this year, let alone planning into the future. This supplemental \nbill we will send to the President in the next few days begins the \nprocess of what we need to do to take care of the health and the \nwelfare of these returning troops, these injured, psychologically and \nphysically injured soldiers.\n  If the President won't take responsibility for his failures and lead \nour troops home, then Congress needs to and Congress will. We owe it to \nour soldiers, to our sailors, to our airmen and women and to our \nmarines, and we owe it to their families.\n  The President should listen to military leaders and the American \npeople and work with Congress to change course in Iraq instead of \nthreatening vetoes. Vetoing this legislation would deny funding that \nour military needs in Iraq. It would deny funding our veterans \ndesperately need who have returned home.\n  The President says there is too much pork, too much spending in this \nbill, as if every other supplemental bill that previous Republican \nCongresses, the House and Senate, have sent to the President every time \nwith other supplemental emergency spending has not. Mr. President: \nPlease read this bill. Don't dismiss it out of hand because you don't \nlike some of the language about Iraq, even though it protects our \nsoldiers, even though it takes care of our veterans, even though it \ndoes things such as spend $3 billion for the mine-resistant ambush-\nprotected vehicles, vehicles that will make our troops considerably \nsafer than the flat-bottomed vehicles where far too many of our troops \nhave been killed or badly injured.\n  This supplemental bill we are sending to the President includes \nbillions of dollars for BRAC, billions of dollars for military \nconstruction, the kind of work we need to do to make our military even \nmore efficient, even more productive. It spends $1.6 billion for \nindividual body armor, something the military and the civilian \nleadership in the White House and the civilian leadership in the \nPentagon have fallen short on, providing the kind of body armor for our \ntroops and the kind of up-armor for our humvee vehicles that is needed.\n  I ask again, Mr. President: Please read this bill before you decide \nwhat you are going to do, and then sign this bill. The VA would get \n$1.7 billion more than the VA proposal from the President, which was \nzero; it would have $39 million in polytrauma-related funding; it would \nhave $10 million for blind veterans programs. It has $100 million for \nVA mental services. It has $25 million for prosthetics.\n\n  This legislation we are sending to the President--again we ask him to \nread it before making his decision instead of dismissing it out of \nhand--has all kinds of support for our troops, for their health care, \nfor their supplies, for supplying them in the field. It has way more \nmoney for our troops in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and for those troops \nreturning home in our VA system, way more resources than the President \nhas allowed in his budget.\n  The President has set our Nation on a path that leads nowhere. He did \nnot listen to the voters last fall. He has not listened to the Iraq \nStudy Group, the bipartisan panel of very distinguished Americans. He \nhas not listened to many of the military advisers, free to speak \nfreely, and he has not listened to the House and the Senate majorities \nabout this legislation.\n  In addition, this legislation provides for help for mine safety. It \nprovides for emergency spending for the LIHEAP program, for elderly \nindigent people who have had their heating or air-conditioning cut off \nbecause they simply can't afford to pay for their energy use at home. \nIt has support for the pandemic flu. It has pandemic flu protections. \nAs Senator Stabenow from Michigan said a few moments ago, it has a \nminimum wage increase, something this Senate or House has not done for \n10 years.\n  Mr. President: Please read this bill before you decide whether you \nare going to sign it or veto it, and please listen again to General \nPowell, who said:\n\n       I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into \n     Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work.\n\n  We are on the wrong course in Iraq. If the President signs this bill, \nit will help us redeploy our troops more quickly out of Iraq in the \nmost orderly and safest way possible. It will also equally and \nimportantly provide for health care for our troops, for the tens of \nthousands of injured troops who have returned home from this war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4907-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4907-S4908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING PROFESSOR CHERIF BASSIOUNI\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor an outstanding Illinoisan, \nProfessor Cherif Bassiouni, a great legal mind, teacher, and \nhumanitarian, and to congratulate him on his retirement.\n  For more than 40 years, Professor Bassiouni has made Chicago--and \nDePaul University--his home. At DePaul, he has made countless \ncontributions to international law and legal education. He has also \nbeen a consistent advocate for the rule of law. His legacy at DePaul \ncontinues the legacy of his family. The Bassiouni family is widely \nknown for their impact on the struggle for independence in Egypt almost \none century ago.\n  Cherif's maternal and paternal grandparents were lawyers and leaders \nin the struggle for Egyptian independence. His paternal grandfather led \nthe 1919 revolt against the British. Professor Bassiouni's early \ninstruction was comprised of French Jesuit schooling, Muslim tutors, \nand European nannies. His upbringing encompassed the best of different \nsocieties and was a sign of great things to come. He was introduced to \nthe charitable works of St. Vincent de Paul and since his youth, has \nbeen guided by St. Vincent's motto, ``to serve God by serving the needs \nof man.'' He lived through some of the most dramatic moments in both \nEgyptian and American history; he was a solider during the 1956 war but \nthen dissented against Nasser's regime and was placed under house \narrest. Soon afterward he immigrated to the United States.\n  After finishing his law degree, Professor Bassiouni began his \nteaching career at the DePaul University College of Law in 1964, where \nhe was able to link the experiences of his youth to the work of his \nadult life. He was steadfastly devoted to the advancement of human \nrights. He did pro bono work for clients involved in the civil rights \nmovement that culminated in the 1967 Chicago riots and the 1968 \nDemocratic National Convention protests. Ten years later he applied \nwhat he had learned to his native land, by advising President Anwar \nSadat during the Camp David Peace Accords.\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n  As a legal scholar, Professor Bassiouni's accomplishments are \nastounding. Several thousand judges and professors worldwide have \nstudied under him. He is considered a world authority in the field of \ninternational criminal law. He cochaired the United Nations Committee \nof Experts that drafted the Convention Against Torture. He drafted this \nseminal document from his ninth floor office in the O'Malley Building \nof DePaul, right down the street from my office in Chicago.\n  At DePaul, Professor Bassiouni has left a lasting mark, perhaps most \nnotably for his founding of the International Human Rights Law \nInstitute. The IHRLI already has impacted generations of students and \nassisted people throughout the world.\n  Cherif Bassiouni has been a Nobel nominee and is a recipient of the \nIllinois Order of Lincoln--among many other honors. He was pivotal in \nthe creation of the International Criminal Court. His has been a voice \nof reason and experience in complicated situations, including most \nrecently his work as counsel to the Governments of Afghanistan and Iraq \nas they seek to establish rule of law. I hope he will continue to \nadvise these wounded nations as they move towards peace and democracy.\n  I conclude by thanking Professor Bassiouni for his brilliant work and \ncontributions not only to DePaul University but also to the lives and \ncommunities his work has helped shape. I commend him and his family and \nwish him an equally brilliant retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4908-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN MEMORY OF REPRESENTATIVE JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of Representative \nJuanita Millender-McDonald, a kind-hearted woman whose remarkable life \ntouched so many of us.\n  Juanita was a loving mother, and a dedicated public servant who \napproached her work with an upbeat attitude and can-do spirit that was \nan inspiration to us all.\n  Her passing is a tragic loss for California, the 37th Congressional \nDistrict she so ably represented, and the many Members of Congress with \nwhom she has worked over the years.\n  Juanita's career broke through so many barriers for women and African \nAmericans. Her rise as the first African American woman to chair a \nCongressional Committee was only the latest of many firsts in her \ncareer.\n  In her seven terms of service in the House of Representatives, she \nfought valiantly for the rights of women, for the security of our \nNation, and for the protection of human rights across our Nation and \nthe world.\n  Juanita's efforts to reach across the aisle made her one the most \neffective Members of Congress, but it was her bold initiatives that \nembodied the courage with which she followed her convictions.\n  In her first year in Congress, Juanita immediately demanded the \nattention of the nation when she brought then- CIA director John \nDeutsch to Watts to address a newspaper report that the CIA was using \nprofits from domestic crack-cocaine sales to fund CIA-backed Contras in \nNicaragua.\n  Juanita's commitment to the health of our communities has been \nprofound, and her efforts addressed the needs not only of her \nconstituents, but to the victims of disease around the world.\n  She led the charge to enact the Mother-to-Child HIV-AIDS Transmission \nAct that has become the foundation of President Bush's $15 billion \nAfrican AIDS initiative. For nearly a decade, Juanita coordinated the \nannual AIDS Walk in her district to help continue to inform the \ncommunity and raise awareness of this deadly disease.\n  During her tenure as the Ranking Member of the Committee on House \nAdministration, Juanita fought to ensure that every ballot that is cast \nis counted, and that all of the citizens of our country would know \ntheir voting rights.\n  Juanita has been inspiring young women since the beginning of her \ncareer as an educator in California, when she served the Los Angeles \nUnified School District as a career counselor and edited Images, a \nstate textbook which encouraged young women to pursue non-traditional \ncareers.\n  As the Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's \nIssues, she sought to address the plight of women globally, brought \ntogether the women of Congress with the first female Supreme Court \nJustices to discuss issues important to women across the Nation, and \nsought recognition for the women in uniform who have served our country \nin times of war with the first annual Memorial Day Tribute to Women in \nthe Military at the Arlington National Cemetery's Women's Memorial.\n  On so many issues, I have been fortunate enough to consider Juanita a \nvaluable ally and friend, but I will especially miss her work as a \nleading voice on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \nAs the Representative of a district with two of the busiest ports in \nthe United States, Juanita was a passionate supporter of the effort to \nensure that the movement of goods is safe, secure and efficient.\n  Through these past years, Juanita and I worked together to keep the \nC-17 production line from being mothballed by President Bush and \nfurloughing hundreds of employees.\n  I know that Juanita's presence will be sorely missed by communities \nwhich she served so tirelessly. Today I send my sincere condolences to \nher husband James, her five children, her staff, and all those who knew \nand loved her. Together we will continue her important work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4908-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4908-S4909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  Ninety-two years ago today, on the night of April 24, 1915, the \nOttoman government launched a series of raids in which hundreds of \nArmenian leaders and intellectuals were arrested and subsequently \ndeported or killed. This event marked the beginning of a systematic \ncampaign of murder, deportation, and forced starvation, during which as \nmany as 1.5 million Armenians perished and 500,000 were exiled by the \nOttoman government.\n  We are obliged to remember and speak about their suffering because \nsilence about such atrocities plants the seed for another tragedy.\n  On the eve of the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland, seeking to allay the \nfears of his aides, Adolf Hitler said: ``Who, after all, speaks today \nof the annihilation of the Armenians?''\n  And today, the world is again witnessing genocide, one waged by a \ngovernment against its own people, one involving mass murder, ethnic \ncleansing, and forced starvation. I am speaking, of course, about the \ngenocide in Darfur.\n  Let there be no mistake. The ongoing genocide in Darfur, carried out \nby the Government of Sudan and its janjaweed militias, traces its roots \nto the silence and quiescence of the international community during \nprevious episodes of genocide and ethnic cleansing, including the \nArmenian genocide.\n  By acknowledging and learning from the Armenian genocide, then, we \nbecome better positioned to prevent present and future atrocities.\n  Open discussion of the Armenian genocide serves another important \npurpose. It enables the descendants of those involved in the Armenian \ngenocide--both perpetrators and victims--to mend the wounds that have \nnot yet healed.\n  As recently as January of this year, a Turkish-Armenian journalist, \nHrant Dink, was murdered because of his outspoken advocacy for Turkish \nrecognition of the Armenian genocide. This incident serves as an \nimportant reminder that an open, informed, and tolerant discussion of \nthe genocide is critical.\n  California is home to many of the descendants of the genocide's \nsurvivors, who immigrated to the United States and, over the course of \na few decades, built strong and vibrant communities. Working closely \nwith the Armenian-American community over my many years in public \nservice, I know how alive and painful this issue continues to be for \nmany Armenian Americans.\n  So I rise before you today and ask that you join me in acknowledging \nand commemorating the Armenian genocide. Together, let us send a strong \nmessage that such atrocities will never be accepted, regardless of when \nand where they take place.\n  And let us ensure that the legacy of the Armenian genocide is one of \nreconciliation and hope.\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, on behalf of the Armenian population \nof Rhode Island, and Armenians around the world, I wish to recognize \nthe 92nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  On April 24, 1915, nationalists in the Ottoman Empire rounded up, \ndeported, and executed 200 Armenian community leaders, writers, \nthinkers, and professionals in Constantinople, present day Istanbul. \nAlso on that day in Constantinople, 5,000 of the poorest Armenians were \nmassacred in the streets and in their homes. These events sparked an 8-\nyear campaign of tyranny that impacted the lives of every Armenian in \nAsia Minor. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were murdered, \nand another 500,000 were exiled.\n  The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morganthau, Sr., \nunsuccessfully pleaded President Wilson for intervention. \nUnfortunately, the United States and the world tragically failed to \nintervene on behalf of the Armenian people. Ambassador Morganthau would \nlater write in his memoir, ``The great massacres and persecutions of \nthe past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of \nthe Armenian race in 1915.''\n  Today, as a proud supporter of S. Res 106, legislation officially \nrecognizing the Armenian genocide, I urge the President to ensure that \nthe foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate \nunderstanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human \nrights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the U.S. record \nrelating to the Armenian genocide. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stated \nover 50 years after the Armenian genocide that: ``Injustice anywhere is \na threat to justice everywhere . . . Whatever affects one directly, \naffects all indirectly.'' The time has come to officially recognize the \nArmenian genocide.\n  The United States is proud to have Armenia as an ally in the \nrebuilding and reconstruction of Iraq. For the past 4 years, Armenian \nsoldiers have supported American and multinational force efforts in \nIraq. As part of the Polish-led multinational division in south-central \nIraq, Armenians have worked as truckdrivers, bomb detonators, and \ndoctors. Armenia has proclaimed their fight by not allowing others to \nbe left helpless as they were nearly a century ago.\n  We must study and remember the events of our past in order to be \nbetter citizens of tomorrow. In instances such as the Armenian \ngenocide, I call on all nations, not just the United States, to educate \ntheir youth to stand against hatred and prejudice of others in order to \ndeter future atrocities against humanity. We should be prepared to take \na vigilant stand against similar atrocities, such as the current \nsituation in Darfur, to not let history repeat itself.\n  We must honor the victims of the Armenian genocide by vowing to never \nallow the world to stand idle to atrocities against humanity again.\n  Menk panav chenk mornar. We will never forget.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those asking \nthat today, the 24th of April, 2007, be a day of reflection and \nremembrance for those Armenians who perished in the genocide that \noccurred between 1915 and 1923.\n  As many as one and a half million Armenians lost their lives during \nthis systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing conducted in Turkey while \nthe world was preoccupied by the First World War and its aftermath. \nThat the major powers, including the United States, did not prevent or \nintervene at any point to stop this killing represents one of twentieth \ncentury's ugliest stains on humanity.\n  While today we all would like to believe that had world leaders been \nacutely aware of the atrocities occurring they would have acted to stop \nthem, recent episodes make a clear that we as a people continue to \nstruggle with the obligation to speak out when our neighbor's blood is \nshed. In Bosnia, Rwanda, and right now in Darfur, the world has stood \nby while hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians are slaughtered. \nAny action on the part of the international community has been too \nlittle and far too late.\n  Because I believe we cannot prevent future genocide unless we \nrecognize past genocide, I am a sponsor of Senate Resolution 106, which \ncalls upon the President to ensure that this Nation's foreign policy \nreflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning human \nrights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the U.S. record \nrelating to the Armenian genocide.\n  I join many of my colleagues today in urging the Senate to pass this \nresolution.\n  Turkey is good friend of the United States and a critical ally in the \nfight against terrorist networks. I hope that the ties that bind our \ntwo nations only grow closer in the coming years, as we continue to \nwork through NATO to ensure cooperative security. And I will join my \ncolleagues in pressing for Turkey's admittance to the European Union.\n  However, I believe that the Armenian genocide must be acknowledged.\n  Today, the 92nd anniversary commemorating this incident, we pause to \npay tribute to those who died and renew our commitment to ensuring that \nsimilar atrocities never again occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4909-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4909-S4910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise tonight to respond to those who \nhave questioned the legislative history and intent of section 1076 of \nthe fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act, a provision dealing \nwith the use of the Armed Forces and National Guard in major public \nemergencies.\n  This provision was the subject of a hearing today before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I would like to outline that this provision was drafted jointly by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in a bipartisan and transparent \nfashion, was approved unaninmously by the committee, and was printed on \nMay 9, 2006 as part of the Senate report on this bill.\n  The provision was fully available in the public domain for review and \ndebate for over 5 months prior to its final passage in the House and \nSenate, and approval by the President.\n  During the brief period today that I have had the opportunity to \nagain review this legislation, I did not uncover any material that \nsuggests there were any serious misgivings regarding this provision by \nFederal, State, or local officials.\n  I believe the committee's record speaks for itself. Attached below is \nan excerpt as put forth in the final conference report:\n\n        Report 109-702--Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5122\n\n   National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Excerpt)\n\n\n    use of the armed forces in major public emergencies (sec. 1076)\n\n       The Senate amendment contained a provision (sec. 1042) that \n     would amend chapter 15 of title 10, United States Code, the \n     so-called `Insurrection Act,' to clarify and update the \n     statute, and to make corresponding changes toother provisions \n     of law. Chapter 15 contains a collection of statutes dating \n     to the 18th and 19th centuries that authorizes the use of the \n     armed forces to put down insurrections, enforce Federal \n     authority, and suppress conspiracies that interfere with the \n     enforcement of Federal or State law.\n       The provision would amend section 333 of title 10, United \n     States Code, to authorize the President, in any situation in \n     which he determined that, as a result of a natural disaster, \n     terrorist attack or incident, epidemic or other serious \n     public health emergency, or other condition, domestic \n     violence occurred to such an extent that the constituted \n     authorities of the State are incapable of maintaining public \n     order, and the violence obstructed the execution of the laws \n     of the United States of impeded the course of justice \n     thereunder, to use the armed forces, including the National \n     Guard in Federal service, to restore public order and enforce \n     the laws of the United States until the State authorities are \n     again capable of maintaining order. The President is to \n     notify Congress of his determination to exercise this \n     authority as soon as possible and every 15 days thereafter as \n     long as the authority is exercised.\n       The provision would also amend chapter 152 of title 10, \n     United States Code, to authorize the President, in any \n     situation in which he determines to exercise the authority \n     set out above, to direct the Secretary of Defense to provide \n     supplies, services, and equipment necessary for the immediate \n     preservation of life and property. Such supplies, services, \n     and equipment may be provided: (1) only to the extent that \n     the constituted authorities of the State are unable to \n     provide them; (2) only until other departments and agencies \n     of the United States charged with such responsibilities are \n     able to provide them; and (3) only to the extent that their \n     provision will not interfere with preparedness or ongoing \n     operations. This authority is not subject to the provisions \n     of section 403   of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170b  ).\n       The provision would further include a conforming amendment \n     to section 12304   of\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\n     title 10, United Stated Code, to remove a restriction on the \n     use of the Presidential Selected Reserve call up authority in \n     chapter 15 or natural disaster situations. The House bill \n     contained no similar provision. The House recedes with an \n     amendment that would modify the conforming amendment to \n     section 12304  ) to provide that the Presidential Selected \n     Reserve call up authority could be used in situations arising \n     under chapter 15 and section 12406 of title 10, United States \n     Code, as well as in situations set out in subsection (b) of \n     section 12304.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4910-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n  Technical Sergeant Timothy Weiner, Senior Airman Daniel Miller and \n                     Senior Airman Elizabeth Loncki\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to three members of \nHill Air Force Base's 75th Air Base Wing who, together, lost their \nlives in Iraq in performance of their duties. Tsgt Timothy Weiner of \nTamarack, FL, SrA Daniel Miller of Galesburg, IL, and SrA Elizabeth \nLoncki of New Castle, DE, were killed while disarming an explosive \ndevice.\n  One of the core values of the Air Force is ``Service Before Self.'' \nThese airmen met this standard every day while disarming improvised \nexplosive devices and destroying munitions to protect their fellow \nservicemen and the people of Iraq. All three knew the risks inherent in \ntheir assignment, but still chose to volunteer so that others may be \nsafe.\n  Technical Sergeant Weiner was the youngest of four sons of Ken \nWeiner, a Korean war veteran, and Marcia Fenster. It should be noted \nthat all the sons of the Weiner family have worn the uniform of their \nNation. Technical Sergeant Weiner's mother said, ``he was a \nunbelievable father and husband who could do a job that was rough and \nso demanding but was also a man who could show love and was not afraid \nto.''\n  This was Sergeant Weiner's second tour in Iraq. His professionalism \nis best exemplified by the fact that, in a previous assignment, he was \npart of explosive ordnance disposal team that provided protection for \nthe President. He is survived by his wife Debbie and son Jonathan. The \ntechnical sergeant had planned to retire within a couple of years and \nwork with computers. Now our prayers go with his wife and son.\n  SrA Airman Daniel Miller was the oldest of six children of Daniel B. \nMiller and Robin Mahnesmith. He is remembered by his family and friends \nas a happy person, who loved football, enjoyed hunting and fishing and \nwas a silent leader. His girlfriend Dana Sopher stated ``the love he \nhad for his family was just amazing.'' Senior Airman Miller knew of the \nrisk of his job but still believed that you ``just have to live life.'' \nSenior Airman Miller had hoped to work for a metropolitan bomb squad \nafter he had completed his service with the Air Force. I know I join \nwith all of my colleagues in praying for his family during these \ndifficult times.\n  SrA Elizabeth Loncki was also the oldest child of Stephen and \nstepmother Christine Loncki, who still plans on sending cookies and \nbaked goods to troops in Iraq. After learning of her death, one of her \ntraining instructors contacted Senior Airman Lonki's family and \nrecounted that Elizabeth had excelled at her explosive ordnance \ndisposal training class and was a valuable member of any team. Senior \nAirman Loncki planned on getting married after she returned from Iraq; \nher future fiance was to visit her parents shortly and ask permission \nfor the senior airman's hand in marriage. He has since accompanied her \nhome to her family. Again our prayers go to her family.\n  All three of these airmen were heroes in the truest sense of the \nword. They volunteered for one of the most dangerous jobs in our \nNation's military and risked their lives every day. Their sacrifice was \nnot in vain, their bravery in the face of danger is an example to us \nall. They met and exceeded the Air Force principle of ``Service Before \nSelf.''\n\n\n                        captain brian s. freeman\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the \nloss of CPT Brian S. Freeman whose mother, Kathleen Snyder, is a \nresident of Utah.\n  Captain Freeman died while performing his duties in Karbala, Iraq, \nwhere he was assigned to the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion, U.S. Army \nReserve, based in Whitehall, OH.\n  Captain Freeman resided in Temecula, CA, with his wife Charlotte, a \n3-year-old son, Gunnar, and a 3-month-old daughter, Ingrid. The captain \nhad just returned to Iraq after a 2-week Christmas leave. Charlotte \nFreeman commented about that time, ``We did all the family things \npacked into two weeks. It was wonderful. We had a picture perfect \nfamily and the two weeks were perfect.''\n  The captain was a 1999 West Point graduate who, after returning home, \nplanned to attend graduate school. He had already received an important \nletter of recommendation from the Governor of Karbala who wrote: \n``Freeman has assisted in forming a warmer relationship with the Army . \n. . I think Capt. Freeman genuinely cares about what happens to Karbala \nand its people.''\n  For a member of a civil affairs unit, whose responsibility it is to \nassist the local population while developing and maintaining close \nrelationships with indigenous government officials, I cannot think of \nany higher praise. Not surprisingly, Captain Freeman had been decorated \nwith two Army commendation medals, two Army achievement medals, a \nnational defense service medal and a global war on terrorism service \nmedal. I also understand that he was a member of the Army's bobsledding \nteam.\n  America has lost another decorated hero. Captain Freeman had hope to \nmake a difference during his time in Iraq. I believe that anyone who \nlooks at the life and actions of Captain Freeman will see that he more \nthan achieved that goal.\n  Captain Freeman and his family will always be in my prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4910-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4910-S4911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ANNIVERSARY OF THE L'AMBIANCE PLAZA COLLAPSE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday marked the 20th anniversary of a \ndark day in my State's history: the day the L'Ambiance Plaza towers \ncollapsed in Bridgeport and took with them the lives of 28 Connecticut \nconstruction workers.\n  For millions of people in Connecticut, that day's images are still \nfresh; time can blunt their pain, but it can never erase them. We \nremember the shock: 16 stories of new apartments reduced with a roar, \nwithin seconds, to ruined concrete and steel. We remember the hundreds \nof volunteers who combed the wrecked piles for their friends. This is \nhow one newspaper reported their remarkable endurance: ``Physically and \nemotionally drained by a nightmarish task of seeking and sometimes \nfinding the bodies of friends and loved ones, some of the volunteers \nhave pushed themselves to exhaustion, working around the clock and then \nbegging to go on working.'' We remember their frantic search for \nsurvivors, and the slow-dawning truth that there were none.\n  But above all, we remember 28 men who died too soon. They were union \nmen from Bridgeport and Waterbury who poured concrete, laid pipe, and \nfixed steel. Not a single one of them went to work that morning \nexpecting to die; but each knew the high risks of his trade, and \nwillingly took them on to make a good living for his family.\n  We can clear rubble and rebuild towers, but not a single life can be \nreplaced. If this tragedy can give us anything to be thankful for, it \nis the end of the dangerous lift-slab construction method that led to \nthe collapse. We can and must demand the safest conditions for all \nworkers, and do everything it takes to protect them. But try as we \nmight, we will never be able to outlaw collapse, or regulate accidents, \nor legislate against tragedy.\n  We can only send our thanks to the men and women who risk themselves \nso we can lie down and wake up in safety and comfort. For those who \ndied 20 years ago, we can pledge to keep their memories fresh.

Mr. President, today I wish to talk about the ongoing \ngenocide in Darfur, and this administration's inexcusable failure to do \nall it can to stop the violence there. We all understand the monumental \nchallenge we face in ending the violence in Darfur, but this \nadministration's behavior and recent statements on this issue suggest \nthat it simply does not know when to stop talking and when to start \nacting. And all the while innocent people continue to needlessly die \nunder our watch.\n  Last fall, the President's Special Envoy for Darfur, Andrew Natsios, \nannounced that if the Sudanese Government did not accept a U.N.-African \nUnion peacekeeping force by January 1, the administration would \nimplement punitive measures as part of its Plan B.\n  Well here we are today. Over 100 days have passed since January 1. \nAnd what do we have to show for it? No U.N.-African Union peacekeeping \nforce on the ground in Sudan. And no Plan B.\n  Meanwhile the death toll has risen. Over the course of the conflict, \n200,000 people have been killed; 2.5 million displaced. Families and \nvillages have been decimated; women and girls have been raped.\n  Fighting has infected Sudan's neighbors, leaving scores dead along \nthe Sudan-Chad border. One U.N. official recently described the scene \nof dead bodies in the area as ``shocking and apocalyptic.''\n  So much death and destruction, 2\\1/2\\ years after this administration \nstated that genocide was indeed occurring in Darfur. More than 100 days \nafter Mr. Natsios's deadline, the killings continue.\n  Earlier this month, Mr. Natsios testified before the Foreign \nRelations Committee on Darfur and Plan B. His testimony only deepened \nmy concerns about the administration's Darfur paralysis.\n  When asked repeatedly by Senator Menendez to answer yes or no as to \nwhether genocide was occurring in Darfur, he did not answer yes. \nInstead his response was that the violence has abated in Darfur and \nthat the rebel groups were also engaging in killings. His answer was \nincredibly disturbing to me and to other members of the committee.\n  Now I understand Mr. Natsios's desire to convey the complexity of the \nsituation and the complicity of various parties on the ground, but the \nfact is that the primary party responsible for the killings is the \nSudanese Government and its Janjaweed proxies. For Mr. Natsios to be \nunable to state that genocide is occurring in clear terms seems to me a \nclassic example of missing the forest for the trees. It also raises a \nquestion of credibility. After all, how can this administration stop a \ngenocide when its special envoy won't even fully acknowledge it?\n  Mr. Natsios also stated that although the President is supposedly \nangry about the situation in Darfur and has recently proposed certain \nsanctions, he has acceded to a request by U.N. Secretary-General Ban \nKi-Moon to delay any implementation of Plan B for another two to four \nweeks to give the Secretary-General time to convince the Sudanese \nGovernment to accept a peacekeeping force.\n  Now 2 to 4 weeks may seem like nothing in the context of protracted \nand complex diplomatic negotiations, but this is no treaty that is \nbeing negotiated. There are lives at stake every day here and we just \ncannot afford to take a ``wait and see'' approach.\n  Recent reports suggest that the Sudanese Government has agreed to a \nhybrid force but based on its previous track record, I will believe it \nwhen I see some additional boots on the ground. In the meantime, a \npause on the administration's part is simply unacceptable.\n  And so I believe that even as the modalities of a peacekeeping force, \nthat may or may not materialize, are worked out, the administration \nmust begin implementing certain elements of Plan B immediately. Not 4 \nweeks from now. Not 2 weeks from now. Immediately.\n  Select punitive measures as described by Mr. Natsios at the hearing \ninclude imposing personal sanctions on certain members of the rebel \ngroups and the Sudanese Government; curbing the Sudanese Government's \naccess to oil revenues; and increasing penalties on companies operating \nin Sudan.\n  There is nothing revolutionary about these measures. They were leaked \nto the public and have been under discussion for some weeks. The \nquestion in my mind is not so much about whether we should implement \nthem but why haven't we already implemented them.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee and a senior member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I am absolutely willing to work with the \nadministration to put these measures into force and look forward to \nsome clear answers from the administration on this.\n  Now let me be clear about what I mean in saying we should go ahead \nand implement elements of Plan B. I fully appreciate the sensitivities \nof our diplomatic efforts related to Darfur. I fully agree with the \nimportance of working this issue through the U.N. in a multilateral \nmanner. But if there are certain steps that the United States can take \non its own account and indeed was supposed to take over 100 days ago to \npressure the Sudanese Government, then what are we waiting for?\n  The time has come to delink certain elements of Plan B from our \nbroader multilateral strategy to pressure Khartoum. The time has come \nto act where and when we can. This administration has shown no \ncompulsion in acting unilaterally in the past. It did so by invading \nIraq with disastrous consequence. Why does it continue to keep one foot \non the side lines 4 years into this genocide when it not only has the \nability but also the moral responsibility to act?\n  Moreover, we must not stop at implementing long overdue sanctions \nwhose credibility has been called into question because they have yet \nto be implemented. We must also consider a more robust role for NATO \nforces, including their deployment to Sudan if the Sudanese Government \ncontinues to obstruct a hybrid peacekeeping force.\n  Even if the Sudanese Government consents to the U.N.-AU force, the \nUnited Nations may fail to muster the requisite troops within an \nacceptable period of time. In such a scenario, we should consider the \ndeployment of an interim NATO force with U.S. participation. At a \nminimum, NATO forces, which already provide logistical support to the \nAfrican Union mission, should enforce a no-fly zone in Darfur pursuant \nto U.N. Resolution 1591 to prevent military flights over Darfur.\n  Naturally, special attention will have to be paid in any operation to \nthe security of refugee camps and aid workers but to those who say that \nmilitary action will make things worse, I have only one thing to say: \nwe are already at rock bottom.\n  The authorization of force is one of the most critical decisions a \nmember of Congress has to make, especially if it entails sending our \nbrave men and women into harm's way on the ground. U.S. participation \nhowever in any such action, even in a limited capacity, is critical to \nshowing the world that America is not just about fighting the war \nagainst terrorism but also is willing to fight against injustice and \nmass murder. That we are prepared to fight for the principles of \nrespect for human dignity and life, and not just talk about them.\n  In advocating certain measures outside the framework of the United \nNations, I do not intend to dismiss the critical role that the U.N. and \nother countries can play. The fact is that the U.S. has limited \nleverage over Sudan and we need all the help we can get. We must work \nwithin the U.N. system, and also press other key countries that deal \nwith Sudan such as India and China to do their part. China in \nparticular has a crucial role to play in changing Khartoum's behavior.\n  But even as we assess the role and responsibilities of others, we \nmust never forget our own. We must lead by example. Over the past few \nyears, I have\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nvoted for legislation sanctioning the Government of Sudan. I have \ndelivered floor statements and attended hearings on Darfur, where \nwitness after witness has testified to the ongoing atrocities. I have \nsent letters to the Chinese, the Russians, the Arabs and others urging \nthem to use their clout with Sudan.\n  Yet after all such actions and deliberations by members of this body \nand after all the punitive authorities granted to this administration, \nto see it temporizing and regressing to a point where we are debating \nwhether genocide is even occurring is utterly unacceptable.\n  The time for action is now, not in a few weeks. We are at rock bottom \nand the administration needs to deliver on its threats and translate \nits rhetoric into action. We must do everything in our power to end the \ngenocide in Darfur immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4912-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DISCUSSING PRESSING ISSUES FACING THE NATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Their current membership includes more \nthan 170 Nobel laureates and more than 50 Pulitzer Prize winners.\n  This joint meeting, entitled ``The Public Good: Knowledge as the \nFoundation for a Democratic Society'' will bring together academics and \npractitioners for a series of panel discussions, conversations and \ndinner programs on many of the most pressing issues facing the Nation.\n  Joining them for the unprecedented 2\\1/2\\-day meeting will be members \nof these congressionally chartered National Academies--the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the \nInstitute of Medicine.\n  At the opening of their meeting next week, the presidents of all five \norganizations will issue a joint statement affirming the importance of \nknowledge as the foundation for sound policymaking for the public good, \nand I ask unanimous consent that their unprecedented joint statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Knowledge in Service to the Public Good\n\n       As America's oldest national learned societies, we trace \n     our origins to the tumultuous periods in the Nation's \n     history. The American Philosophical Society was founded by \n     Benjamin Franklin in 1743, during a period of rapid growth \n     and intellectual development in the American colonies. The \n     American Academy of Arts and Sciences was founded by John \n     Adams in 1780, in the midst of the Revolutionary War. The \n     National Academy of Sciences (1863), the National Academy of \n     Engineering (1964), and the Institute of Medicine (1970) were \n     all established under legislation signed by President Abraham \n     Lincoln during the Civil War.\n       Our founders shared a conviction that knowledge in service \n     to the public good is an indispensable pillar of our Nation. \n     We have remained committed to that vision over the centuries, \n     because democracy requires freedom of inquiry, engaged and \n     educated citizens, and a wise and responsive government.\n       Our societies, individually and collectively, represent \n     leading thinkers and practitioners of the Nation. We honor \n     excellence and use our unique convening powers to engage the \n     expertise of our members in collaborative action. We actively \n     create, preserve, support, and disseminate knowledge critical \n     to the growth and well-being of our Nation.\n       Each generation must reaffirm and reinforce the founders' \n     reverence for scholarship and knowledge as the cornerstones \n     of progress and the building blocks of enduring institutions. \n     We live in an age of instantaneous access to unimaginably \n     rich sources of information, but truly useful information \n     continues to depend on underlying research and basic \n     knowledge.\n       The Academies assemble today not just to assert the \n     importance of research and free inquiry in every field, but \n     to give practical demonstration of their worth through \n     reflection on topics that affect the workings of our society \n     and that define the public good. A nation attentive to these \n     values will long endure.\n       Signed by: Emilio Bizzi, President, American Academy of \n     Arts and Sciences; Baruch S.

Mr. President, North Dakota has long maintained strong \nties with our Nation's military.\n  My State is home to two Air Force bases and the Nation's best Air \nNational Guard unit. More of our young people volunteer to serve their \ncountry in the military than nearly any other State.\n  In North Dakota, our commitment to our troops does not end when we \nwelcome them home from war. We also\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\nhave a strong tradition of honoring our veterans. In fact, when I \nstarted a North Dakota Veterans History Project 5 years ago to record \nthe stories of our veterans for future generations, the outpouring of \ninterest resulted in more than 1,500 interviews.\n  So I did not find it surprising that when the WDAY television station \nbased in Fargo, ND, organized an ``Honor Flight'' to bring veterans of \nWorld War II to Washington, D.C., it had an overabundance of donors and \ntoo few seats to accommodate all the veterans. But WDAY has chartered a \nflight to Washington next month and will bring 100 veterans of World \nWar II to see the memorial on our National Mall that was built in their \nhonor. My colleagues, Senator Conrad and Congressman Pomeroy, and I \nwill host a reception for them in the historic Russell Caucus Room.\n  I can't think of a better way to pay tribute to these heroes than \nthis trip to our Nation's Capital. Many of them will visit for the \nfirst time the World War II Memorial that is a powerful symbol of the \nsacrifice they made for the safety and freedom of our country and the \nworld.\n  This is a group of Americans who were appropriately labeled ``the \ngreatest generation'' by Tom Brokaw. I remember reading his book some \nyears ago and marveling again at the dedication those young men, and \nsome young women, expressed to this country. They dedicated their lives \nto defeating the fascism and Nazism that threatened the peace and \nprosperity of the world. They kept the free world free. Many paid for \nit with the ultimate sacrifice--their lives.\n  Several years ago, I was reminded just how important their sacrifice \nwas when I was part of a congressional delegation involved in \ndiscussions with members of the European Parliament. We had been \ndiscussing some differences between the United States and the Europeans \nfor some time. It was at this point that a European delegate stopped me \nand said, ``Mr. Senator, I want you to understand how I feel about your \ncountry.''\n  He said, ``In 1944, I was 14 years old and standing on a street \ncorner in Paris, France, when the U.S. Liberation Army marched in and \nfreed my country from the Nazis.''\n  He said, ``A young American soldier reached out his hand and gave \nthat 14-year-old boy an apple. I will go to my grave remembering that \nmoment. You should understand what your country means to me, to us, to \nmy country.''\n  To me, this man's story is a testament to the respect and admiration \npeople around the world feel for our country. And this is because the \n``greatest generation''--those same men and women who will visit \nWashington next month--were willing to leave their homes so many years \nago and travel around the world to fight an enemy that threatened our \nfreedom. They did it without complaint and without question. They loved \ntheir country.\n  There is a verse that goes, ``When the night is full of knives, and \nthe lightning is seen, and the drums are heard, the patriots are always \nthere, ready to fight and ready to die, if necessary, for freedom.''\n  The men and women who will travel to Washington next month are \npatriots who answered when duty called. The Honor Flight is an \nexpression of our thanks for the sacrifice they made that is too large \nto ever fully repay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4914-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANNOUNCING THE BIRTH OF ROBERT RILEY LUGAR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

His parents are our son, \nJohn Hoereth Lugar, and his wife, Kelly Smith Lugar, daughter of Renee \nRouton Conner and the late Robert Lee Smith. Robert Riley was born at \n6:21 p.m., and within the next hour, Renee, Char, and I were in the \ndelivery room to admire a very healthy newborn baby boy and to \ncongratulate John and Kelly as we shared these unforgettable moments \ntogether.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the city of Lenexa, KS. \nOn May 8, Lenexa, which is known as the City of Festivals for the \nnumerous festivals and events it hosts each year, will mark its 100th \nanniversary. This grand event will be part of a weeklong community \ncelebration of history and culture.\n  Lenexa was platted in 1869 by French-born civil engineer Octave \nChanute, who, in addition to designing the original Hannibal Bridge \nover the Missouri River in Kansas City, also served as a mentor to the \nWright Brothers in their quest for flight.\n  Lenexa was named for Na Nex Se, a highly respected, hard-working \nShawnee Indian woman, the daughter-in-law of Chief Black Hoof. Thirty-\neight years later, on May 8, 1907, Lenexa was incorporated as a City of \nthe 3rd Class.\n  In Lenexa's earliest days, people from various backgrounds and \ncultures came together to form this great city. With a population of \napproximately 300, the young community boasted a healthful location, \ngraded schools, three churches, suburban train service, excellent \ntelephone service, and an electric railway station.\n  Today, Lenexa has grown to a population of 46,000 residents and \nenjoys a healthy business base and is considered a city of choice for a \nvariety of high-tech and bioscience companies. The city also is looked \nto as a leader in local government initiatives, including watershed \nmanagement and public safety.\n  Lenexa cherishes its rich history, heritage and culture, and with \nthis celebration marking the city's 100th anniversary, Lenexa honors \nits past while looking forward to the future.

Mr. President, for over 50 years, Thomas W. Burns, \nMD, and Joan F. Burns have served the University of Missouri-Columbia \nwith great distinction. To honor this service, on April 27, 2007, the \nuniversity will dedicate the Thomas W. and Joan F. Burns Center for \nDiabetes and Cardiovascular Research at the University of Missouri-\nColumbia School of Medicine.\n  Thomas W. Burns was one of the founding faculty members of MU's \nmedical center, which opened in 1956 and graduated its first class of \nphysicians in 1957. Since then, hundreds of physicians who trained \nunder him have gone on to lead distinguished careers in medical care, \neducation and research. MU's medical center has treated hundreds of \nthousands of patients from Missouri and beyond.\n  Dr. Burns has been a pioneer in endocrinology and contributed greatly \nto MU's national reputation in diabetes care, prevention, and research. \nDr. Burns was a key architect in establishing MU's Cosmopolitan \nInternational Diabetes and Endocrinology Center and for many years \nserved as the center's founding director. The Cosmopolitan \nInternational Diabetes and Endocrinology Center established by Dr. \nBurns was the first public-private partnership at MU. Thousands of \npatients have received state-of-the-art care in Mid-Missouri as a \nresult of Thomas W. Burns' tremendous contributions to medicine.\n  Dr. Burns has received numerous awards from community, State and \nnational organizations. The American College of Physicians, the largest \ninternal medicine organization in the country, bestowed on him the \ntitle of ``Master,'' which is the ACP's highest academic honor, and \npresented him with the Laureate Award. Dr. Burns also received the \nUniversity of Missouri Faculty-Alumni Award in 1986 and the University \nof Missouri Distinguished Faculty Award in 1992.\n  Thomas and Joan Burns are leaders in recognizing that diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease are linked and that together the diseases \nconstitute one of the most pressing health problems for Missouri and \nthe Nation. Their contribution and legacy will allow MU to make \npotentially lifesaving advances in diabetes and cardiovascular \nresearch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4915-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON MEN'S INDOOR TRACK \n                             AND FIELD TEAM\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I offer my personal \ncongratulations to Talmadge E. King, Jr., MD, for receiving the Edward \nLivingston Trudeau Medal from the American Thoracic Society. The award \nrecognizes Dr. King for his lifelong commitment to the prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of lung disease.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. King has made significant contributions to \npulmonary medicine in patient care, research, specialty organization, \nand through his generous philanthropic contributions.\n  Dr. King began his illustrious career after graduating from Gustavus \nAdolphus College in 1970 and Harvard Medical School in 1974. Following \nhis graduation from Harvard Medical School, he began his residency at \nEmory University Affiliated Hospitals in Atlanta, GA. After 2 years of \nresidency at Emory, Dr. King was offered a pulmonary fellowship at the \nUniversity of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver. Here he also \nheld a professorship in medicine at the University of Colorado Health \nSciences Center.\n  Over the next decade, Dr. King spent time at two other Denver \nhospitals, the Veterans Administration Medical Center and the National \nJewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine. In both of these \ncapacities his talents as a doctor and as an administrator were quickly \nrecognized and he rapidly advanced within both organizations.\n  By 1997, however, he was ready to bring his considerable talents to \nthe Golden State--and we were happy to have him. Dr. King left Denver \nto take on two new roles in San Francisco, concurrently serving as the \nvice chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of \nCalifornia, San Francisco and as the chief of medical services at San \nFrancisco General Hospital. As chief of medical service at San \nFrancisco General Hospital, he leads a department of over 140 full-time \nphysicians and scientists and more than 500 support staff, with an \nannual budget of over $65 million.\n  Currently, Dr. King still serves as the chief of medical services at \nSan Francisco General, and since 2005, he has also served as the \ninterim chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of \nCalifornia San Francisco.\n  Dr. King is also a founding board member of the Foundation of the \nAmerican Thoracic Society, the philanthropic arm of the American \nThoracic Society. In this role, Dr. King has been an exemplary \ncontributor and tireless fundraiser to support domestic and \ninternational research to find better treatments for the myriad of lung \ndiseases that afflict individuals around the globe.\n  Of course, no congratulations would be complete without mentioning \nthe contributions of his wife Mozelle Davis King and his two children \nConsuelo and Malaika who have been there every step of the way and \nprovided him with steadfast love and support.\n  Again, I congratulate Dr. King on this great achievement and wish him \ncontinued success in the years to come. It is truly a pleasure to honor \nand thank him for all that he has done for patients across the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4915-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4915-S4916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BATAAN DEATH MARCH SURVIVOR\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this is an article from the April \n20, 2007, Omaha World Herald, ``Bataan Death March Survivor Still \nBeating Odds at 101'' by Joseph Morton:\n\n       When Albert Brown returned home after years in Japanese \n     camps for prisoners of war, a doctor told him to get out and \n     enjoy life while he still could.\n       The native of North Platte, Neb., was unlikely to see 50, \n     the doctor told him, given the illnesses, extreme \n     malnutrition and physical abuse he suffered as a POW.\n       Brown is 101 now--the oldest living survivor of the Bataan \n     Death March.\n       He was recognized by fellow survivors at a Washington \n     conference this week that coincided with the 65th anniversary \n     of the march.\n       During the trip, Brown visited with a fellow veteran from \n     North Platte, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. He sat in Hagel's \n     Capitol Hill office, spinning some of the tales he's racked \n     up over an eventful life.\n       His darkest stories come from the war.\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n       In the late 1930s, Brown--who had been in ROTC in high \n     school and college--got the call from Uncle Sam. He was to \n     leave his Council Bluffs dental practice and report to the \n     Army in two weeks.\n       In 1941, when he was 35, Brown was shipped off to the \n     Philippines, not long before the Japanese attacked there. Out \n     of supplies and with no reinforcements in sight, American \n     forces and their Filipino allies surrendered after months of \n     fighting in 1942.\n       The exact numbers vary somewhat from account to account, \n     but more than 70,000 American and Filipino soldiers were \n     captured. Overwhelmed with the task of transporting so many \n     prisoners, the Japanese forced them to march north. Disease, \n     thirst, hunger and killings marked the brutal ordeal, which \n     lasted for days.\n       Brown recalled being lined up and forced to march with no \n     food and no water. He said local civilians would approach and \n     attempt to throw food to the marchers.\n       ``The Japanese would beat the hell out of them,'' he said. \n     ``They'd go over there and take the butt of their rifle and \n     just beat the hell out of those people, girls and boys, that \n     threw stuff in there.''\n       Brown also witnessed the beheading of a 17-year-old Marine, \n     who was forced to the ground ``on his hands and knees, and \n     then they took the samurai sword out and severed his head.''\n       Brown himself was stabbed.\n       ``I started faltering and got to the back of the pack, and \n     then the Japanese (soldier) came up and stuck a bayonet in my \n     fanny and he yelled 'Speed-o!,' and I knew what 'speed-o' \n     meant. I never was at the back of the pack after that.''\n       At the prison camps in the Philippines, the violence and \n     the shortages of food, medicine and water continued. Brown \n     recalled how the temperature soared while the tens of \n     thousands of men in camp relied on a single brass faucet for \n     water. Fights would break out over places in line for that \n     spigot, he said.\n       ``Every drop in that canteen was your life.''\n       Later, Brown was one of the soldiers packed into a ``hell \n     ship'' to camps in Japan and China. He remained a prisoner \n     until the end of the war.\n       He suffered numerous health problems as a result of his \n     captivity, even losing his eyesight for a time.\n       Brown's memories also wind their way back to his childhood \n     in North Platte. His father, an engineer with Union Pacific \n     Railroad, was killed when a locomotive exploded in 1910.\n       The family lived a couple of blocks from William F. \n     ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody. Brown said his family became friends \n     with the former Wild West hero, whom he described as a quiet \n     man who liked to sit on their porch. As a child, Brown \n     recalled, he would sit on Cody's lap and run a hand through \n     his beard.\n       ``I don't know whether he liked that or not. Anyway, I kept \n     doing it.''\n       The family later moved to Council Bluffs, where Brown \n     attended high school. He went to Creighton University's \n     dental school.\n       He was quarterback of Creighton's football team and played \n     as a forward on the basketball team. He received a medallion \n     during the school's centennial celebration in 2005.\n       In the years after the war, Brown moved to Hollywood, where \n     he met a number of movie stars, including John Wayne. He said \n     he used to play handball with one of Wayne's sons.\n       Brown has retained his sense of humor and likes to throw a \n     sly wink in with many of his jokes. He kidded that, during \n     his trip to the East Coast, he had yet to find a girl to take \n     back to Illinois, where he now lives with his daughter.\n       ``I don't tell the girls I'm 102,'' he said, projecting his \n     age to the milestone he'll hit later this year.\n       What's left for Brown to do? He suggested to Hagel that \n     perhaps he could be a U.S. senator.\n       ``We should make you a senator, and maybe we'd get some \n     things done up here,'' Hagel replied.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4916-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING LANCE MACKEY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Lance \nMackey for being the first dog musher to win the Iditarod Sled Dog Race \nand the Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race--the world's two longest sled dog \nraces--in the same year. He won both races earlier this year.\n  For those who are not familiar with both races, this is an incredible \naccomplishment. To put his feat into perspective, Lance Mackey and his \ndogs traveled a total distance that is equal to traveling between \nBoston, MA and Salt Lake City, UT.\n  The Yukon Quest Sled Dog race is a 1,000-mile annual international \nsled dog race between Whitehorse, Canada, and Fairbanks, AK. The trail \nfollows a portion of the Yukon River and trails used by gold \nprospectors over 100 years ago. On February 20, 2007, in Fairbanks, he \ncompleted this sled dog race in a record time of 10 days, 2 hours, and \n37 minutes.\n  Only 12 days after winning the Yukon Quest, Lance and 13 of his 16 \ndogs that completed the Yukon Quest race started the Iditarod Sled Dog \nRace. This race starts in Willow, AK and ends in Nome, AK, and is 1,100 \nmiles long. The Iditarod trail originally started out as a supply route \nto numerous remote Alaska communities, including Nome. On March 13, \n2007, Lance Mackey and his team completed this race in 9 days, 5 hours \nand 8 minutes.\n  Both of these races travel through numerous small, rural Alaska \nvillages but most of the trails pass through nothing but pure \nwilderness. Lance and his fellow mushers had to race through blizzards, \ntemperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero, wind gusts up to 60 miles \nper hour, water overflows from partially frozen rivers and very rough \nterrain. Accidents due to terrain, trail conditions and other factors \nare not unusual. Occasionally, a moose will attack dog teams and \nmushers. Of course, these elements add additional challenges to these \nalready arduous races. In fact, 21 mushers ``scratched''--or withdrew--\nfrom the Iditarod this year.\n  As a throat cancer survivor, Lance has to always drink water after \neating since his salivary glands were removed during cancer treatment. \nHowever, Lance Mackey continued to pursue victory and almost entirely \nshunned food and drink for the last 219 miles of the Iditarod in order \nto save time. In addition to that, he suffered from frostbite as he \nmade his way to the finish line.\n  The conventional wisdom is that the same musher could not win both \nsled dog races in the same year. This year, Lance Mackey proved \neveryone wrong. We are proud of Lance and his dog team for this \nunprecedented achievement. Once again, I congratulate Lance Mackey and \nhis dog team and wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4916-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAYOR SHARON BRANSTITER\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the late Oregon Governor Tom McCall \nonce said, ``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. \nThey are individuals who say, `This is my community, and it is my \nresponsibility to make it better.' ''\n  I rise today with sadness because Oregon lost a true hero this past \nweekend with the passing of Sharon Branstiter, who had served as mayor \nof the wonderful community of Toledo since 1997. Few people have ever \ngiven more of their time, talents, and energy to make their community a \nbetter place than did Mayor Branstiter.\n  I consider myself very privileged to have called Sharon my friend. In \nmy job, there are many people who will tell me what they think I want \nto hear. I always knew that Sharon would tell me what I needed to hear. \nShe expressed her opinions with candor and eloquence, and she always \nmade it very clear that the top item on her agenda was making Toledo a \nbetter and more beautiful place in which to live, work, and raise a \nfamily.\n  The Greek poet Sophocles wrote, ``One must wait until the evening to \nsee how splendid the day has been.'' While the evening of Sharon's life \ncame much to soon, I hope that her family and friends will take solace \nin the fact that Sharon could look back on a life filled with love and \nlaughter, a life filled with accomplishment, and a life filled with \nmaking a positive difference and say that ``the day has indeed been \nsplendid.''\n  I will never visit Toledo without thinking of Sharon, and I am \nconfident that her work will live on through the good work of all those \nwho call Toledo home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4916-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4916-S4917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 625.

A bill to increase the number of Federal judgeships in \ncertain judicial districts with heavy caseloads of\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\ncriminal immigration cases; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat authorizes the Federal judgeships recommended by the 2007 Judicial \nConference for our U.S. District Courts that are overloaded with \nimmigration cases.\n  For a year, I have been telling the Senate about the crisis on our \nSouthwest border involving judges who are overwhelmed by the sheer \nnumber of immigration cases that are filed in their courts.\n  New caseload numbers have recently become available, and it is clear \nthat this problem is not going away--Congress must act to fix it. \nFederal Court Management Statistics available at www.uscourts.gov \nreveal that for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2006, four \nDistrict Courts each had more than one thousand criminal immigration \nfilings. Not surprisingly, all of these Districts share a border with \nMexico.\n  In fiscal year 2006, the Southern District of Texas had 3,679 \nimmigration cases, the Western District of Texas had 2,324 immigration \ncases, the District of New Mexico had 1,940 immigration cases, and the \nDistrict of Arizona had 1,924 immigration filings. In each of these \nDistricts, immigration filings make up more than forty-nine percent of \nall of the District's criminal filings. No other District Court \nrecommended for new judgeships had more than 314 immigration filings. \nIn fact, the four Districts mentioned above account for more than 60 \npercent of all immigration filings in fiscal year 2006.\n  The legislation I am introducing today authorizes the ten new Federal \njudgeships recommended by the Judicial Conference for these four U.S. \nDistricts, where immigration filings total more than forty-nine percent \nof all Federal criminal filings.\n  Based on these caseloads, we should already have given these \nDistricts new judgeships. But to increase border security and \nimmigration enforcement efforts, as we have over the past few years, \nwithout equipping these courts to handle the even larger immigration \ncaseloads that they will face as a result of immigration enforcement \nefforts would amount to willful negligence on the part of Congress.\n  It is imperative to equip our Federal agencies with the assets they \nneed to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws, including \nthe Federal District courts that try repeat immigration law violators \nwho are charged with Federal felonies.\n  The New Mexico District Chief Judge, Martha Vazquez, wrote me a \nletter in May of 2006 about the situation her District faces. Judge \nVazquez wrote:\n\n       As it is, the burden on Article III Judges in this District \n     is considerable. This District ranks first among all \n     districts in criminal filings per judgeship: 405 criminal \n     filings compared to the national average of 87. As in all \n     federal districts along the southwest border, the majority of \n     cases filed in this District relate to immigration offenses \n     under United States Code, Title 8 and drug offenses arising \n     under Title 21. Immigration and drug cases account for \n     eighty-five percent of the caseload in the District of New \n     Mexico. . . . In fiscal year 1997, there were 240 immigration \n     felony filings in the District of New Mexico. By fiscal year \n     2005, the number of immigration felony filings increased to \n     1,826, which is an increase of 661 percent.\n\n  The Albuquerque Tribune has also documented the burden on our \nSouthwest border District Courts. An April 17, 2006 article entitled \n``Judges See Ripple Effect of Policy on Immigration,'' stated:\n\n       U.S. District Chief Judge Martha Vazquez of Santa Fe \n     oversees a court that faces a rising caseload from illegal \n     border crossings and related crime. And help from Washington \n     is by no means certain. . . . From Sept. 30, 1999 to Sept. \n     30, 2004 (the end of the fiscal year), the caseload in the \n     New Mexico federal district court increased 57.5 percent, \n     from 2,804 to 4,416. In the 2004 fiscal year alone, 2,126 \n     felony cases were heard, almost half of all cases in the \n     entire 10th Circuit, which includes Colorado, Kansas, \n     Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Most typical immigration cases go \n     before an immigration judge, and the subjects are deported. \n     But people deported once and caught crossing illegally again \n     can be charged with a felony. And that brings the \n     defendant into federal district court. Those are the cases \n     driving up New Mexico's caseload . . . Some days as many \n     as 90 defendants crowd the courtroom in Las Cruces . . . \n     The same problems are afflicting federal border courts in \n     Arizona, California, and Texas.\n\n  Similar problems were documented in the May 23, 2006 Reuters article \n``Bush Border Patrol Plan to Pressure Courts'' which said:\n\n       President George W. Bush's plan to send thousands of \n     National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border could spark a \n     surge in immigration cases and U.S. courts are ill prepared \n     to handle them . . . Even without the stepped-up security at \n     the border, federal courts in southern California, Arizona, \n     New Mexico and Texas have been overburdened. Carelli [a \n     spokesman for U.S. federal courts] said those five judicial \n     districts, out of 94 nationwide, account for 34 percent of \n     all criminal cases moving through U.S. courts. . . Most \n     immigrants caught crossing illegally are ordered out of the \n     country without prosecution. But that still leaves a growing \n     pile of cases involving illegals who are being prosecuted \n     after being caught multiple times or those accused of other \n     crimes. . . Nationwide, each U.S. judge handles an average of \n     87 cases a year. But along the southern border, even before \n     Bush's plan moves forward, the average is around 300 per \n     judge, Carelli said.\n\n  I have also heard first-hand about this problem from Federal judges \nin New Mexico, including one who travels almost 200 miles to hear cases \nin Southern New Mexico. Many of the situations he sees involve mass \narraignments because there are so many defendants in the system. He is \nnot alone in this arrangement; other Federal judges drive almost 300 \nmiles to hear cases in the Southern part of my home State. This is a \ndire situation that must be addressed.\n  The United States Congress must address the overwhelming immigration \ncaseload our southwestern border U.S. District Courts face. The bill I \nam introducing today does that by authorizing the eight permanent and \ntwo temporary judgeships recommended by the 2007 Judicial Conference \nfor the four U.S. Districts in which the immigration caseloads total \nmore than forty-nine percent of those Districts' total criminal \ncaseload. I am proud to have Congressman Cuellar join me in this effort \nby introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Criminal Immigration \n     Courts Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on the recommendations made by the \n     2007 Judicial Conference and the statistical data provided by \n     the 2006 Federal Court Management Statistics (issued by the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts), the \n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal courts along the southwest border of the United \n     States have a greater percentage of their criminal caseload \n     affected by immigration cases than other Federal courts.\n       (2) The percentage of criminal immigration cases in most \n     southwest border district courts totals more than 49 percent \n     of the total criminal caseloads of those districts.\n       (3) The current number of judges authorized for those \n     courts is inadequate to handle the current caseload.\n       (4) Such an increase in the caseload of criminal \n     immigration filings requires a corresponding increase in the \n     number of Federal judgeships.\n       (5) The 2007 Judicial Conference recommended the addition \n     of judgeships to meet this growing burden.\n       (6) The Congress should authorize the additional district \n     court judges necessary to carry out the 2007 recommendations \n     of the Judicial Conference for district courts in which the \n     criminal immigration filings represented more than 49 percent \n     of all criminal filings for the 12-month period ending \n     September 30, 2006.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to increase the \n     number of Federal judgeships, in accordance with the \n     recommendations of the 2007 Judicial Conference, in district \n     courts that have an extraordinarily high criminal immigration \n     caseload.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGESHIPS.\n\n       (a) Permanent Judgeships.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate--\n       (A) 4 additional district judges for the district of \n     Arizona;\n       (B) 1 additional district judge for the district of New \n     Mexico;\n       (C) 2 additional district judges for the southern district \n     of Texas; and\n       (D) 1 additional district judge for the western district of \n     Texas.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--In order that the table \n     contained in section 133(a) of\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\n     title 28, United States Code, reflect the number of \n     additional judges authorized under paragraph (1), such table \n     is amended--\n       (A) by striking the item relating to Arizona and inserting \n     the following:\n\nArizona.............................................................16;\n\n       (B) by striking the item relating to New Mexico and \n     inserting the following:\n\nNew Mexico...........................................................7;\n\n       (C) by striking the item relating to Texas and inserting \n     the following:\n\n  Texas:\n    Northern.........................................................12\n    Southern.........................................................21\n    Eastern...........................................................7\n    Western.........................................................14.\n\n       (b) Temporary Judgeships.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint, by and with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate--\n       (A) 1 additional district judge for the district of \n     Arizona; and\n       (B) 1 additional district judge for the district of New \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Vacancy.--For each of the judicial districts named in \n     this subsection, the first vacancy arising on the district \n     court 10 years or more after a judge is first confirmed to \n     fill the temporary district judgeship created in that \n     district by this subsection shall not be filled.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1193. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to take into \ntrust 2 parcels of Federal land for the benefit of certain Indian \nPueblos in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Indian School Act. I want to thank Senator Bingaman, my \ncolleague from New Mexico, for joining me as a cosponsor of the bill \nagain this Congress.\n  The Albuquerque Indian School Act seeks to take two parcels of \nFederal land into trust for the 19 Pueblos--Acoma, Cochiti, Isleta, \nJemez, Laguna, Nambe, Ohkay Owingeh, Picuris, Pojoaque, San Felipe, San \nIldefonso, Sandia, Santa Ana, Santa Clara, Santo Domingo, Taos, \nTesuque, Zia and Zuni. I believe this property, if transferred, would \nreceive greater utilization and would benefit the 19 New Mexico \nPueblos.\n  In 1981, the New Mexico Pueblos petitioned the United States for the \ntransfer of approximately 44 acres from the Albuquerque Indian School \nsite for the purpose of economic development. In 1984, the Assistant \nSecretary of the Interior conveyed 44 acres to the Pueblos. This land \nis currently under development by the 19 New Mexico pueblos. In 2003, \nthe 19 Pueblos requested conveyance of the ``B'' and ``D'' tracts, \nwhich total approximately 18 acres, located near Interstate 40. This \nland contains various metal buildings which have deteriorated to the \npoint that they have little to no usable value at this time.\n  The return of these two properties to the 19 Pueblos is supported by \nthe southwestern regional office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. With \nthe addition of these two tracts, the 19 pueblos will be able to \ncontinue their successful economic development of the Albuquerque \nIndian School property. I believe the transfer will benefit the 19 New \nMexico Pueblos, and their individual tribal members.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with Senator \nSalazar a very important piece of legislation, ``The No Child Left \nBehind Reform Act.'' This legislation makes three basic changes to the \nNo Child Left Behind Act which was signed into law in January of 2002.\n  Five years ago I supported the No Child Left Behind Act because I \ncare about improving the quality of education in America for all of our \nchildren. I believed that this law would help to achieve that goal by \nestablishing rigorous measures of student achievement, by helping \nteachers do a better job of instructing students, and by providing the \nresources desperately needed by our schools for even the most basic \nnecessities to help put the reforms we passed into place.\n  Regrettably, the high hopes that I and many others had for this law \nhave not been realized. Throughout the years, this law has been \nimplemented by the administration in a manner that is inflexible, \nunreasonable and unhelpful. As a result, it has failed the teachers, \nthe schools, and, most importantly, the students it was meant to help.\n  Worse still, this administration's promise of sufficient resources to \nimplement the law is a promise that has yet to be kept. This year's \nbudget proposal underfunds No Child Left Behind by almost $15 billion. \nSince passage five years ago, the administration has underfunded the \nlaw by more than $70 billion below the level promised when the \nPresident signed the Act into law.\n  As a result of the failures of the current administration to fulfill \nits commitment to our Nation's school children under this law, children \nand their teachers are shouldering noteworthy hardships. Additional \nrequirements without additional funding, and little,\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\nif any, technical assistance from the Department, have left students, \nteachers, administrators and parents struggling to implement mandates \nthat are often confusing, inflexible, unrealistic and costly. With the \ndegree of underfunding that we have seen at the Federal level, many \ntaxpayers are simultaneously paying for their mortgage, basic health \ncare, the rising cost of their children's tuition and the Federal share \nof the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, resources without \nreforms are a waste of money. By the same token, reforms without \nresources are a false promise a false promise that has left students \nand their teachers grappling with new burdens and little help to bear \nthem.\n  The legislation I am introducing today proposes to make three changes \nto the No Child Left Behind Act. These changes will ease current \nburdens on our students, our teachers and our administrators without \ndismantling the fundamental underpinnings of the law.\n  First, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to be \ngiven credit for performing well on measures other than test scores \nwhen calculating student achievement. Test scores are an important \nmeasure of student knowledge. However, they are not the only measure. \nThere are others. These include dropout rates, the number of students \nwho participate in advanced placement courses, and individual student \nimprovement over time. Unfortunately, current law does not allow \nschools to use these additional ways to gauge school success in a \nconstructive manner. Additional measures can only be used to further \nindicate how a school is failing, not how a school is succeeding. This \nlegislation will allow schools to earn credit for succeeding.\n  Second, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act will allow schools to \ntarget school choice and supplemental services to the students that \nactually demonstrate a need for them. As the current law is being \nimplemented by the Administration, if a school is in need of \nimprovement, it is expected to offer school choice and supplemental \nservices to all students--even if not all students have demonstrated a \nneed for them. That strikes me as a wasteful and imprecise way to help \na school improve student performance. For that reason, this legislation \nwill allow schools to target resources to the students that actually \ndemonstrate that they need them. Clearly, this is the most efficient \nway to maximize their effect.\n  Finally, the No Child Left Behind Reform Act introduces a greater \ndegree of reasonableness to the teacher certification process. As it is \nbeing implemented, the law requires teachers to be ``highly qualified'' \nto teach every subject that they teach. Certainly none of us disagree \nwith this policy as a matter of principle. But as a matter of practice, \nit is causing confusion and hardship for teachers, particularly \nsecondary teachers and teachers in small school districts. For example, \nas the law is being implemented by the Administration, a high school \nscience teacher could be required to hold degrees in biology, physics \nand chemistry to be considered highly qualified. In small schools where \nthere may be only one 7th or 8th grade teacher teaching all subjects, \nthese teachers could similarly be required to hold degrees in every \nsubject area. Such requirements are unreasonable at a time when \nexcellent teachers are increasingly hard to find. The legislation I \nintroduce today will allow States to create a single assessment to \ncover multiple subjects for middle grade level teachers and allow \nstates to issue a broad certification for science and social studies.\n  In my view, the changes I propose will provide significant assistance \nto schools struggling to comply with the No Child Left Behind law all \nacross America. As time marches on and more deadlines set by this law \ncome and go including additional testing, a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom and 100 percent proficiency for all students--we have a \nresponsibility to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act in a manner \nthat will require it to be implemented in a fair and reasonable manner. \nI would caution that in doing so, however, we must also preserve the \nbasic tenets of the law--providing a high quality education for all \nAmerican students and closing the achievement gap across demographic \nand socioeconomic lines. Again, no child should left behind--no special \neducation student, no English language learning student, no minority \nstudent and no low-income student. I stand by this commitment.\n  Obviously, funding this law is beyond the scope of this bill. I would \nnote, however, that I will continue my efforts to direct increased \nfunds to the law. Clearly, our children deserve the resources needed to \nmake their dreams for a better education a reality. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important reform legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nthe deduction for depreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Smith and I are introducing \nthe ``Tax Depreciation, Modernization, and Simplification Act of \n2007.'' This legislation will update our depreciation system so that it \ncan keep pace with new technology.\n  Last July the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Long-Term Growth and \nDebt Reduction, on which Senator Smith was Chairman and I served as \nRanking Member, held a hearing on updating our depreciation system. \nDuring the hearing, we heard that the current depreciation system is \nout of date and that changes should be made.\n  Our tax system allows, as a current expense, a depreciation deduction \nthat represents a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and \ntear of property used, or of property held for the production of \nincome. Since 1981, the depreciation deduction for most tangible \nproperty has been under rules specified in section 168 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS, \nspecified under section 168 applies to most new investment in tangible \nproperty. MACRS depreciation allowances are computed by determining a \nrecovery period called a ``class life'' and an applicable recovery \nmethod for each asset.\n  The current depreciation system has not kept pace with technological \nadvances. Several industries were not even contemplated when class \nlives were assigned in 1981, and some class lives even date back to \n1962.\n  In the 1980's it would have been difficult to imagine what our \nreliance on computer and wireless technology would be today. At that \ntime, the wireless industry was in its infancy, and there was no \nspecifically assigned life for wireless equipment. As a result, today's \ndepreciation system is like playing ``audit roulette.'' There is no \ncertainty in how these assets should be depreciated.\n  All this matters because it impacts investment, innovation, \ncompetitiveness, and ultimately the quality and quantity of jobs in \nAmerica. My home state of Massachusetts is a leader in the high tech \nindustry. Massachusetts employs hundreds of thousands of skilled \nworkers in key technology sectors, including computer hardware, life \nsciences, software, medical products, semiconductor, defense technology \nand telecommunications. We have learned in Massachusetts that a \nstrategic tax policy can have a positive effect on economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  For these reasons, we are reintroducing the ``Tax Depreciation, \nModernization, and Simplification Act of 2007.'' This legislation makes \nfour important changes to the current depreciation system.\n  First, the legislation creates a process that provides the Department \nof Treasury with the authority to modernize class lives. The Secretary \nof the Treasury will prescribe regulations to provide a new class life \nfor certain eligible property. Eligible property does not include \nresidential rental property, nonresidential real property, or property \nfor which Congress has specifically legislated the recovery period.\n  The purpose of this provision is to provide Treasury with a mechanism \nto modify class lives that reasonably reflect the anticipated useful \nlife and the anticipated decline in value over time of the property to \nthe industry, and take into account when the property becomes \ntechnologically or functionally obsolete to perform its original \npurpose. Treasury will also have the authority to modify class lives in \norder to more accurately reflect economic depreciation. For example, a \npersonal computer has a depreciable life of five years, but it has an \neconomic life of only 2 to 3 years. Even though a computer can be used \nfor five years, it becomes economically obsolete after a couple of \nyears because of the newer, faster, and more advanced computers on the \nmarket.\n\n  Our depreciation system has not been adequately updated since \nCongress revoked Treasury's rule making authority in 1988. When the \nMACRS system was enacted in 1986, Congress directed Treasury to \nestablish an office to monitor and analyze the actual experience with \nclass lives and to modify class lives if the new class life reasonably \nreflected the anticipated useful life and the anticipated decline in \nvalue over time of the property to the industry. The authority was then \nrevoked because Congress did not agree with all of the decisions made \nby Treasury.\n  The authority provided in this legislation addresses this previous \nproblem by requiring Treasury to consult with Congress 60 days prior to \npublishing any proposed regulations. In addition, the Congressional \nReview Act would apply to any regulation proposed by Treasury and each \nclass life prescribed by Treasury would be considered a separate rule.\n  Providing Treasury with the authority to modify class lives would \nallow the process to move more efficiently than allowing Congress to \nmake piecemeal changes to the current depreciation system. Congress \nwould provide guidelines, and Treasury would have the role of \nadministering those guidelines. Under the legislation, Treasury would \nmonitor and analyze the actual experience of depreciable assets and \nreport their findings to Congress. We expect Treasury to establish \nguidelines that will take into consideration the fact that some assets \nlose a significant percentage of their original value in\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nthe early part of their lives. This legislation specifically provides \nconsultation with Congress in order for Congress to continue to have a \nrole in this important tax policy issue.\n  We do not expect Treasury within the first year or two to review all \nclasses of assets. Rather, we expect Treasury to begin with new assets \nthat do no fit into the system, assets that have undergone \ntechnological advances, and existing assets that do not really fit into \nthe current system. For example, the current system creates an \nirrational result for fiber optic lines. The class life of a fiber \noptic line depends upon whether it is used for one-way or two-way \ncommunications.\n  Second, the legislation would eliminate the mid-quarter convention. \nThe placed-in-service conventions determine the point in time during \nthe year that the property is considered ``placed in service'' and this \ndetermines when depreciation for an asset begins or ends. Under current \nlaw, there are the half-year, mid-month, and mid-quarter conventions. \nThe mid-quarter convention is a source of complexity because it \nrequires an analysis of the depreciable basis of property placed in \nservice during the last three months of any taxable year. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation recommended the elimination of the mid-quarter \nconvention in its 2001 recommendations on simplifying the Federal tax \nsystem. The calculation of the mid-quarter convention is burdensome, \nand it requires taxpayers to wait until after the end of the taxable \nyear to determine whether the proper placed-in-service convention was \nused to calculate depreciation for assets during the taxable year.\n  Third, the legislation would allow taxpayers to elect to use mass \nasset accounting for assets with a cost of less than $10,000. \nGenerally, taxpayers calculate depreciation on an item-by-item basis. \nThe bill would allow taxpayers to elect to use mass asset accounting \nfor all assets with the same recovery period. This provision will help \nsimplify the recordkeeping associated with depreciation.\n  Fourth, the legislation would permanently extend increased expensing \nfor small businesses. In lieu of depreciation, a taxpayer with a small \namount of annual investment may elect to deduct such costs. The Jobs \nand Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased the amount a \ntaxpayer may deduct from $25,000 to $100,000 and increased the total \namount of investment a business can make in a year and still qualify \nfor expensing from $200,000 to $400,000. In addition, the Act allows \noff-the-shelf computer software to be eligible for the provision.\n  The Tax Depreciation, Modernization, and Simplification Act of 2007 \nwould make the $100,000 and $400,000 amounts permanent and index them \nfor inflation. Off-the-shelf computer software would be eligible for \nthe provision. Increased expensing for small businesses helps lower the \ncost of capital for mall businesses and eliminates complicated \nrecordkeeping. In addition, it should reduce administrative costs for \nsmall businesses.\n  The four components of this legislation will result in updating and \nsimplifying the current depreciation system. The Tax Depreciation, \nModernization, and Simplification Act of 2007 will provide certainty \nfor taxpayers and put an end to ``audit roulette.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1199. A bill to strengthen the capacity of eligible institutions \nto provide instruction in nanotechnology; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Wyden to \nintroduce the Nanotechnology in the Schools Act.\n  Nanotechnology will revolutionize manufacturing, energy, healthcare, \nnational defense and many other sectors by improving the way things are \ndesigned and made. The potential benefits of nanotechnology are \ntremendous, especially for the nation that leads the world in \nnanotechnology research and development. Studies project that by 2014 \nnanotechnology will be incorporated into more than $2 trillion worth of \nmanufactured goods. China, Japan, the European Union, India and other \nnations are fighting for global leadership, and the competition is \ngetting stiffer all the time.\n  For the United States to maintain and expand its leadership in the \nfield of nanotechnology, we must train and educate more scientists and \nengineers who are capable of conducting research and development in \nthis emerging technology. To reach this objective, students need to be \ntaught the necessary skills beginning at the high school and college \nlevels.\n  According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on \ntemporary visas earned approximately one-third of all science and \nengineering doctorates awarded in the United States. By providing high \nschool and college students with the tools to learn nanotechnology, a \nhigher number of American students will enter this crucial field.\n  The Nanotechnology in the Schools Act provides grants to American \ncolleges and high-performing high schools to purchase the tools that \nwill enable their students to learn nano-tech-nology. The Act also \nprovides training for teachers and professors to use these tools in the \nclassroom and the laboratory. The Nanotechnology in the Schools Act is \nan investment in America's greatest asset, its students, and a key \nelement of the nation's strategy to maintain nanotechnology leadership \nworldwide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nanotechnology in the \n     Schools Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is \n     generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that \n     will benefit society by improving the way many things are \n     designed and made.\n       (2) Nanotechnology is likely to have a significant, \n     positive impact on the security, economic well-being, and \n     health of Americans as fields related to nanotechnology \n     expand.\n       (3) In order to maximize the benefits of nanotechnology to \n     individuals in the United States, the United States must \n     maintain world leadership in the field of nanotechnology, \n     including nanoscience and microtechnology, in the face of \n     determined competition from other nations.\n       (4) According to the National Science Foundation, foreign \n     students on temporary visas earned 32 percent of all science \n     and engineering doctorates awarded in the United States in \n     2003, the last year for which data is available. Foreign \n     students earned 55 percent of the engineering doctorates. \n     Many of these students expressed an intent to return to their \n     country of origin after completing their study.\n       (5) To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the \n     United States must make a long-term investment in educating \n     United States students in secondary schools and institutions \n     of higher education, so that the students are able to conduct \n     nanoscience research and develop and commercialize \n     nanotechnology applications.\n       (6) Preparing United States students for careers in \n     nanotechnology, including nanoscience, requires that the \n     students have access to the necessary scientific tools, \n     including scanning electron microscopes designed for \n     teaching, and requires training to enable teachers and \n     professors to use those tools in the classroom and the \n     laboratory.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to strengthen the \n     capacity of United States secondary schools and institutions \n     of higher education to prepare students for careers in \n     nanotechnology by providing grants to those schools and \n     institutions to provide the tools necessary for such \n     preparation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend the Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor several times \nlast year, and have already again this year in the 110th Congress, to \ntalk about the need for Congress to pass legislation to reauthorize the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  Legislation to amend and reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act has been considered by the 106th, 107th, 108th and \n109th Congresses, and today, my colleagues and I put forward a new \nversion of the bill in the 110th Congress.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 builds on \nthe work of prior Congresses, work done not only by the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, but also by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nand Finance Committees. These committees gave us their recommendations \non provisions in the legislation which are within their jurisdiction. I \nthank my colleagues for their collaboration on the Indian health \nreauthorization.\n  I have added new provisions to this year's Indian health bill that \nseek to address the lack of access to health care services that exists \nin so many tribal communities, which may be due to limited hours of \noperation at existing health care facilities or other factors. The bill \nwould allow grants for demonstration projects which include a \nconvenient care services program as an additional means of health care \ndelivery.\n  This bill also addresses an issue that has been of particular concern \nto me: Indian youth suicide. The bill would authorize additional \nresources for Indian communities to confront this issue and seek to \nprevent, intervene in and treat Native American youth who have lost \nhope and are contemplating or have attempted suicide.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined me in introducing this bill. It \nis my highest priority as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  I wish to note that title II of this bill sets forth amendments to \nthe Social Security Act, addressing payments under Medicare, Medicaid \nand SCHIP and other provisions which are in the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee. The Indian Affairs and Finance Committees \nworked very closely together during last year's session on the \nprovisions that are contained in this bill. I appreciate the efforts of \nboth Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley in drafting these \nimportant provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nAmendments of 2007, and I look forward to their committee's approval of \nthese provisions as the Indian Affairs Committee considers the \nprovisions under our jurisdiction.\n  Eight years is too long to wait to reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. I intend to move aggressively to seek approval of this \nlegislation by the Indian Affairs Committee, and to bring this bill to \nthe Senate floor so that all my colleagues will have an opportunity to \naddress the very fundamental need for--and right of--American Indians \nand Alaska Natives to adequate and innovative health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today regarding the introduction of \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. This \nlegislation will reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and \nprovide essential improvements to the Indian health system.\n  These improvements are needed to raise the health status of Indian \ncommunities where the mortality and disease rates are far greater than \nthe national averages. For example, on the Wind River Indian \nReservation in Wyoming, the average age at death is 49, according to \nrecent data from the Indian Health Service.\n  The reauthorization has been an on-going effort since 1999 and \nsignificant progress has been made particularly in the last two \nCongresses. The bill being introduced today incorporates provisions \nthat the Committee has developed in the course of the previous two \nCongresses.\n  Even though there may be remaining issues on certain provisions, the \nintroduction of this very important bill will facilitate the process of \nresolving those issues. I look forward to continuing work on those \nissues and advancing a bill that is effective in addressing the health \ncare needs of Indian people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Chairman Dorgan and me in these \nefforts to improve the lives of Indian people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 1201. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from \nelectric powerplants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Power \nAct of 2007. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record. This legislation is modeled after legislation \nspearheaded by my predecessor and ardent protector of the environment \nand the public health, Senator Jim Jeffords. I am proud to sit on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that was under his leadership \nfor a time, and I am also honored to be a member of another Committee \nof significant importance, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  The Clean Power Act of 2007 gets to a problem on the minds of those \nin the northeast, who suffer insults to their health and their \nenvironment in the form of dirty air and polluted lakes, as well as \nthose all across the country who want to see power plants shape up \ntheir act. This legislation will help clean the air and reduce global \nwarming pollution by dramatically reducing the four major pollutants \nemitted by power plants--carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur \ndioxide, and mercury.\n  Congress must work toward an economy-wide approach to addressing \nglobal warming, along the lines of the legislation I introduced with \nSenator Boxer and others: S. 309, the Global Warming Pollution \nReduction Act. However, power plants should begin reducing their \ngreenhouse gas emissions now, at the same time they are reducing \nemissions of other air pollutants. The Clean Power Act of 2007 would \nset this process in motion by using a cap and trade approach for \nreducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emissions. \nAdditionally, the legislation makes specific linkages to an economy-\nwide reduction of pollutants responsible for global warming by \nspecifying that if Congress has not passed, and the President has not \nsigned, legislation affecting at least 85 percent of manmade sources of \nglobal warming pollutants by 2012, that the emissions from power plants \nmust be decreased each year by 3 percent until atmospheric \nconcentrations of global warming pollutants are stabilized at 450 parts \nper million carbon dioxide equivalent. So, while I am putting forward \nthis power plant only bill today, let it be clear that I remain firm in \nmy belief that we must tackle the problem of global warming in a way \nthat will actually make a difference to the future of the planet.\n  I am happy to be joined in introducing this legislation by Senator \nLieberman, Senator Leahy, and Senator Feingold. Additionally, I am glad \nto have the support of many national organizations, including the Clean \nAir Task Force, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense, \nNational Environmental Trust, the American Lung Association, Natural \nResources Defense Council, and U.S. PIRG.\n  As we move forward to address global warming and to protect current \nand future generations, dealing with power plant emissions is a good \nstart. I look forward to gaining the support of my colleagues on this \nimportant legislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

KOMEN FOR THE CURE ON ITS \n LEADERSHIP IN THE BREAST CANCER MOVEMENT ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 25TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 169\n\n       Whereas, Nancy G. Brinker promised her dying sister, Susan \n     G. Komen, that she would do everything in her power to end \n     breast cancer;\n       Whereas, in Dallas, Texas, in 1982, that promise became \n     Susan G. Komen for the Cure and launched the global breast \n     cancer movement;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has grown to become \n     the world's largest grassroots network of breast cancer \n     survivors and activists fighting to save lives, empower \n     people, ensure quality care for all, and energize science to \n     find the cure;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has invested nearly \n     $1,000,000,000 to fulfill its promise, becoming the largest \n     source of nonprofit funds in the world dedicated to curing \n     breast cancer;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure is committed to \n     investing an additional $1,000,000,000 over the next decade \n     in breast health care and treatment and in research to \n     discover the causes of breast cancer and, ultimately, its \n     cure;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure serves the breast \n     health and treatment needs of millions, especially under-\n     served women, through education and support to thousands of \n     community health organizations, with grants to date of more \n     than $480,000,000;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has played a critical \n     role in virtually every major advance in breast cancer \n     research over the past 25 years, with research investments to \n     date of more than $300,000,000;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has advocated for more \n     research on breast cancer treatment and prevention, with the \n     Federal Government now devoting more than $900,000,000 each \n     year to breast cancer research, compared with $30,000,000 in \n     1982;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure is a leader in the \n     global breast cancer movement, with more than 100,000 \n     activists in 125 cities and communities, mobilizing more than \n     1,000,000 people every year through events like the Komen \n     Race for the Cure Series - the world's largest and most \n     successful awareness and fundraising event for breast cancer;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has been a strong \n     supporter of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \n     Detection Program and the Mammography Quality Standards Act;\n       Whereas, in the last 25 years early detection and testing \n     rates have increased, with nearly 75 percent of women over 40 \n     years of age now receiving regular mammograms, compared with \n     30 percent of such women in 1982;\n       Whereas, in the last 25 years, the 5 year breast cancer \n     survival rate has increased to 98 percent when the cancer is \n     caught before it spreads beyond the breast, compared with 74 \n     percent in 1982;\n       Whereas, without better prevention and a cure, 1 in 8 women \n     in the United States will continue to suffer from breast \n     cancer - a devastating disease with physical, emotional, \n     psychological, and financial pain that can last a lifetime;\n       Whereas, without a cure, an estimated 5,000,000 Americans \n     will be diagnosed with breast cancer - and more than \n     1,000,000 could die - over the next 25 years;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure is challenging \n     individuals, communities, States, and Congress to make breast \n     cancer an urgent priority;\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure recognizes that in the \n     world of breast cancer, the big questions are still without \n     answers: what causes the disease and how it can be prevented; \n     and\n       Whereas, Susan G. Komen for the Cure is marking its 25th \n     anniversary by recommitting to finish what it started and end \n     breast cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Susan G.

Mr. President, I am proud to be submitting a resolution \ndesignating May 1, 2007, as National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. On \nthis day, child care providers and other early childhood professionals \nnationwide conduct public awareness and education efforts highlighting \nthe importance of good early childhood education for our Nation's young \nchildren. This resolution is an effort to support these initiatives and \nto help develop greater public awareness to our early educators and the \ncritical work they do.\n  Every day, nearly 63 percent of children under the age of 5 are cared \nfor outside their home so their parents can work. Early care and \neducation workers, who number more than 2.3 million, make it possible \nfor millions of parents to leave their children at day care and go to \nwork. By enabling parents to go to work every day, our early education \nworkers add more than $580 billion to our economy nationwide.\n  The importance of early education cannot be overstated. From the day \nthey are born, children begin to learn, and the quality of care they \nreceive will affect their language development, math skills, behavior, \nand general readiness for school. Our early educators help future \nleaders and workers of our Nation develop their social, emotional, \nphysical and cognitive skills so they can be ready for school.\n  However, the committed individuals who nurture and teach these young \nchildren continue to be undervalued, with grossly low wages and lack of \nbenefits. It is outrageous that the average salary of our early \neducation staff is just a little over $18,000 per year, that only one-\nthird has health insurance and even fewer have pension plans.\n  Early childhood educators perform essential work by supporting the \ndevelopment of our Nation's children. Yet poor wages and benefits have \nmade it difficult to attract and retain high-quality early childhood \ncare takers and educators, and one-third of all early childhood \neducators leave their jobs every year. This is not only unfair to our \nchild care workers, but it undermines the quality of care that our \nchildren receive.\n  Our early educators deserve nothing less than to be recognized and \nadequately compensated for the work they do. We must give our Nation's \nearly childcare workers wages worthy of the incredible work they do \nevery day to train and develop the future workforce of America.\n  The Nation's childcare workforce, and the families who depend on \nthem, deserve our support, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S4980-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4980-S4981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 913.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The national debt of the United States of America now \n     exceeds $8,500,000,000,000.\n       (2) Each United States citizen's share of this debt exceeds \n     $29,000.\n       (3) Every cent that the United States Government borrows \n     and adds to this debt is money stolen from future generations \n     of Americans and from important programs, including Social \n     Security and Medicare on which our senior citizens depend for \n     their retirement security.\n       (4) The power of the purse belongs to Congress.\n       (5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal \n     discretionary spending and creates new mandatory spending \n     programs.\n       (6) For too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and \n     more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want \n     Congress to live within its means, using the same set of \n     common sense rules and restraints Americans face everyday; \n     because in the real world, families cannot follow Congress's \n     example and must make difficult decisions and set priorities \n     on how to spend their limited financial resources.\n       (7) Last year, the interest costs of the Federal debt the \n     government must pay to those who buy U.S. Treasury bonds were \n     about 8 percent of the total Federal budget. In total, the \n     Federal government spent $226 billion on interest costs alone \n     last year.\n       (8) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     interest costs will consume 25 percent of the entire Federal \n     budget by 2035. By way of comparison, the Department of \n     Education's share of Federal spending in 2005 was \n     approximately 3 percent of all Federal spending. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services was responsible for \n     approximately 23 percent of all Federal spending. Spending by \n     the Social Security Administration was responsible for about \n     20 percent of all Federal spending. Spending on Medicare was \n     about 12 percent of all Federal spending. Spending in 2005 by \n     the Department of Defense--in the midst of two wars in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan and a global war against terrorism--comprised \n     about 19 percent of all Federal spending. Thus, if we do not \n     change our current spending habits, GAO estimates that as a \n     percentage of Federal spending, interest costs in 2035 will \n     be larger than defense costs today, Social Security costs \n     today, Medicare costs today, and education costs today.\n       (9) The Federal debt undermines United States \n     competitiveness by consuming capital that would otherwise be \n     available for private enterprise and innovation.\n       (10) It is irresponsible for Congress to create or expand \n     government programs that will result in borrowing from Social \n     Security, Medicare, foreign nations, or future generations of \n     Americans without reductions in spending elsewhere within the \n     Federal budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of \n     new Government programs and initiatives.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 918.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH \n                   AND CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has the most fair, most transparent, \n     and most efficient capital markets in the world, in part due \n     to its strong securities statutory and regulatory scheme;\n       (2) it is of paramount importance for the continued growth \n     of our Nation's economy, that our capital markets retain \n     their leading position in the world;\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n       (3) small businesses are vital participants in United \n     States capital markets, and play a critical role in future \n     economic growth and high-wage job creation;\n       (4) section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has \n     greatly enhanced the quality of corporate governance and \n     financial reporting for public companies and increased \n     investor confidence;\n       (5) the Securities and Exchange Commission (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Commission'') and the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board (in this section referred to as \n     the ``PCAOB'') have both determined that the current auditing \n     standard implementing section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n     of 2002 has imposed unnecessary and unintended cost burdens \n     on small and mid-sized public companies;\n       (6) the Commission and PCAOB are now near completion of a \n     2-year process intended to revise the standard in order to \n     provide more efficient and effective regulation; and\n       (7) the chairman of the Commission recently has said, with \n     respect to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, \n     that, ``We don't need to change the law, we need to change \n     the way the law is implemented. It is the implementation of \n     the law that has caused the excessive burden, not the law \n     itself. That's an important distinction.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States capital markets are losing their \n     competitive edge in the face of intensifying global \n     competition, posing a risk to economic growth, a problem that \n     is well-documented in initial public offerings (IPO), over-\n     the-counter (OTC) derivatives, securitization, and \n     traditional lending;\n       (2) according to the Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mayor \n     Michael R. Bloomberg report, entitled ``Sustaining New York's \n     and the US's Global Financial Services Leadership'', ``In \n     looking at several of the critical contested investment \n     banking and sales and trading markets--initial public \n     offerings (IPOs), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and \n     debt--it is clear that the declining position of the US goes \n     beyond this natural market evolution to more controllable, \n     intrinsic issues of US competitiveness. As market \n     effectiveness, liquidity and safety become more prevalent in \n     the world's financial markets, the competitive arena for \n     financial services is shifting toward a new set of factors--\n     like availability of skilled people and a balanced and \n     effective legal and regulatory environment--where the US is \n     moving in the wrong direction.'';\n       (3) further, the report referred to in paragraph (2) stated \n     that--\n       (A) ``The IPO market also offers the most dramatic \n     illustration of the change in capital-raising needs around \n     the world, and US exchanges are rapidly losing ground to \n     foreign rivals. When looking at all IPOs that took place \n     globally in 2006, the share of IPO volume attracted by US \n     exchanges is barely one-third of that captured in 2001. By \n     contrast, the global share of IPO volume captured by European \n     exchanges has expanded by more than 30 percent over the same \n     period, while non-Japan Asian markets have doubled their \n     equivalent market share since 2001. When one considers mega-\n     IPOs - those over $1 billion - US exchanges attracted 57 \n     percent of such transactions in 2001, compared with just 16 \n     percent during the first ten months of 2006.''; and\n       (B) ``London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast-\n     growing and innovative over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives \n     market. This is significant because of the trading flow that \n     surrounds derivatives markets and because of the innovation \n     these markets drive, both of which are key competitive \n     factors for financial centers. Dealers and investors \n     increasingly see derivatives and cash markets as \n     interchangeable and are therefore combining trading \n     operations for both products.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\n     Indeed, the derivatives markets can be more liquid than the \n     underlying cash markets. Therefore, as London takes the \n     global lead in derivatives, America's competitiveness in both \n     cash and derivatives flow trading is at risk, as is its \n     position as a center for financial innovation.'';\n       (4) on March 13, 2007, the Department of the Treasury \n     convened a conference on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness, where--\n       (A) key policymakers, consumer advocates, members of the \n     international community, business representatives, and \n     academic experts, each with different perspectives, discussed \n     ways to keep United States capital markets the strongest and \n     most innovative in the world; and\n       (B) conference delegates examined the impact of the United \n     States regulatory structure and philosophy, the legal and \n     corporate governance environment, and the auditing profession \n     and financial reporting on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness;\n       (5) the foundation of any competitive capital market is \n     investor confidence, and since1930, the United States has \n     required some of the most extensive financial disclosures, \n     supported by one of the most robust enforcement regimes in \n     the world;\n       (6) a balanced regulatory system is essential to protecting \n     investors and the efficient functioning of capital markets; \n     and\n       (7) too much regulation stifles entrepreneurship, \n     competition, and innovation, and too little regulation \n     creates excessive risk to industry, investors, and the \n     overall system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, \n     and other stakeholders should take the necessary steps to \n     reclaim the preeminent position of the United States in the \n     global financial services marketplace;\n       (2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies \n     should, to the maximum extent possible, coordinate activities \n     on significant policy matters, so as not to impose \n     regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on \n     innovativeness with respect to financial products, \n     instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \n     that are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same \n     time, ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the \n     United States capital markets continues to promote and \n     protect the interests of investors in those markets; and\n       (3) given the complexity of the financial services \n     marketplace today, Congress should exercise vigorous \n     oversight over Federal regulatory and statutory requirements \n     affecting the financial services industry and consumers, with \n     the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic \n     implementation of existing laws and regulations, while \n     ensuring that necessary investor protections are not \n     compromised.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 957.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nsay to him, it is always nice to serve with him in the Senate but \nespecially this week because this week the Senate, as anyone can see, \nis debating perhaps the two greatest issues facing our country. One is \na way forward in Iraq, about which we have profound disagreements; two \nis, how do we keep our jobs in a competitive world, how do we keep our \nbrainpower advantage so we can continue this remarkable situation we \nfind ourselves in where our country produces about 30 percent of all \nthe money in the world, gross domestic product, for about 5 percent of \nthe people?\n  I believe the election last November was as much about the conduct of \nbusiness in Washington, DC, as it was about the conduct of the war in \nIraq. I think most people--and I have said this many times--most people \nwant to see us acting like grownups dealing with big issues. They know \nthat while we have our principles and we have our politics, there are \nsome issues before us that are simply too big for one political party \nto solve. We have not reached the point on Iraq where we can do that. I \nam hopeful we can. We need a political settlement here as much as Iraq \nneeds one there. But we have reached--or we are close to reaching--a \npolitical settlement on the other great issue we are debating this \nweek; that is, competitiveness. This is a great big issue. This is of \nconcern to Tennesseans in every county where I go. This is the feeling \ndown deep in your gut or in your heart while sitting around the table \nat night: Am I going to have a job? As the Presiding Officer has spoken \neloquently to this, we come at this from many different ways, but we \nsee that our country now is in a very fortunate position that we can't \ntake for granted.\n  I was trying to think of an appropriate analogy today, and I was \nthinking of the University of Tennessee women's basketball team. I \nheard some nice compliments paid to the Wisconsin teams today. I think \nPat Summitt and the University of Tennessee women's basketball team \nhave won seven national championships, including the one this year.\n  There was a time 20 years ago when the University of Tennessee \nwomen's basketball team coached by Pat Summitt played any team in the \nSoutheastern Conference and it wasn't even close. Everybody knew the \nLady Volunteers--the Lady Vols--were so good, so strong, so far ahead \nthat they were going to win. Now they still win, but they really have \nto work to win because there are a lot of great teams in the \nSoutheastern Conference. In fact, there are a lot of great teams around \nthe country, and that is the way as we look in the world in which we \nlive today.\n  We cannot take for granted 1 year longer that our children and our \ngrandchildren will enjoy this remarkable standard of living we have. \nThere are a number of steps we need to take to deal with that.\n  The step we are talking about this week with a reasonable degree of \nconsensus is keeping our brainpower advantage. Why do we say brainpower \nadvantage? Because that is one way we gained our wealth as a country. \nIn fact, many of the studies show that at least half and maybe a good \ndeal more of the growth in the wealth of families, the family incomes \nin America since World War II, has come from technological advances. \nThat is going back a long ways. That is from Thomas Edison's \ninventions. That is from Henry Ford's inventions, Walter Chrysler's \ninventions, and more recently the Google invention. Wherever those \ninventions come, the jobs grow.\n  I learned a long time ago that as important as it is for Governors, \nfor example, to recruit jobs, it is more important to grow jobs. We \nwere feeling pretty good down in Tennessee 25 years ago when Saturn \ncame from General Motors and Nissan came to Tennessee. I added it all \nup, and that was 10,000 or 12,000 jobs. Then the suppliers came, and \nthat was a lot more jobs.\n  But in Tennessee, as in most places in America, we lose jobs every \nyear. The numbers are a little elusive. But in a State such as \nTennessee where 2.5 million people work, maybe we lose 10 percent of \nour jobs every year. They just disappear. Companies go out of business. \nBut that must mean we must create about that many new jobs every year. \nSo the strong economies, the economies that are growing--the United \nStates being the prime example--are the economies which create the best \nenvironment for the growth of the largest number of good new jobs. That \nis what a progrowth policy is.\n  We Republicans, we on this side of the aisle, are saying progrowth--\nyes, that means low taxes. I agree. I vote for low taxes. When I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, we had low taxes. I believe we had the lowest \ntaxes per capita in the country. That wasn't enough. We were the third \npoorest State, and we had low taxes. The problem was we had a lot of \nother rules and regulations and impediments and impairments that kept \nus from raising our family incomes. For example, we had a usury limit \nof 10 percent. We had very restrictive banking laws. On the good side, \nwe had a right-to-work law. That helped us. There were a number of \nthings that created a more competitive environment. On the negative \nside, we had a bad road system. Now we have one of the best four-lane \nhighway systems in America.\n  As we worked through the goal of how do we in our State of Tennessee \ngo\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\nfrom being the third poorest State to what we became--the fastest \ngrowing State in family incomes--we went through all those other issues \nand finally centered on better schools, better colleges, better \nuniversities, more brainpower, because if you went to work at the \nSaturn plant, you had to know statistics, you had to know other forms \nof math, you had to speak English well and work as part of a team. \nThere really weren't any blue-collar jobs left in the auto industry; \nthey were high-tech jobs, and you had to be well trained to be there.\n  As we have said to each other--and we all believe this, almost every \none of us--our children have to know more than we did. Standards are \nhigher and higher and higher because as some jobs leave our country, if \nwe want to create more good new jobs, we are going to have to be smart \nenough to create them, smart enough to work at them, and smart enough \nto keep them. That is what the brainpower advantage is.\n  We have had that advantage. We have had the greatest K-12 system in \nthe world here for a long time. It has some problems now, but it has \nbeen a remarkable system for our country. There is no doubt we have the \nfinest system of colleges and universities in the world. More than half \na million students around the world come here.\n  The former President of Brazil, Cardoso, was visiting with a group of \nSenators a couple of years ago, and someone asked him: What will you \ntake back to Brazil, Mr. President? He taught at the Library of \nCongress and in other places in the world. He is an academic. He said: \nThe American university.\n  No one in the world has a system like the American universities. That \nis why we have people lining up in India and China and everywhere else \nto come to our schools.\n  Then we have these remarkable National Laboratories, such as the Oak \nRidge National Laboratory. Just in Knoxville, TN, the area where I grew \nup, with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the University of Tennessee \nresearch campus, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we have more \nthan 3,000 Ph.D.s. What a concentration of brain power. Out of that \ncomes entrepreneurial hotspots, new jobs, and this high standard of \nliving we talk about in our State, as well as for our country.\n\n  So what is the problem? You might even look at it, as the \nInternational Monetary Fund has said over the last several years, that \nwe have been able to keep that high level of gross national product, \nbut we all know anecdotally, and now from recommendations we have \ngotten from people who know what they are talking about, that we have a \ngathering storm. That is why simultaneously a number of us in the \nSenate, on both sides of the aisle, all began to come to about the same \nconclusion.\n  Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign, for example, took legislation \nfrom a group called the Council on Competitiveness, which said if we \ndon't stay competitive, we are not going to keep our jobs. So what do \nwe need to do? They told us. Senator Bingaman and I, with Senator \nDomenici's encouragement, and Representatives Boehlert and Gordon in \nthe House of Representatives joined in, asked the National Academy of \nSciences: We said, OK, you are supposed to know this. The Senator from \nOhio and the Senator from Tennessee, we might have an idea, we might \nhave a friend with a math program, but you are supposed to know. \nExactly what do we need to do to keep our high standard of living, to \nkeep our jobs from going to China and India? Tell us in priority order. \nThey did that. They gave us this report, ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm.''\n  They said if we want to keep our jobs, we better do these 20 things \nin priority order. These aren't the only 20 things. Each of us can \nthink of more to do. We might not agree about some of those things. \nSome might be tort reform. Some might be to give poor kids vouchers to \ngo to school. Those things aren't in here. Some overhaul of the tax \nsystem. There are a lot of barriers to innovation, but this group came \nup with 20 recommendations.\n  What happened to that? We have worked together with the \nadministration--homework sessions we called them--and we took the best \nadvice we could. These 20 recommendations weren't willy-nilly. These \nwere three Nobel laureates, a former president of MIT, business leaders \nlike Craig Barrett of Intel, Bob Gates, the head of Texas A, now the \nDefense Secretary. They gave their summer. They reviewed hundreds of \nproposals. They said of all the proposals, here is one that seems \neffective; that makes a difference. Let's try it. This is what we need \nto do to keep our advantage.\n  We usually don't have that kind of dispassionate, disinterested \nadvice. I think that is why, after we got going, we were able to have a \npiece of legislation, Domenici-Bingaman, that had 70 cosponsors--35 on \nthis side, 35 on that side. We had a Republican majority, and we worked \ntogether to produce that bill, and Senator Frist and Senator Reid \nintroduced it last year as we were going out of session.\n  What has happened this year? We have a Democratic majority, and \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell have taken the same bill, after it \nhas made its way through all these committees--and it is a big bill, \n208 pages. I reread it over the weekend. It is remarkably well \norganized, remarkably literate, remarkably easy to understand, and \nmakes a lot of sense.\n  Is it perfect? No. We have 100 Senators. We have 62 cosponsors of \nthis legislation by the majority leader and the minority leader. Yet \nthere are several things, if I were writing it, that I would take out.\n  We have had a healthy debate today. We have had some good points made \nby Senator DeMint and Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg and some others \nwho are critical of provisions of the bill. That is the way the Senate \nis supposed to work. We put it out there, we work hard to get our \nadvice, we have debates, we have votes, and we go on to the next thing, \nwhich is what we are doing tomorrow.\n  I would like to say, if all of us insisted on every right each of us \nhas, we would never get anything done. So I am very grateful to my \ncolleagues for the work they have done to help bring this to a \nconclusion, which we hope we can reach tomorrow.\n  I would like to make just a couple of other comments in response to \nsome of the criticisms of the legislation. I don't want to make too \nmany because most of the comments have been favorable. I mean, it is \nvery impressive when senior members, such as Senators Kennedy and Enzi \nfrom the HELP Committee, and Senators Inouye and Stevens from Commerce, \nand Senators Bingaman and Domenici from the Energy Committee bring this \nbill directly to the Senate floor and have a sense of urgency about its \npassage and step back and don't insist on all their prerogatives so we \ncan actually come to a conclusion. They have produced a remarkably good \nbill.\n  In improving it, however, one thing that was done to improve it \nyesterday was an amendment that was adopted which Senator Bingaman \noffered. That took out any direct spending in the bill. So there is no \nmandatory spending in this legislation. This is an authorization bill. \nIt doesn't spend one single penny. That is important for everyone to \nknow.\n  There is also the question of its cost. Let me go to a Statement of \nAdministration Policy that arrived last night. I used to work in the \nWhite House, in the Congressional Relations Office. I think if I had \nbeen doing it, and if the Senate had been working on this for 2 years, \nwith maybe a dozen Senators, including some Republicans, I think I \nmight have driven over here and given this to somebody. I would have \nappreciated that, and I think many other Senators would have. \nNevertheless, I put this in the Record this morning as a courtesy to \nthe White House because the President has spoken out forcefully for the \ncompetitiveness agenda in his State of the Union message for the last 2 \nyears, and he put a large amount of funding in his budget for the next \n4 years in support of it, and a number of the President's proposals, \nmost of them in fact, are incorporated in this legislation.\n  So among the National Academy of Sciences, the Council on \nCompetitiveness, and all the committees, we have the President of the \nUnited States, the most important voice in the country, saying this is \nwhat we need to do. I am grateful for that.\n  I am also grateful for this Statement of Administration Policy which \nhas made some helpful suggestions, and we have been considering them. \nThis\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nstatement points out, for example, that the Senate bill in support of \ncompetitiveness objectives would cost $61 billion over the next 4 \nyears. Most of it comes from doubling funding for the hard sciences in \nthe Office of Science in the Department of Energy, doing that over 10 \nyears, and authorizing--again, not spending, authorizing--doubling of \nthe National Science Foundation over 5 years. Mr. President, $61 \nbillion is what the Senate bill would do. That is $9 billion more than \nthe President's proposal.\n  Let me point out that the President himself proposed $52 billion over \nthe next 4 years. We have proposed $8 billion or $9 billion more--no \ndirect spending, and fairly close to what the President had \nrecommended. As Senator Bingaman said, the Budget Committee and the \nSenate, by a 97-to-1 vote, approved an amendment making about $1 \nbillion of room in our budget for the first year of these proposals.\n  In terms of new programs, it has been said there may be $16 billion \nof new proposals over the next 4 years. Let me try to put that in \nperspective. I consider this progrowth legislation. Over on this side \nof the aisle, we get very excited about progrowth legislation. I do. I \nlike it. I just talked about how I was a progrowth Governor. The first \nthing that comes to mind is taxes, the Bush 2001 tax cuts. I voted for \nthem. I will vote for them again. They are progrowth. They cost $552 \nbillion over 5 years--$552 billion over 5 years. That is a lot of \nmoney. We do that over here and don't think twice about it because it \nis progrowth.\n  This is $16 billion over 4 years. It is progrowth. To my way of \nthinking, it is just as progrowth as tax cuts. In fact, most of the \nresearch shows that our brain power advantage is the single most \nimportant reason that we grow the largest number of new jobs in our \ncountry. Our tax structure is important, but our brain power advantage \nis more important. So this is progrowth.\n  Another way of thinking about it, if we are $8 billion more than the \nPresident's proposals, $8 billion is about what we spend in a month in \nIraq. We spend about $2 billion a week in Iraq. I vote for that, \ntoo. But if we don't have growth, if we don't invest in education and \nresearch and keep our competitive advantage, we will never be able to \npay for the urgent needs we have--in Medicare, Medicaid, to clean up \nafter hurricanes, and to have a strong national defense. So this is \nprogrowth legislation.\n\n  As I look through the Statement of Administration Policy, I won't \nseek to discuss each of these items, but there are some differences of \nopinion between those in the administration and those of us who worked \non the bill. In some cases, it boils down to the President liking his \nnew programs and not liking our new programs, although most of his are \nin there. It is not quite fair for the White House to say it is wrong \nfor the Senate to add a few new programs but not wrong for the \nPresident to add a few new programs. We are coequal branches of the \nGovernment.\n  He has a new Math Now Program. We think it is a good program, and it \nis in here, but it is a new educational program. We have new \neducational programs, too, that were recommended by the Augustine \ncommission, such as the You Teach Program from the University of Texas \nand the Penn Science Program from the University of Pennsylvania, both \nof which were judged to be the most outstanding programs in the country \nto help train existing teachers or train new teachers. And who told us \nthat? This committee of 21, including three Nobel laureates who spent \nthe summer reviewing all the ideas. That is pretty good advice we are \ngetting, Mr. President. So I think we should take it.\n  The administration doesn't like what we call ARPA-E. It is what has \nbeen called DARPA over in the Defense Department, which has been very \nsuccessful as a research agency. Out of it came Stealth, which permits \nus to own the night in our military activities. Out of it came the \nInternet. There are some differences between using that to solve our \nenergy problems, but we think we ought to try. That is just a \ndifference of opinion.\n  There are a few other differences of opinion. One is that some people \nthink--although I haven't heard it said much on the floor today--we \nshould not be using our National Laboratories to have math and science \nprograms for teachers and students. I do not agree with that. My \nexperience is totally the reverse. Our biggest problem with math and \nscience is inspiring kids to learn math and science. What would inspire \nyou more than to go to the Oak Ridge Laboratory, Los Alamos, being near \na Nobel Prize winner if you are 14 or 15 years old or if you are a \nteacher? If you want to be a musician in Nashville, you would rather go \non the road with Vince Gill or Martina McBride than sit in the business \noffice of the Grand Ole Opry. So if we have these great National \nLaboratories, let's use them to inspire our students.\n  That is new. That is true, it is new. But what is wrong with a new \nidea every now and then if it has promise and it looks as if will work \nand it is recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, the \nInstitute of Engineering, and the National Academy of Medicine as \nsomething we ought to do? There are a variety of very good suggestions \nmade by the administration's statement of policy. We are taking them \nall into account.\n  We have had a number of amendments today. One of the concerns of the \nadministration was that we not duplicate educational programs. That is \nour concern as well. In the work that we did, we asked the National \nAcademies to look at existing programs and help us not duplicate those. \nSo as an example, the National Academies suggested that we create a \nspecial program of scholarships to train new teachers. We looked at the \nNational Science Foundation and, in fact, asked the Director. He \nalready had a program like that called the Robert Noyce Scholarship \nProgram. We judged that to be an effective program. Instead of creating \na new one, we expanded the existing one. So we have been very sensitive \nto that.\n  The legislation itself sets up a Cabinet council which will review \nexisting math and science programs in kindergarten through the 12th \ngrade to try to make sure we do not duplicate and that all of the money \nwe spend is effective. The administration has its own academic \ncompetitiveness council. It has been at work for about 18 months, I \nthink. It hasn't reached its conclusions yet. It is going to be a very \nuseful council as well. And the President's own Math Now proposal, a \nnew program, will also be helpful in helping us take the existing \nprograms and focus them correctly.\n  So the new Cabinet council within the administration, set up by this \nbill, the existing Academic Competitiveness Council already ongoing in \nthe administration, and our own oversight, should help us continue this \nvery valid inquiry to make sure the programs weren't duplicated.\n  I told the visiting chief State school officers today, who were here \nfrom around the country, that there was a lot to take home from this \nbill, and there is. When the academies were asked to put this in \npriority order, they didn't put a research and development tax credit \nas the No. 1 thing to keep our jobs. They didn't put bringing in \nstudents from overseas as the No. 1 thing, although we think it is \nterrifically important. They didn't even put more research in the \nuniversities as the No. 1 thing.\n  They said improving kindergarten through the 12th grade. And they \ntook a number of steps, some of which I have already mentioned: the \nsummer institutes of the National Laboratories, the teacher institutes \nat the National Science Foundation--70,000 new teachers will be trained \nto teach advanced placement courses in math, science, and the critical \nforeign languages. Especially, this will mean low-income children who \nare just as smart but just haven't had the opportunity to have a \nteacher who knew how to teach it or the money to pay for the test, this \nwill take care of that. This is from a Houston, TX, program that has \nbeen judged effective because it has worked for many years.\n  Then I think a very exciting program is the idea of supporting these \nspecialty math and science schools in each State, a residential math \nand science school such as the one in North Carolina, the one in \nGeorgia. The Governor of Tennessee has just begun to have one. It forms \na nucleus of excellence in a subject matter, in this case math and \nscience, that attracts and inspires the best students and teachers.\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n  We found in our State over the last 20 years that summer academies, \njust 2 or 4 weeks, in different subjects, has made a remarkable \ndifference in the quality of education. In Georgia, for example, their \nexperience is that half the students who go to the Georgia math and \nscience academy then go to Georgia Tech. That means they stay in \nGeorgia instead of going somewhere else and then they are the source of \nthe new jobs and higher standard of living for our future.\n  As I hope you can tell, I am excited about what has happened today. I \nknow enough about the Senate to know we are not through. The Senate is \nnot done until it is done. My hope is that Senator Bingaman is right \nand we can finish tomorrow.\n  I thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for creating an \nenvironment in which we can succeed. They have given us the time to do \nit and our colleagues have been diligent. I hope our colleagues will \ncome to the floor tomorrow with their suggestions. But I want the \nAmerican people to know what I said when I began. It is always a \nprivilege to serve in the Senate, but especially it is a privilege this \nweek because this is the Senate acting as grown-ups, not playing \npartisan, petty politics, not dealing with little kindergarten issues. \nWe are dealing with the two foremost issues facing our country: How we \ngo forward in Iraq--we have profound disagreements still--and how we \nkeep our competitive advantage, our brain power advantage, so we can \nkeep our jobs. We are coming to a consensus because of very hard work \non both sides. I think the American people will be proud of the result, \nif we are able to succeed, which I very much hope we can.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/24/senate-section/article/S5012-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
