Madam President, I thank my good friend the majority \nleader for allowing me to go ahead. My remarks will be briefer than \nhis.\n  All across the country, Americans are feeling the sting of record \nhigh gas prices at the pump. The cost of food is rising along with the \nprice of gas. Truckers and stay-at-home parents and commuters and \nvacationers are frustrated at paying more for gas than any of them ever \nimagined.\n  The situation is urgent. It demands our full attention, and it \ndemands a serious legislative response.\n  And though a barrel of crude oil costs roughly three times what it \ndid when Democrats took over Congress a year and a half ago, so far, \nthe Democrat leadership has been timid about solutions. They have \ntreated high gas prices as a distraction. But the time for timidity has \npassed. Americans are demanding that Congress do something to lower the \nhigh price of gas, and they won't be fooled by gimmicks or half-\nmeasures.\n  The majority leader has moved to a bill that only addresses the issue \nof speculation. But no serious person thinks passing this legislation \nalone will fix the problem. I don't know of any reputable economists \nwho think\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nthat simply addressing the futures market will significantly affect the \nprice of gas.\n  Warren Buffett, the most famous rich Democrat in America, dismisses \nthe idea.\n  T. Boone Pickens--who will be meeting with the Democrats tomorrow--\ndismisses the idea.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, dismisses the \nidea.\n  Serious economists on all sides dismiss the idea.\n  The 27-nation International Energy Agency dismisses the idea.\n  Strengthening regulation of the futures market is a worthwhile piece \nof any legislative effort, but let's be clear from the outset: it is \njust a piece--and a small piece at that.\n  We need to think about the scope of this problem and act boldly. \nProblems this big require a bigger solution than a single idea by a \nsingle Member of Congress, not timid attempts to address only part of \nthe problem.\n  As the senior Senator from Tennessee has said, can you imagine if \nPresident Kennedy had acted timidly when launching the space mission? \nWhat do you think the reaction would have been if he had declared we \nwill go only a fraction of the way to the Moon?\n  Good ideas from both sides should be considered. And Americans, we \nknow, are demanding nothing less.\n  They are demanding, above all, that we treat high gas prices for what \nthey are: the single most important domestic issue facing Americans \ntoday. And they will know we are doing so when they see us dealing head \non with supply and demand. Increased global demand for oil is not going \ndown anytime soon. This means gas prices will not go down unless supply \ngoes up.\n  And with gas prices now well above $4 a gallon, the time has come for \nthose who oppose a balanced approach to retreat from their long-held \nopposition to targeted and responsible oil exploration at home. They \nneed to unlock the Outer Continental Shelf and lift their ban on the \ndevelopment of the vast oil shale deposits in western States.\n  America is the third-largest oil producer in the world. We possess \nwithin our own borders triple the amount of oil potential of Saudi \nArabia with oil shale alone. It is time for the opponents of a balanced \napproach to unlock these vast domestic resources that will allow us to \nfinally start the process of increasing domestic supply even as we work \ntogether toward a future free from dependence on Middle East oil.\n  Our friends have been reluctant until now to unlock these vast \ndomestic reserves because of an aversion to fossil fuels and a sluggish \nattitude toward legislating in the middle of a Presidential election \nyear. But Americans are more concerned right now about paying for \ngasoline and groceries than they are about the political calendar. And, \nover the past couple of weeks, a number of our friends on the other \nside have indicated they want a balanced solution too.\n  So far, a dozen Democrats have expressed some level of openness to \nnew domestic exploration. We are approaching a bipartisan consensus on \nthe need to increase domestic supply. But their leadership isn't there. \nTheir Presidential nominee opposes every effort to increase supply. The \nSpeaker of the House is walking in lock-step with Al Gore.\n  It is time for Republicans and Democrats to come together on high gas \nprices. It is time to put aside old and outdated prejudices about \noffshore exploration, which is being done safely by countless other \ncountries around the world and here at home too. It is time to use the \nresources we have and stop timidly nibbling around the edges. It is \ntime to deliver for the American people. It is time to do what we were \nsent here to do.\n  A serious solution is already at hand. The Gas Price Reduction Act, \nwith 44 coponsors, features a speculation piece that addresses the \nconcerns of the bill the Democratic leadership would have us vote on \ntomorrow. But it is bolder than just that. It also contains the \nelements of a serious energy bill. It faces supply and demand head on \nby lifting the ban on Western oil shale development and opening up \nexploration far from the shores of the states that want it. And it \npromotes energy efficient vehicles like plug-in electric cars and \ntrucks.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act was written with one bipartisan principle \nin mind: find more, use less. If we adopt it, the American people will \nsee that Congress is taking their concerns seriously.\n  Anything short of this bill will not be welcomed by the American \npeople and will prove to be a waste of energy. If we pass the \nspeculator piece alone, Americans will continue to demand a serious \nsolution that gets at supply and demand. But we can avoid such a \ndisappointment now by getting behind a proposal that directly addresses \nthe price of gas at the pump.\n  This is a big problem, and the problem is bigger than just \nspeculation; good ideas from all sides should be considered. It is what \nthe American people demand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6948-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6948-S6949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Private First Class Sammie E. Phillips\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to speak about a hero of the \nKentucky National Guard who gave his life in defense of freedom for our \ncountry. PFC Sammie E. Phillips was tragically killed on September 10, \n2007, when his vehicle overturned during patrol in Iraq. Hailing from \nElizabethtown, KY, he was 19 years old.\n  For his bravery in uniform, Private First Class Phillips earned \nseveral awards, medals and decorations, including the Good Conduct \nMedal, the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal and the Bronze Star.\n  Sammie's wife, Ashley Phillips, says of her husband, ``I want \neveryone to know how proud Sammie was and how he truly was a hero, just \nlike he always wanted to be.''\n  In his too short life Sammie made a big impression on many people. He \nhad a way of brightening any room when he walked in, and he made lots \nof friends.\n  ``The thing I remember about Sammie the most was his smile,'' says \nLaura McGray, a former high-school teacher of his. ``His eyes stood \nout. In some people their whole souls shine through their eyes. That \nwas Sammie.''\n  Sammie grew up in Elizabethtown and attended North Hardin High School \nin nearby Radcliff. Like a lot of young men his age, he enjoyed \nwatching scary movies, and he liked Cadillac cars.\n  He was a big Tennessee Titans fan. He liked listening to rap music, \nand had big speakers in his car so he could do just that. Most of all, \nhe enjoyed spending time with family and friends, especially Ashley, \nwho he met during his junior year at North Hardin.\n  ``He was very dedicated to his friends and relationships and would \ngive a person the shirt off his back,'' says Ashley.\n  Sammie graduated from high school in 2006, and enlisted in the \nKentucky National Guard. When he received his orders to deploy to Iraq, \nhe asked Ashley to marry him. That was on a Wednesday. That Saturday, \nSammie and Ashley were wed.\n  The happy couple had 10 days together before Sammie reported for \ntraining. In August of 2007, he shipped out to Iraq.\n  In uniform, Sammie continued to impress people just as he had in high \nschool. He was assigned to Battery B, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field \nArtillery, based out of Carlisle, KY. He qualified as an expert gunner \nand became the gunner in his tank.\n  CAPT Robert S. Mattingly, the commander of Sammie's unit, calls \nSammie ``an excellent soldier who had unlimited potential. I rode with \nSammie while training in Mississippi. He was one of our best gunners, \nthe absolute cream of the crop. He was always ready to go, which is one \nof the best traits a soldier could possess.''\n  Captain Mattingly adds:\n\n       I never met a person that didn't like Sammie Phillips.\n\n  Donald C. Storm, the former Adjutant General of the Kentucky National \nGuard, says Sammie was ``a tremendous young soldier that just had \ntremendous potential.''\n  Sammie aspired to one day be an architect, a goal he told Ashley \nabout when they first met. He had hoped to go to school to study \narchitecture once he returned from Iraq. He saw himself as a builder, \nand he built big dreams for himself and for a future with Ashley.\n  Sammie's unit returned home from Iraq in May of 2008. Sadly, PFC\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\nSammie Phillips did not return with them. At Sammie's funeral at the \nStithton Baptist Church in Radcliff, 3,000 people turned out to pay \ntheir respects to the boy with the big smile. Sammie's mother, Rachel \nCrutcher, wrote a letter to her son that said:\n\n       I know you're in heaven saying, ``Momma, don't cry.''\n\n  Rachel says:\n\n       He was someone special, and I knew . . . that he'd be an \n     inspiration to everyone he came in contact with.\n\n  Madam President, our prayers are for the Phillips family for their \nterrible loss. We are thinking of Sammie's wife, Ashley Phillips; his \nmother, Rachel Crutcher; his stepfather, Donny Crutcher; his father, \nRonald Phillips; his sister, Cassandra Phillips; his brother, Logan \nCrutcher; his grandfather, Ted Stiles; and many more beloved family \nmembers and friends.\n  Madam President, Ashley tells us that her Sammie was proud of his \nservice. He told his mom that if he were to die while wearing his \ncountry's uniform, ``everyone was going to know who he was.''\n  Well, this U.S. Senate knows, and we certainly will not forget PFC \nSammie E. Phillips's service and sacrifice. We honor the life of this \ndedicated man, soldier, and patriot, and stand in awe of devotion like \nhis that continues to keep our Nation safe and free.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6949-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6949-S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PARTICIPATING IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a very busy week ahead of us. I \nhave announced some of the work we are going to do, but we really do \nhave a lot to do. I look forward to this being a very productive week. \nI hope things work out as well as I anticipate.\n  Madam President--I am sorry that I referred to you as ``Mr. \nPresident.'' That is pretty standard when you just have--as I mentioned \nlast week, we sure have a lot more women than when I first came here. \nWhen I came here, we had Senator Mikulski. Now, on this side alone, we \nhave 11 Democratic women, which has made the Senate a much better \nplace.\n  Madam President, as Senators Obama, Reed, and Hagel travel through \nIraq today, there is one conclusion they will undoubtedly all reach: \nour troops--about 150,000 strong--have done a remarkable, heroic job \nunder nearly impossible circumstances.\n  This war has been going on for a long time--more than 6 years--\napproaching about $1 trillion having been spent. Today, we are spending \n$5,000 a second in Iraq. We have more than 3,000 double-amputees. We \nhave a significant number of returning veterans who are blind, \nparalyzed, and, of course, the traumatic head injuries they have had \nhave been significant. It will be a legacy of this country for a long \ntime to pay for all that. But because of the valor of these troops and \ntheir sacrifice, a war that was irresponsibly planned and incompetently \nwaged by President Bush has now shown signs of improvement, and that is \ngood. Neither Democrats nor Republicans can take any credit for that. \nEvery ounce of credit goes to our men and women in uniform, and we are \ngrateful to them beyond words to describe.\n  It would be impossible to fully repay our troops for the sacrifice \nthey and their families have made. But this Congress took a historic \nstep forward--over the President's objection and over Senator McCain's \nstatement that the bill was too generous--and we passed, in spite of \nMcCain's objection and the President's objection, a new GI bill of \nrights--the largest expansion of veterans' benefits since the original \nGI bill after World War II.\n  As Senator Obama visits Iraq to listen to our troops and commanders \nand meet with Iraqi leaders, it is becoming clear that America, Iraq, \nand the world are coalescing around Senator Obama's plan to end the \nwar.\n  I spoke yesterday to someone I know very well. He has had three tours \nof duty in Iraq.\n  I said: James, what do you think of Senator Obama going to Iraq?\n  He said: The troops love him.\n  For someone who has had three tours of duty in Iraq, I think he has \nthe credentials to say that.\n  That plan sets a responsible timeline for redeploying American combat \nbrigades, transitions the responsibility for securing Iraq to the \nIraqis--as Senator Levin has said for many years: Take the training \nwheels off and let them run their own country. It restores America's \nmilitary readiness. Right now, because of this long war, our military \nis in very difficult shape. Estimates of bringing the military to what \nit was before the war started is now approaching at least $150 billion. \nFinally, it takes the fight to America's No. 1 enemy, Osama bin Laden.\n  This weekend, Prime Minister Al-Maliki spoke in favor of the Obama \nplan. Today, despite pressure from the White House, Iraqi Government \nofficials publicly reiterated their support. They want us out of their \ncountry. If you take a poll--and there have been many taken--80 percent \nof the Iraqis want us out of that country. They have suffered \nsignificantly during this war.\n  We are all glad Saddam Hussein is gone. But they do not know \ndefinitely the number of Iraqis who have been killed. There are wide-\nranging estimates from 150,000 to 600,000. We know that millions have \nbeen displaced. There are 2 million out of the country. There are a \nmillion and a half wandering around inside of Iraq who are displaced.\n  The American people have known for years that our national security \ninterests require us to carefully bring our troops home and call on the \nIraqi people to take the reins of their own sovereign nation. The vast \nmajority of Iraqis, I repeat, are eager for the day to come when they \ncontrol their own destiny. They are ready for the war to responsibly \ndraw to a close.\n  Even President Bush--even President Bush--who bears the primary \nresponsibility for this incompetently managed war, is now belatedly and \ngradually moving toward some elements of key Democratic positions on \nIran, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The President has labeled his new position \nfor Iraq a ``time horizon.'' Try to figure out what that means. We \ndon't know. But at least he is recognizing there must be some timeline \nset. No one knows yet what a ``time horizon'' actually means, and it is \nclear that President Bush has no plans to draw down the war before he \npacks his bags in January. This critical national security decision \nwill fall to the next President.\n\n  While it is becoming increasingly clear that the American people and \nIraqi leaders strongly support the Obama plan to bring our troops home, \nSenator McCain is stubbornly clinging to his open-ended commitment to \nendless war.\n  Senator McCain has called upon Senator Obama to listen to our troops \nand commanders in Iraq. He criticizes Senator Obama for not going to \nIraq again. And he criticized Senator Obama for going to Iraq. Senator \nObama is, though, listening to our troops and commanders, and it is \nclearer than ever that his position was right from the beginning.\n  Now it is time for Senator McCain to listen to the American people. \nIf he does, he will discover a nation desperate for a responsible path \nout of Iraq. If Senator McCain fails to join the chorus of calls for a \nresponsible path out of Iraq, the choice in November will be even more \nclear than it is now.\n  Madam President, I want to talk about energy speculation, about \nenergy generally.\n  This weekend, Senator Murray delivered the weekly Democratic radio \naddress. In her remarks, the Senator from Washington said that her last \ngas fill-up in the State of Washington was $4.35 a gallon. Nevada is \nnot far behind.\n  I have spoken on the floor about gas prices on countless occasions, \nand each time the crisis has grown worse. Last month, we heard from a \npublic school teacher, who gave the Democratic response to President \nBush, a teacher in Auburn, NY, who has had to spend all the money he \nand his wife used to save for their children's college tuition on \ngasoline. All across our country, billions and billions of dollars that \nrightfully belong in the pockets and savings of American families are \nbeing funneled instead to oil companies and oil-producing countries. \nThat diversion of savings from American families to foreign governments \nand oil companies is nothing short of a national crisis.\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\n  When our country is in a crisis, Congress must be ready to take \naction. We Democrats in Congress, working with Senator Obama, have \ntried to take action again and again. We have proposed both long- and \nshort-term solutions--short-term solutions to bring down gas prices now \nand long-term solutions to attack the root of the problem: our growing \naddiction to oil.\n  We had something called the Energy First Act. It would end the \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks for big oil companies whose \nexecutives have been hauling in record profits while we pay record \nprices. Last year, the oil companies made $250 billion net.\n  Second, in that piece of legislation, we would force the oil \ncompanies to do their part by investing some of their profits in clean \nand affordable alternative energy--the Sun, the wind, geothermal, \nbiofuels.\n  Third, we protect in that legislation the American people from price \ngougers and greedy oil traders who manipulate the market.\n  We also, in that legislation, among others things, stand up to OPEC \nand countries that are colluding to keep oil prices high.\n  One of my friends is a foremost antitrust lawyer in America. His name \nis Joe Alioto, Jr. He has painted the picture very clearly that there \nis a conspiracy going on. We have a bipartisan approach to that. \nSenator Kohl of Wisconsin and Senator Specter of Pennsylvania have \njoined to have OPEC subject to American antitrust laws.\n  Of course, we have been blocked on all four of these issues by the \nRepublicans.\n  We have found with our efforts to do something about these energy \nprices that the Republicans have not been willing to participate in the \nlegislative process. They have taken their cues from President Bush \nand, of course, from Senator McCain that the solution to gas and oil \nprices starts and ends with more offshore drilling. Democrats have made \nit clear that we support more domestic production.\n  We have, counting ANWR and all the offshore potential that exists, \nless than 3 percent of the oil in the world. We use more than 25 \npercent of the oil in the world every day. So there is no question \ndomestic production is part of the answer, but it is only one part of \nthe answer. The minority would like us to believe that the moment we \nopen more of our coast to the oil companies, gas prices will come \ntumbling down.\n  Less than 2 years ago, here in the Senate, we passed a bill that was \nsigned by the President. We were told by the oil companies and others \nthat if we opened the Gulf of Mexico to more drilling, it would really \nbe good for our economy, good for oil production. But we allowed 8.3 \nmillion more acres in the Gulf of Mexico to be drilled, and here it is, \nalmost 2 years since we passed that legislation, and not a single drill \nbit has been placed in that water.\n  So it seems to be kind of a hollow cry to say we need more places to \ndrill when they have not used the places we gave them to drill. Sixty-\neight million acres they have, and they have 8.3 million acres we gave \nthem less than 2 years ago that they have not touched.\n  The truth is, it would take years--and even decades--for offshore oil \nto be explored, drilled, and distributed. Just to set up an oil rig \nwould take more than 2 years. Equipment is not available. So in the \nshort term, drilling would do absolutely nothing.\n  We have expressed our willingness to consider more drilling as part \nof any comprehensive short- and long-term package, but Republicans so \nfar have not been willing to entertain other solutions.\n  We will begin this week by working on legislation that would have an \nimmediate impact on gas prices. I heard my friend, the Republican \nleader, say: Well, speculation is not such a big deal. I do not think \nit is just fortuitous that once we started talking about doing \nsomething about speculation, the price of oil dropped. I think this \nspeculation is way out of hand, and I am not the only one who feels \nthat way.\n  We need legislation to rein in Wall Street traders who are unfairly \ndriving up oil prices. These traders have no regard for the well-being \nof American families. The only thing they care about are their own \nprofits. Prior to 2000, you could not speculate in oil. It was not \nallowed. But a Republican Congress led the charge, and now you can \nspeculate in oil even if you are not going to use that oil. The only \nthing, it seems to me, that these speculators care about is how much \nmoney they can make, which they secure by bidding up the price of oil, \nbuying huge quantities just to sell it at an even higher price. They \nhave no plan to actually use the oil they buy. All they want to do is \nbuy, sell, and repeat, leaving American families to pay the bill.\n\n  Now, there are wide-ranging suggestions as to how much this is. \nTwenty to fifty percent of the cost of oil is in speculation. Not all \nspeculation is bad. Sometimes it helps the market determine a fair \nprice for a commodity. Speculation in the oil market has gone on \nthroughout the Bush administration with virtually no oversight, and it \ntruly has gotten out of hand. Experts say this speculation is \nresponsible, as I have indicated, for 20 percent--up to as much as 50 \npercent--of the price we pay at the pump. These are figures with actual \npeople making those suggestions and those calculations: Academics, \neconomists, and people who used to work for the Commodities Futures \nTrading Commission.\n  Democrats have proposed legislation--the Stop Excessive Energy \nSpeculation Act--that would set a fair amount of oversight on this out-\nof-control trading. The Republicans have said in speeches and press \nconferences that they agree with us that speculation is a problem. They \nhave kind of now backtracked and said it is a problem but not a big \nproblem. I assume they have been getting a lot of calls from Wall \nStreet, as have we, but we are not going to be intimidated by them. We \nbelieve they are part of the problem, and we need to do something to \nmake them a part of the solution.\n  To show that the Republicans believe that speculation is important, \nthe bill they have before this body has a provision in it dealing with \nspeculation. I would hope they would look at our speculation bill and \njoin us. If there is something wrong with it, we are happy to take a \nlook at any reasonable suggestion that would make it a better piece of \nlegislation. It stands to reason this would be a chance for Democrats \nand Republicans to work together. So far, however, we have seen, sadly, \nmore of the same from the Republican side: nice rhetoric, no action.\n  We had to file cloture again. We are now up to 83 Republican \nfilibusters--83. As I have said before, it has gotten so there are so \nmany of them, we now have Velcro numbers here. We can peel them off and \nput the number four up here. Hopefully, we will not have to do that too \nsoon. This breaks all records ever in the history of our Congress, more \nthan doubling the number of filibusters. We have made it clear that we \nare willing to work with the Republicans on compromise. Legislation is \nthe art of compromise. We want to work together on energy legislation \nthat both sides feel good about.\n  They keep talking about their drilling amendment. That has been their \nhue and cry for weeks now: We want to drill. We want the Governors to \ndetermine where you should drill off the coasts of their States. So we \nare saying we are willing to work with them. If they want to offer a \ndrilling amendment, we will offer an alternative. Both measures would \nreceive a vote. That is how the legislative process is supposed to \nwork, but the latest Republican obstruction tactic has left us with no \nchoice but to file cloture again on the speculation bill, and this \nchart is what that represents: 83. Otherwise, this important issue \nwould fall off the legislative map. By forcing us to file cloture, \nRepublicans, I believe, are wasting precious time when prompt action is \nnecessary. So I hope in the morning we get cloture on this bill. I hope \nafter we get cloture on the bill, the Republicans will work with us and \nsay: OK, we want to offer our drilling amendment. That is fine. We are \nhappy to work with them. What we have had in the past is that the \nrhetoric is not reality: Well, we really want to do the drilling \namendment, but you are not letting us offer unlimited amendments, so we \nare not going to support you on anything.\n  The American people will certainly be waiting to see whether \nRepublicans are willing to take yes for an answer. They have said they \nwanted a vote on drilling; let's see if they will take yes\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nfor an answer and legislate on the energy crisis.\n  In the near future, we are going to turn to the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program--LIHEAP. This is one of the best programs we \nhave ever done in Washington. It is a great program. This energy crisis \nis difficult. If you are a man or a woman, a mother, a father and you \nhave a job and you have to drive to work, there are ways, as difficult \nas it might be, that you can alleviate some of the burdens of high gas \nprices. You can take public transportation, in some instances. You can \ncarpool. There are things that can be done. If you are a soccer mom or \ndad, you can carpool the kids. There are things that can be done to \nwork with this high price of gasoline: Change the time of the practices \nand do all kinds of things such as that.\n  However, if you are a senior citizen--and here we are with August \nfast approaching and cold weather hitting parts of our country in \nOctober--it must be stark recognizing the limitations of being able to \nheat your home. It is significant. If you are old and on a fixed \nincome, this is very scary, and that is what LIHEAP is all about.\n  This legislation would provide immediate relief to millions of senior \ncitizens, families with children, and the disabled, who are struggling \nto pay their home energy bills, a crisis that will only worsen in the \nwinter months ahead. LIHEAP has been highly successful, but the \nbreathtaking rise in energy prices is making the program far less able \nto help those in need. That is why this legislation is supported by \nAARP, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Alliance for \nRural America, and dozens and dozens of different farmers groups and \nconsumer groups and other organizations.\n  I was approached by one of my Republican colleagues the other day who \nsaid: I hope you will bring this up. We are going to bring this up. It \nis a bill we should pass. I hope we don't have to jump through all the \nhoops, all the steps procedurally. I hope we can get this bill passed. \nThe high price of oil and gas is making headlines. This LIHEAP \nlegislation addresses those energy problems as well as the rising \nprices of propane, kerosene, natural gas, and electricity.\n  This legislation is important now, when high temperatures are \ncreating health risks for the elderly and people with disabilities. It \nis interesting. I have been told there are more homeless dying in the \nsummertime than the wintertime because of exposure. We talk about the \ncold winters--and that is very important to talk about--but for those \nof us who live in the West, these hot summers are very difficult. Old \npeople need their homes cooled. So this LIHEAP legislation is important \nnow. It is important now as we plan to prevent a major crisis that may \ncome if gas prices do not fall significantly before winter.\n  We are going to introduce another package of critical bills that have \nbeen blocked by mostly one Senator. As the Presiding Officer knows, one \nSenator can have tremendous power in the Senate. We are going to turn \nto a package of critical bills that have passed the House of \nRepresentatives, have cleared the committees in the Senate, enjoy \noverwhelming bipartisan support, and have been blocked by one Senator \non occasion--sometimes two.\n  A few examples of the kinds of bills that this one individual, or a \ncouple of his friends joining with him, have prevented us from passing \nand becoming law are, for example, the Emmett Till Unsolved Crimes \nbill. For people who lived through that era, they believe there is \nsomething that needs to be done to help heal old wounds and provide the \nDepartment of Justice and the FBI tools needed to effectively \ninvestigate and prosecute unsolved civil rights era murders.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this is \nimportant legislation, and it should not be held up as this has been \nheld up. This is authorizing legislation. There is no reason in the \nworld to hold this up.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth bill would provide grants for health \ncare, education and workforce programs and housing programs for \nrunaways and homeless youth. Why wouldn't we pass this? It has passed \nthe House. It has been reported out of the committee overwhelmingly.\n\n  The Combating Child Exploitation bill would provide grants to train \nlaw enforcement to use technology to track individuals who trade in \nchild pornography.\n  On the Senate floor, we may not think pornography is a big issue. We \nshould. Years ago, when I was a practicing attorney, one of my clients \nwas Dr. O'Gorman. Dr. O'Gorman was a psychiatrist in Las Vegas. He was \na prominent physician. He became president of the State Medical \nSociety. I was preparing a contract for him. We were waiting while the \nsecretary typed the final part of it. I said to him: Doc, what is the \nbiggest problem people come to see you about? Remember, we are in Las \nVegas more than 25 years ago. What is the biggest problem people have \nwho come to see you? He said pornography. I was stunned. Pornography? \nYes, he said, pornography. He went on in some detail to tell me how \npornography ruins people's lives, breaks up marriages, and is so \ndestructive. We have a bill dealing with grown men, mostly, who trade \nin child pornography. Now, shouldn't we be able to pass that \nlegislation? It establishes an Internet Crimes Against Children Task \nForce within the office of Justice Programs. This is something that \nshould be matter of fact. It is being held up. We should pass this.\n  I don't know how many have had the experience--I think every Senator \nhas had a friend or a relative or a neighbor who has been struck with \nLou Gehrig's disease. It is devastating. From the time this disease is \ndiscovered until you die is about an average of 18 months. The ALS \nRegistry bill would create a centralized database to help doctors and \nscientists better understand, and hopefully find a cure, for Lou \nGehrig's disease. It afflicts 5,600 Americans every year.\n  Why is a registry important? When I first came to the Senate, I had \nthree women come to visit me in my Las Vegas office. Those three women \nwanted to be someplace else, but they swallowed their pride and their \nembarrassment to come and visit with me. Why did they come to see me? \nBecause all three of these women had a disease called interstitial \ncystitis. Ninety percent or more of the people who get this disease are \nwomen. The pain is best described as shoving slivers of glass up and \ndown someone's bladder--excruciating pain. When these women came to see \nme, most all doctors thought it was psychosomatic.\n  Well, the first thing we did with this disease is we worked to \nestablish within the National Institutes of Health a registry so people \ncould gather information and have it set up so people who are \nphysicians in one part of the country could look and see what was going \non in other parts of the country and the scientists could go to work on \nit. Tremendous progress has been made with interstitial cystitis. \nDoctors can now more easily diagnosis this. There is now a medicine so \nthat 40 percent of the people who have this disease have no pain--they \nare symptom-free.\n  One of the people who worked hard on this with us was a woman who was \na professional golfer. To show you how difficult this disease is, this \nwas a professional golfer who had been a great athlete her whole life. \nShe was stricken with this disease before she was 30 years old. For her \nto try to complete a round of golf, she would have to go to the \nbathroom 25 or 30 times during 18 holes of golf. Well, she is one of \nthe lucky people. The medicine helped her. She went on to win a number \nof tournaments. She is a success story. So why shouldn't we be able to \nstart with Lou Gehrig's disease, as we did with this dread disease, \ninterstitial cystitis, which now people clearly recognize is not \npsychosomatic.\n  Another piece of legislation in this package is the Christopher and \nDana Reeve Paralysis Act. We all know ``Superman'' was in a horse \naccident and was paralyzed. This legislation would enhance the \ncooperation of research, rehabilitation, and quality of life for people \nwho suffer from paralysis. Not only would this bill accelerate the \ndiscovery of better treatments and cures, but it would help improve the \ndaily lives of 2 million Americans who are awaiting a cure.\n  So I would hope that we, moving forward on this legislation, will get \nsupport from colleagues on this side of the aisle. We should not have \none or two Senators stop everything from moving forward. People say: \nWell, why don't you do something about it? Madam\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\nPresident, this is why we don't do anything about it: 83 filibusters. \nAs to each one of these, when we finish and get the vote on a motion to \nproceed, it takes 30 hours; once we get on the bill and file cloture \nagain, into cloture invocation, another 30 hours. We can't do this. We \nhave about 40 bills in this package, every one of them similar to the 5 \nI have mentioned.\n  So I hope people will work with me so we can give the American people \nsome recognition that the Senate isn't going to be a graveyard for \nimportant pieces of legislation. Emmett Till, runaway homeless youth, \npornography, Lou Gehrig registry, and the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act.\n  I think the Republicans are going to have a choice. They can join the \nside of the American people or they can continue to stand beside a \ncolleague intent on blocking virtually everything.\n  I hope we can work together as Democrats and Republicans to make this \na week of progress, so the American people can recognize we are trying \nto do something to alleviate some of the problems facing this country. \nThere are a lot of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6952-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, following up on the comments made by the \nmajority leader, the American public is suffering record pain at the \npump. Missourians are struggling with higher gas prices. They have said \nin poignant and perceptive letters to me that they are hurting.\n  Carol Shoener, in Braymer, MO, northeast of Kansas City, wrote my \noffice asking that the Senate take action swiftly to stop rising fuel \nprices. She has to drive 25 to 30 miles to the nearest town with a \nhospital, dentist or pharmacy.\n  Juanita Highfill, of Bolivar, in southwest Missouri, is retired on a \nfixed income. She writes that the cost of gasoline is a real hardship \nfor her family. Her son, a kidney transplant recipient with few job \nskills and limited ability, drives 30 miles one way to work a minimum \nwage job. His net monthly income is under $400, with gas taking $250 of \nthat, leaving him with $150 per month for his life's expenses.\n  Anthony Meis, of Pacific, MO, west of St. Louis, is on a fixed income \ntoo. He follows the markets and knows that ``once we pump more oil in \nour country, the speculators . . . won't have the same leverage of \ndriving up oil prices.''\n  It is time we get real about gas prices. The Democratic leader \npointed out that there are areas where there is tremendous suffering \nacross the country. Maybe it is time he realized we need to take some \nsubstantive, comprehensive approaches to the gas price problem. No more \nof these show activities, these empty promises, these peripheral \nissues. Let us hope he meant it when he said he would allow us to \ndebate the issues and offer amendments. That is the problem.\n  The majority leader has been acting as a Rules Committee such as the \nHouse has, which says we can only vote on the things he wants us to \nvote on. He is going to try to cram a package down our throats with a \nwhole bunch of bills--and many are good ones--without having an \nopportunity to vote. I want cloture and I want to talk about an energy \nbill. I want to vote on it and have people go on the record and show \nwhether they are for dealing with this crisis--the gas prices and oil \nprices and a whole range of energy prices.\n  No more saying, no, we can't, to real action on gas prices. No more \nsaying, no, we can't, to providing American families the relief they \nneed. No more saying, no, we can't, to going after every option \navailable, including increasing production.\n  We must say, yes, we can, to real action on gas prices. Any plan that \nhas a real chance of lowering gas prices must say, yes, we can, to \nincreasing production; yes, we can, to increasing conservation; and, \nyes, we can, to addressing speculation.\n  We Republicans have a plan that says, yes, we can, to each of these \nways to increase production, increase conservation, and address \nspeculation.\n  I hope the other side will join us to allow our plan for real gas \nprice relief to go forward. I hope we don't get shut out. I hope the \nmajority leader doesn't fill the tree, as he has in the past. I hope \nthey will let us act on these important measures.\n  I hope the Members blocking real relief for the American people \nfinally listen to what we are hearing from home. I hear it every day \nfrom constituents back home. Farmers, truckers, and families are all \nsuffering from gas price increases. Families from the cities to the \nsuburbs to our rural areas are all cutting their budgets to pay higher \ngas prices.\n  At stake are good jobs in places far from affordable hospitals, the \nability to live near good schools and the ability to share in the \nAmerican dream. All of these need affordable energy solutions.\n  Why are we refusing to help families any way we can? We are tired of \nhearing the other side of the aisle tell suffering families: No, we \ncan't.\n  Farmers--the great symbol of American bounty--are suffering. They \nprovide for us. Why are we refusing to provide for them? They need \naffordable fuel to run their farm equipment, store their harvest, and \nship their goods to market.\n  One of the biggest costs of food is that of transportation. Why are \nwe telling those who produce our food, package it, ship it--why are we \ntelling them, no, we can't help them with their energy costs?\n  Truckers across the country are suffering. Many trucking companies \nare small businesses. They are laying off workers and some are going \nbankrupt. Why are we telling struggling truckers, no, we can't?\n  The American people understand what is going on. They are smart \nenough to know that if you don't have enough of something, you go out \nand get more of it. It is economics 101. If prices are too high, it is \nbecause there is not enough supply and too much demand. Yet the \nleadership on the other side of the aisle, and the Democratic Party, \nhave done everything they can to prevent more production of the \nbountiful gas and oil resources we have in our country. Of course, \nthere was the 1995 veto by President Clinton of the Republican \nauthorization to open drilling in ANWR. He said it would take 10 years \nto produce oil. Well, 10 years was probably longer than it would have \ntaken, but that time has long past. We are missing out on a million \nbarrels of oil a day that would have come from ANWR.\n  The Republicans have a plan. Our Gas Price Reduction Act takes real \naction on oil supplies. Right now, there are, at a minimum, 18 billion \nbarrels of oil waiting for us off our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. That \nis 10 years of supply we are blocking from ourselves, stopping \nourselves from producing.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act will open these offshore areas and allow \nus to put the American oil to use for Americans.\n  For those who say it would take years to get, they ignore the \nimmediate price-lowering effect of the news of new supplies. It \nhappened last week. After the President announced suspension of the \nPresidential moratorium on offshore drilling, prices are down $16 a \nbarrel. It is now up to us in Congress to get off our duffs and do the \nsame thing and bring immediate, long-term, lasting relief to American \nfamilies and farmers. When Congress finally gets its act together and \ngives the go-ahead, we can see new wells being brought on, some in \nrelatively short periods of time.\n  For those States concerned with opening drilling off their shores, \nour plan would allow States to opt out. If California doesn't want to \nparticipate, that is fine. But that should not block States such as \nVirginia and Alaska, where they want to drill.\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\n  For those concerned about the environment, as we all should be, the \nmodern oil drilling technology the United States requires is so much \nmore environmentally safe now than decades ago; it is so much safer \nthan that which other countries require, and our environmental concerns \ncan best be satisfied by allowing American production to go forward.\n  The terrible tragedy of Hurricane Katrina at least proved that modern \noffshore drilling is environmentally safe.\n  That hurricane blew over thousands of oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwith scarcely a drop or a bucket spilled.\n  Some say we need to use the oil leases we have before we can issue \nnew leases. Well, welcome to the party, folks. That already is a \nrequirement placed on current leaseholders. If the oil companies do not \nproduce from a lease in 10 years--or even less in some leases--\nthen that lease goes back to the United States and somebody else can \ntry it. Many of the people making that argument lack a basic \nunderstanding of the lease program. There is a reason they call it \nexploration, because a lease is no guarantee that oil is actually \npresent. You have to go out and use technology to find out if there is \na good chance--drill a prospecting hole, after getting permits, to see \nif there is oil there.\n\n  A lot of leases have no foreseeable production on them. Some would \ncall them goat pastures because they are good for pasturing goats, not \nproducing oil.\n  Some claim their plans offer new supplies of oil. But they are only \noffering false hopes and half measures. Excuse me, I misspoke in \ncalling them half measures. Half measures gives them far too much \ncredit.\n  One Democratic plan is to raid the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and \ndivert 10 percent of its volume to consumers. Putting aside that the \nreserve is only for national emergencies, such as times of war, and \nthere are great dangers where we might need that oil, their plan would \nprovide us exactly 3\\1/2\\ days' worth of oil, and then we would have no \nreserve for extreme emergencies.\n  The Republican Gas Price Reduction Act would provide struggling \nAmerican families and workers the equivalent of 10 years of new oil \nsupply versus a 3\\1/2\\-day supply. That is the most substantive \nproduction idea I have heard from the Democrats.\n  The facts are clear. The Gas Price Reduction Act is the only plan \nthat will lower gas prices with real amounts of new oil supplies. Of \ncourse, there is much we can and we must do to use less oil and \nincrease conservation.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act includes incentives to foster domestic \nmanufacturing supply base for hybrid vehicle batteries. I am \nparticularly proud of the leadership role Missouri is playing in \nadvanced vehicles and batteries.\n  We make hybrid cars and trucks at Ford and GM in Kansas City. We also \nhave world leaders in advanced batteries in Kansas City. We know more \ncars and trucks partially running on electric power would save more \noil. We would conserve more.\n  Kansas City autoworkers know the good pay such manufacturing jobs \nwould bring. These families know the health care and retirement \nbenefits those jobs bring. I wish to see us create more good-paying, \nmiddle-class-supporting manufacturing jobs making advanced batteries in \nthe United States.\n  Right now, most all of the advanced batteries that go into hybrid \ncars and trucks are made in Japan, China, and Korea. With Asia \ncontrolling the battery market, supplies are tight and prices are high. \nThe availability is not always there.\n  As we know, when prices are high, we need to increase the supply to \nmeet demand. That goes for batteries as well as oil and gas.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act provides new financial incentives to \nincrease the U.S. domestic manufacturing supply base for hybrid vehicle \nbatteries.\n  Mass producing hybrid vehicle batteries in the United States will get \nbattery prices down, provide jobs for U.S. manufacturing workers, and \nreduce the demand for oil, helping us to conserve more and use less.\n  We should also address excess speculation, and the Gas Price \nReduction Act does that. While a lack of new oil supplies is the \nbiggest reason for high prices, we should make sure speculators are not \ndistorting or abusing the markets.\n  When you look at the price of oil and the prospect of it going up, is \nit any wonder retirement funds are investing in long-term oil futures? \nCalPERS, the California Public Employees Retirement System, has \ninvested billions of dollars for their public employees in a bet that \nover the long term, $145 oil would go to $200 to $250. Other public \nemployee retirement systems are making similar investment decisions. We \nneed to increase supply so they will not do it.\n  Our farmers and commodity traders need buyers and sellers to make the \nmarket work. But we should never allow purely financial interests to \nabuse the market and make people suffer.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act addresses potential speculation problems \nby putting more commodity cops on the beat to make sure our rules are \nrespected.\n  We can also consider how to close loopholes that have sprung up to \nescape trading rules as markets have become ever more sophisticated and \ncomplicated.\n  Most important, anything we do must not make things worse. So \nforemost on my mind will be protecting farmers, producers, and \nconsumers who depend on commodity markets. Airlines depend upon being \nable to get future supplies.\n  They have to be able to go after futures and not have them driven up \nby the expectation that there will be no more production out of the \nUnited States.\n  It is time for us to say, yes, we can to real action to lower gas \nprices. The Gas Price Reduction Act says, yes, we can to new \nproduction, increased conservation, addressing speculation. The \nAmerican people deserve this real relief. I urge its immediate \nadoption.\n  I hope the Democratic leader will make good on his promise to give us \nthe opportunity to have everybody vote on issues that will make a real \ndifference; no more playing Rules Committee, no more saying I don't \nwant this amendment or I am going to fill up the tree or I am only \ngoing to let you offer amendments I like.\n  Let us debate it. Let us have votes to see who is real about getting \ngas prices down and who wants to go through a show of motion to pretend \nthey are doing it and hope to fool voters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                            Emmett Till Bill\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \nmajority's leader remarks on the 83 supposed filibusters. I take great \nissue with that point. The process of filing cloture when a bill is \nfiled and then filing cloture on the actual bill 30 hours thereafter \nhas taken away from the Senate tradition. At 5:15 tonight, I have an \nhour reserved to go through and talk about many of these issues.\n  I wanted to take issue with the Emmett Till bill the majority leader \nmentioned. I actually support us spending money for that bill. What I \ndon't support, and I don't think most Americans support, is the over \n$100 million worth of waste every year in the Justice Department that \nhas been documented by the Congressional Research Service, the \nCongressional Budget Office, as well as the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  The majority leader voted against an amendment when this bill was \npart of another bill less than a year and a half ago to take $1.36 \nmillion out of waste in the Justice Department to pay for the Emmett \nTill bill. I met with Mr. Alvin Sykes. He is a hero of mine in terms of \nhis fastidiousness and his commitment to accomplish a goal. And he is \nright.\n  But the overall point is: Will we continue to grow the Government at \nthe same time we have tremendous waste within the Government? The issue \nwe are going to have over the majority leader's growth-in-Government, \nspend-\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\nmore-money bill is about whether we will do the same thing that \nfamilies have to do, which is make tough choices and prioritize.\n  It is easy to find $1.36 million in the Justice Department of all the \nwaste that is there. However, we refuse to do that. The majority leader \nrefuses to do that. He refuses to get rid of programs that are not \nworking and instead adds more programs.\n  This is a good program. I am totally for the intent of this \nlegislation. What I am not for is sacrificing the future of America's \nchildren by us not doing our job, by us not making the hard choices and \neliminating waste, eliminating duplication, eliminating fraud, and pass \nanother authorization bill that will be spent when we have that kind of \nwaste.\n  So the point is not whether we should go after civil rights \nviolations from the fifties and sixties. The point is will we do what \nthe American people expect us to do?\n  The majority leader claims this is a 99-to-1 issue. It is not. The \nreal issue is that 91 percent of the American people don't have \nconfidence in what we are doing. We ought to be a lot more worried \nabout that, when we do not do what is expected of us--eliminate waste, \neliminate fraud, eliminate abuse--and instead pass billions of dollars \nin more legislation.\n  I will spend some time at 5:15 p.m. delineating the potential bill \nthe majority leader is going to bring up on bills on which I and 56 \nother Senators have holds. But it is inaccurate and undeniably in error \nto say I am opposed to the Emmett Till Justice Act. I am not. I am for \nit. I just believe we ought to do two good things instead of one good \nthing and one bad thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from New Mexico be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to go back to the discussion about the \nsubject we want to devote a lot of attention to this week, and that is \ngas prices. Senator Bond spoke to that issue a little earlier. We are \ngoing to be going to that issue tomorrow. It is critical that we \naddress this problem before the August recess in a couple of weeks.\n  Forty-four Republicans have cosponsored the Gas Price Reduction Act, \nabout which Senator Bond spoke. It is a balanced approach to our energy \ncrisis. It recognizes the need for additional production, as well as \ndealing with the demand side. In other words, use less, find more, and \nto do so here at home, to use American energy to solve this American \ncrisis. That way we can have more control over our own destiny, a point \nI will be making in a moment.\n  The other side, though, has decided to approach this problem with a \nvery narrow and limited approach dealing with so-called speculators. \nSpeculators are people who trade in crude oil. There is a view that \nspeculators actually affect the price when they buy it or sell it.\n  The first point I wish to make is the opposition always talks about \ndriving up the price when speculators buy, but they never bother to \nmention that every time you buy, somebody else sells. So it is a little \nhard to see how speculators are responsible only for the increase. As a \nmatter of fact, last week was the largest drop in oil prices ever in \nour history, at least in the last couple of decades, over $20. I don't \nthink anybody blamed the speculators for the decline, or maybe I should \nsay they didn't cheer the speculators for the decline or drop in oil \nprices. So it is a little odd every time the price goes up, it is the \nspeculators' fault, but when the price goes down, well, maybe that is \nthe market forces taking control. The reality is that for every \npurchase, you have to have someone who is selling.\n  I did think it was interesting that the majority leader was here \nearlier and he actually attributed that decline to the fact that we \nwere talking about legislation dealing with speculators. I see no \nevidence to support that claim and, in fact, I will cite some evidence \nquite to the contrary in a moment. But it reminds me of a great fable \nwriter by the name of Stephen Leecock who tells the story about the two \nfleas on the back of the Roman chariot. They look back and say: My, \nwhat a fine cloud of dust we are creating. It seems to me that is \npretty similar to contending this speculation bill caused the drop in \nprices. I think we all know what it was. When President Bush announced \nthe end of the Executive moratorium on drilling, that is when the \nprices went down. As a matter of fact, Joseph Trevisani, who is the \nchief market analyst for a company called FX Solutions, said a few days \nago:\n\n       President Bush lifted the executive ban on offshore \n     drilling on Monday and by Friday crude prices had completed \n     their sharpest fall in percentage terms since 2004.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Oil traders are betting that this Congressional ban on \n     drilling which covers 85 percent of U.S. Continental waters \n     will not stand.\n\n  That is the point. When we start seriously talking about eliminating \nthe ban on production, that is when prices will go down. Why is that? \nSpeculators are actually very smart researchers who are trying to \nfigure out whether demand will exceed supply or supply will exceed \ndemand some time in the future--16 months out, 18 months, 2 years, 5 \nyears, whatever it might be. They do a lot of research to try to figure \nthis out. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you have a \nlegal ban on more production and you lift that ban, obviously you are \ngoing to potentially produce a lot more crude oil. That increase in \nsupply will obviously affect the price because it will then exceed the \ndemand or at least it will keep pace with demand. That is simple market \neconomics. That is what happened last week. It illustrates the fact \nthat while there are those who say if we increase our production, it is \ngoing to take 3 to 7 years before we will see any of that production, \nthe mere fact that we are getting serious about doing it was enough to \nreduce prices. I suspect if we actually pass a law that does it, the \nprices will decline even further and will continue to decline as \nprogress is made toward increased production.\n  The reality is that prices rise and fall depending on a lot of events \nthat are outside our control, and we need to bring more of those \ndecisions within our control. There is a hurricane in the gulf. Iran is \nrattling its sword in the Middle East. Those kinds of things cause the \nprices to go up because there is a suggestion that the supply may be \ninterrupted in the future. Then by the same token, we react to good \nnews, as occurred last week. When the President says we are going to \nremove the moratorium that by Executive order has been placed on \nproduction and Congress says we are considering legislation to remove \nthe congressional moratoria as well, speculators react to that as well.\n  The other side, which says it is all the speculators who are to blame \nfor the rising prices, might as well blame the weatherman for bad \nweather. His job is to do the research and predict what the weather is \ngoing to be. Muzzling him and saying he cannot talk about the weather \nis not going to create sunny days next week. Those days are going to \ncome because of weather factors, not because the expert in the field is \npredicting it one way or the other. It is the same thing with these so-\ncalled speculators who are in the business of buying, whether it is for \nan airline or a pension fund or for whomever. Their job is to try to \ndetermine what the market price should be at any given time.\n  I talked about trying to gain more control of it ourselves. \nUnfortunately, there are a lot of producers in the world that have an \ninterest in increasing the price of oil and have the means of doing so \nby simply acting badly. I am speaking of countries such as Russia, \nIran, and Venezuela. In Iran, we know they have rattled their sword in \nthe past, and that not only advances their national policy goals, but \nit also has a tendency to cause panic in the market and, therefore, the \nprices go up because there is a view there may not be an adequate \nsupply for the demand we have.\n  For example, I note the fact that all of the oil through the gulf--it \nis not just Iranian oil; it is from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, \nand other countries. About two-fifths of all globally traded oil goes \nthrough the Strait of Hormuz, and Iran is on one side of the Strait of \nHormuz. They have their ships in the area. At one time or another they \nhave tried to interfere with\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nthe shipping traffic lanes through the Strait of Hormuz.\n  For example, in June 2006, the threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear \nweapon created quite a stir among New York traders, and that drove the \nprice of oil up to nearly $80 a barrel. In 2007, five armed Iranian \nboats approached three U.S. Navy warships in international waters, \ntaking aggressive actions. The Pentagon described it as ``reckless and \ndangerous.'' The incident only lasted about 20 minutes. As a result, \nthere was a brief spike in oil prices as soon as that was reported on \nCNN.\n  The reality is that a country such as Iran can have an effect on the \nprice of oil. What we need to do is get away from that kind of \nsituation. The same thing is true of Russia. I talked about this the \nother day. Russia has a tendency when it wants--by the way, it is the \nsecond largest producer ahead of Saudi Arabia--when it wants to affect \nthe price of oil or national policy, it can cut off the supply of oil \nor natural gas, and that can result not only in shivers running through \nthe countries of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe which relies on \nthis natural gas and oil, but also affects the world price.\n  I note that Gazprom, which is Russia's natural gas monopoly, controls \na lot of other things as well. Its former chairman is Dmitry Medvedev, \nthe new President of Russia. It alone accounts for 25 percent of the \ncountry's tax revenues. So this is a major deal.\n  Russia has used Gazprom as a political tool in more than one \nsituation when it affected Ukraine after that nation allegedly failed \nto pay debts to Russia, or other European countries, such as the Czech \nRepublic when it said it would cooperate with the United States in \nmissile defense.\n  Let me conclude with Venezuela. President Chavez of Venezuela has \nrepeatedly threatened to cut off oil from that country. A 2006 GAO \nreport stated this cutoff could amount to increased oil prices of $11 \nper barrel and would cut American GDP by $23 billion.\n\n  The point here is that the United States needs to gain more control \nover its own destiny. We are the third largest producer in the world. \nWe have vast resources of natural gas and crude oil, as well as other \nresources, such as coal, uranium, and others, but we have an aversion \nto produce in this country because of the not-in-my-back-yard problem \nassociated with wherever that production might be. As a result, \nRepublicans have proposed legislation that would remove the moratoria \nthat currently preclude production and provide incentives to States to \npermit offshore. Even though it is far off of their State limits, in \nFederal waters, it would at least provide an incentive for them to \nagree to production offshore, thus enhancing American production and \nmore control over our own destiny.\n  That is the point I want to conclude with. It is time to gain control \nof our own destiny. It will enable us to affect the prices ourselves by \nproducing more and, thus, reducing prices, not relying so much upon \nother countries, which can adversely affect the price by withholding \nproduction or creating conflict in the world. It will enable us to \ndevelop the resources safely in an environmental way, because we know \nhow to do that. We know we can't conserve our way out of the problem. \nWe know the so-called renewables can only meet a small fraction of our \nneeds. And we further know that regulating speculators is not going to \nproduce one additional drop of oil. So that is why Republicans have \nfocused on more energy production--American energy for American \nconsumers--as a way to become less energy dependent and affect the \nprice in a meaningful way, a way which could permit us, as we saw last \nweek, to drastically reduce the price of oil almost overnight if \nCongress were to pass this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we take this matter up, as Senator Bond \nsaid, to permit a full and free debate, and amendments that we have to \noffer here, so at the end of the day Congress can complete our work \nover the next couple of weeks by passing meaningful legislation to \nreduce the cost of oil and, therefore, importantly for American \nconsumers, the price we pay at the pump.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may state his inquiry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator from New Mexico recognized at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I have \ncompleted my remarks, the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin \nthe process of moving to debate energy legislation--at least that is \nwhat we are told, and we hope we do in fact have a good, honest debate \nabout energy and that we on this side, which constitutes 49 Senators \nout of the 100, have an opportunity to offer 1 or 2 or 3, or some \nreasonable number, of amendments so as to make the case for the \nAmerican people that in fact we want to produce more energy; that we \nwant to both save energy and produce more; and we have every reason to \nbelieve that can be done.\n  With that in mind, we open the discussion, we begin the debate that \nshould end up in a number of days of discussion on real energy \nlegislation. And when I say real, I think the American people have \nawakened to the idea that Congress should and can pass legislation that \nwill produce more oil for the consumption of the world and America, and \nthus have the strong potential for dropping the price of gasoline, \nlowering the price of gasoline at the pump. So we are here to begin the \ndebate, a debate on how we might lower the price of gasoline at the \npump by using less and producing more.\n  Now, before I talk about my prepared remarks, I am going to say it is \ncommon knowledge in the oil and gas industry of America and the world \nthat offshore--off the shores of the United States--be it California or \nGeorgia, there exist large quantities of natural gas and crude oil, and \nthat there are ways today to discover precisely where that oil is and \nto build platforms that are impregnable, onto which the apparatus is \nmoved for the drilling of oil, and that from one such platform 10 or 12 \nmajor wells can be drilled underground--way down, many feet, in fact \nmiles below the surface--to produce oil and gas for the American \npeople.\n  As we begin this debate, it is interesting to note that it has been \n26, almost 27 years that these offshore oil and gas reserves owned by \nthe American people have been locked up in a moratorium, either \ncongressional or Executive. We note the other day the President lifted \nhis moratoria, wherever they were around the United States. He lifted \nthem. So what is left is the congressionally imposed, 1 year at a \ntime--and we have imposed it for 26 years--moratorium on using this \nvaluable resource because we were frightened and scared about the \ndamage it might cause, the harm that might be caused by going out and \ndrilling in the deep waters off the coasts of our country.\n  We have since found out, without question--during this 27 years of \ngetting oil elsewhere and expecting oil to be cheap--we found out \nduring that period of time that we can indeed locate and find and drill \nfor and produce and deliver oil and gas from the bottom, way down deep \nfrom the bottom of the coastal waters of America. Huge quantities of \noil and gas can be removed, can be piped out, with no damage and no \ndanger to anyone. That was proven with Katrina. When Katrina happened, \nAmerica had a number of platforms, deep-water platforms in existence, \nbecause some parts of the offshore were open and yielded large \nquantities of oil and gas. None of them was disrupted. None of them was \nbroken. None of the pipes were broken, and no environmental damage \noccurred from one of the most severe problems that came with Katrina \nand the hurricane that followed, as we all know.\n  Experts now tell us the price Americans are paying at the pump is the \nresult of global oil supply and demand imbalance. Having worked as a \nleader on energy legislation for 36 years in the Senate, I can honestly \nsay I have never seen a problem so big being met with proposals and \nproposed solutions that are so small. Again, experts tell us it is a \nsupply and demand problem and the legislation that will be before the \nSenate does nothing to address supply and demand.\n  Americans are clamoring for more energy production at home. They know\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\nthis is a serious problem that calls for serious solutions. It has been \n81 days since I introduced a bill called the American Energy Production \nAct of 2008. Since that time, the Senate has failed to act on adding \nnew supply measures. Since that time the price of oil has risen by \nnearly 15 percent, from $112 to $129 per barrel, even after last week's \ndecline.\n  Over that same time period, we have seen the other side offer a \nwindfall profits tax that has been uniformly rejected by nearly all \nenergy and economic experts across the ideological spectrum. In fact, \nthe architect of this very concept in the Carter administration has \nsaid that ``it's a terrible idea today.''\n  On price gouging, an issue once dismissed by top economic advisers to \nSenator Obama, the other side abandoned their flirtation with this \nissue after confirming it was grounded in fiction and unsupported by \nany evidence.\n  Then the majority sought the authority to sue OPEC, the OPEC nations, \nin the Federal courts of the United States for withholding energy \nsupplies. Perhaps the other side decided to abandon this concept when \nthey realized how much energy supply the Congress was responsible for \nlocking up.\n  Finally, the majority sought to increase taxes on the domestic energy \ncompanies, believing that increasing their business costs would somehow \nmake it easier to compete with much larger national oil companies in \ntheir quest for global commodities. Having failed repeatedly to achieve \nsuccess in increasing taxes, the other side has now decided to do so \nunder the auspices of additional production.\n  I have said before on the Senate floor in much greater detail that \nthe ``use it or lose it'' concept is an uninformed and ill-conceived \npolicy that will harm all our energy security and increase our energy \ncosts. In the midst of all these failed ideas, the majority brought a \nclimate change bill to the floor of the Senate that was estimated to \nincrease gas prices by as much as $1 per gallon over the coming years \nand would have resulted in even greater price increases for overall \nenergy costs.\n  The assertion that the majority knows how to deal with the problems \nof high energy costs is discredited by their continuous attempts to \nadvance policies that will raise the prices even higher. That is how we \nhave arrived here today. After a series of failed ideas and \ncounterproductive policies and counterproductive policy proposals, the \nother side seeks to set up another smokescreen against the force of \noverwhelming public opinion, and Senate Republicans united to increase \ndomestic energy production.\n  The other side seems content to create another politically motivated \ndiversion from the serious problem which stares us in the face. And lo \nand behold, as we start this discussion, the American people have seen \nthrough it all and they have come to the conclusion that it is time, as \nthey put it, to drill for more oil and gas if it is ours. We have \ncalled it exploration off the shores of America, where much oil and gas \nhas been locked up for 27 years, where we have imposed moratoria based \nupon our concern and our fears that should not have existed. We tied up \nthe oil and gas that belongs to Americans, and they are saying ``get on \nwith it.'' No more smokescreens, no more politically motivated \ndiversions. Let's stare this problem right in the face and get on \nproducing more and saving more. I repeat, in all my years in the Senate \nI have never seen a problem so big met with a proposed solution that is \nso small.\n\n  But I do not come to the Senate floor simply to reject the ideas of \nthe other side. I rise to speak today, to share with the Senate some \nideas supported by facts about how we can address the serious supply \nand demand imbalance that confronts us. My proposed American Energy \nProduction Act, as well as the Gas Price Reduction Act, introduced by \nour Republican leader, Senator McConnell, would help ensure an adequate \nand affordable supply of energy in both the near term and the long \nterm.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator McConnell and by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, myself, would allow Atlantic and Pacific States to \ninitiate oil and gas production from the deep seas, regions that are \nbelieved to contain, at a minimum, 14 billion barrels of oil.\n  We know this is a minimum because we have not bothered to inventory \nthese deep water assets for 20 or 30 years or more. We must understand \nthat during this period of time, with new techniques, new technology, \nnew ways of discovery and new ways of delivery, these underwater \nreservoirs are going to yield much more oil and gas than we ever \nimagined, as we looked at them with old-time techniques, 20 and 30 and \n40 years old.\n  This legislation would reverse a congressional ban on regulations for \noil shale leases--the ``rules of the road'' that industry must have \nbefore they will invest in significant resources. That is another asset \nwe have which exists in three Western States. We need the rules of the \nroad which have been locked up, again, by a moratorium imposed in the \nInterior appropriations bill in the dead of night, with no debate and \nno one to watch it. That must be removed so that giant potential for \noil will be the source of investment by oil companies that seek new and \ninnovative ways to turn that shale, which abounds in oil, into usable \noil or usable diesel, which could certainly alleviate America's \nproblems.\n  We also propose establishing a program of direct loans and grants to \naccelerate the production of advanced batteries in the United States. \nThese are crucial to advanced vehicles such as plug-in hybrids, which \npromise to reduce our Nation's consumption of oil and our greenhouse \ngas emissions. Thus, we will be producing more and using less because, \nwith this battery research reaching fruition, producing batteries that \ngive many more miles for the wheels that carry the electric cars--\nclearly, when we get that we will be saving oil because we will not use \nas much gas to service our automobile fleets.\n  These batteries are critical to advanced vehicles, the plug-in \nhybrids which we are talking about, and which hold so much promise.\n  I am also willing to look at ways to improve the transparency of the \nmarkets and the ability of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nenforce its authority. The legislation introduced last month by the \nRepublican leader would strengthen our oversight of the markets by \nadding more enforcement and increasing transparency. Republicans are \nopen to working with the majority on speculation. It is time now for \nthe majority to work with us on production. Production is a far bigger \npart of the solution to the American concern for ever-escalating prices \nof gas for automobiles and natural gas for use in various parts of our \ndaily lives.\n  I look forward to an open debate. Clearly, the issues we attempt to \naddress on the production side and on the side of saving through \nelectric automobiles are a much bigger part of the American problem \nthan the problem that the majority leader attempts to solve in his \nantispeculation bill, which a number of us have had a chance to read \nnow and to discuss with experts. We will have more to say about it. \nSuffice it to say that it would certainly not be a major part of \nsolving the energy problem for the American people. There is no \nquestion about it. All you would have to do is submit the bill to \nanybody who knows about commodities and about futures markets, and they \nwill tell you that bill we are going to talk about is not calculated to \ndo a lot of good.\n  As we move toward a new policy, it is important that we do so with \nevery good intention. We want the majority leader to know we respect \nhis approach to bringing up, through rule XIV, his bill. But we believe \nwe are entitled to offer amendments to it--certainly not just one but \nenough amendments to make our case.\n  The Democratic leader wants to talk about speculation. We say let's \nalso talk about production. There is no question, if you are going to \ntalk about the problem confronting the American people, and you put up \na speculation bill--that you are not even sure will work, but it is \nthere--that those who have some real interest in increasing production \ndeserve an opportunity to offer their amendments and to be heard.\n  To address this imbalance it is logical that we seek policies to \nincrease our supply and decrease demand. I urge my colleagues on the \nother side to join\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\nus in this effort and do something big for the American people because \nthe problem is big. It is not a little problem. It is a very big \nproblem.\n  I believe the next 3 or 4 days will shed some light for the American \npeople on the issue of whether they, the American people, own the \nsubstantial quantities of oil and gas that are off our shores that in \nthe next few years can be the subject matter of new modern techniques \nfor drilling and gathering the oil and gas for use by the American \npeople, thus reducing the heavy pressure put upon the world's supply of \noil and natural gas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is an interesting debate because it \nis really coming down to some different points of view. As both sides \npresent their cases, I am sure the American people will listen \ncarefully because there is hardly an issue we can discuss that hits \neach and every family and each and every person so personally. This is \nthe sign that you see in front of the gas station every morning when \nyou drive to work, every weekend when you start to fill up. This is \nwhat you face when you go to fill up that car or truck and reach into \nyour wallet for your credit card or cash and realize this is the most \nyou have ever paid for gasoline in your life.\n  This is real. This isn't some theoretical possibility that it may \naffect your life. This debate is about reality. So it is important that \nthe people who are following this debate understand there are two very \ndifferent points of view.\n  The view expressed by the Senator from New Mexico is one that I think \nmost Republicans now espouse. It is this: if we could just drill more \noil, we would have a larger supply, and it would bring down the cost. \nIf the cost goes down, then the price of gasoline goes down and, thank \ngoodness, we will get some relief at the gasoline pump.\n  It is a good theory, and it is their starting point, but it has some \nweaknesses. The first weakness is, if you take a look at all of the oil \nthe United States has within its boundaries and offshore, all of this, \nthe estimate of all the oil we could reach at any given time in the \nUnited States represents 3 percent of the world's supply of oil. Most \nof our oil comes from other places--Canada, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia. Our \noil, U.S. oil, is 3 percent of the world's total. How much oil do we \nconsume in the United States? We consume 25 percent of the world's \nproduction. We cannot drill our way out if we drill every drop of oil \navailable to us anywhere, onshore and offshore. We could not meet the \nclear demand of the largest economy in the world.\n\n  Simply, drilling does not answer the challenge. It ignores the \nreality that China, India, and many other countries which, for the \nlongest time, didn't use as much oil as the United States, now are \nstarting to use more--more cars, more trucks, more industry. Their \ndemand for that same world oil supply is putting a strain on the \nmarket. There is no question about it.\n  The second question, obviously, is, is there a place, someplace in \nthe United States--either onshore or offshore--where there is the \nanswer to our prayers immediately, where we could say: For goodness \nsake, clear the decks, stop the regulators, get the derricks out, and \nlet's drill. Bring out that oil and, for goodness sake, bring down the \nprice of gasoline. Is there such a place?\n  The answer is no, honestly, because those who are involved in the \nindustry tell us anytime we decide to drill on another acre of land, it \nis a decision which will lead to production of oil anywhere from 8 to \n14 years from now--8 to 14 years. Why? They have to go in and map the \nland. They have to figure out where the oil might be. They have to do \nsome testing. They have to find some equipment.\n  Incidentally, all the oil equipment for offshore drilling right now \nis in use. There is nothing like an inventory waiting to be dragged out \nand put in just the right spot. It is not there. It takes years to get \nin the queue, to bring these oil exploration operations on line. Once \nthey are on line, production starts slowly and builds. And that is the \nreality that explains the 8 to 14 years.\n  So we do not have any oil in the United States to take care of \nourselves indefinitely, and we don't have this mother lode of oil \nsomewhere that if we could just tap it tomorrow, it is going to answer \nour prayers.\n  Then there is the third issue. The third issue is the Federal \nGovernment, which controls a lot of land within the United States and \noff our shores, continually offers to the oil and gas companies the \nopportunity to lease that land and explore it for gas and oil. If you \nlisten to the other side, you would think we are squandering--holding \nback all of these oil and gas assets from oil and gas companies and \ndaring and defying them to go forward with exploration and production. \nThat is not the case.\n  President Bush and the Republicans and the oil companies want to \ngreatly expand the available areas for drilling. But is it responsible? \nThe Federal Government already offers tracts of land in offshore \nregions for oil and natural gas development. In fact, nearly 94 million \nacres of U.S. territory--that is a larger landmass than the size of the \nState of Utah--is currently under lease to the oil and gas companies \nwho believe there is oil and gas to be found. That is twice the size of \nthe State of Pennsylvania currently under lease.\n  It is not as if access has been restricted. The Government leases \nmillions of new acres every year. An additional 4.6 million acres of \nFederal land was leased in 2007. The Bureau of Land Management has held \n21 onshore lease sales already this year. Last week a sale was held for \nnearly 63,000 acres. BLM has 18 more lease sales scheduled through this \nyear. Offshore lease sales have proceeded at an even faster pace.\n  Since the beginning of 2007, the Minerals Management Service has held \nsix lease sales for open areas off the Outer Continental Shelf in the \nGulf of Mexico and in Alaska's Chukchi Sea.\n  How much offshore oil land has been offered? It is 115 million acres \nthat has been offered to the oil and gas companies for a lease on which \nto drill. How big a territory is 115 million acres?\n  Most people, certainly in my State and around the country, know \nInterstate 80.\n  It starts over here in New Jersey and ends in California. If you were \nto take a 628-mile swath along Interstate 80 from New Jersey to \nCalifornia, that would represent 115 million acres. That is what we \nhave offered to the oil and gas companies to lease; land they can look \nat and explore and find oil and gas and produce it.\n  The oil companies, that said they do not have enough land to look at \nfor future oil and gas, have responded by saying they would like to \nhave 12 million acres, that is the amount of seabed the oil companies \nput bids on, barely 10 percent of what we offered them.\n  In my I-80 comparison, that would take you from New Jersey to \nPennsylvania, about 310 miles. Look at the big stretch they are not \ninterested in bidding on. We hear from the Republicans: There is no \nplace for them to turn. But when we offered them the land, they turned \nit down. They are not using the leased land they currently have either. \nThis next chart shows there are 68 million acres of Federal land \ncurrently leased to the oil and gas companies. What you see is kind of \na shot of the Western part of the United States. The leased land that \nis under production is the dark areas, the black areas.\n  The red areas represent leased land by the Federal Government to the \noil companies that they pay for--they do not force them to take it, \nthey pay for it, they pay an annual lease for the right for oil and gas \nproduction. The red areas represent areas they lease and are currently \nnot exploring or producing on.\n  So you see the argument that there is not enough land out there for \nthem to look at defies explanation. When we open it for bid, they will \nnot bid on it. When they do lease it, they do not explore it and use \nit. Does that sound like there is a lack of supply here of land that \nthey can turn to? That is the Republican argument.\n  They do argue that there is one little spot, one spot in the United \nStates of America where they can find oil, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, 1.56 million acres. Now how much is there? I do not know. But I \nwill tell you that next door to the ANWR is the National Petroleum \nReserve of Alaska, which has been established specifically for oil and \ngas development.\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\n  There are 23 million acres of land there available. We have held four \nlease sales in that area since 1999. So far they have leased 3.6 \nmillion acres out of the 23 million. We are going to try to lease some \nmore there to see if there is any interest. All this talk about Alaska \nbeing the answer to our prayers, they do not explain as well that it is \n10 or 12 years away, if there is any production, and when, if it ever \ncame in, even at the wildest estimates, it would not have any impact of \nmore than pennies or nickels on the actual cost of oil and the price of \ngasoline.\n  I joined with Senators Dodd and Menendez to charge oil companies a \nfee for every acre they lease but do not use for production. I have \nheard critics on the other side say that is unfair to the oil \ncompanies. Why should they be able to tie up the land if they are not \ngoing to use it? Should not we make it available to oil companies that \nmight explore and might produce on that land? Is that not what we need? \nEven the Republicans would have to agree with that argument.\n  When it comes to offshore drilling, I mentioned the 68 million acres. \nThe red areas are Federal offshore land leased to oil companies which \nthey are currently not exploring or producing on. The dark acres, they \nare. There is a lot of land available.\n  I wish to say a word about speculation too. We have offered to the \nRepublicans the following. We have a bill, a bill which I was at least \npartially responsible for writing, which says we need more regulators \nto keep an eye on speculation when it comes to oil and its prices.\n  I think that is something that is eminently reasonable. This is a \ngood indication. In the year 2000, 37 percent of the oil futures market \nwas for speculators. These are basically investment companies, \ninvestment banks. And 63 percent represented companies that were \nactually hedging the price of oil, because they used oil, such as \nairlines.\n  Look how that has changed in the last 8 years. Seventy-one percent of \nthe oil futures market is in the hands of speculators who literally \nnever take control of the oil they are bidding on, and only 29 percent \nrepresent companies that use it for the purpose that most of us would \nagree it should be intended.\n  So we know speculation is growing when it comes to oil, and we know \nthe transactions have gone up 600 percent in the last 8 or 10 years. \nThe size of the agency that regulates it has not; in fact, it has \ndeclined. We want to put 100 more regulators, overseers, in this agency \nto keep an eye on this energy futures market to see if there is \nexcessive speculation or even manipulation and do something about it.\n  The bill I introduced, and the one that is included in the Democratic \nplan, would increase by 100 the number of full-time employees involved \nin regulation. We would also put more money into computer technology so \nthey can follow these markets even more closely. We would have more \ntransparency when it comes to these markets so we understand who is \ntrading what and when, so if we see big movements in the market, our \npeople who are keeping an eye on it can look more closely.\n  I think most agree we want to bring more markets into regulation, not \njust NYMEX in New York but the ICE exchange in London. They are \nagreeable to this regulation. We would also like to bring in, if we \ncan, the over-the-counter markets, which frankly we do not even know \nthe size of. There are companies that are involved in swaps and over-\nthe-counter trades, done almost on a private basis with no disclosure. \nWe do not know what is going on in these markets. I think we should.\n  So this kind of disclosure and transparency is part of it. We also \ntry to make sure that as we do, in many other commodities, that we \nlimit the size of trades. If you are involved in this futures market, \nbecause your airline needs to make certain that you are not burned by \nfuture oil prices, we want you to be able to trade. That is a so-called \ncommercial use of the futures market, a healthy thing. Southwest \nAirlines has proven that. But for those in the market simply to play \nthe game, to speculate, we think there ought to be a limit on how far \nthey can go.\n  I think that may be one of the major differences between the \nRepublican and Democratic positions. But the point I wish to make is \nthat speculation itself is not inherently evil. Excessive speculation \nshould be followed carefully to make sure that it is not getting out of \nhand. Manipulation is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Now, some on the other side--Senator Kyl of Arizona--got up and said \nwhat is happening in futures, as a matter of fact, is give and take, \nsupply and demand, things happen, and people try to guess whether they \nare going to impact the price of oil.\n  Well, there are a lot of experts who take a look at the future price \nof oil. This chart tells you that one of the Federal agencies that is \ninvolved in this, that we spend a lot of money on, has been giving its \nestimate since May of 2007 of what would happen to the price of oil.\n  Here it was starting at $65 a barrel. They said in May of 2007, it \nwas likely to go below $60. Then, in July of 2007, they made a new \nestimate. They said: Well, it is now $67, $68 a barrel, it will \nprobably be going down to $66 a barrel, and so forth. So you can see \nthe lines of their predictions. These are the experts hired by the \nFederal Government who took a look at market conditions, supply and \ndemand, and made the flowing estimates on where the prices could go.\n  This red line, incidentally, reflects what happened to the prices. \nThis is how much they missed it. They did not see that it was headed \nnorth of $125 a barrel and did not even expect that to happen. They did \nnot find any market conditions that would drive it up that high. That \nis why some of us want to ask the question: How much of today's current \nprice of oil and price of gasoline has to do with market speculation?\n  There are a lot of different points of view. Here is Secretary \nBodman's point of view, June 11 of this year: The reason we are looking \nat these very high prices for oil is strictly supply and demand.\n  That is the administration's position. No surprise. Our President and \nVice President come from the oil industry. The oil industry has done \npretty well under their watch. The people they have appointed to the \nCabinet think this is the market at work.\n\n  But there are others on the outside who see it a little differently. \nThe New Jersey Star Ledger, January of this year: Experts, including \nthe former head of Exxon, say financial speculation in the energy \nmarkets has grown so much over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to \n30 percent or more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n  And here is a specific individual, Stephen Simon, a senior vice \npresident at ExxonMobil, testifying under oath before the House of \nRepresentatives, who said: The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 \nper barrel.\n  It is more than twice what it ought to be. So when we want to have \nmore resources to look at speculation in the energy futures market, I \ndo not think it is unreasonable. I think we can protect the legitimate \ncommercial application of the futures market for airlines and others, \nthose that need it, and still do our best to slow down excessive \nspeculation and manipulation that lead to higher prices.\n  We have been trying to get an agreement with the Republicans about \nhow to proceed because I think the worst thing that can occur is that \nwe do nothing. We want to do something.\n  First, address speculation with the Democratic bill. We have said to \nRepublicans: Offer your version. If you do not want to offer a bill, \nvote against ours if you wish. But we offer you this opportunity to put \nyour amendment on the floor on speculation, whatever it happens to be. \nWe will go head to head, one amendment against the other. We will have \na pretty good debate, I am sure. We will have the same vote requirement \nfor both. We will let the Senate work its will. It is a 51 to 49 \nSenate. It takes 60 votes to pass a measure of this complexity. Let's \nsee what happens. I think that is fair. How can they argue? They get to \nwrite their own version of their amendment. If they do not think \nspeculation is an issue, they do not have to offer anything.\n  The second thing we offered them is: Prepare the Republican approach \nto dealing with the energy crisis, put it in a package. You write it, \nwe have nothing to say about it, as long as it is clearly about energy. \nPut yours on the table. We will put ours on the table.\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\nLet's debate both of them. Let's vote on both of them. Let's have the \nsame vote requirement for both of them. At the end of the day, let's \nsee who prevails. I do not think that is unreasonable.\n  Now, there are some on the other side, the Senator from New Mexico \nmentioned earlier, who want to offer more amendments. I am not opposed \nto more amendments. But there is a reasonable limit to this. We would \nlike to end this in a timely fashion, so we can actually get something \ndone.\n  If there are those who want to filibuster or run out the clock on \neither side of the aisle, then I cannot say I am going to support that \npoint of view. This could be worked out. It should start this week. \nThis ought to be an issue we can resolve, at least the debate, before \nwe leave next week. We can do it. I think if we have a meeting of the \nminds, and a fair approach, we can see that done in the very near \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me thank the assistant \nmajority leader, the Senator from Illinois, for his comments. I was \nlistening intently to his message, which I think is one that is very \nimportant for this Nation.\n  The Senator talked about the fact that there is a significant amount \nof land currently available for drilling, and for reasons that are a \nlittle bit unclear, the oil industry has decided not to drill in those \nareas.\n  He also expressed his confusion, as I do, as to why the Republicans \nhave come forward and said: Let's talk about the energy issue, let's do \nsomething about it.\n  But when it comes time to vote as to whether we can proceed on a bill \nthat is important for our energy needs, the Republicans seem to vote \nagainst that so we cannot proceed.\n  We had a bill before us that would have dealt with renewable energy \nsources and would allow us to deal with solar and wind and biomass and \nbiodiesel. The Republicans refused to allow us to move forward on that, \nrequiring the 60-vote threshold so we could not move forward on a major \nbill dealing with renewables, which is clearly an important part of an \nenergy policy for this Nation.\n  We had the Consumer-First Energy Act, legislation that would have \nbrought forward a way to deal with the immediate cost of energy. The \nRepublicans refused to allow us to proceed, used the filibuster to \nblock that legislation that would have dealt with issues such as the \noil cartel and the anticompetitive procedures they use to control \nsupply and price of oil or to deal with price gouging or to look at \nways we could take some of our resources and put them into renewables \nso we have a policy for the future or to deal with oil speculators.\n  But, no, the Republicans used the filibuster to prevent a full debate \non the floor of this body to talk about the energy policies of this \ncountry. So I return to the floor to tell Marylanders and the people of \nthis Nation we need to do something about this. Marylanders are hurting \ntoday. I have talked about this before on the floor.\n  I can take you to some homes of seniors who are making a very \ndifficult judgment not to use air-conditioning this summer during these \noppressive days, which may very well jeopardize their health, because \nthey do not have the money to pay for their utility bills.\n  They are making these tough decisions today in my State and States \naround the Nation. I could give you examples of independent truckers \nwho are located in Maryland who do not have the money to fill their \ntrucks with fuel because of the high cost of gasoline.\n  They don't know what they are going to do, whether they will be able \nto stay in business. I can tell you of small business owners I have met \nwho tell me they don't have any alternatives. They have to use their \ncars for business. They have to fill up the car with gasoline, and they \ncan't afford to do it. They are using their personal credit cards, the \nmost expensive way to borrow money, because of the high cost of \ngasoline. They are looking to us to do something so they can stay in \nbusiness.\n  I could take my colleagues to families who have to make tough \njudgments as to whether they can fill their gas tanks with gas or buy \ngroceries because of the high cost of gasoline.\n  I met with people from the nonprofit community. We had people in from \nMeals on Wheels, volunteers who deliver food to people who can't get \nout of their homes and depend upon a nonprofit in order to get meals. \nIn these tough economic times, there is more and more demand for their \nservices, but their volunteers can't afford to fill their tanks with \ngasoline. They are doing on it their own, because we are asking them to \npay the extra cost of the fuel. They are having a tough time being able \nto carry out their nonprofit mission, which will put more pressure on \ngovernmental services.\n  The list goes on and on as to why we need to deal with the energy \ncrisis now and why we should have dealt with it before but for the \nfilibusters Republicans have used.\n  The Republican answer to this problem seems to be to drill. Let me \ntake up that issue for a moment. Most recoverable offshore oil and gas \nis currently open to drilling. Today most of our offshore oil areas are \nopen to drilling. According to the Minerals Management Service, 79 \npercent of recoverable oil is currently open to drilling and 82 percent \nof recoverable natural gas is currently open to drilling. According to \nthe Department of Interior, only 21 percent of the Outer Continental \nShelf is actually in production. My friend from Illinois gave the \nnumbers: 68 million acres of the 90 million acres of the Outer \nContinental Shelf are not in production today. There is plenty of area \navailable for drilling, but the oil industry has chosen not to drill in \nthose areas. Instead they keep on mentioning ANWR, the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. That is a pretty sensitive environmental area. We all \nknow that. We know the risks involved in drilling in ANWR. It would \nrepresent .6 percent of the world's supply. The National Petroleum \nReserve in Alaska, which has been set aside for oil exploration, \ncurrently has available but not in production more oil reserves than \nare in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. So this isn't a point about \nwhere we have oil, we need to drill in order to get it. We have oil \navailable. But the oil industry has chosen not to do this.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, projections in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf access case indicate that access to the \nPacific, Atlantic, and eastern gulf regions would not have a \nsignificant impact on domestic crude oil or natural gas production \nprices before 2030.\n  The reason is we don't have a lot of oil in the United States. If we \ninclude all of the oil reserves, we have 3 percent of the world's \nreserves. We use 25 percent of the world's oil. We have 3 percent of \nthe world's known reserves. So even if we produce at maximum capacity, \nwe will not have a major impact on the pricing of energy.\n  It is for that reason I want to show this chart showing remarks from \nT. Boone Pickens, who said:\n\n       I have been an oilman all my life, but this is one \n     emergency we can't drill our way out of. . . .\n\n  He goes on to point out:\n\n        . . . But if we create a new, renewable energy network, we \n     can break our addiction to foreign oil.\n\n  If we produce every drop of oil we have in the United States, we are \nstill going to be dependent upon foreign oil. We have to break our \ndependency on foreign oil. As Mr. Pickens points out, either in the \nshort term or long term, oil is not the solution to our energy problem.\n  Having said that, I do believe we need to produce oil where we can. I \nam baffled as to why the oil industry is not using the 79 percent of \ncurrently leased area to produce more oil that would certainly be part \nof the solution to the energy problem. We can't drill our way out, but \nwe certainly should produce what we can. Maybe this chart helps explain \nwhy the oil industry is not drilling where they can. The blue line \nrepresents the price of gasoline, showing when it was about $1.50 a \ngallon, going up to now where it is close to $4 a gallon. The red line \nrepresents the profits of the oil industry. It is amazing. As gasoline \nprices go up, oil profits go up. These are quarterly profits. So one \nmight suspect that the oil industry is not exactly interested in \nbringing down the cost of gasoline. Their profits go up, as the costs \ngo up. Maybe that helps explain some of the reason why production is \nnot at the maximum capacity we currently could have.\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\n  Let me urge my colleagues as to what we should be doing. In the short \nterm, we need to look at a lot of different alternatives. Again, I am \nfor producing what we can in an environmentally sensitive way, but I \nurge my colleagues to consider S. 3268, the excess speculation bill. \nLet me try to make this clear. We are dealing with what is known as \nindex speculation. These are speculators who never take the product. \nThey are allocating a part of their portfolio to oil futures. It is an \ninvestment for them. It is not a commodity transaction. These are not \nairline companies or trucking companies that do want to buy futures in \noil because they need that for their business. They are going to take \nthe product because they need the product. These are pure speculators.\n  According to Michael Masters, a hedge fund manager, index speculators \nadded to the supply equal to China's increase in demand of oil over the \npast 5 years. That is a dramatic amount of activity in the marketplace. \nIt is equal to 70 percent of all the benchmark crude trading on the New \nYork Mercantile Exchange; 70 percent is in index speculators. Just 7 \nyears ago it was 37 percent. So we see the dramatic increase over the \nhistoric levels of commodity trading.\n  My friend from Illinois indicated that perhaps oil should be at $60 a \nbarrel. Masters says $60 to $75 a barrel, if Congress fixed the \nloophole in index speculation. Edward Krapels, an energy security \nanalyst, says it is 50 percent of the pump price. I am not an \neconomist. I don't know what it is. But I do know this is something we \ncan do, and it could have an immediate impact on the price of gasoline \nat the pump. That is what my constituents are asking us to do. This is \nsomething we should do. We should not let speculators add to the price.\n  S. 3268 reins in index speculation. It provides higher margin \nrequirements for those who speculate, more disclosure. This is common \nsense. Let's get this done.\n  If we are looking for other things we can do to help in the short \nterm, let me encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nwithdraw their objections to the bill Senator Sanders has introduced \nthat would add resources to the LIHEAP program. That is for energy \nassistance for low-income families. If we are looking for who has been \nhurt by the energy crisis, it is low-income families throughout \nAmerica. Let's do something to help them. Let's target our relief to \nthose who have been disadvantaged as a result of what has happened to \nenergy prices.\n  These are some things we can do that can have some impact in the \nshort term. I must tell my colleagues, I hope we don't leave this \ndebate without talking about what we need to do in the long term so we \ndon't come back to this issue. I would hope that in the 1970s we would \nhave learned our lesson, with long gasoline lines, and done something \nfor energy security in America. But we need to become energy \nindependent. We need to become energy secure. We need to do this for \nnational security reasons. I need not remind my colleagues that we have \ncommitted our Armed Forces because of the vulnerability of America to \noil. So for national security, we need to become energy independent.\n  We need to become energy independent for our environment. Global \nclimate change is real. Using less oil, fossil fuels will make us a \ncleaner country and will help our environment. It is something we \nshould be doing.\n  We came close this year to moving forward on a global climate change \nbill. We should do that for the sake of our environment and our energy \npolicy. What we have learned over the last several months is that when \nwe don't control our energy, when we are dependent upon other countries \nfor our energy needs; i.e., oil, overnight we can see a huge increase \nin the price of energy which can have a devastating impact on our \neconomy. I don't know what the right price is for energy, but I do know \nif we controlled our own energy sources, our economy would make that \njudgment, not some country halfway around the world that decides how \nmuch oil will be available to the U.S. consumer.\n\n  For all those reasons, we need to become energy independent. One way \nwe can do that--and we have all agreed--is to be more efficient in the \nuse of energy. Last year we came together and increased the CAFE \nstandards. If we had done that 10 years ago, the energy savings today \nfrom an increased CAFE standard on an annual basis would equal three \ntimes the amount of oil we could get from ANWR at maximum production. \nEnergy efficiency works. It has to be part of our energy policy as we \nmove forward.\n  Yes, we have to deal with alternative and renewable sources. We have \nto deal with biofuels and wind and solar. I also believe we need to \nhave responsible use of nuclear power. I think that is an important \npart of an energy policy that makes us energy self-sufficient. We can \ndo that.\n  We need a national commitment. We made that type of commitment, as we \ndid before, when our national security was at stake during World War \nII. We can do it again. We can be equally successful.\n  I have an offer to my colleagues. On behalf of the people of Maryland \nand of the Nation, let's get together on this. This is a national \npriority. It should not be a partisan issue. This is an issue Americans \nare asking that we deal with, that we become energy independent, that \nwe do what is responsible in the short term to help those who have been \nvictimized by the extreme increase in energy costs. Let's work to do \nthat. Let's take out the profits of the speculators. Let's deal with \nthose who have been victimized and then work together to develop an \nenergy policy for America that will truly make us energy independent so \nthat we can control our security, our economy, and be good \ninternational citizens on the environment. We can do all of that by \nworking together and putting America's interests first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I believe under the unanimous consent, I \nhave an hour to speak. I ask unanimous consent that I be allotted an \nhour to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to spend a little bit of time this evening talking \nabout motivations, talking about a realistic assessment of where we \nare and then merge those two things with some of the actions that \nmyself and others in the Senate are doing.\n\n  One of the things we all know but we do not like to talk about is the \nsignificant, unsustainable course our country is on. Numbers can be \nreally boring, but they are not boring when you apply what is going to \nhappen to our children and grandchildren.\n  This first chart I have in the Chamber shows Government spending as a \npercentage of GDP. It has gone higher than that at times of war in the \npast. But here is where we are today at 2008. We are right around 20 \npercent. These are not my numbers. These are Government Accountability \nOffice--these are the Medicare and Social Security trustee numbers. If \nwe do not start doing something about wasteful Washington spending, \nabout reform of waste, about elimination of fraud, about duplication of \nprograms--2 or 3 or 20 doing the same thing, none of them doing it \nefficiently--what is going to happen to us under our current policy is \nthat by 2038 we are going to have 35 percent of our GDP spent by the \nGovernment.\n  Well, what does that really mean? What happens to us when 35 percent \nof everything we produce comes to the Government and the Government \ndeals it back out? Well, what it really means is less liberty. What it \nreally means is less freedom. Because what it does is it takes the \nresources of Americans out of their pockets and out of their families \nand transfers it to a government bureaucracy that then mandates how \ndollars will be spent.\n  These numbers are not disputable. Nobody will dispute this is the \nroadmap we are on. As shown on this chart, this is where we are going. \nWhat happens is, the results of that become a markedly lower standard \nof living for our children and grandchildren. As we look at that, we \nsee other things that are happening to us that are very harmful. As a \nmatter of fact, they are affecting us greatly right now.\n  The debt held by the public--that is debt that is exclusive of the \nmoney we have stolen from Social Security, from Federal employees' \nretirement funds,\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\nfrom the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and from about 60 other trust \nfunds the Government continually steals excess money from and spends \nbut does not recognize the debt--that is exclusive of all this. This is \nthe debt that is out there that people have actually bought: T-bills or \nTreasury notes or Treasury bonds. About a third to 40 percent is now \nheld by foreign governments.\n  If you think this cannot impact us as a nation, we need to think \nabout what happened when France and England started to take the Suez \nCanal back from the Egyptians, and because we owned the majority of \nFrance's and England's debt, we said: If you do this, we will put your \ndebt on the market. We will collapse your economy. So, consequently, \ntwo allies of ours did not do a very foolish thing and, through the \neconomic power we had of owning their debt, we accomplished very \npowerful foreign policy objectives.\n  Well, the reverse of that is about to be true for our country when we \nhave $300 billion to $500 billion sitting in China today, when we have \n$300 billion to $500 billion sitting in the Middle East. What would \nhappen if they decide to dump our debt? So by being less than fiscally \nproper, by not being frugal, what we have done is put our foreign \npolicy at risk by having a larger and larger percentage of our debt \nheld by foreign sovereign governments.\n  As you can see by this chart, what is happening is, in 2008, we are \nat about 20 percent of our GDP being held by the public. But another 20 \npercent is internal in terms of what we have stolen. As that rises, the \nrisk to our children, the risk to our Nation, the risk to us for an \neffective foreign policy--because we are now leveraged by what someone \nmight do with our debt--starts impacting us in a tremendous way.\n  The other trend that is not sustainable and even more worrisome is \nthe makeup of our GDP as a percentage of the Government, the things we \nreally have not fixed or have not addressed. If you look at our total \nrevenues, which are estimated to be around 20 percent, if they stay \nhistorically at that level, how much we take from the Americans--which \nwe are not going to if we are going to maintain the programs of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--but if you leave them there \nand then you look at the growth of Government that is mandated just on \ndemography alone, just on the fact that the baby boomers--my age--are \ngrowing old, what we see is that Social Security rises, Medicare rises, \nMedicaid rises, but net interest becomes over 50 percent of everything \nwe pay out. Notice all the other functions of Government actually \ndecline. The things that make a difference in your life every day \nactually get squeezed down.\n  So we are on an unsustainable course. There is no question we are on \nan unsustainable course, and we have before us today--the majority \nleader spoke about introducing a bill. I want to spend a little bit of \ntime talking about the bill. We have not seen the bill. We are guessing \nwhat is in the bill--but a bill that is going to spend between $25 \nbillion and $50 billion more, is going to create over 77 new programs, \nis going to grow these numbers even more.\n  That bill is coming about because myself and several other Senators \nhave refused to allow those bills to go without debate on this floor \nand without the ability to amend them. Now, some of them are very good \nthings we ought to be about. But we should not be about it until we are \ngoing to inculcate and act as Senators the same way every other family \nin this country has to act; that is, by making a decision based on \npriorities. If people get to take a vacation this year, they are taking \nthat vacation because they have scrimped somewhere else to be able to \nafford the fuel, to be able to afford the cost. They have made a \ndecision within their family budget that what they are doing is a \npriority compared to the other priorities. Well, the American public is \nnot surprised we refuse to make priorities here. We just go on and pass \nbills.\n  Now, you will hear the argument over the next 10 days to 2 weeks, as \nwe debate this bill, that these are just authorizations, that it is not \nmoney that is actually spent until it is appropriated. But if you go to \nthe Web site of all of the Senators who are supporting these bills, \nthey have already sent out press releases bragging about what they have \ndone. They intend to spend the money.\n  So one of three things comes about from that. One is they plan on \nauthorizing it and spending the money; two is they are just gaming \ntheir constituency, they are planning on passing the bill but never \nspending the money, which is highly unlikely, or three is they just \nwant on the bill so they can get a positive parochial benefit and do \nnot really care whether the money gets spent.\n  Well, this is one Senator who really cares whether the money gets \nspent. And a lot of these bills we should spend money on. But some of \nthe bills, to pay for them, we ought to get rid of the programs in \nthose agencies that are either duplicative of what we are doing and \neliminate the ones that are not working or we ought to pay for any new \nprograms the same way a family does. They get rid of the things they do \nnot think are important.\n  But to pass somewhere between $25 billion and $50 billion worth of \nnew authorizations for spending and not eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, \nand duplication means we think we are above the American people. Do you \nknow what. The American people already figured that out because the \nlatest survey on whether they think Congress is doing a good or \nexcellent job is only 9 percent of the people in this country. And they \nare right; we are not. We are totally ignoring the things that every \nother person in this country has to do in terms of making decisions on \nhow they live.\n  The debate on this bill is going to be about priorities and choices.\n  Also, this bill is going to be coming at a time when the No. 1 issue \nfacing Americans is being able to afford enough money to put gas in the \ncar to go to work. I would put forward that we should not spend any \ntime growing the Government in any way or authorizing any new \nexpenditures until we have a comprehensive, totally inclusive energy \npolicy that is going to work for this country for the next 30 years. \nThe reason that is important is our national security is now at risk \nbecause we are energy dependent, we are energy insecure.\n  You heard the majority whip talk about lands that were bid on but are \nnot drilled on. It is the Willie Sutton phenomenon. He robbed banks \nbecause that is where the money is. People drill where the oil is. If \nthere is not a high chance of getting oil, they do not drill there.\n  Every available offshore rig in this country right now is either in \nrepair or drilling. Every other working rig is either under contract or \nunder repair or is out for contract. It would be surprising to most \npeople where we get most of our oil drilling rigs today. Most people do \nnot realize China produces most of them. We have lost our technologic \nadvantage in terms of being competitive just on oil drilling rigs.\n  The other thing that is disappointing is, we cannot have a debate \nabout priorities in the Senate because we hide behind the fact that \nthis is just an authorization. But the point is, if we think it is \nimportant enough to authorize it and we think it is a priority, we \nought to think it is important enough to spend the money on. In fact, \neverybody thinks that except when they get on the Senate floor to \ndebate the fact that they do not want to do the hard work of getting \nrid of waste, of get getting rid of fraud, of getting rid of abuse, of \ngetting rid of duplication.\n  For most of the bills that are going to be in here, my staff and I \nhave offered legitimate spending offsets to them. But that is foreign. \nThat is new. We have not always done it that way.\n  Well, I refer to this chart and this other chart as evidence that we \nbetter start doing things a little differently. We better start \ndeauthorizing programs that do not work. We ought to start getting rid \nof programs that are wasteful. We ought to start fine-tuning the \nprograms that do work but are highly inefficient. And we ought to get \nrid of programs that are designed to be defrauded and abused.\n  The Senate is an interesting place by historical standards. By \nhistorical standards, this is supposed to be the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. In the 110th Congress, 890 bills have passed--890. \nFifty of them have had debate. Only 50 have had debate. And for\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\nmost of those, the debate has been extremely limited and shortened \nthrough the power of the majority leader, by a technical process of \nfilling the tree, 14 times, where no amendments were available except \nthose of the majority leader, or by granting amendments that were only \napproved by him and limiting the total time of debate. Well, there is \nan interesting historical record that I will go through in a minute. \nBut it lessens what our Founders intended for the Senate to be.\n  From 1912 to 1972, only five times in the U.S. Senate was cloture \ninvoked. That means the decision was made by the U.S. Senate to limit \ndebate. Our Founders believed the whole purpose of the majority of the \nSenate was to be the reasoned body, to stand away from emotion, to \nstand away from the pressured responses of an election every 2 years, \nand have an open and vigorous debate on every issue.\n\n  Two things happened from that. One is Members of the Senate became \nmuch better informed. The second thing that happens when we have \nvigorous open debate is the American people learn something about what \nis going on. So if we have passed 890 bills this year and 840 of them \npassed by this procedure called unanimous consent, you didn't hear any \ndebate, there were no amendments offered, there was no vote taken on \nthose bills. What a loss for the American people.\n  Now, granted, 72 of them were naming post offices, but what a loss, \nthat we don't have and utilize the tools of the Senate to inform the \nAmerican people about what we are working on.\n  There are two things that can come from that. One is, if we are doing \na unanimous consent--a procedure where a bill passes and nobody raises \nan objection to it. It is a process where everybody says: I think this \nis a bill we ought to do. I think this is a bill we ought to not amend, \nand I don't think we should vote on it.\n  So there have been 840 times or 850 times in the 110th Congress when \nwe have said we don't need to do that. So the American people have no \nidea what we have passed, what the import of it is, because there has \nbeen no debate. What the majority leader hopes to bring to the floor is \na bill consisting of 40 bills that says: Wait a minute. There are some \nof us who think we ought to debate these. There are some of us who \nthink we ought to amend these. And there are some of us who think we \nought to vote; that we ought to be recorded on how we stand on an \nissue.\n  One of the things that has been put out in this debate by unelected \nstaff members is that I have blocked the bills from coming to the \nSenate floor. Well, everyone in this body knows that isn't true. An \nindividual Senator can't block a bill from coming to the Senate floor. \nThe majority leader has the right to bring any bill to the floor any \ntime he wants.\n  What the staff members are saying is we want to bring a bill, but we \ndon't want to debate it. We don't want to vote on it. We don't want to \nhave it amended. We don't want the American people to know what we \nwould rather do in secret, what we would rather pass without the \nAmerican people knowing the details about our business.\n  So is it any wonder that only 9 percent of the American public has \nany significant confidence in the Congress to put forward their \ninterests? We are going to be doing this at a time when the No. 1 issue \nin this country is energy security and energy prices, but we are going \nto put a bill on the Senate floor that grows the Government, that \ncreates 70 new programs, and spends somewhere between $25 billion and \n$50 billion.\n  I would tell my colleagues that most people sitting down to their \ndinner table think we have our priorities messed up, and they are \nright. We do.\n  The other thing that is concerning is our Founders made the House of \nRepresentatives very much different from the Senate. The Senate was \ndesigned to make sure the rights of the minority were always ever \npresent in terms of debate and amendment. Earlier today the majority \nleader said we had filibustered--my particular party had filibustered--\n83 times. That is an inaccurate statement.\n  A filibuster is when someone says: I want to continue talking and I \nwant to continue debating and I want to continue amending--to the point \nwhere you try not to pass a bill. The difference between what the \nmajority leader claims and actual truth is, what the minority is asking \nfor is we would just like to be able to amend bills and not have to go \nto the majority leader, who has now become the ``Rules chairman'' of \nthe ``House,'' and says only with our approval can we offer an \namendment to a bill. It undermines the total tradition of the Senate, \nbut more importantly than that, it undermines truth and transparency in \nthis country because, if you stifle debate, what you do is lose the \nbenefit of the 100 Senators who are here who come from diverse \nbackgrounds with vast and different experiences to have that input into \nthe debate.\n  So as we become the ``House of Representatives,'' where we don't \nallow amendments, where we don't allow an open amendment process--and I \nam not talking about political ``gotcha'' amendments; I am talking \nabout real amendments to change real bills based on the facts of that \nbill, and I am talking about pertinent amendments--we are doing great \ndamage to the institution of the Senate.\n  I have also heard some of my colleagues complain that it is somehow \nundemocratic for one Senator to stand against 99 Senators. I would not \nbe living up to my oath if I acceded on conscience to do what I thought \nwas wrong for the very people of Oklahoma who sent me here, not to \nrepresent just their interests but to pay attention to what our oath \nsays, which is to uphold and fulfill the Constitution of the United \nStates. It is interesting that in that Constitution, there is a section \ncalled the Enumerated Powers Act. It is very straightforward. It is \nvery clear in terms of what it spells out, the rules under which the \nCongress is to operate.\n  I have introduced, along with my colleague--several other colleagues \nin the Senate but also my colleague, John Shadegg, in the House--the \nEnumerated Powers Act. This act says we should fulfill article I, \nsection 8. I wish to read that into the Record for a minute because I \nthink as American families across this country and American workers and \npeople struggle to meet either health care bills, food bills, or energy \nbills, the answer is that the Congress has gotten totally off course.\n  Here is what our Constitution says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \n     but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform \n     throughout the United States. . . .\n\n  The Congress shall have the power to:\n\n       [B]orrow Money on the credit of the United States;\n       To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the \n     several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\n       To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform \n     Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United \n     States;\n       To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign \n     Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;\n       To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the \n     Securities and current Coin of the United States;\n       To establish Post Offices and post Roads;\n       To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \n     securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n     exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;\n       To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;\n       To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the \n     high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations;\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n       To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money \n     to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\n       To provide and maintain a Navy;\n       To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land \n     and naval Forces;\n       To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the \n     Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions;\n       To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the \n     Militia. . . .\n       To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, \n     over such District. . . .\n       To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. . . .\n\n  The 10th amendment to the Constitution says anything that is not \nlisted right there is exclusively and absolutely the right of the \nStates. That is how we got here. We have abandoned what the \nConstitution has taught us is our responsibility.\n  I will tell my colleagues, my guesstimate of the 40 bills that are \ngoing to be bound in this omnibus grow-the-government, spend-more-money \nbill, half\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\nof those bills will violate the enumerated powers of the Constitution. \nThen we wonder how is it that we are bankrupting our children, how is \nit that we are undercutting their standard of living for the future, \nhow is it that we have gotten to the point where we are at risk based \non the loans that we have taken out to foreign sovereign governments?\n  What we have missed is what is not controversial to the American \npeople, which is that we should be living within our means because they \nhave to live within their means. This bill is about not living within \nour means. It is going to be about a lot of other things--a lot of \nwhich I support--but mostly the bill is going to be about not living \nwithin our means, about growing the Government, spending more money, \nreaching into areas that are rightly the States' requirements because \nwe have the power to do it.\n  I wish to make one other point that I think in my lifetime--I am 60 \nyears old, and I have seen a great shift in the legislative bodies in \nthis country. That shift is this: When you take your oath to be a U.S. \nSenator or Congressman, you take the oath to support and defend and \nuphold the Constitution of these United States. Nowhere in that oath \ndoes it mention your State. What has happened as we have evolved such \ngreat power to the Federal Government, the Members of Congress have \nbecome parochial. They have decided that in their wisdom, we should be \nabout sending stuff home. We should be about violating the enumerated \npowers. One is because it feels good to help people--there is no \nquestion about that--but No. 2 is it has to do with being liked and \ngetting reelected. It has everything to do with getting reelected.\n  So what it has become, as opposed to what our Founders envisioned was \na national legislature whose goal was long-term thinking to the benefit \nand the trust and the security for the Nation as a whole, it has \ndevolved into a parochial legislature which spends half of its time \ntrying to fix problems in individual States or communities that violate \nthe enumerated powers listed in our own Constitution.\n  So we find ourselves with the following facts. If you are born today, \nif you are born today and end up in a nice swaddling in your mother's \narms, here is what you face: Your parents are going to have to raise \nyou, they are going to have to try to afford your college education, \nwhich is going to be impossible in 20 years. The reason it is going to \nbe impossible is because we have, out of this red line, put $400,000 of \nobligations on every child that is born in this country today and every \nday forward because we continue to grow the Government. We continue to \nviolate the enumerated powers. We continue to refuse to make hard \nchoices about priorities because someone might get upset.\n  The interesting thing is the American people get it. You can see that \nin their level of confidence in this body. Ninety-one percent of the \nAmerican people say: We don't get it. You are not working on what we \nwant you to work on. You are not fixing the problems we think you \nshould be fixing. It is because we are fixing what is best for the \npoliticians, not what is best for the country.\n\n  Let me give you a few examples of what I suspect will be in this \nbill. You as an American can decide if you think it is a priority for \nus right now, knowing that we are going to have at least a $600 billion \ndeficit this year; we are going to borrow at least $600 billion from \nthe Chinese and the Middle East. That is $2,000 for every man, woman, \nand child in this country.\n  Here is the first one. Ice age, floods, National Geographic Trail \nDesignation Act. That has to be a priority for us right now, when \nAmericans cannot afford gasoline to get to work. It only costs $14.5 \nmillion over the next 5 years, but it has to be a priority for us, it \nhas to be something that has to happen right now. Why does it have to \nhappen? It is because somebody will look good back home, not because it \nis a priority for the Nation--and it is certainly not a priority for \nour children.\n  So do we need to do that now. Or do we intend to pass the bill, not \nfund it, and say we did something? Either one of them is dishonorable.\n  Next is the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial \nCommission Act. That will create a commission to celebrate the \nbicentennial and creation of the National Anthem. I don't think there \nis a problem with doing that. I think we ought to recognize the 200th \nanniversary of that. The question is, Should we spend $4 million doing \nit, when you can probably spend $100,000 doing it? Only in Washington \ndoes it take $4 million to have a party, to recognize a celebration. \nThat is totally out of touch with the American taxpayers and the \npriorities they have to make.\n  How about the Captive Primate Safety Act? It will add nonhuman \nprimates to the list of species that are prohibited from being brought \ninto the country for commerce. That commerce has to do with the \nscientific integrity and discovery and the utilization of subhuman \nprimates because they are the best way we know to test things before we \ntest them on us. But we are going to limit that. We are only going to \nspend $17 million doing that--only $17 million.\n  There is $1.5 billion for the National Capital Transportation \nAmendment Act. That is Metro. I think we ought to help Metro. But \nbefore we help Metro, we ought to demand some accountability and \nefficiency. They have gotten a billion dollars in Federal grants over \nthe last 3, 4 years. Yet the problems that plague that institution \nhaven't been fixed. They are not addressed in this bill. There is no \naccountability, no transparency. You cannot see where they are spending \nthe money. There is nobody held accountable for the failure of the \nretrofit on the old rail cars that were retrofitted and now are not \nworking.\n  The other question American taxpayers ought to ask is: Why should \nevery other taxpayer in the country pay for the rail transportation of \nthe best paid people in the country, the Federal workforce? Should the \naverage family who makes $33,000 in Oklahoma pay for the transportation \nto work of families who average $75,000 and are commuting on Metro? \nInherently, there is something not quite right with that. Yet that will \nbe in this package--$1.5 billion. We don't have the money, so not only \nare we going to have to subsidize it now, but we are going to charge it \nto our kids.\n  I would say this bill the majority leader is going to bring up isn't \ngoing to fit with the priorities of the American people. There are some \ngood things in it. But contrast that with the fact that we have an \nenergy crisis, that we have families who now, compared to a year ago, \nare spending at least $2,000 more for energy. I would think the only \nthing we ought to be working on, the only thing the American people \nthink we ought to be working on would be solving that problem in a \ncomprehensive way. Instead, we are not; we are going to grow that and \nspend more. We are not going to do long-term solutions for our energy \ninsecurity that puts our Nation at risk in terms of our national \nsecurity.\n  Even a cursory look at the history of the Senate shows that the \nmajority leader's decision to construct an omnibus bill to get around \ntrue debate and true amendment objections to the broken hotline process \nviolates the tradition of full and open debate and amendment. Following \nthe Revolutionary War, the Founders created a system that protected the \npeople from tyranny. The checks and balances provision was extended to \nthe legislative branch, between the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. The Framers created the House of Representatives to pass \nlegislation quickly. But the Senate was designed for the opposite \npurpose. It is supposed to be hard to pass a law up here because it has \nsuch a major effect on every American. It needs the cooling in the \n``coffee cup saucer.'' It needs to be thought about, debated, \ndiscussed, and it needs to be open toward the American people to where \nthey can see it.\n  James Madison said:\n\n       The use of the Senate is consistent in its proceedings with \n     more coolness, more wisdom than the popular branch of \n     government. Its hallmark would not be the majoritism of the \n     House, but the emphasis on the rights of individual Senators \n     to consider and impact legislation.\n\n  Impacting legislation is offering amendments. You cannot impact it \nunless you have the ability to amend it. By wrapping several dozen \ncontroversial bills into one omnibus, what the majority leader is \nattempting to do is\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\noverride the best traditions of the Senate. But more important, it is \nto shortchange the American people about what we are doing.\n  Since we have already passed 850 bills that you have no knowledge of, \nbecause they didn't have debate and amendments and they didn't have \nvotes, why is it we should let another 40 bills come through without \nfull debate and full amendments?\n  There are two examples in history on how the Senate has operated as \nintended as a bulwark against hasty decisions and bad policy. First was \nthe 1805 impeachment trial of Justice Samuel Chase, and the second was \nthe 1869 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. In order for \nthe Senate to function as intended, it took courageous Senators to \nstand on principle in the face of adversity. In 1804, President Thomas \nJefferson won reelection by a landslide, and his party then was known \nas the Republican Party--it is now the Democratic Party. They ended up \nwith overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate. Only the judicial \nbranch remained in control of the opposition party, the Federalist \nParty. The President, buoyed by strong public support, sought to \nimpeach Federalist judges on the basis of their political stances and a \nvariety of court opinions, leading Jefferson's Republicans to target \nJustice Chase as one of the most outspoken judges--in other words, to \nintimidate the judicial branch.\n  With the distance of history, we can see clearly that Chase's \nconviction would have undermined the independence of the courts. It \nwould have said we would not have a three-part government, each a \ncareful balance to control the others. That would have gone out the \nwindow. In the House, Justice Chase was impeached 73 to 32. All of \nJefferson's Republicans voted for it. In the Senate, votes from 23 of \nthe 34 Senators were necessary for conviction, and 25 of those Senators \nwere Jefferson's Republicans. Conviction seemed sure. Yet following a \nweek-long trial in the Senate, 18 voted against conviction, while 16 \nvoted for it. They were five votes short to remove Justice Chase.\n  Following the ordeal, Vice President Aaron Burr made the following \nobservation:\n\n       The Senate is a sanctuary, a citadel of law, of order, and \n     of liberty, and it is here in this exalted refuge--here if \n     anywhere--will resistance be made to the storms of political \n     frenzy and the silent arts of corruption.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will consider that last phrase, ``the silent \narts of corruption.'' When the American people look at this body, that \nis precisely what many Americans see. If any process was in the \ncategory of the silent art of corruption, the secretive hotline \nprocess, where bills come through with unanimous consent, fits that \ndefinition well.\n  In 1869, in the trial of President Andrew Johnson, a similar matter \nunfolded. In the years following the Civil War, there was severe strife \nbetween the President and Congress over the best way to handle the \nrejoining of the South with the Union. The Congress, dominated by \nMembers who were determined to humble the Confederacy, was pitted \nagainst the President, who was more interested in reconciliation than \nrevenge. After 4 years of battling with President Johnson, the House \noverwhelmingly voted to impeach him. Every Republican had voted for \nimpeachment. This was a different group of Republicans--the Lincoln \nRepublicans. In the Senate, 36 votes were required for conviction and \n41 Senators were Republicans. Once again, conviction seemed sure. \nHowever, a group of seven Republicans saw between the momentary chaos \nand understood the consequences of impeaching Johnson. After it was \nrevealed that the group of seven Republicans planned on voting against \nremoval, a surge of public outrage was thrown down on the Senators. One \nSenator from Iowa, James Grimes, received so many physical threats that \nhe suffered a stroke 2 days prior to the vote. Nevertheless, all 7 \nSenators remained resolute and voted not guilty, making the final tally \n35 to 19, 1 short for conviction of impeachment.\n  Both these examples, dealing with impeachment and not legislation \nspecifically, call attention to how the Senate was designed to slow \ndown bad policy. I believe what the majority leader is doing is bad \npolicy, in terms of combining a multitude of bills--1,700 pages of \nbills that very few offices know the extent of--into one bill, and \ntrumping all minority rights, which are a sacred and central feature of \nthe Senate that should not be violated.\n  Our Founders constantly warned about the tyranny of the majority. \nMadison called the Senate a necessary fence against the majority party, \nand the primary tool given to the minority was the informal principle \nof unlimited debate. Between 1917 and 1962, cloture--a motion to stop \ndebate--only happened five times in this body--only five times. Eighty-\nthree times now the majority leader has filed cloture. Why has he done \nthat? He doesn't want the debate. He does not want the debate. Opposite \nthe best traditions of the Senate, the majority leader has filed \ncloture 83 times.\n  One last point and I will finish. A hold on a bill is not blocking a \nbill from coming to the Senate floor. The rights are very clear of the \nmajority leader. The majority leader can bring any bill to the floor \nanytime he wants. No Senator can stop it. So if you are holding a bill \nbecause you are saying I don't agree with a unanimous consent, which \nmeans I don't agree that we should not debate, I don't agree that we \nshould not amend, and I don't agree that the public should not have a \nrecorded vote on this bill, that does nothing to stop the bill from \ncoming to the floor. What stops the bill from coming to the floor is \nthe priorities of the majority, not the priorities of any other \nSenator.\n  Debate, full, open, honest debate is great for this country. The \nhotline process with unanimous consent, passing bills in secret the \nAmerican people don't know about, are not informed about, are not \ndebated in the Senate, are not voted on in the Senate, goes against the \ntradition of the Senate. But it also robs us of freedom because the \nknowledge of what we do is as important as what we do. Without that \nknowledge by the American people, we are not the cooling saucer of \nthought, debate, calmness, and reason.\n  The hold, which I have exercised, is the last check against the \nabusive hotline process. It may be that 70 or 80 Senators want to pass \na bill, and that is great. Let's put it on the floor. Let's debate the \nbill. Let's have options to amend the bill and make people vote on \ncommonsense items such as priorities, getting rid of waste, doing what \nevery American has to do every day, and let's have that debate in front \nof the American people.\n  There are 76 programs that are being held currently by a number of \nSenators. It comes to $70 billion of new spending. I have yet to have \nsomebody from Oklahoma or any other State in the country tell me that \nwith a $700 billion deficit this year, with $10 trillion in debt, with \n$1.4 billion in new debt a day and spending $1 million a minute in \ndebt, that we ought to put $70 billion more on the backs of the \nAmerican families. It may be that we need to put 70, but we need to \ntake another 70 off.\n  So the debate about the bill the majority leader will introduce is \ngoing to be a good debate. It will not stop the process. The rules are \nvery clear. We will have a debate. The question will be: Will we have a \ndebate that is open to true amendments, that is a full debate, and that \nwill take the time to make sure every one of these 40 bills is \nthoroughly vetted with the American public?\n  The final issues I wish to talk about are some of the bills that are \nin here.\n  We reformed the National Institutes of Health last year. We said: \nLet's get politics out of it. Let's let peer-reviewed science tell us \nhow we spend the money to the greatest benefit to help the greatest \nnumber of people. As soon as we passed that bill, we had five or six or \nseven new bills coming to tell them exactly where to spend the money \nbecause we could look good with constituencies, and yet we violated the \nvery bill we passed that said we ought to let science guide us to make \ngood decisions, make the priorities that are out there that help the \nmost number of people with the greatest benefit in terms of science.\n  There are going to be several bills in the one bill for that. I will \ngladly and readily defend my opposition to those bills. One is because \nthey do not accomplish what they say they do. And No. 2 is they hurt \nother people by taking away limited resources, by placing them in a \ncategory that somebody else\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\nsays is more important than what the science would say we can do best.\n  There is the Emmett Till unsolved civil rights bill. I agree we ought \nto pass that bill, but I don't think we ought to add that money to our \ngrandkids. I think we ought to get rid of the waste, fraud, abuse, and \nexcesses at the Department of Justice and pay for it. It is a \nlegitimate Federal role. It fits with the enumerated powers. Those were \nFederal laws violated in the fifties and sixties. But to pass that bill \nand not get rid of wasteful programs and not get rid of waste says we \nare only doing half the job. It is easier doing it that way. You don't \nmake anybody mad or upset with you. But you don't do the best thing for \nour children and our grandchildren, and you certainly don't do the best \nthing for our country.\n  It is interesting. I have sent two letters to the prime author of \nthat bill. He has not had the courtesy to answer me once. He held a \npress conference that impugned I was a racist because I would not let \nthat bill go through.\n  The fact is, the statements are: You can't work and negotiate bills. \nWe have offered amendments to pay for the bill, with which Mr. Sykes, \nthe main supporter of this bill, agrees. What has happened is it is \ntake it or leave it, no debate, no amendment, no working in the Senate \nto the best tradition of the body.\n  So we have this statement made by Senator Harry Reid that you can't \nwork with Coburn. I tell you, PEPFAR was a great bill. This Senate \npassed it. We were critical in terms of negotiating that bill. The \nSecond Chance Act, which makes sure that we work against recidivism on \nprisoners throughout this country, we worked hard and changed that \nbill. On the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, we negotiated well and got \na great bill for every American so the insurance company can no longer \ndiscriminate against you if you have a genetic tendency and they cannot \nraise your premium. We have done a ton of things, but it is on the \nsmall bills which require people to work that we have not been able to \naccomplish that.\n  I look forward to the next 2 weeks. I look forward to the weekend. \nCongress is about to go on vacation. Most Americans today with gas \nprices cannot go on vacation. And we are going to get a debate this \nweekend on these 40 bills. We probably won't have done anything \nsignificant yet about energy. So we are going to be debating spending \n$25 billion, $50 billion, maybe even $70 billion more, creating 50, 60, \n70 new programs, and you are still going to be paying $4.10 for your \ngasoline with no hope 10 years from now that things are going to be any \ndifferent because we have our priorities wrong. We would rather look \ngood to special interests and pass bills in the dark of night than \ndebate them on the floor and put the priorities that should be in front \nof this country out there--energy, health care, Social Security reform, \n$300 billion worth of waste in the Federal Government every year. \nNobody is doing a thing about it. Half the agencies will not even \ncomply with the improper payments law. We have $3 billion a year spent \nat the Pentagon maintaining properties they don't want, but the \nCongress won't pass a true real property reform because it is held up \nby a homeless act, most of which none of the buildings are capable of \nbeing utilized by homeless individuals.\n  What I say to my colleagues is let's have a debate. Let's see the \nrumble in America that thinks whether we are doing the right things, \nthe right priorities. Do they want us to go down this road where we \nstrangle the lifeblood economically from our children, we take away \ntheir ability to own a home, we take away their ability to get a \ncollege education, or should we be about real priorities? And if we are \ngoing to spend new money, shouldn't we be about getting rid of some of \nthe $300 billion that is wasted every year right now?\n  I don't have to take a poll about that one. That is a 90-plus-percent \nfactor with the American people. It is only in the Senate that we don't \nget it, that we would rather spend time growing the Government and \nspending more money than fixing the real problems of this Nation.\n  I look forward to the debate. I am excited about this weekend. My \nhope is we will have an open amendment process, one that does justice \nto the greatest traditions of the Senate but, more importantly, one \nthat does justice to the American family and their children to come.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I have in my hand the bill Senator Reid \njust filed. There is no CBO score with this, and I object to the \nintroduction of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPC \nEstell ``Lee'' Turner and his heroic service to our country. As a \nmember of the Army's Echo Company, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry \nRegiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division based in \nFort Campbell, KY, SPC Turner was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. On July 2, 2008, he died in the National Naval \nMedical Center in Bethesda, MD, after being mortally wounded by an IED \nin Afghanistan.\n  Lee had already served his country for 6 years in the Army two \ndecades earlier, having finished his military service in 1989. Yet this \nwasn't enough. Even though he had gone above and beyond, Lee still had \nthe drive to be a hero. After moving to Sioux Falls in 2004, he \nreenlisted in the Army at the age of 39, after the Army had raised its \nage limit. He looked forward to being deployed to Afghanistan, his \nfirst tour in the war on terror. His wife recalls, ``He never seemed \nworried about it, this is something he believed in. He thought it was \nright.''\n  Raised in a military family, patriotism was instilled in his heart \nfrom a young age. Lee's father served in the Navy for 18 years, and his \ngrandfather was an Army soldier who served in World War II. His younger \nbrother John is in the Army and his wife is an Army reservist. Lee's \nawards and decorations include the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Army Combat Action Badge, and the \nPurple Heart. Lee enjoyed racing and fixing cars and playing guitar. He \nhad a fierce devotion to his family, and he will be deeply missed by \nthose who survive him: his wife Leah, his daughter Lyda, his siblings, \nJohn and ``Gucci,'' and his mother Gloria.\n  Specialist Turner gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life \nis to emulate his commitment to our country. Madam President, I join \nwith all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family \nand friends of SPC Estell Turner. He will be missed, but his service to \nour Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Jeremy Vrooman\n\n  Madam President, I also rise today to pay tribute to SSG Jeremy \nVrooman and his heroic service to our country. As a member of the \nArmy's 2nd Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armored \nDivision, in Vilseck, Germany, Staff Sergeant Vrooman was serving in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On July 15, 2008, he died in a \nBaghdad hospital after sustaining injuries from an improvised explosive \ndevice.\n  A native South Dakotan, Jeremy carried on the tradition of military \nservice in his family when he joined the Army 9 years ago. Both of his \ngrandfathers served and his older brother, Justin, is currently in the \nArmy. Jeremy was proud to serve in the military and planned on making \nit his career.\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\nHe was on his second tour of duty in Iraq.\n  Jeremy enjoyed playing with his children, hunting, fishing, and \nmountain biking. Friends and family will miss Jeremy's laughter and \ninfectious smile.\n  Sergeant Vrooman gave his all for his soldiers and his country.

Madam President, I rise to commemorate the 34th \nanniversary of Turkey's invasion of the island of Cyprus. Today, Cyprus \nremains a divided island, with a third of the territory still occupied \nby Turkish forces.\n  Over the years, numerous United Nations resolutions have called for \nthe respect of the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of \nCyprus and for an immediate end to the Turkish occupation. The \nGovernment and people of Cyprus are ready to make compromises to \nachieve peace and to reunify the island. We must continue to stand with \nthem to fight for a fair and reasonable agreement--one that safeguards \nbasic freedoms and human rights for all Cypriots.\n  I am proud of the partnership we have with the Republic of Cyprus. \nDuring the evacuation of Lebanon in 2006, Cyprus served as the primary \ntransit location for some 15,000 U.S. citizens and was the launching \npoint for humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon. As a member of the \nEuropean Union, the Government of Cyprus has worked to improve the \neconomic viability of all its citizens and has taken important steps to \nintegrate the Turkish-Cypriot community.\n  Madam President, I welcome the renewed interest in the efforts for a \ncomprehensive and fair solution to reunify Cyprus. I urge the \nGovernment of Turkey to cooperate with the negotiations and I applaud \nthe people of Cyprus for their steadfast commitment to securing a \npeaceful and prosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6966-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER GEREMEK\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of \nBronislaw Geremek--scholar, diplomat, and Polish patriot--who passed \naway on Sunday, July 13.\n  Bronislaw Geremek played a key role in Poland's transition from \ncommunism to democracy. The Solidarity movement is known as a labor \nmovement. In 1980, an obscure electrician jumped over the wall of the \nGdansk shipyard and took the world with him. Yet behind these workers \nstood leading Polish academics and intellectuals, like Professor \nGeremek. The scholars became advisers to the workers. Professor Geremek \nwas imprisoned by the Communist government during the dark days of \nmartial law.\n  Professor Geremek was instrumental in the negotiations that led to \nthe election of 1989. These elections brought the Solidarity government \nto power and ended Communist control of Poland. This peaceful \ntransition was a model for other nations.\n  I got to know Minister Geremek during the debate on NATO Enlargement. \nPoland was taking the difficult steps to become a free market \ndemocracy. Yet Poland yearned to be a true partner in Europe. That \nmeant joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  The Senate had a robust debate on enlarging NATO. I argued that the \nnew democracies would strengthen NATO and share the burden of European \ndefense.\n  In the years since, Poland has shown the world why NATO membership \nwas so important. In Kosovo, in Iraq, in Afghanistan--Poland has stood \nby the side of the United States and the members of NATO.\n  I was with Foreign Minister Geremek in Madrid--when Poland signed the \narticles of enlargement. I joined President Clinton in Warsaw to \ncelebrate. It was a historic time for America and for Poland.\n  Bronislaw Geremek's achievements will live on in the history books. \nHis legacy is a Poland that is democratic and free--and a true friend \nand ally of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6966-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6966-S6968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo .senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thanks for your stand. I believe you have it exactly right. \n     I sent you an e-mail a month ago with some of my thoughts, \n     but here are a few more. I work in the distribution business. \n     With the cost of diesel almost $5, it is inflating the cost \n     of all our products. We have already had increases the when \n     printed are the size of a phone book. We are seeing a big \n     slow down in our business that is directly related to the \n     cost of fuel. It has a domino effect in that our customers \n     are cutting back because the average business and home owner \n     does not have extra money to spend because it is all going to \n     fuel. If it gets any higher I see it destroying our economy. \n     There will be an ever increasing slowdown in the economy as \n     everyone cuts back more and more. Thanks for your hard work.\n     Dennis, Meridian\n                                  ____\n\n       It is time the Congress and Senate quit looking for stories \n     and do something! America needs to be independent from \n     foreign oil and energy. We need an energy bill brought before \n     President Bush before [a new President is elected]. Items \n     that need addressed: domestic construction of nuclear power, \n     clean use of coal, renewable energy resources, construction \n     of new clean technology, oil refineries, renewed domestic \n     production of oil, legislation that would hold those \n     accountable for hindering achieving these goals by crying \n     about ``not in my backyard.'' [Such] people are a threat to \n     our national security. Where is this legislation you claim to \n     strongly support?\n       Mr. Crapo, I am 39 years old. I have worked hard and look \n     forward to being able to achieve a comfortable life in \n     retirement. I am afraid that our country is going in a \n     direction where that will be the least of my concerns. It \n     costs me over $5 a day to get to work, and I live less than \n     15 miles from work. With what those of you in Washington are \n     currently doing, prices will only worsen. [The] negligence in \n     previously addressing these needs has brought our nation to \n     its current economic distress. You can't just support issues; \n     you need to take the lead in promoting new policies.\n       Give me something to judge you by your actions.\n     Rob.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator, Nightly, I listen to a number of pundits and \n     politicos debate the ``solutions'' to our energy problems. \n     One of the more ridiculous ones is mandating people switch to \n     higher fuel efficiency automobiles (i.e., buy a new car). As \n     a small business owner, our health insurance premiums have \n     just gone up (again), the minimum wage has risen, grocery \n     costs are rising and our 401k is diminishing. The very \n     thought of anyone in Congress telling me I have to replace my \n     ``paid for'' cars, and take out a loan to buy a new (more \n     energy efficient) car is ludicrous!! Gasoline would have to \n     be over $10 a gallon to make economic sense to my family, in \n     lieu of absorbing a car payment.\n       I support drilling offshore and in ANWR, as well as shale \n     oil extraction. I think it is time that the world's most \n     technologically-advanced nation illustrate to the world the \n     most technologically-advanced means of extracting energy. I \n     am deeply offended that the United States government, who \n     cannot profitably manage Amtrak, the U.S. Postal Service, or \n     even its own Senate cafeteria, has the audacity to pretend to \n     convince me that they know more about ``safe and sound'' \n     energy extraction than the companies that are professionals \n     in this endeavor. I hear people crying about how drilling in \n     the U.S. might ``spoil national resources''! I would be \n     willing to wager that if we were not dependent upon Middle \n     Eastern oil, we could have, most likely, saved about 4,000 \n     U.S. servicemen and women's lives. That cost of natural \n     resource is infinitely greater than a handful of caribou!\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Daniel, Boise.\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Thank you for your time. I am on Social Security and \n     believe me, if I could work, I would. But I cannot. So, as a \n     person who is now on the bottom half of an almost pretend \n     income, it took more over $800 last year for hearing, not \n     including the $356 that is all I need for help. I personally \n     would love to have a new pair of teeth; the ones I have are \n     broken and pretty useless. But can I even save to get a pair \n     of teeth? I am weighing in at 101 pounds, because all of my \n     money goes to propane and forget about going anywhere. My gas \n     budget only allows me to go to doctors, and then I go to the \n     store. I worked until I got hurt. I raised four children. \n     They all work every day, and their wives and husband. I \n     taught my children to always be kind, helpful and to be good \n     people. I am sick of paying money to places that have every \n     want to kill us. What did happen to our rights, and why are \n     you not all fighting harder. Even the money we use has been \n     allowed to be changed. What is wrong with the people in \n     power? I live off $6,000 a year and have no rights. What is \n     wrong? Thank you.\n     Marylynna.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am unhappy with the spin stories that the media tries to \n     share that our prices are not comparable to those in Europe. \n     They forget to tell everyone that the taxes on their gas \n     prices are 1/3 to 1/2 the price per gallon. Our taxes are not \n     unreasonable right now, but the price per gallon is. We are \n     rural residents and must drive to work. Our income has \n     changed radically in the past 2 years and leaves us with no \n     money to spare for the extra gas cost. We pay our own \n     insurance and that has just taken a 25% premium hike. My \n     parents live in St. George, Utah, and that makes the cost of \n     travel even more of a concern. They are 80 and 75 and \n     presently independent of any special care needs, but the cost \n     of heating/ac and travel will be a burden for them and the \n     family as well. I believe in taking action on the \n     possibilities of drilling for oil at home, nuclear energy, \n     and coal use. I am so sick and tired of the environmental nut \n     cases taking over our country and without logic, locking us \n     into unrealistic laws, taxes, and restrictions that make the \n     U.S.A. weak and unprepared for things that will leave us at \n     the mercy of even greater issues than gas prices. I \n     appreciate your information and concern. I hope you can bring \n     some sense to your fellow Senators. Thank you.\n     Susan, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your e-mail. Yes, we agree these prices are \n     out of control. Why are we not drilling in our own country? I \n     cannot believe the environmentalists have such control of \n     this. There must be more to this than we hear about. Is there \n     anything coming up before Congress to be able to start being \n     a self-sufficient country with our energy? All these studies \n     and research for alternative fuel are a waste of time and \n     money. We have plenty of oil right here. We as citizens of \n     Idaho are counting on you and our other Congressmen to get \n     moving on this problem!!!!!

Does that mean that \n     you do not support further exploration for unproven or \n     unknown reserves? Thank you.\n     Pat.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are Idaho residents, and are retired with \n     limited income because all we basically have for income is \n     our individual Social Security and my pension, which is small \n     through the company I retired from--Albertson's corporate \n     office previously in Boise.\n       My primary health insurance is with Medicare, and I do have \n     a secondary retiree insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield \n     of Minn. (Supervalu). Unfortunately, since Medicare pays 80%, \n     Blue Cross will not pay the balance (it's a carved policy) \n     until I meet the annual max of $2,500 per year out-of-pocket. \n     My monthly cost is $263.90 with a $500 deductible. To top it \n     off, Supervalu cancelled all dental and vision coverage on \n     retirees that I previously had with Albertson's. Fortunately, \n     my husband is a disabled veteran with a 10% disability with \n     diabetes, so he can get a lot of help through the VA.\n       We have wintered in Mesa, Arizona, for the past five years. \n     We do have a 38-foot Class A motor home that we have \n     travelled back and forth in, but feel because of the high gas \n     prices, we may be forced to sell. We do still owe on it, so \n     probably is not the best time to sell.\n       I am going to try to find work when I return to Mesa this \n     fall, but I am also 69 years old, so this might be difficult.\n       The high gas prices are not only hurting people who have to \n     work and maybe travel a distance like a lot of people \n     employed in Boise that live in Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell or \n     even Emmett or Mountain Home. I remember working with some of \n     these people. A lot of them carpooled then, but also the \n     retired people like me and others who have worked hard all \n     these years looking forward to our retirement years to \n     hopefully afford to do some travelling let alone trying to \n     exist from month to month.\n       We would appreciate anything you can do to help bring down \n     gas prices. We do drive a Honda CRV, which helps some with \n     mileage, but we are making monthly payments on it too.\n           Sincerely,\n     Avlin, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       What we need to do is drop the tariffs on ethanol imports-\n     particularly from Brazil.

The oil industries profits were 7.45%; \n     industrials, 8.2%; the commodity (money vultures), pensions \n     hedge funds, Dubai and others, 80%.\n       On June 3, 2008, the Senate Commerce Committee held a \n     hearing. Suggest you get a copy.\n       Mr. Greenberger (one of the witnesses) testified that \n     Congress, by revising the law on December 15, 1999, is the \n     cause of the problem. He stated that Congress can fix the \n     problem immediately to cause oil prices to drop 25%.\n       As of today (June 16, 2008), Congress has not acted. \n     [Congress must act to correct the problem; we should be able \n     to start pumping our own oil. It is not acceptable that we \n     cannot use our own nation's resources like ANWR.]\n     Jon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think $200 a month is very conservative. To fill most \n     tanks, it is $100 plus. People are not able to take vacations \n     as they planned. People will have to stay right at home more. \n     The only way to really help us is to drill and open up capped \n     wells in the U.S. Yes, if we drill it will take awhile to get \n     things to market, but we have to start some time. Had we shut \n     the environmentalists down ten years ago, these new wells \n     would be producing now and in our tanks. Please don't keep \n     putting this off. Middle east, Argentina, Mexico could cut us \n     off any time they want. Drill our own wells, uncap the ones \n     that are already here. Shut down environmentalist extremists!\n           Thank you.\n     Kaye, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       We have not taken trips to Boise or Stanley Basin to visit \n     family on the weekends or holidays. $100 in gas is just \n     beyond our budget. We also have not utilized our motor home \n     for anything except a trip to the South Hills to go tubing in \n     over a year.\n       Basically, it has limited our recreation and family travel.\n       We also have cut back on eating out. We are waiting for our \n     tax rebate in order to take a much-needed vacation somewhere \n     and when we do, it will be close by, IN Idaho.\n       We do not drive our truck except to haul stuff to the dump.\n     Kayla.\n                                  ____\n\n       This probably does not fit your agenda, but actually \n     gasoline prices have been a lot worse. I paid a much higher \n     percentage of my income when I was stationed overseas. The \n     Energy Information Administration says we were reaching much \n     deeper into our pockets to pay for gasoline in 1980 than last \n     year. The real difference is that today's money buys less \n     value. So the best way the government can keep gasoline \n     affordable is to stop creating inflation. The next thing you \n     do is require automobile makers to deliver cars that get \n     better mileage. USA cars need to be more competitive.\n     James.\n                                  ____\n\n       Drill here, drill now.\n     William.\n                                  ____\n\n       Reference the high cost of energy, I expect you to vote to \n     release the vast reserves of oil and other energy sources \n     held hostage under the land masses in the United States that \n     are ``protected'' by environmental minorities and their \n     monetary vote-buying policies.\n       The energy crisis is manipulation, when our abundant \n     supplies are made available, supply and demand will suddenly \n     bring prices to a livable level.\n       Until these changes taken place, our country and its place \n     as a world power are threatened.\n       This fuel crisis has already reached a critical point as \n     you know. Our nation cannot support itself, let alone the \n     many countries in the world, when its people are living in a \n     state of economic slavery.\n       Do the right thing and stand for the people that keep this \n     great country free.\n     Lyle.\n                                  ____\n\n       I agree with your positions on energy and believe strongly \n     that we need to stop exporting our national wealth and \n     financial security to the Middle East. We need to develop a \n     strong nuclear program and provide financial incentives to \n     consumers and businesses to select more fuel efficient \n     options for their cars and heating needs. We also need to \n     gradually but steadily increase a tax on gasoline that will \n     be used for public transportation as the Europeans have done \n     for decades. We Americans subsidize roads too heavily at the \n     expense of other modes of transportation and our government \n     agencies who focus on transportation do not work together. \n     For instance, in the Wood River Valley, the planning for the \n     highway, bus services, airport relocation and light rail \n     connections to the airport, Twin, and Amtrak in Shoshone \n     should be done cohesively, and\n\n[[Page S6968]]\n\n     with long term (50+) year horizon rather than by separate \n     agencies with no budget sharing possibilities.\n     Joan, Sun Valley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your letter regarding the high prices of gas \n     and oil. I absolutely agree that many things need to be done \n     to lower the prices. You mentioned many things, but action \n     needs to be taken now in all areas you mentioned.\n       My husband and I are retired so we do not need to drive as \n     much as others, but we have very little possibility of having \n     an increase in our income to compensate for the high gas \n     prices. We do, however, buy things that are affected by the \n     rising prices in everything. Please take some action and \n     report that to us.\n       One thing you did not mention is the war situation in Iraq. \n     If we need to stay for some time because the country needs \n     us, they should be paying for our help with their oil \n     revenues.\n     Ellen.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to your request for the Idaho experience re \n     gasoline prices: My wife and I are recently retired as state \n     of Idaho employees. As such, our income is now set and we no \n     longer can anticipate even the miniscule raises sometimes \n     provided by the state. As retirees we are certainly not \n     unique in that regard, but we share with other retirees the \n     inability to absorb the rapid and unjustified escalation of \n     energy costs. We are fortunate to enjoy a comfortable home, \n     although still with a mortgage. Because of the unjustified \n     escalation of gasoline prices, we now find ourselves limiting \n     our trips from home for shopping, medical appointments, \n     visiting family, and just getting out of the house, to no \n     more than twice a week. Those trips are carefully planned to \n     incorporate as many needs as possible. Trips from home are \n     now made for necessity. No longer do we enjoy the freedom to \n     hop in the car for a ``frivolous'' jaunt. We now frequently \n     forego fresh produce because of increased prices ostensibly \n     the result of higher transportation costs. We purchase store \n     brands in lieu of name brands. Dining out is now a true \n     luxury and even then we often will order one meal and split \n     it between ourselves. Clothes are sparingly purchased at \n     store sales, and even thrift outlets.\n       As said above, we realize we are not unique in our \n     circumstance. We understand that there is a seemingly \n     acceptable inflationary scheme. But the inaction by Congress \n     to adopt a meaningful energy policy requires this nation to \n     rely on our enemies for our energy needs. It has also allowed \n     the greed of commodity speculation to exacerbate an \n     inordinate rise in prices to such an extent that even the \n     Saudi's question its validity.\n       We categorically support a meaningful energy policy . . . \n     one which eliminates detrimental environmental restrictions . \n     . . realistic conservation . . . using our own oil reserves \n     (ANWR, shale, offshore drilling), nuclear, wind, solar power \n     . . . and build some refineries. Equally important, identify \n     [those who are preventing commonsense policies from being \n     undertaken]. It is time that those we have sent to \n     Washington, D.C. do what they have been elected to do. Too \n     many of us feel that this is not happening now and has not \n     happened for far too long. Please share these comments with \n     the rest of the Idaho delegation.

WILSON\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and true military heroine who has honorably served our country \nfor over 29 years in the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps: CAPT Catherine A. \nWilson.\n  In May, 2006, Captain Wilson assumed command of Naval Hospital \nBremerton. Prior to reporting, she completed a successful tour as the \ncommanding officer of Expeditionary Medical Facility, Kuwait. Her \ncommand included the U.S. military hospital and nine troop medical \nclinics located throughout the country. Prior to deploying, she served \nas the executive officer, Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton where she also \ncommanded the fleet hospital.\n  Captain Wilson's past assignments included the Naval Medical Center \nPortsmouth where she was the Director of Fleet and Family Medicine. \nThis Directorate was staffed by over 2,600 personnel and covered six \nservice lines--family care, women and children's health, adult medical \ncare, preventive care and wellness, emergent and urgent care, and \nbehavioral care, plus nine branch medical clinics.\n  Captain Wilson served as the Deputy Director of the TRICARE Mid-\nAtlantic Region Lead Agent Office where she had direct impact on all \nmilitary and civilian health care for over a million beneficiaries in \nVirginia and North Carolina. Her responsibilities included the \nadministration of a $3.1 billion managed care support contract.\n  In 1999, she was selected as a congressional detailee to my office, \nwhere she advised me on all health-related issues. Captain Wilson was a \nstaff assistant for the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee \nfor Defense, as well as the Labor, Health, and Human Services and \nEducation Committee. Prior to working on Capitol Hill, she served as \nthe Director of Regional Operations for TRICARE Mid-Atlantic.\n  Captain Wilson also worked at the Pentagon as the staff of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs. During this tour, she \nwas the Deputy Director for Force Management, Senior Policy Analyst for \nTRICARE Operations Policy, and ultimately served as the chief of staff \nfor the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, health affairs, for \nHealth Services Operations and Readiness. At that time, the MHS was a \n$15.5 billion system, the Nation's second largest, and included the \nintegrated delivery of health care to more than 8.2 million DOD \nbeneficiaries worldwide. Captain Wilson's other executive management \npositions include a 4-year tour at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery \nas the Deputy of Enlisted Force Management and the Navy Surgeon \nGeneral's representative for HIV and AIDS prevention education. Her \nduty assignments include the Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Naval \nHospital Philadelphia; and the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, \nMD.\n  Captain Wilson's military awards include the Defense Meritorious \nService Medal, third award, Navy Meritorious Service Medal, fourth \naward, Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Military Unit Commendation, second \naward, Overseas Service Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, \nsecond award, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. She \nis entitled to wear the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nidentification badge and is the recipient of the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences, USUHS, Meritorious Service Award.\n  Captain Wilson's educational background includes a bachelor of \nscience degree in nursing, a master of science degree in trauma/\ncritical care nursing with a minor in education, and a master of \nscience degree in human resources management and health policy. She is \nalso certified in managed care by the Academy of Healthcare Management \nand earned a certificate in legislative studies from Georgetown \nUniversity. She is married to Don D. Wilson, CAPT, MSC, USN (Ret.) and \nhas two children and two grandchildren.\n  Captain Wilson is a meritorious leader, administrator, clinician, \neducator, and mentor. Throughout her career she has served with valor \nand profoundly impacted the entire Navy Medical Department. Her \nperformance reflects exceptionally on herself, the U.S. Navy, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my \ndeepest appreciation to CAPT Catherine A. Wilson on behalf of a \ngrateful nation for her more than 29 years of dedicated military \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6968-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6968-S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ISLE ROYALE WOLF/MOOSE STUDY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 50th anniversary of the initiation of the \nIsle Royale Wolf/Moose research study, the longest running predator-\nprey study in the world. Scientific research has both enlightened and \neducated us, reshaping our lives in many profound ways. Continuing to \ncritically study our environment and our impact on it is integral to \nour prosperity and survival as a nation and planet and will help to \nensure future generations inherit a healthy world in which to live and \nthrive.\n  The remote Isle Royale National Park, located in the upper northwest \ncorner of Lake Superior, serves as an ``island laboratory'' for \nscientists to study the interactions of the gray wolf and its primary \nprey, the moose. Mr. Durward Allen of Purdue University founded this \neffort in 1958 as a result of his desire to conduct research on an \nisland ``where the animals you are counting and studying do not wander \naway.'' Today, Mr. Allen's project is led by Mr. Rolf Peterson and Mr. \nJohn\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nVucetich, both distinguished researchers affiliated with Michigan \nTechnological University's School of Forest Resources and Environmental \nScience. In partnership with the National Park Service, Michigan \nTechnological University, and the volunteer efforts of Earthwatch, \namong many other contributors, this project has provided a wealth of \ninformation and has contributed in many important ways to our \nunderstanding of the interaction within and between these two species.\n  Today, scientists enjoy a deeper understanding of the complexities \nthat exist within the gray wolf and moose populations that survive on \nIsle Royale. Through the depth and breadth of the research compiled \nthrough this study, we are better aware of the intricate nature of wolf \npack leadership, social structure, and territorial interaction. We have \nalso learned how parasites the size of a pinhead, en mass, can mortally \nwound an adult 900-pound moose.\n  I was fortunate to visit with Mr. Peterson during a trip to Isle \nRoyale National Park in July of 2003. I left thoroughly impressed by \nthe dedication and hard work of those involved with this study and was \nfascinated to learn about some of the information they have uncovered. \nI am certain that their efforts have enabled us to better understand \nthe gray wolf and moose in an environment largely free from human \ninfluence.\n  We celebrate the lessons learned and the sharing of knowledge gained \nthrough the course of 50 years of observing wolves and moose on Isle \nRoyale. All of us benefit from the application of the information \nattained through this study.\n  The health and well-being of our environment not only affects the \nquality of our daily lives but is one of the most significant legacies \nour generation will pass onto the next. I know my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing the efforts and hard work of each person affiliated with \nthis important project and wish them much success as they continue to \nshed light on the relationships of these species in Isle \nRoyale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6969-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING DR. EPHRAIM ZUROFF\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, today I commend Dr. Ephraim Zuroff \nand the Simon Wiesenthal Center for their efforts to track down the \nlast Nazi war criminals from World War II. Their work is enormously \nimportant, both in bringing the guilty to justice and preventing future \nacts of genocide. The statute of limitations does not--must not--expire \non crimes against humanity. I am proud to assist Dr. Zuroff and his \norganization through the World War II War Crimes Accountability Act, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Nelson earlier this year.\n  Over the past weeks, Dr. Zuroff has traveled throughout South America \nin an effort to locate Dr. Aribert Heim, one of the most wanted Nazis \nstill at large. Dr. Heim, a former SS concentration camp doctor, was \nnicknamed ``Dr. Death'' for his brutal and sadistic experiments on camp \ninmates. At Mauthausen, the camp where he committed his worst crimes, \nDr. Heim was known for murdering inmates by injecting toxins directly \ninto their hearts. Though detained after the Second World War, Heim was \nsubsequently released and remained free until 1962. After he was tipped \noff that German authorities intended to prosecute him for war crimes, \nhe fled Germany and disappeared. Today, Dr. Heim is believed to be \nliving in either the Chilean or Argentinean Patagonia region at the tip \nof South America. His family claims he died in 1993 after fleeing \nGermany, but Dr. Zuroff points out that the family has still not \nclaimed one of his bank accounts holding over a million dollars. If he \nwere dead, his relatives could receive that money by showing evidence \nof his death.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation: Last Chance in 2002 \nto identify and assist in the prosecution of the remaining Nazi war \ncriminals still at large. Dr. Zuroff, who has been leading this effort, \nshould be highly commended for his outstanding efforts in bringing the \nmost guilty Nazis to justice. Of these, Dr. Heim is at the top of his \nlist.\n  Even today, the crimes of Heim and the Nazi regime strain our \nunderstanding of hate. National Socialist Germany today is an icon \nremembered only for its brutality, its mantra of genocide, and its \nculture of racism. And those last Nazis, who are waiting out their last \ndays under the coming twilight, must not be allowed to go quietly into \nthe night, as did too many of their victims. For the souls that were \nlost, and even more for those that remain, there must be justice. I \ncommend Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in the highest \npossible terms, and urge the U.S. Government to do all it can to help \nthem in their cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/21/senate-section/article/S6969-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 3:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 3564.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ncertain income and gains relating to fuels as qualifying income for \npublicly traded partnerships; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN, Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Lugar in \nintroducing the Biofuels Pipeline Act of 2008. This bill provides that \nthe movement of biofuels by pipeline will receive the same tax \ntreatment as petroleum-based fuels.\n  Earlier this session, Congress adopted a Renewable Fuels Standard \nthat will require us to consume 15.2 billion gallons by 2012, and 36 \nbillion gallons by 2022. Biodiesel and ethanol already have the \ncapacity to meet a substantial share of our energy needs. In future \nyears, second-generation ethanol from switch grass and other cellulosic \nfeedstocks will further increase our liquid fuel supply.\n  But it is not enough to establish renewable fuels standards and \nmandates in order to spur production. We also need to clear the way for \ndevelopment of the infrastructure for storing, transporting, and \nmarketing vast new quantities of renewable fuels.\n  In this regard, we have a problem. The lion's share of our renewable \nfuels are produced in the Midwest and in the Plains states, and we \ncurrently do not have the most efficient infrastructure in place to \ntransport these liquid fuels to population centers in the East and \nelsewhere.\n  Currently, biodiesel and ethanol are transported by barge, rail, or \ntruck. But these forms of transportation are far more expensive than \nthe pipeline alternative. Simply stated, there aren't enough barges, \nrail cars, and trucks to move renewable liquid fuels from where they \nare produced to where they will be consumed.\n  While the most efficient mode for transporting liquid fuels is by \npipeline, there are multiple obstacles--both technical and man-made--\nthat have to be overcome.\n  The industry is overcoming the technical challenges associated with \ntransporting so-called ``neat'' renewable fuels by pipeline, and is \nactively studying the prospect of transporting gasoline/ethanol blends \nvia pipeline.\n  Since the rate of return on the transportation of oil and gas is \nhighly regulated and limited, oil and natural gas companies have been \nselling their pipelines to companies that operate as Publicly Traded \nPartnerships--PTPs--whose core business is the transportation, storage \nand marketing of oil and gas.\n  However, by law, Publicly Traded Partnerships must earn 90 percent of \ntheir income from ``qualifying income,'' which is defined under the tax \ncode as income from the exploration, transportation, storage, or \nmarketing of depletable natural resources, including oil, gas, and \ncoal.\n  By their very nature, renewable liquid fuels are not a depletable \nnatural resource. And that means that the income produced from the \ntransportation, storage, and marketing of these fuels is not qualifying \nincome.\n  Since the penalty for PTPs that earn more than 10 percent of their \nincome from a non-qualifying source is loss of PTP status, they cannot, \nand will not, invest in pipelines designed to transport renewable \nliquid fuels.\n  We simply have to remove this obstacle. Publicly Traded Partnerships \nnow own and operate 50 percent of America's liquids pipelines. Some \nwould argue that there are also others who would be willing to step in \nand meet the need with regard to renewable liquid fuels.\n  However, vertically integrated energy companies that own pipelines \nmay not view the opportunity associated with renewable fuel pipelines \nin the same manner as a PTP. In fact, since the mid-1980s, when the PTP \nstructure was originally codified, several major oil companies have \nbeen divesting themselves of pipelines, which they have been selling to \nPublicly Traded Partnerships.\n  As a result, since the PTP pipeline industry's core business is the \ntransportation, storage, and marketing of liquid fuels, these PTP's are \nthe most likely industry to build the pipeline infrastructure that we \nwill need to transport alternative liquid fuels from the Midwest to \nfar-flung parts of the country.\n  Bear in mind, too, that PTPs have crucial right of way that would \nmake\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nthe construction of renewable fuel pipelines more likely.\n  To this end, we need to expand the definition of ``qualifying \nincome'' to include any renewable liquid fuel. This bill does just \nthat--to any fuel approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for \ntransport in pipelines. Effectively, the modification adds one category \nof fuels that currently do not receive the favorable qualified income \nstatus: biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel.\n  This is entirely consistent with Congress's original intent in \ncodifying Publicly Traded Partnerships. At that time, both the Treasury \nDepartment and Congress recognized that partnerships were the \ntraditional manner in which oil and gas exploration, refining, \nmarketing and transport were financed.\n  Clearly, transportation of liquid fuels was an integral part of what \nCongress intended to cover. However, back in the mid-1980s, few people \nthought that alternative fuels would become a significant source of \nliquid energy.\n  It's time to bring the law up to date. Our current dependence on \nimported oil--including oil from some of the most unstable parts of the \nworld--is a clear and present danger to America's national security. At \nthe same time, our dependence on the burning of fossil fuels--a primary \nsource of carbon dioxide emissions, and a primary cause of global \nwarming--presents a clear and present, danger to the Earth as we know \nit.\n  The price of a barrel of imported oil has shot up nearly five fold \nduring the last eight years--from $27.39 a barrel in 2000 to about $130 \na barrel today. During the same time, the cost of a gallon of gasoline \nhas risen more than 250 percent, from $1.50 to $4.11. In the future, \nprice increases will be driven by an explosion of demand from China, \nIndia, and other rapidly developing countries.\n  We need to seize control of our energy future. We need to rapidly \nshift to clean, renewable, home-grown sources of energy, including \nethanol and other renewable fuels.\n  This legislation is one step, but an important step, in moving us to \nconsiderably expand our efficient use of renewable fuels, thereby \nexpanding our alternatives to gasoline and diesel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 3292. A bill to provide emergency energy assistance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency Energy \nAssistance Act of 2008, which will provide emergency relief to families \nin Massachusetts and around the country who are suffering from record \nenergy costs. I am joined by Senators Kennedy, Lieberman, Cardin, \nMenendez, Whitehouse, Cantwell and Dodd in introducing this important \nand timely piece of legislation. This legislation will help some of the \n85 percent of American families who are eligible for assistance from \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, but have been unable to obtain \nit due to budget restrictions.\n  Consumers around the country are facing skyrocketing prices for \ntransportation and heating fuels. Heating oil prices in the Northeast \naveraged $3.40 in the first quarter of 2008, compared to just $2.52 in \n2007, putting severe strains on the approximately 960,000 Massachusetts \nfamilies who simply cannot afford these skyrocketing prices. Today, \n100,000 Massachusetts households are still behind on their energy bills \nfrom last winter and remain at risk of shut-offs of vital energy \nservices.\n  These high costs are expected to continue through this year's heating \nseason. Home heating oil prices in Massachusetts are already averaging \n$4.60/gallon. The typical family uses approximately 1,000 gallons of \nheating oil during the course of the winter--Massachusetts households \ncould realistically be looking at heating bills approaching $5,000--an \nimpossible sum for thousands of families around the state. When coupled \nwith the escalating costs of transportation fuels, the burden is simply \ntoo much to bear.\n  The primary Federal energy assistance program for low-income \nhouseholds is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP. As \nenergy costs rise, the demand for LIHEAP funds grows. 5.8 million \nfamilies received LIHEAP funds in 2008, the highest participation \nlevels in 16 years. In Massachusetts, over 145,000 families receive \nLIHEAP funds. However, as energy costs rise and demand for LIHEAP \ngrows, the program's budget has not kept pace and we just can't cover \nall the people that need help. In fact, only 15 percent of eligible \nhouseholds nationally are receiving funding. Even in those households \nthat do receive LIHEAP funds, the money isn't going very far--the \naverage LIHEAP grant only pays for 18 percent of the total cost of \nheating a home with heating oil.\n  I have been a long-time, strong supporter of legislation introduced \nby Senator Sanders--the Warm in Winter, Cool in Summer Act that would \nfund the LIHEAP program for 2008 at the fully-authorized level of $5.1 \nbillion, and I have incorporated that essential provision into the \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  In addition, the Emergency Energy Assistance Act of 2008 includes \ncritical emergency funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program at \nthe U.S. Department of Energy. This program enables service providers \nto install energy efficiency measures in the homes of qualifying \nhomeowners free of charge, and it provides real, short-term \nopportunities for homeowners to bring down their energy bills. My \nlegislation would fund the program at $750 million, the fully-\nauthorized level for 2008.\n  Finally, this legislation would provide a temporary increase in the \nEarned Income Tax Credit EITC for 2008 to help families pay their \nincreasing energy bills. The EITC is a refundable tax credit for low-\nincome working families. These households are bearing the burden of \nescalating energy costs, yet many of these beneficiaries did not \nreceive the full rebates provided through the Economic Stimulus Act of \n2008.\n  This legislation would increase the maximum EITC credit amount by \n$300 for 2008. By increasing the credit amount, more families will be \neligible for the credit than under current law. Beneficiaries will \nreceive the increased EITC when they file their 2008 tax returns. This \n$300 will help working families with rising heating and transportation \ncosts.\n  In the face of skyrocketing energy prices, we must take serious and \nimmediate measures to assist low-income working families. We cannot \nstand idly by as American families are forced to make impossible \ndecisions about whether to heat their homes or put food on their \ntables. This is a crisis of tremendous proportions, and it is incumbent \nupon us to take steps now to ensure that millions of households are not \nliterally left out in the cold this winter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Domenici, and \n        Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 3293. A bill to provide financial aid to local law enforcement \nofficials along the Nation's borders, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing an important \nmeasure that will provide local, State, and Tribal law enforcement \nagencies along our Nation's borders with critical assistance in \naddressing border-related criminal activity. I am pleased that Senators \nHutchison and Domenici are joining me in introducing this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  By virtue of their proximity to an international border, law \nenforcement agencies operating along the border face a variety of \nunique challenges. Criminal enterprises are able take advantage of \nweaknesses in security to traffic drugs and other illicit contraband \ninto the country, as well as smuggle weapons and stolen vehicles out of \nthe country. This creates a nexus of criminal activity that requires \nsubstantial resources to address.\n  While Congress has dramatically increased funding to hire additional \nBorder Patrol agents and to build tactical infrastructure--such as \nsurveillance cameras and barriers--we haven't done enough in terms of \nhelping local law enforcement. The reality is that although we are \nmaking some progress in securing the borders, local law enforcement \nagencies still have to pick up\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\nmuch of the burden in tackling the criminal activity throughout the \nregion.\n  Many of these police departments are ill-suited to cover these costs \nwithout financial assistance. Many are responsible for large, rural \nareas of land and lack the personnel and equipment to adequately patrol \nthese areas. If we are going to be successful in bringing real security \nto the border region, we need to have Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies doing their respective parts to fight criminal \nactivity. But to do this, we also need to ensure that local law \nenforcement have the resources necessary to play a constructive role, \nand to recognize the substantial costs they are incurring.\n  The Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2008 would do just that.\n  Specifically, the legislation would: establish a new competitive \ngrant program within the Department of Justice to assist local law \nenforcement operating within 100 miles of the U.S. borders with Mexico \nand Canada; authorize the Attorney General to designate areas outside \nof the 100-mile limit as ``High Impact Areas'' to permit additional \npolice departments impacted by border-related criminal activity, such \nas drug smuggling, to access grant funding; and authorize $100 million \neach year for the next 5 years to implement this program.\n  Let me also be clear about what this legislation would not do. It \ndoes not confer local law enforcement with authority to enforce Federal \nimmigration law. The purpose of this bill is to help these agencies \ncover some of the costs they incur in addressing border-related \ncriminal activity, not to shift another burden to them.\n  The U.S.-Mexico border region is a vibrant area, economically and \nculturally. International trade with our southern neighbor continues to \nincrease and communities on both sides of the border maintain strong \nties. Unfortunately, over the last year and a half we have seen a \ndramatic increase in the level of violence in Mexico as the government \nsteps up efforts to tackle drug cartels--over 4,000 people have been \nkilled. This violence has had a negative impact on both sides of the \nborder, and Congress recently provided $400 million in assistance for \nMexican law enforcement to address this problem. But we also need to be \naware of the fact that local law enforcement within the United States \nalso need additional resources to prevent this violence from spreading \nand to fight these drug gangs in a comprehensive manner.\n  I strongly believe this legislation will provide this essential \nassistance and I hope my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize tribal, \n     State, or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Border \nLaw Enforcement Relief Act of 2008.\n  This legislation will address one of the most serious threats facing \nour communities--drug trafficking. The magnitude of narcotics \ntrafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border is staggering.\n  According to the U.S. State Department, in 2007 alone, Mexico, with \nclose cooperation from U.S. and regional law enforcement, confiscated \n48.5 metric tons of cocaine, 2,171 metric tons of marijuana, and 25.7 \ntons of precursor chemicals for methamphetamines.\n  On the American side of the border, in fiscal year 2007, on a typical \nday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confiscated 2,250 pounds of \nnarcotics in 69 seizures at ports of entry and 5,138 pounds of \nnarcotics in 29 seizures between ports of entry and conducted 70 \ncriminal arrests.\n  While new funding for the Merida Initiative in the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill will help the Mexican government attack the \nproblem, the funding is currently unbalanced, as it does not address \nthe U.S. side of the border and the battle that our hometown law \nenforcement officials are waging against the exact same threat.\n  We should not fail to recognize that the narco-terrorists in Mexico \nhave grown increasingly violent, killing 300 policemen last year and \nthe head of the Mexican federal police force in May.\n  However, the violence is not confined to Mexico. In 2007, a \ncouncilman from Acuna was killed on U.S. soil in Del Rio, TX, and seven \nborder patrol agents were killed on the frontlines. Two agents have \nbeen killed so far this year. The total number of assaults against \nofficers has increased from 335 in 2001 to 987 in 2007. We must take a \nbalanced approach to this growing problem, which is why I am \nintroducing the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act today.\n  This bill would create a grant program to help certain local law \nenforcement agencies obtain equipment, upgrade technology, hire \nadditional personnel and cover transportation costs associated with \ncriminal activity along the border. Both northern and southern border \nlaw enforcement agencies would be eligible, as well as counties that \nthe\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nAttorney General designates as ``High Impact Areas'' for drug \ntrafficking.\n  While we have taken steps to provide our Federal officials with \nnecessary resources, we have not done enough to sufficiently arm our \nlocal law enforcement officials with the equipment and resources they \nneed to address an increasingly sophisticated and lethal enemy.\n  Our local law enforcement across the country serve as a front-line \ndefense, and Congress must ensure they have the necessary resources to \nstay ahead of the cartels and protect our communities from narcotics \ntrafficking and associated violence.\n  I ask my colleagues to signal their support for our local law \nenforcement in their fight against narco-terrorism by supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3295. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, and the \nTrademark Act of 1946 to provide that the Secretary of Commerce, in \nconsultation with the Director of the United States Patent and \nTrademark Office, shall appoint administrative patent judges and \nadministrative trademark judges, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

A bill to extend the authority of the United States Supreme \nCourt Police to protect court officials off the Supreme Court Grounds \nand change the title of the Administrative Assistant to the Chief \nJustice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation cosponsored \nby Senator Specter that would extend for 5 years the authority of the \nUnited States Supreme Court Police to protect Supreme Court Justices \nwhen they leave the Supreme Court grounds. In January of this year, \nafter months of compromise, the Court Security Improvement Act was \nsigned into law to authorize additional resources to protect Federal \njudges, personnel, and courthouses. The bill that we are introducing \ntoday would extend the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police to \nprotect the Supreme Court Justices on and off Court grounds. It would \nalso change the title of the Chief Justice's senior advisor from \n``Administrative Assistant'' to ``Counselor.'' The administrative \nassistant position was created by statute in 1972.\n  We have extended the U.S. Supreme Court Police's authority to protect \nJustices before, the last time in 2004. This authority expires at the \nend of this year. I urge Senators to pass this legislation quickly so \nwe can provide Supreme Court Justices the protection that they need as \nthey serve our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 3294, introduced earlier today by \nSenators Leahy and Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3294) to provide for the continued performance \n     of the functions of the United States Parole Commission.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate will unanimously \npass the United States Parole Commission Act of 2008, a bill Senator \nSpecter and I introduced that will extend the life of the U.S. Parole \nCommission by 3 years. Without quick action by Congress, the Commission \nwill expire on\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nOctober 31, 2008. Senate passage is an important first step to ensure \nthis does not happen.\n  The U.S. Parole Commission is responsible for granting or denying \nparole for incarcerated Federal and DC prisoners who were sentenced \nbefore the Federal and DC governments abolished parole. The Commission \nwas created and empowered to consider the requests of these ``old law'' \nFederal and DC inmates, but it also has jurisdiction over DC offenders \nwho are on supervised release from prison.\n  Originally slated to expire in 1992, Congress has extended the life \nof the Commission four times. Another extension is necessary to ensure \nthe orderly administration of the law, and to avoid the risk of \npremature release of offenders. If the authorization lapses, the law \nrequires the Commission to set release dates for all parole-eligible \nFederal prisoners. In addition, there is no mechanism to handle DC \nparolees who are on supervised release from prison.\n  A limited extension will avoid these potential problems, and will \ngive the Justice Department time to evaluate whether any changes to the \nCommission are necessary.\n  I urge the House to work quickly to pass this bill and send it to the \nPresident so that it can be effective before the Commission's \nauthorization expires in October.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times and \npassed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3294) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
