Mr. President, my theme today has to do with our friends \nin the media, or the fourth estate as they like to call themselves. \nThere are two items I wish to call to the attention of the Senate and \nanyone else who might be listening with respect to the performance of \nthe media. The first one is highlighted in an editorial that appeared \nthis morning in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Frist's \nVindication.''\n  All of us in this Chamber know Senator Frist. We know him as a man of \nintegrity, intelligence, and grace. He presided over the Senate as the \nmajority leader for 4 years. He has a long history as a humanitarian, \nas a scientist, as a skilled doctor who pioneered procedures in the \nprocess of heart and lung transplants.\n  We also know him as the target of media attack for insider trading, \nand we know groups that are self-anointed as watchdogs of the public \nconsciousness that picked that up and kept the drumbeat alive. Our \nfriends in the media also kept the drumbeat alive saying, over and over \nagain, Dr. Frist was a hypocrite, Dr. Frist engaged in insider trading, \nDr. Frist used his position to enrich himself while he was here in the \nSenate.\n  Well, the Securities and Exchange Commission was sufficiently aroused \nby those attacks that they entered into an investigation of Dr. Frist's \nactivities with respect to his stock. That investigation is now closed. \nI did not realize the investigation was closed because there has been \nno hue and cry whatsoever in the media. There has been no mention that \ncame to my attention in the media, until I picked up this morning's \nWall Street Journal and saw this editorial.\n  I would like to quote from it. Under the title ``Frist's \nVindication'' and the subhead ``So much for that `insider trading' \nsmear,'' here is what it says:\n\n       When insider-trading allegations against former Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\n     surfaced back in 2005, they were splashed on the pages of \n     major newspapers from coast to coast. Now that Dr. Frist has \n     been vindicated, the silence is instructive. Is anybody out \n     there?\n\n  It goes on to describe the allegations against Dr. Frist. I shall not \nrepeat them. Basically, it says he used his position in the Senate to \nget insider information and started selling his stock in HCA in advance \nof a drop in the stock that occurred because of earnings reports.\n\n  The editorial says:\n\n       Thanks in part to his meticulous email archives, Dr. Frist \n     was able to show that he had begun the process of selling his \n     HCA stock in April of 2005, months before he was alleged to \n     have received the inside whispers.\n\n  It goes on to discuss the groups that attacked him. Again quoting:\n\n       For years he was harassed by such liberal lobbies as Public \n     Citizen, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in \n     Washington, which alleged conflicts of interest. These groups \n     objected even to those stocks he held in the blind trust he \n     had created to avoid the appearance of a conflict of \n     interest. Yet when he sold those stocks, with a possible eye \n     on higher office, he was pilloried for doing what the \n     ethicists had asked him to do all along.\n\n  The editorial indicates that while this absolution is a relief to Dr. \nFrist, ``it's impossible to undo the damage to his political career. \nDespite flimsy evidence, the media storm cast a shadow over his office, \nderailing any thought of a Presidential bid this year. The Nashville \nheart surgeon chose instead to `take a sabbatical from public life.' ''\n  A great deal was made out of this. The editorial quotes American \nUniversity professor James Thurber as saying that Dr. Frist ``came in \nlike Jimmy Stewart and was leaving like Martha Stewart.'' That is a \ngreat line. That gets headlines. The press loves things of that kind.\n  Now that it is clear he behaved in an absolutely ethical way--\ndocumented everything he did, turned over all of his e-mails--and has \nbeen completely cleared, after 18 months of careful examination by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, we hear nothing in the press, we \nhear nothing in the way of an apology from Public Citizen or Citizens \nfor Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Maybe ethics does not \napply to them when it comes to apologizing for smears against \nlegitimate and responsible public servants. Maybe we will now hear that \nDr. Thurber has something else to say besides his quick quip about Dr. \nFrist being the same as Martha Stewart as she went to jail. But I doubt \nwe will hear any of that. I doubt the press will even notice. I doubt \nthere will be a sidebar anywhere.\n  I am grateful to the Wall Street Journal for pointing this out to us, \nand I appreciate the opportunity on the floor of the Senate to speak on \nbehalf of a man whom I consider a friend, I think whom all of us \nconsider a responsible Senator, a devoted leader. He deserves better at \nthe hands of the press and those self-appointed leaders of ethics who \nare quick to criticize but slow to apologize.\n  Now, Mr. President, the next issue I would like to raise with respect \nto the media has to do with the hysteria over America's trade deficit \nwith China. I have some charts I would like to put up to show some \nhistorical evidence with respect to this issue.\n  Let's talk about China and the trade deficit and the rise of China. \nThis chart has two lines on it, one in red, which is American exports \nto China, and one in blue, which is American imports from China.\n  Let's go back to 1975, before people were all excited about China and \nhow China was destroying us in the age of globalization, how China's \ncheap labor was taking all of our jobs, and we were flooded with \nChinese imports. We notice on the chart there was a gap between \nAmerican exports to China and American imports from China. No one felt \nthat gap was ready to threaten and destroy the American economy. No one \ngot excited about it. All right.\n  You go to 1990, and you find that neither line has moved up very \nmuch, but the gap remains virtually the same. Now, the Chinese economy \nstarted to take off and we started to buy things from them, and at the \nsame time we started to sell things to them. Both lines started moving \nup. We saw, yes, imports from China were going up, but exports to China \nwere going up. By 2002, 2003, both were up significantly over where \nthey had been in 1975. But the gap remained roughly the same. All \nright.\n  Interestingly enough, as we get toward 2005 and so on, there are \nmoments when the gap disappears, when our sales to China were greater \nthan our imports from China. Why would that be? It would be because the \nimproving Chinese economy now has enough money to buy American goods. \nThey want to buy our airplanes. Boeing does well in China. The last \ntime I was in China, I met with the manager of General Motors in China. \nGeneral Motors was having a very bad year in the United States, but \nthey were having a good year in China. They were making money in China. \nThey were selling Buicks and other automobiles in China.\n  The red line started to move up, and, as I say, at one point they \nactually crossed the blue line. OK, the blue line opened up again, not \nas great as the gap back in 1975, but it began to open up. Once again, \nwe saw the gap closed. Sales to China reached the same level as \npurchases from China. And then it opened up again. It appears if we \nwant to project from this period on into the future that the pattern of \nour importing slightly more from China than we sell to China is likely \nto continue.\n  I doubt this historic demonstration of facts comports with the way \nthe media is talking about China. They are telling us China is going to \novertake us. They are telling us China is going to destroy us. They are \ntelling us China is the nation of the future. We have heard in the \nmedia statements about the 20th century being the American century; the \n21st century is going to be the Chinese century.\n  Well, let me put up another chart that I think will demonstrate that \nmight be a little bit premature.\n  Let's look at the size of the two economies. The size of the economy \nis measured in gross domestic product. The gross domestic product of \nthe United States in 2000 was $9.8 trillion. The gross domestic product \nin China in 2000 was $1.2 trillion. This is the beginning of the \nChinese century? The Chinese are starting off pretty far behind in this \nrace if they are going to turn the 21st century into the Chinese \ncentury. They are at $1.2 trillion and we are at $9.8 trillion. We have \nsprinted into what the media is calling the Chinese century now for the \nfirst 6 years.\n  Where are we? These statistics are for the first 5 years, the first 5 \npercent. In that period of time, our annual GDP growth has been 3.2 \npercent. The Chinese has been 10 percent. Those are the numbers that \nsay they are going to overtake us. Ten percent is clearly better than 3 \npercent.\n  I would make this one footnote with respect to the 10 percent. I am a \nlittle suspect of these numbers because the Chinese released their \nannual figures on December 31 of the same year. We don't know our \nannual figures for months afterwards. Then, when more data comes in, we \nrevise them upward or downward, based on additional information. \nSomehow they know on New Year's Eve exactly how they have done during \nthe year. If they were a corporation required to report to the SEC, \nthere would be some investigations about the possibility of ``cooking \nthe books.'' I think they make the determination of where they want the \nnumber to be and then report it thusly, either too high or too low for \nwhatever their political purposes might be.\n  So all right, let's take these numbers at their face value. These \nnumbers mean from 2000 to 2005 the Chinese GDP grew from $1.2 trillion \nto $2.2 trillion, a $1 trillion increase. That is not a slouchy thing \nto do. That is clearly a tremendously impressive performance--almost \ndoubling a $1 trillion increase. How about the United States. We are \njust limping along at 3 percent, 3.2 percent, but we went from $9.8 \ntrillion to $12.4 trillion.\n  In other words, they went up $1 trillion, and we went up $3 trillion. \nHow is that possible if they are growing another 10 percent, and we are \nonly growing at 3 percent? It is because they are starting from a very \nlow base. Those who say the 21st century will be the Chinese century \nand the Americans are through need to pay attention to what the real \nnumbers are.\n  If we are going to have a game and we start out the game with one \nteam having almost 10 times as many points as the other, and then add \non to that on a percentage basis rather than an\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\nabsolute basis, we see in terms of the gap between the size of the \nAmerican GDP and the Chinese GDP the gap is actually widening rather \nthan shrinking. Yes, they can have a higher rate of growth, but their \nhigher rate of growth is on a much lower base. Our growth on a higher \nbase is unprecedented in world history.\n  My message today is we need to hold the media accountable as well as \nall of the others. We have had two examples I have highlighted this \nmorning where the media has misled us: the first with respect to one of \nour respected and beloved colleagues, Dr. Frist, where he was smeared \nand then when he was vindicated, that fact was ignored. The second has \nto do with telling us where the world is going. For whatever reasons, \nthere are those who are constantly panicked about China and its impact \non the United States who need to pay attention to the reality of the \nnumbers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5317-S5318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today is an important yet a sad day for \nour Nation because it represents the 85th day that our fighting men and \nwomen in uniform have been waiting for emergency aid from the Congress. \nYet they have been left waiting because of political gamesmanship and \npolitical theater in Washington, DC. The latest is reported in the \nCongressional Quarterly today, an article I have here in my hand--\nactually the date is April 30, 2007, 10:45 p.m., entitled: \n``President's Veto Dependent on House Speaker's Signature.'' The report \nis that Congresswoman Pelosi wanted time to personally read the \nemergency supplemental bill and to sign it before sending it to \nPennsylvania Avenue. I would have thought that Congresswoman Pelosi and \nMembers of Congress would have read legislation before they voted on \nit, not afterwards.\n  Also, in today's edition of The Hill, there is a story that says:\n\n       Congressional leaders today will put an exclamation point \n     on their political showdown with President Bush on Iraq \n     spending, staging a signing event to send their Iraq \n     supplemental bill to the White House.\n\n  I don't think this is Congress's finest hour, and I think it is an \nembarrassment that when our troops are waiting on an emergency spending \nbill to provide them essential equipment, we are staging signing \nceremonies and going through political kabuki theater just to \ndemonstrate on the part of some their disagreement on the present \nstrategy in Baghdad and in Iraq. I think it is inappropriate and \nirresponsible.\n  I know one of our colleagues here has talked about, for example, the \nMRAP vehicles, the so-called Mine Resistant Ambush Prevented V-shaped \nhull vehicles that are awaiting $3.1 billion in spending in this \nappropriations bill to get those to the Marines and Army in Iraq, \nsomething that has proven, in the hands of the Marines, to be very \nresistant to the improvised explosive devices. They save lives. That is \none example, one concrete example of funding for equipment that is \nbeing held up because Congress continues to dither and play political \ngames now 85 days after the President has requested this funding for \nour troops. The bill that will--after this so-called signing ceremony \nand after this reading of the bill after it has passed rather than \nbefore it was passed exercise--be sent to the President and he will \nveto it is simply unacceptable. Why? For two reasons.\n\n  First of all, because it imposes arbitrary timelines on our generals \nin Iraq, including GEN David Petraeus, who was confirmed unanimously by \nthe Senate, who was here last week to explain the progress that is \nbeing made in places such as Al Anbar Province, west of Iraq, which has \nbeen controlled by al-Qaida for some time now, and we are finally \nstarting to see some real, concrete improvements being made there. We \nare seeing the local sheiks offering troops to supplement Iraqi police \nofficers and the Iraqi Army to fight al-Qaida--the same organization \nthat killed 3,000 Americans on September 11--right in Iraq. That is \ngood news.\n  We are beginning to see some real security measures going forward. So \nwhy we would have Congress tie the hands of General Petraeus and these \nsuccessful efforts in Al Anbar Province, west of Baghdad, controlled by \nal-Qaida, and why Congress would want to tie the hands of our military \nleaders at a time when we are seeing some real improvement there is, \nfrankly, beyond me. Why would we simply give up when we are beginning \nto see some light at the end of the tunnel?\n  Then, of course, there is the second matter of providing porkbarrel \nspending in order to secure the votes of some Members of the House for \nthis bill that they would not support on the merits. It is completely \ndemeaning to our troops and the nobility of their sacrifice, not to \nmention the sacrifice of the military families who wait anxiously \nhoping their loved one will return from the fight only to be told that \nCongress is causing unnecessary delays in this spending--85 days now--\nputting arbitrary timelines on the troops, making it harder for them to \nsucceed, denying them the equipment necessary for their very safety, \nwhile Congress engages in more porkbarrel spending in order to secure a \npolitical consensus for this ill-considered piece of legislation.\n  The bill, on its way to the President after this kabuki theater, \nsubstitutes congressional mandates for the considered judgments of our \nmilitary leaders. This bill assumes and forces the failure of a new \nstrategy, which is only halfway implemented. The new Baghdad security \nplan to back up Iraqi forces in Baghdad to implement the clear hold-\nand-build strategy that GEN David Petraeus is the architect of as part \nof our counterinsurgency measures is only halfway deployed. Only half \nof the troops that are a part of this so-called surge are on the \nground. While we are seeing some progress, we are also seeing some \nincreased violence and, unfortunately, deaths as a result of meeting \nthe enemy in places where previously they were safe and secure because \nwe could not even go into places such as Sadar City, which was \ncontrolled by Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric who has since \nleft to go to Tehran. He has left the country because he is afraid of \nthe American and Iraqi military forces joining together. He has \ninstructed the Shiite militias, one of the major causes of death squads \nand violence and ethnic cleansing in Iraq, to lay down their arms. What \nis there not to like about that kind of progress? Yet Congress, \nthousands of miles away in the safety and comfort of the Senate Chamber \nand our offices, is undermining the good efforts that are going forward \nin Iraq.\n  While no one believes success is assured, we know, in the words of \nGeneral Petraeus:\n\n       The mission is hard, but it is not hopeless.\n\n  The only thing that would make it hopeless is if Congress continues \nto undermine General Petraeus and our troops who are in harm's way. It \nboggles my mind that we have that sort of mindset in Washington, DC \nbecause of some rabid, antiwar, left-leaning groups that insist we \nought to simply tuck our tail and run. They haven't come up with an \nadequate explanation as to what they think would happen if we were to \nleave precipitously, as some of them suggest.\n  I happen to believe that notwithstanding the fact that Darfur, where \n400,000 people at last count have died as a result of terrible violence \nthere, would pale compared to the ethnic cleansing and the violence \nthat would follow if America were to betray our Iraqi allies and would \nleave precipitously. It would also create a regional conflict where \nSunni majority nations would come in and try to stave off the Shiites \nfrom Iran for helping them and trying to prevent them from killing the \nSunni minority there.\n  The Democratic leadership has not helped the situation in Iraq with \ntheir recent pronouncements either. Democratic leadership in recent \nfloor statements has suggested that if the President vetoes this bill, \nthen he will be the one endangering the troops. They further stated \nthey hope the President would realize that with his pen in hand he can \nhonor soldiers, honor his country, and bring an end to this war.\n  To that I say baloney. That is sheer fantasy that by cutting and \nrunning, by neglecting our allies in Iraq, by neglecting the \nimprovements we have been able to make, by recruiting tribal sheiks to \nhelp us in fighting al-Qaida,\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\nthat somehow, by giving up on that, we are going to bring an end to the \nviolence and the death in Iraq. To the contrary, we would create a \nfailed state where al-Qaida, the very same people who hit this country \non September 11, 2001, could reorganize, train, and recruit, and export \nfuture terrorist attacks to the United States.\n  I am chilled by comments made a few months ago when I attended a \nceremony where the Deputy Secretary of Defense spoke.\n  He asked rhetorically:\n\n       Do you know why al-Qaida killed 3,000 people on September \n     11, 2001, in New York and Washington, DC?\n\n  Then he answered his own question. He said:\n\n       Because they could not kill 30,000, because they could not \n     kill 3 million.\n\n  His point is if they had the kind of biological, chemical, or nuclear \nweapons they are seeking, they would have killed thousands--perhaps \nhundreds of thousands more innocent Americans. And they will do that at \nwill if they are provided that sort of weaponry.\n  So it is sheer naivete on the part of those who say all we need to do \nis leave and somehow these people will go away. They will not go away \nand they will visit us here again with deadly results.\n  With General Petraeus back from Iraq for the first time last week \nsince he assumed command of U.S. forces, and the emergency \nsupplemental, I hope, reaching the President later today, it is \nappropriate to reflect on the majority leader's statement, where he \nsaid we have ``lost the war.''\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony \nfrom GEN Barry McCaffrey, a proven combat commander from the first gulf \nwar, and a recognized expert on the tactical, operational, and \nstrategic situation in Iraq. I will quote for a moment from his \nstatement. He said:\n\n       The consequences of failure in Iraq will be a disaster to \n     the American people and our allies if we cannot achieve our \n     objective to create a stable, law-based state at peace with \n     its neighbors. . . . We have 150,000 U.S. troops battling in \n     Iraq and 22,000 fighting bravely in Afghanistan.\n       These are the finest, most courageous military men and \n     women we have ever fielded in battle. Their commanders--who \n     have almost without exception at company, battalion, and \n     brigade level served multiple combat tours--are the most \n     capable leaders that I have encountered in my many years of \n     watching our Armed Forces with admiration.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Our new leadership team in Iraq--our brilliant new \n     commander, General David Petraeus, and the equally \n     experienced Ambassador Ryan Crocker--are launched on a new \n     approach to use political reconciliation, new methods and \n     equipment to strengthen the Iraqi security forces and \n     enhanced U.S. combat protective power to stabilize the \n     situation. We must give them time and space.\n\n  That is exactly what we are trying to do, to provide the basic \nsecurity General Petraeus said is necessary, but not sufficient, to \nsolve the problem.\n  I submit our colleagues who have said General Petraeus said there is \nno military solution in Iraq are not listening to what he is saying, \nbecause what he has said is that improving our security situation is \nnecessary but not sufficient. It is not a question of whether we are \ngoing to do the security part or the political reconciliation part. One \nmust precede the other. It makes common sense that it is hard to sit \ndown and work out your differences around a conference table in a \npolitical debate, or an attempt at reconciliation, if people are \ndriving automobile-borne improvised explosive devices or people are \nwalking into the Parliament in a suicide vest. So security must precede \nthe political reconciliation that we all recognize is so absolutely \nimportant. That is what General Petraeus is saying. That is what we \nhave to accomplish.\n  We have some hopeful signs in Iraq now, for the first time in a long \ntime, as a result of this new strategy that is only about half way \nimplemented. But if we are going to succeed, it won't be because our \ncommanders have had their hands tied by arbitrary deadlines in \nWashington, DC. It won't be because of the political theater going on \nhere 85 days after the President had requested the emergency spending \nincluded in this bill for necessary equipment for our troops.\n  The leadership should sign this legislation and get it to the \nPresident so he can veto it and we can get down to the serious business \nof providing for our troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 4 years ago today, President Bush landed \non the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in his flight suit. The banner behind him \nproudly said, ``Mission accomplished.'' President Bush announced to the \nworld, and to the American people, that ``major combat operations in \nIraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our \nallies have prevailed.''\n  I can think of almost no greater act of hubris, arrogance, and denial \nthan the declaration of mission accomplished in Iraq 4 years ago. It is \ntruly stunning how false that statement was.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet, since that time, 3,000 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq. Over \n104 American troops died in April alone, making it the deadliest month \nsince last December.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet we have now spent over $450 billion on the war in Iraq. This war is \ncosting us almost 10 times what the Bush administration initially said \nit would.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet we have now been in Iraq for nearly 50 months, longer than the \nUnited States was in World War II.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet U.S. troop fatalities are up 33 percent since the President's \nescalation of the war in January.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet today, Iraqi civilian casualties are estimated to be in the tens or \neven hundreds of thousands. It is impossible to know how many have been \nkilled in Iraq, but the United Nations estimates that 35,000 civilians \nhave been killed.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet today oil production in Iraq is still 15 percent lower than it was \nbefore the war.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet Baghdad is only getting 6 hours of electricity a day, significantly \nless than before the war.\n  Four years ago today, President Bush declared mission accomplished. \nYet the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction just put out \na new report detailing how projects the administration declared a \n``success'' are actually failing and no longer operating.\n  Frankly, it reminds me of all the other ways we were misled by this \nadministration. Let us remember what this administration told us about \nthis war. Let us remember the Iraq myths. Remember the unfound weapons \nof mass destruction; remember the missing mobile weapons labs; remember \nthe yellowcake uranium in Africa; remember Saddam's nonexistent vast \nstockpiles of chemical weapons; remember when Secretary Rumsfeld told \nus that ``we know where the weapons of mass destruction are;'' remember \nthe nonexistent link between al-Qaida and Saddam; remember the claims \nthat Iraqi oil and other countries, not the United States taxpayer, \nwould pay for the cost of reconstruction; remember when the \nadministration told us the war would cost only between $50 billion and \n$60 billion; remember when Paul Wolfowitz said ``it seems outlandish'' \nto think we would need several hundred thousand troops in Iraq; and \nremember when President Bush told us on May 1, 2003, that ``major \ncombat operations in Iraq have ended.''\n  This is the same administration that now comes to this Congress and \nsays: Trust us. This is the same administration that says: Trust us, \nour new escalation plan will work. This is the same administration that \ntells this Congress and the American people to be patient, to give \ntheir ``new'' plan to escalate the war time to work.\n  Yet their new plan is more of the same. To quote one of the witnesses \nwho testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       This plan is just stay-the-course plus 20,000 troops.\n\n  That is what they thought then when the witness testified, but \neventually it has been a lot more than 20,000 troops.\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\n  Well, the American people and this Congress have run out of patience. \nThis administration has run out of credibility to ask for more time or \nanother chance, when all we are largely doing is staying the course. \nFrankly, I find it insulting that this administration thinks this \nCongress would simply go along with their escalation plan without \nquestion.\n  Why should we support President Bush's escalation--a plan with \nbenchmarks but no real consequences? As I have said time and time \nagain, benchmarks without consequences are simply aspirations. We have \nseen countless misguided plans from this administration, but the Iraqis \nhave never been held accountable.\n  We were told by the end of 2006 a provincial election law would be \napproved. But that benchmark has not been met. We were told that Iraqis \nwould approve a law for de-Baathification. But that benchmark has not \nbeen met.\n  We were told that Iraqis would create a law to help restrain \nsectarian militias. But that benchmark, too, has not been met.\n  We were told the Iraqis would establish a law to regulate the oil \nindustry and share revenues, which is one of the critical elements to \nbe able to achieve reconciliation in Iraq, the sharing of the nation's \nnational resources. But that benchmark has not been met.\n  We were told that, by March, the Iraqi Government was supposed to \nhold a referendum on constitutional amendments. But that benchmark has \nnot been met.\n  Time and again, the Iraqi Government has fallen short; and time and \nagain, this administration has looked the other way--basing their plans \non the hope that the Iraqis will step up. Continuing this failed policy \nin Iraq based on the mere hope that things will improve is not good \nenough. The broken promises must stop.\n  It also seems to me the President is once again out of touch about \nour progress on the ground and his escalation plan. The President said \nlast week:\n\n       The direction of the fight is beginning to shift . . . and \n     so far the operation is meeting expectations.\n\n  This is very much like ``mission accomplished.'' Yet, last Monday, an \nattack carried out by a suicide bomber near Baqubah killed 9 soldiers \nand wounded 20 others. The explosion was one of the deadliest single \nground attacks on American forces since the start of the war.\n  Two weeks ago, five different bombs exploded in Baghdad, killing at \nleast 171 people. These attacks mark the deadliest day in the capital \ncity since the new security plan was implemented 2 months ago.\n  In fact, almost four coalition soldiers have been killed per day in \nthe past month--the highest rate since January of 2005. As I pointed \nout before, over 100 soldiers were killed in April, including 9 killed \nover the weekend, 1 of only 6 times that more than 100 servicemembers \nwere killed in 1 month since the start of the war.\n  Violence outside of Baghdad is on the rise, with more than twice the \nnumber of American troops killed in the past 5 months in Diyala \nProvince than were killed all of last year.\n  In terms of civilians, over 1,500 Iraqis were killed between February \n14 and April 12. That is almost 500 more people than were killed during \nthe previous 2 months.\n\n  Frankly, I don't believe the President's escalation plan is working. \nSo I say to the President: The era of blank checks is over and the time \nof congressional oversight has begun.\n  The President would largely want us to send him a blank check. We \nhave spent 10 times more than we were told we would spend on this war, \nand there is no end in sight in terms of lives and national treasure. \nThat is why this Senate and the House sent the President an Iraq \nspending bill with a responsible timeline for withdrawing our troops \nfrom Iraq. I believe the President is making a serious mistake with his \nplan to veto the bill.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle like to point out that the \nPresident is the Commander in Chief. I remind my friends the \nConstitution puts the Congress in charge of appropriating funds. The \nConstitution, in article I, section 8, provides what scholars call the \npower of the purse, and it says: ``The Congress''--the Congress--\n``shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and \nExcises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and \ngeneral Welfare of the United States.'' Congress has the power and the \nright and the obligation to make sure we spend the taxpayers' money \nwisely.\n  In a recent editorial, Leon Panetta, a member of the Iraq Study \nGroup, reminded us the President has stated the goal of our involvement \nis for Iraq to be able to ``govern itself, sustain itself, defend \nitself.''\n  In order for us to get to that point, we need to hold Iraqis \naccountable for meeting the benchmarks they helped set. The emergency \nsupplemental bill that passed the House and the Senate does just that, \nby including a plan to redeploy U.S. forces in relation to progress \nmade by the Iraqi Government in achieving security and diplomatic \nbenchmarks.\n  Leon Panetta also said:\n\n       The worst mistake now would be to provide money for the war \n     without sending the Iraqis any message at all about their \n     responsibility for reforms. Both the President and the \n     Congress at the very least must make the Iraqi Government \n     understand that future financial and military support is \n     going to depend on Baghdad's making substantial progress \n     toward the milestones Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has \n     publicly committed to.\n\n  The Iraq supplemental sends a strong message to the Iraqis that it is \ntheir responsibility to take control of their own country and that our \ninvolvement in Iraq is not indefinite.\n  Vetoing the supplemental sends the message to the Iraqis that they do \nnot have to take responsibility and that our troops will be in Iraq \nindefinitely. But staying in Iraq isn't in the national interest or \nnational security of the United States.\n  Our troops are caught in the middle of a civil war they cannot solve. \nKeeping more troops there will only put them directly in the middle of \nan Iraqi fight. Keeping our troops there is trying to solve a political \nproblem with a military solution. Staying in Iraq actually keeps the \nIraqis from taking responsibility for their actions.\n  Frankly, what we hear from the other side doesn't make sense. They \ntalk about victory, but what is the definition of ``victory''? Is that \nthe victory we have heard is around the corner? They talk about \nbenchmarks for the Iraqis, but they set no consequences.\n  Four years after the President declared ``mission accomplished,'' 4 \nyears and over 3,000 Americans lives later, 4 years and over $450 \nbillion later, 4 years with no new plan for Iraq, just more of the \nsame, 4 years after the President declared ``mission accomplished,'' I \nask: How many more lives must we lose and how much more money must we \nspend?\n  I close by asking: When will this administration finally understand \nthat ``mission accomplished'' was a myth of their own imagination, born \nof delusion and denial, yet another terrible mistake in a series of \ntragic errors? When will we finally hear the words ``major combat in \nIraq has ended'' and know they are true?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 4 years ago today, as Senator Menendez \nsaid, the President landed on an aircraft carrier, amid a flurry of \npomp and circumstance, and declared, ``Mission accomplished.''\n  Since that day, much has happened. Since that day, 3,000 brave \nAmerican soldiers and marines have died in Iraq. This war has gone on, \nsince that day, longer than World War II. Since that day, the United \nNations has estimated that 35,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed. \nSince that day, U.S. taxpayers have spent $450 billion on the war in \nIraq.\n  To get an understanding of what $450 billion is, if we spent $500 \nevery second of every minute of every hour of every day, it would take \n29 years to spend the $450 billion we have spent in Iraq.\n  Now, 4 years later, our troops in Iraq are stuck in the middle of a \ncivil war. Too many of our brave soldiers do not have the body armor \nthey need, in spite of the imploring of so many of us to the \nadministration to do what they need to do to protect our soldiers. Now \nthousands of Guard men and women face early and extended redeployment.\n  Four years later, the will of the people resonates in townhalls and \nin\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\nchurches, in back yards and in living rooms across this country. Their \nmessage is clear: Mr. President, redeploy our troops out of Iraq.\n  Up to now, however, the President has refused to hear the calls of \nmillions of Americans. He has refused to listen to voters last fall who \ndemanded a different course in Iraq. He has refused to listen to the \nIraq Study Group, which recommended the redeployment of our troops out \nof Iraq. He has refused to listen to his own generals who have implored \nhim, in many cases, to disengage from this civil war. He has refused to \nlisten to Congress.\n\n  The supplemental on its way to the White House echoes what many of us \nin Congress and military families across this great country have been \nsaying: We need a new direction for Iraq.\n  We take a backseat to no one in supporting the brave men and women \nfighting in Iraq. That is why so many of us have pushed this \nadministration, pushed the civilian leadership in the Pentagon and in \nthe White House to equip our soldiers with proper body armor.\n  We take a backseat to no one in supporting the families of our \nsoldiers overseas. That is why so many of us in this Chamber have \npushed to help these support groups that have formed all over the \ncountry for soldiers and helping them reintegrate back into their jobs, \nback with their families and their society when they return home from \nIraq.\n  But more of the same is not a plan for our troops and will not end \nthe war in Iraq. This war has made our country and our world less safe. \nCongress will continue to fight for our Nation's military by working to \nsee that they have the resources and the support they need and the \nleadership they deserve.\n  This legislation fully funds and supports our troops, while \nestablishing conditions that will bring our troops home. It provides \ndesperately needed funding to the Veterans' Administration, something \nthis administration and previous Republican Congresses have woefully \nunderfunded. It provides desperately needed funding to the Veterans' \nAdministration to help care for the hundreds of thousands of new \nveterans created by this war.\n  If the President will not take responsibility for his failures in his \nconduct of this war, then Congress will. If the President will not lead \nour troops home, then Congress will. We owe it to our soldiers, to our \nsailors, to our airmen, airwomen, and to our marines, and we owe it to \ntheir families.\n  Instead of threatening a veto, the President should listen to the \nmilitary leaders, listen to the American people, and work with Congress \nto change the course in Iraq.\n  Vetoing this legislation would deny funding our military and our \nveterans desperately need: $99 billion in emergency Department of \nDefense spending, more than the President's budget; $3 billion for Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected vehicles; $4.8 billion in military \nconstruction for BRAC, the Base Closing Commission; and the VA, which \nhas been underfunded by $2 billion in the President's budget, under \nthis bill would get $1.7 billion immediately, more than the President's \nVA proposal, and will do better in the next budget. It includes $100 \nmillion for VA mental health services.\n  It is absolutely outrageous that this Congress--the House and \nSenate--and this President send our men and women off to war, not \nequipping them with the right body armor, not giving them the Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected vehicles we know how to build in this \ncountry, and then when they return home, not giving tens of thousands \nof soldiers and marines the health care they deserve.\n  In addition to what we do to restore that spending and take care of \nour veterans when they return home, this emergency legislation has over \n$1 billion for Katrina relief, $13 million for mine safety because of \nthe increase in deaths in mines in places such as Pennsylvania and West \nVirginia, $625 million for the pandemic flu response, something we \nabsolutely need to be prepared for, and $400 million for energy \nassistance for the low-income elderly.\n  Please, Mr. President, before you decide to veto this bill, read this \nlegislation. Don't turn your back on millions of Americans, don't turn \nyour back on your military advisers and the military experts, don't \nturn your back on our soldiers. Sign this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5320-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5320-S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, if you come to my office--I think you have \nhad the opportunity to do so--you will see in front of the entrance at \n112 Hart four huge placards with very small print paying tribute to \nthose from California who have died in this conflict. The sadness of \nall sadness is that we keep having to send these posters back to be \nprinted in yet smaller print because we keep having to add so many to \nit, and we are actually running out of space. We will have to get \nspecial permission from the Architect of the Capitol to place yet \nanother placard in front of our door.\n  But we will do it regardless because we must put names on this \nconflict, ages on this conflict, we must pay tribute to those who are \nbeing sacrificed, in my opinion, by a President who simply will not \nchange course, for whatever reason, from a failed course.\n  Anyone who reads the Constitution--I highly recommend it; it is a \nvery\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nreadable document; it is a very concise document--will see that when it \ncomes to war, there is a shared responsibility. As a matter of fact, if \nyou read the Constitution, you will see Congress mentioned far more \ntimes, far many more times than the President. The President cannot act \nas if he is king. We already had a king, King George. We have a \ndemocracy. This is what the President says our young people are dying \nfor in Iraq. Yet at home he acts as if he is a one-man show when it \ncomes to Iraq.\n  Mr. President, the American people said no to that this past \nelection. Yet it continues as if there is no Congress, there has been \nno election, there has been no change of heart by the American people, \nwhen, in fact, there has been an enormous change of heart by the \nAmerican people. That change of heart is reflected in the election, in \nthe composition of this Senate, and you, Mr. President, actually are \npart of that change, that message that we wanted a change in the \nleadership. With all of this, it just goes on and on.\n  Today is the fourth anniversary of the President's speech that major \ncombat operations are over. Four years ago he said that, in a military \noutfit. Yet, still, in today's paper: April toll is highest of 2007 for \nU.S. troops. Over 100 killed this month. The Iraqi deaths are far \nhigher.\n  Three years ago the President said: Major combat operations are over. \nToday we read: The deadliest month in 2007. As a matter of fact, in the \npast 3 days--as of yesterday, 3 days prior to that, we had 14 \ndead. That is about one for almost every person in the President's \nCabinet.\n\n  What would it be like if 14 people sat around the President's Cabinet \ntable, and every one of them had lost a child? How long would this war \nlast? How long would this war last? But who is paying the price? Who is \npaying the price? Our military families. They want a change. We want \nsuccess.\n  How do you get success? It is by changing course. It is what we sent \nthe President. If you read what we sent the President in this emergency \nbill--I say to the Presiding Officer, I know you are so aware of it--it \nis a change in course. We are going to shift, as the Iraq Study Group \nsuggested, from a combat mission to a support mission. We are going to \ngradually redeploy our troops out of there--not overnight--but \nsensibly. We are going to leave forces in Iraq to target al-Qaida, \nwhich never was in Iraq before this war, and now they are all over it \nbecause they want to go after our troops. So we are going to leave \ntroops there in Iraq. That is what the Feingold-Reid-Boxer bill does as \nwell. It says we have to have a mission there to go after al-Qaida when \nthis war is over. We say training the troops is OK. Going after al-\nQaida is what we want to do, and we want to have enough troops there \nfor force protection.\n  So anyone reading this--when the President says it is irresponsible, \nmaybe he has not read it. There is time, Mr. President. You have not \ngotten this bill yet. Read it again. Look at it. We are changing course \nin a responsible way, the way the Iraqi Study Group that you praised \nsays we should do. That was a bipartisan group. We all remember it: \nSecretary Baker, Lee Hamilton, and the others.\n  Do you know why we have to change course? Because the mission you \nhave given our military cannot be accomplished militarily. The mission \nnow is--and since the mission has changed so many times, we have to go \nback. The mission now is: Bring stability and democracy to Iraq, and \nIraq at peace within its own borders and with its neighbors, and an \nally in the war against terror. That is the President's goal. That is a \npolitical and diplomatic goal, I say to you, Mr. President. It is not a \nmilitary goal. The military cannot do that. The military has done \neverything asked of it, and more.\n  The first mission: Find the weapons of mass destruction. They went \ninto every nook and cranny of Iraq. There were none. So that mission: \ndone, accomplished.\n  The President said: Go get Saddam. They did it. That mission: \naccomplished. That tyrant is gone forever.\n  He said: Go get his sons because maybe they will get the idea we mean \nbusiness. The military got his sons, put the pictures on television of \ntheir dead bodies. It did not do the job.\n  What was the next mission? We have to hold elections. The military \ndid a magnificent job. Three elections were actually held, and they \nhave a government. Now, that Government will go on vacation, as I \nunderstand it, for 2 months while our troops are dying.\n  The fact is, the military has done every single thing asked of it. We \nare now at a point where the only way to win this war is to win it \ndiplomatically, politically. Yet, this President will not change \ncourse. His solution is, more military action, a surge, which was \nsupposed to last a few weeks--now we are being told a few months--and \nour military is paying the price. They are paying the price.\n  I want to read from this news article today: ``April Toll Is Highest \nof '07 for U.S. Troops'':\n\n       On Monday, U.S. troops at Camp Victory, a sprawling base \n     near Baghdad International Airport, reflected on April's \n     deadly toll on their comrades. . . .\n       ``It makes me feel depressed to be in Iraq right now,'' \n     said [Private Richard] Gonzalez, [22 years old,] who is on \n     his second deployment. ``It's a whole lot different than last \n     time.''\n       Now, he said, soldiers at the base must carry weapons. \n     Return addresses on letters from home must be ripped off and \n     burned, so as not to fall into the wrong hands. On his first \n     deployment, eight months passed before his Baghdad base was \n     hit by mortar fire.\n\n  This time, incoming fire every single day--4 years after ``mission \naccomplished.''\n  ``There's a whole lot more activity,'' said Spec. Krystal Fowler, 21, \nof Hampton, Va. She said it ``kind of bothers'' her to know other \ntroops are taking hits in the field and she can't help.\n  SPC Natisha Jetter said:\n\n       Our fellow soldiers are out there dying, and we're here. . \n     . .\n       Gonzales said the deaths made him realize that ``there's a \n     war going on out there.''\n       Fowler sighed. It's a war between Iraqis, she said.\n       ``We are just interfering, and letting our soldiers die.''\n       ``I'd rather be out there helping people survive,'' Fowler \n     said. . . .\n       There was a pause, as the soldiers mulled that.\n       ``It's just terrifying, because you can drive the same road \n     for eight months, and then one day it's over,'' Gonzalez \n     said.\n       ``Over,'' Fowler echoed.\n\n  I ask, rhetorically, in light of what our troops are feeling, \nsaying--going there for a second deployment, third deployment and more, \nand the increased number of deaths of our troops, and the horrific \nthings that are happening in Iraq, detailed in the Red Cross report, \nwhich I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident, this International Red Cross report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Civilians Without Protection\n\n\n             the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis in iraq\n\n       The humanitarian situation is steadily worsening and it is \n     affecting, directly or indirectly, all Iraqis.\n       Protecting Iraq's civilian population must be a priority, \n     and the ICRC urgently calls for better respect for \n     international humanitarian law. It appeals to all those with \n     military or political influence on the ground to act now to \n     ensure that the lives of ordinary Iraqis are spared and \n     protected. This is an obligation under international \n     humanitarian law for both States and non-State actors.\n       The ICRC aims to ensure that Iraqis receive the aid they \n     need most. It cooperates closely with the Iraqi Red Crescent. \n     However, humanitarian aid is clearly not enough when it comes \n     to addressing the immense needs of Iraqis in the present \n     disastrous security situation.\n\n\n                     a conflict that spares no one\n\n       The conflict in Iraq is inflicting immense suffering on the \n     entire population. Civilians bear the brunt of the relentless \n     violence and the extremely poor security conditions that are \n     disrupting the lives and livelihoods of millions. Every day, \n     dozens of people are killed and many more wounded. The plight \n     of Iraqi civilians is a daily reminder of the fact that there \n     has long been a failure to respect their lives and dignity.\n       Shootings, bombings, abductions, murders, military \n     operations and other forms of violence are forcing thousands \n     of people to flee their homes and seek safety elsewhere in \n     Iraq or in neighbouring countries. The hundreds of thousands \n     of displaced people scattered across Iraq find it \n     particularly difficult to cope with the ongoing crisis, as do \n     the families who generously agree to host them.\n       Health-care facilities are stretched to the limit as they \n     struggle to cope with mass casualties day-in, day-out. Many \n     sick and injured people do not go to hospital because it's \n     too dangerous, and the patients and medical staff in those \n     facilities are frequently threatened or targeted.\n       Food shortages have been reported in several areas. \n     According to the Iraqi Red Crescent, malnutrition has \n     increased over the\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\n     past year. The vastly inadequate water, sewage and \n     electricity infrastructure is presenting a risk to public \n     health.\n       Unemployment and poverty levels are rising and many \n     families continue to rely on government food distributions to \n     cover their immediate needs. According to government sources, \n     an estimated one third of the population lives in poverty, \n     while over five percent live in extreme poverty.\n       Much of Iraq's vital infrastructure is in a poor state of \n     repair owing to lack of maintenance and because security \n     constraints have impeded repair work on electrical power \n     grids, water and sanitation systems, medical facilities and \n     other essential facilities.\n       Power shortages are growing worse throughout the country, \n     including northern areas, owing largely to the failure to \n     carry out maintenance and to increase generation capacity. \n     Fuel shortages affecting power stations and acts of sabotage \n     are further aggravating the crisis. As a result, water-\n     treatment plants, primary health-care centres and hospitals \n     rely mainly on back-up generators, which often break down \n     owing to excess usage or fall victim to the chronic fuel \n     shortages.\n       The destructive legacy of previous conflicts, from 1980 \n     onwards, and the years of international sanctions imposed on \n     Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are further \n     exacerbating the current crisis.\n\n\n                            the icrc in iraq\n\n       Despite the difficult security situation, the ICRC spares \n     no effort to help the families most in need. It works closely \n     with the Iraqi Red Crescent, which regularly distributes \n     relief provided by the ICRC and collects and delivers Red \n     Cross messages (brief personal messages to relatives made \n     otherwise unreachable by armed conflict).\n       The ICRC--a strictly humanitarian organization committed to \n     the principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality--\n     strives to monitor and promote respect for international \n     humanitarian law and other legal standards applicable to the \n     current situation in Iraq.\n\n\n                          sliding to disaster\n\n       Since the bombing of the sacred Shiite shrine of Samarra in \n     February 2006 and the subsequent increase in violence, the \n     problem of displacement in Iraq has become particularly \n     acute. Thousands of Iraqis continue to be forced out of their \n     homes owing to military operations, general poor security and \n     the destruction of houses. And the outlook is bleak, \n     particularly in Baghdad and other areas with mixed \n     communities, where the situation is likely to worsen.\n       Most displaced people have taken refuge with host families, \n     who often struggle to cope with the additional burden on \n     their limited resources. Some have found refuge in camps, \n     public buildings and abandoned military barracks. Where \n     displaced people decide to seek refuge often depends on the \n     presence of relatives or friends and, because of the \n     prevailing sectarian violence, on the religious or ethnic \n     make-up of the host community.\n       Frequently, both the displaced families and the communities \n     hosting them are badly in need of shelter materials, access \n     to clean water, adequate sanitation, food and other \n     essentials.\n       The displacement of hundreds of thousands of people places \n     an additional burden on Iraq's basic infrastructure, which is \n     barely sufficient to serve the resident population.\n       Humanitarian aid is needed by a wide range of particularly \n     vulnerable. civilians, including elderly and disabled people \n     and female-headed households.\n\n\n                       medical care under threat\n\n       Medical professionals are fleeing the country in large \n     numbers following the murder or abduction of colleagues. \n     Hospitals and other key services are desperately short of \n     qualified staff. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, \n     more than half the doctors have left the country.\n       The mass influx of casualties to hospitals following the \n     daily attacks against civilians and other violent incidents \n     is putting the health-care system under tremendous additional \n     strain. Staff and resources are often stretched to the limit.\n       The failure to observe the special status of medical staff \n     and facilities is a major concern. A hospital director in \n     Baghdad told the ICRC that poor security conditions were \n     preventing staff from providing medical services. And there \n     have been frequent reports of armed men storming hospitals \n     and forcing doctors to give their companions priority \n     treatment at the expense of others in more urgent need.\n       Road-blocks and check-points sometimes prevent doctors and \n     patients from reaching health-care centres in time. The lack \n     of security also hampers the distribution of medical supplies \n     in many parts of Iraq.\n\n\n                   dirty and scarce--the water crisis\n\n       Both the quantity and quality of drinking water in Iraq \n     remain insufficient despite limited improvements in some \n     areas, mainly in the south. Water is often contaminated owing \n     to the poor repair of sewage and water-supply networks and \n     the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers, which are the \n     main source of drinking water. Electricity and fuel shortages \n     and the poor maintenance of infrastructure mean that there is \n     no regular and reliable supply of clean water and that sewage \n     is often not properly disposed of.\n\n\n               torn apart--The fate of separated families\n\n       Tens of thousands of people are currently being detained by \n     the Iraqi authorities and the multinational forces in Iraq. \n     Many families remain without news of relatives who went \n     missing during past conflicts or the current hostilities.\n       Visiting people detained in connection with the armed \n     conflict in Iraq remains a humanitarian priority for the \n     ICRC. Persons held by the multinational forces or the Kurdish \n     regional government are regularly visited to assess their \n     conditions of detention and treatment.\n\n\n                            the ICRC in 2006\n\n       Over 227,000 people, mostly members of displaced families, \n     received food aid in various parts of Iraq. Over 161,000 \n     people received essential household items.\n       Some 83,000 people, including members of displaced \n     families, had their water supply ensured through emergency \n     ICRC water and sanitation projects.\n       In all, over four million people benefited from water and \n     sanitation projects.\n       Twenty major hospitals in Hilla, Baghdad, Diwaniya, \n     Karbala, Najaf and Tal Afar received medical and surgical \n     supplies for the treatment of wounded patients.\n       Eight limb-fitting centres in Baghdad, Hilla, Najaf and \n     Basra were supported by the ICRC, as was an Iraqi Red \n     Crescent centre in Mosul. This was in addition to the Arbil \n     centre, which is run entirely by the ICRC. In all, these \n     centres helped nearly 21,000 patients, who received 7,300 \n     artificial and some 460 pairs of crutches.\n       Twelve hospital emergency wards received new equipment.\n       Ten hospitals, with a combined capacity to treat some 5,000 \n     inpatients, had their water and sanitation systems repaired.\n       Sixty-seven primary health-care centres in Anbar, Babel, \n     Baghdad, Diwaniya, Karbala, Salah AI Deen and Wasit \n     governorates had their sanitation facilities repaired or \n     upgraded. They treat an average of over 9,000 patients per \n     day.\n       More than 32,000 detainees were visited, almost 9,000 of \n     them individually, during 109 visits to 28 places of \n     detention.\n       Nearly 6,400 detainees held in Camp Bucca and in the Shaiba \n     facility benefited from the ICRC family-visit programme.\n       Nearly 37,000 Red Cross messages were delivered and over \n     30,500 collected by the ICRC in conjunction with the Iraqi \n     Red Crescent.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This report is called ``Civilians Without Protection.'' I \nwill go into it in a minute. But in light of everything that is \nhappening, how on Earth could the President sit in the Oval Office and \nsay: ``I am vetoing this bill that is coming to me, and I want to just \ncontinue what I am doing''? A military solution is what he is doing, \nand he is going to continue it.\n  In light of everything that has gone on, doesn't this President \nunderstand it is time for a change? Doesn't he listen to the voters? \nDoesn't he read these articles? ``Send me the bill. I am going to veto \nit''--very macho like. I do not think it is macho like. I think it is \nwrong. I do not think it is brave to continue a policy that is failing. \nI do not think it is courageous not to admit it is time for a change. I \ndo not think it shows strength. I think it is stubborn. I think it is \nwrong. And, worst of all, our troops are paying the price for this \nstubbornness. This is not the same as being stubborn in an argument we \nmight have about some small matter. Oh, I think this book is better \nthan this book, and I think this singer is better than this one. This \nis involving the lives of our soldiers.\n  Now, this ``Civilians Without Protection'' report is very tough to \nread, by the International Red Cross. Let me share some of it with you: \nthe pictures, the headlines, the words.\n  One section is called ``A conflict that spares no one.''\n\n       In some regions, particularly Baghdad and area, families \n     are often too afraid to leave their homes to go to work or to \n     shop and too afraid to send their children to school because \n     of random violence and the threat of kidnapping for ransom.\n\n  This one is very tough to take--very tough to take. It is written by \na young humanitarian worker from Baghdad. It is in the Red Cross \nreport.\n\n       Once I was called to an explosion site. There I saw a four-\n     year-old boy sitting beside his mother's body, which had been \n     decapitated by the explosion. He was talking to her, asking \n     her what had happened. He had been taken out shopping by his \n     mom.\n\n  How do you sit back and say ``status quo''? How? How? Why not welcome \na change? Why not welcome the Iraq Study Group? Why not welcome the \nwork that has been done here in 50, 60 different hearings which we have \nheld?\n  Another part: ``Sliding to disaster,'' in the International Red Cross \nreport. Another part: ``Medical care under threat.'' Another part: \n``Dirty and scarce--the water crisis.'' Another part: ``Torn apart--The \nfate of separated families.'' It goes into the agony. I ask us all to \nimagine what it would\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nbe like to worry about our kids for even 15 minutes, let alone days and \nmonths.\n  This Red Cross report is printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, also, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article \nI referred to from the newspaper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Washington Post Foreign Service, Tuesday, May 1, 2007]\n\n              April Toll Is Highest of '07 for U.S. Troops\n\n               (By Sudarsan Raghavan and Karin Brulliard)\n\n       Baghdad, April 30.--The deaths of more than 100 American \n     troops in April made it the deadliest month so far this year \n     for U.S. forces in Iraq, underscoring the growing exposure of \n     Americans as thousands of reinforcements arrive for an 11-\n     week-old offensive to tame sectarian violence.\n       More than 60 Iraqis also were killed or found dead across \n     Iraq on Monday. Casualties among Iraqi civilians and security \n     forces have outstripped those of Americans throughout the \n     war. In March, a total of 2,762 Iraqi civilians and policemen \n     were killed, down 4 percent from the previous month, when \n     2,864 were killed. Iraq's government has yet to release any \n     monthly totals for April.\n       Attacks killed a total of nine U.S. troops over the \n     weekend, including five whose deaths were announced Monday. \n     The weekend's fatalities brought the toll for the month to \n     104 Americans killed, in the sixth most-lethal month for \n     American forces since the U.S.-led invasion four years ago.\n       Under the new counterinsurgency plan, many U.S. forces have \n     left large, more secure bases to live in small combat \n     outposts and to patrol hostile neighborhoods where the risk \n     of insurgents targeting them has multiplied.\n       Highlighting the vulnerability of American forces, a series \n     of explosions Monday night rocked Baghdad's Green Zone, the \n     most heavily secured enclave in the capital and home to \n     thousands of U.S. troops, Western diplomats and Iraqi \n     government officials.\n       ``There is a duck-and-cover going on right now,'' said Lt. \n     Col. Christopher C. Garver, a U.S. military spokesman, before \n     quickly getting off the phone. Later, Garver confirmed there \n     had been an assault on the Green Zone, but it was unclear \n     what had happened. Local Iraqi television stations reported \n     10 explosions inside the zone. There were no immediate \n     reports of casualties, Garver said.\n       In eastern Baghdad on Sunday, a roadside bomb killed three \n     U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter who were on patrol, \n     the military said. Attackers shot dead another soldier in the \n     same section of the capital on Saturday. Meanwhile, a Marine \n     was killed in the Sunni insurgent bastion of Anbar province, \n     west of Baghdad. On Saturday, the military reported four U.S. \n     soldiers had been killed on that day.\n       Before the deaths announced Monday, 99 U.S. soldiers had \n     been killed during April, according to iCasualties.org, an \n     independent Web site that monitors military deaths. Nearly \n     half have died in and around Baghdad, with the next greatest \n     number of deaths occurring in Anbar and Diyala provinces. In \n     December, 112 U.S. soldiers were killed.\n       With 11 combat deaths, April also was the deadliest month \n     for British troops in Iraq since the beginning of the war, \n     when 27 soldiers were killed in March 2003. This month's \n     British casualties highlighted the growing tensions in \n     southern Iraq as Shiite groups clash for power and Britain \n     prepares to draw down its forces.\n       The deaths came as the largest bloc of Sunnis in Iraq's \n     parliament, the Iraqi Accordance Front, threatened to pull \n     out its ministers from the cabinet, saying that it ``had lost \n     hope'' in having Sunni concerns addressed by the Shiite-led \n     government. The threat prompted President Bush to phone one \n     of Iraq's two vice presidents, Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni, in \n     an attempt to defuse the potential political crisis, \n     Hashimi's office said in a statement. A Sunni withdrawal \n     could seriously hamper efforts at national reconciliation and \n     further weaken the government. Only two weeks ago, six \n     cabinet ministers loyal to Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr \n     resigned from the cabinet.\n       In the province of Diyala, where scores of fighters have \n     fled to escape the Baghdad security offensive, a car bomb \n     exploded near a funeral tent in the town of Khalis, killing \n     22 and wounding 35, said Lt. Mohammed Hakman of the Diyala \n     police Joint Coordination Center. Police said they expected \n     the toll to rise.\n       The strike came four days after a suicide attacker \n     detonated a car packed with bombs at a checkpoint in the \n     town, 50 miles north of Baghdad, killing 10 Iraqi soldiers.\n       Near the Sunni insurgent stronghold of Ramadi, a car bomb \n     exploded at a police checkpoint, killing four policemen and \n     injuring six others, police said. In another attack near \n     Ramadi, a truck exploded near a restaurant, killing four \n     civilians, police said.\n       In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded in the al-Jihad \n     neighborhood, killing four and wounding another seven, all \n     civilians, while another car bomb detonated in a local \n     market, killing five and wounding nine civilians. In the \n     Shaab neighborhood, mortar shells rained down on a house, \n     killing three and injuring eight, police said.\n       Meanwhile, police found 13 corpses--all blindfolded, \n     handcuffed and shot in the head--in different parts of the \n     capital.\n       On Monday, U.S. troops at Camp Victory, a sprawling base \n     near Baghdad International Airport, reflected on April's \n     deadly toll on their comrades.\n       Sitting at a picnic table outside a recreation center, four \n     soldiers smoked Marlboros under a starry sky. Part of the \n     Headquarters Headquarters Support Company for the 3rd \n     Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Ga., they had arrived \n     last month. They were on the base, just ``sweeping parking \n     lots and waiting for a sandstorm,'' as Pfc. Richard Gonzalez, \n     22, put it.\n       Still, they said, frequent news of troop deaths made even \n     their mission more frightening.\n       ``It makes me feel depressed to be in Iraq right now,'' \n     said Gonzalez, who is on his second deployment. ``It's a \n     whole lot different than last time.''\n       Now, he said, soldiers at the base must carry weapons. \n     Return addresses on letters from home must be ripped off and \n     burned, so as not to fall into the wrong hands. On his first \n     deployment, eight months passed before his Baghdad base was \n     hit by mortar fire. This time, he said, it seems the Camp \n     Victory intercom announces incoming fire every day.\n       ``There's a whole lot more activity,'' said Spec. Krystal \n     Fowler, 21, of Hampton, Va. She said it ``kind of bothers'' \n     her to know other troops are taking hits in the field and she \n     can't help.\n       Spec. Natisha Jetter, 23, of Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, \n     in the Virgin Islands, agreed.\n       ``Our fellow soldiers are out there dying, and we're here \n     not doing our job,'' Jetter said.\n       Gonzalez said the deaths made him realize that ``there's a \n     war going on out there.''\n       Fowler sighed. It's a war between Iraqis, she said.\n       ``We are just interfering, and letting our soldiers die.''\n       ``I'd rather be out there helping people survive,'' Fowler \n     said. ``The more of us that are out there, the more chances \n     they have to survive.''\n       There was a pause, as the soldiers mulled that.\n       ``It's just terrifying, because you can drive the same road \n     for eight months, and then one day it's over,'' Gonzalez \n     said.\n       ``Over,'' Fowler echoed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This President's policies left unchecked have been a \ndisaster. And what does he want? More of the same. He criticizes us for \ncoming up with a new policy, and this new policy will work because it \ncombines a gradual redeployment of troops, a focus on getting al-Qaida, \na focus on training the Iraqis, with a focus on diplomacy and a \npolitical solution, which is exactly what everyone says we need.\n  General Petraeus says we must have a political and diplomatic \nsolution. Well, everyone has heard it, but obviously not this \nPresident. Mr. President, sign this bill. Have a change of heart. Read \nthe paper today. Read the quote from this humanitarian worker. Read \nwhat our troops are saying. Read about it. Reconsider.\n  Also, Mr. President, take a look at what we have done for our people \nhere at home in this bill. You deride it. You make it sound as though \nwe are spending on things we should not. Why shouldn't we fix Walter \nReed? Why shouldn't we fix the Veterans' Administration so when our \nsoldiers come home they get mental health care? Why shouldn't we invest \nin better technologies to protect our troops from these horrific land \nmines, car bombs, et cetera? That is what is in this bill.\n  Why shouldn't we help our farmers who lost their money because of \nhorrific droughts, horrific frosts? That is what these bills are for, \nemergencies. On Sunday, we all learned about the horror that happened \nin Oakland, with a gasoline tanker overturning on a major interstate \nconnecter. It collapsed onto the freeway below. Miracle of miracles: \nthe middle of the night, in the early morning, 3:40 or so a.m. No one \nkilled. Thank you, God. And we pray that the driver survives.\n  But here is the point: There is money in this bill for emergencies \nsuch as that. There is a backlog of these emergency fixes that have had \nto be done to our freeways. So, Mr. President, there is real beef in \nthis bill for our people, for our veterans, for our fighting men and \nwomen. And, most important, we change course. We change course. We \ndon't have a hard-and-fast date to get out, as others have said. We \nhave a goal to get out: in April of 2008.\n\n  When I went to Iraq 2 years ago, I met with General Petraeus at \nlength. I watched how he was training the Iraqi soldiers. He was very \ncomplimentary. He said they are doing great. I said to him: If they are \ndoing so great, why can't we go home? It is their country.\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nThey have to defend their own country. He said: Well, pretty soon they \nwill be able to do it. Clearly, they are not doing it. Clearly, the \nIraqis are turning on each other. What is our military to do?\n  As Thomas Friedman said,\n\n       Our troops are protecting everyone, and yet they are \n     everyone's target.\n\n  They are protecting the Sunnis from the Shia. When they are \nprotecting the Shia, the Sunnis get them. That is an irresponsible \npolicy. So what we need to do is get through to this President. I ask \nall the American people to keep on speaking out, to ask the President \nin these next couple of hours to sign this bill. We can finally change \ncourse. We have been in Iraq longer than World War II. We can't afford \nthis conflict, and that doesn't mean you cut and run. Anyone who says \nthat is what we are saying is wrong. Read the bill. We redeploy out of \nIraq, we stay in the region to go after al-Qaida and to train the Iraqi \nforces.\n  We can't afford this anymore. Mr. President: Sign the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             POLICE CHASES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk about a decision by \nthe Supreme Court yesterday that greatly troubles me. Some many years \nago, I received a call at 10:31 in the evening that my mother had been \nkilled in a car accident. She was killed in a car accident as a result \nof a high-speed police chase. My mother was driving home from visiting \na friend in the hospital, going 25 or 30 miles an hour on a street in \nBismarck, ND. A drunk, on Main Street in Bismarck, ND, was spinning his \nwheels on his pickup truck, and the police then decided to apprehend \nhim. The drunk driver took flight. Witnesses said he was going 80 to \n100 miles an hour on the city streets. Regrettably, that ended in a \ntragic crash that took the life of my mother.\n  I have spent many years here in Congress talking about this issue of \npolice chases and training for law enforcement officials, about \nguidelines--when to chase, when not to chase. I have been joined by a \ngood number of people around this country who have lost loved ones, \ninnocent loved ones who were killed as a result of high-speed police \nchases. One who came to mind was a former member of law enforcement \nwhose family member was killed when someone with a taillight that was \nout was to be apprehended by the police, and he took flight and the \npolice chased at very high speeds. The family member of this law \nenforcement official was killed as a result.\n  In the middle of working on this, over the years, a county sheriff \ncalled me one day. He heard me speak about it. He said: You know, just \nlast week we had a man who was a drunk driver in our community who had \ntwo little children in the backseat. The sheriff's department attempted \nto apprehend that driver, and he took off at a high rate of speed. The \nsheriff's office decided to discontinue the chase immediately. They got \na license number. They discontinued the chase. Three hours later, they \narrested the man.\n  He said: It could have turned out differently. We could have chased \nthat man at 80 to 100 miles an hour, and the end of that chase could \nhave resulted in the death of those children in the backseat of that \ncar. But we didn't do that because we had guidelines and we had \ntraining.\n  The Supreme Court yesterday issued a ruling, regrettably, that I \nbelieve will result in more deaths in this country, deaths of innocent \nbystanders, as a result of high-speed police chases. I think the ruling \nis a horrible ruling.\n  Incidentally, the Supreme Court, apparently for the first time in \nhistory, put a video on their Web site so people could see the chase \nwhich was the subject of the decision in the case they were \nconsidering. Let me suggest to the Supreme Court that perhaps they \ncould put some other videos on their Web site. I know high-speed police \nchases have become a form of television entertainment all too often, \nbut they all too often end in disaster and end with innocent people \nlosing their lives. There are other videos they could perhaps put on \ntheir Web site, if the Supreme Court were interested. Among those \nvideos might be the resulting crashes of high-speed police chases in \nthe middle of our cities, at 80 and 100 miles an hour, where innocent \nbystanders ended up losing their lives.\n  I understand why the police chase when there is a felony, a bank \nrobbery, a serious crime. I understand that. What I don't understand is \nthis: why chases ensue in these communities because of a broken \ntaillight or a person going 5 miles an hour over the speed limit and a \nchase ensues. Yes, the responsibility is in the person fleeing the \npolice. Yes, that is the case, I understand that. But that does not \ngive rise, in my judgment, to reason to endanger people on the city \nstreets with chases at 60, 80, or 100 miles an hour. That is not \njustified.\n  Law enforcement needs guidelines. They need training to understand \nwhat the consequences are--when to chase, when not to chase. \nRegrettably, I believe the Supreme Court ruling yesterday will result \nin more high-speed police chases and more deaths of innocent Americans. \nThat is a profound disappointment, not just to me but to many others in \nthis country who have seen the results of these high-speed chases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5325-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1082, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug \n     user fee provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer \nfrom California be recognized for 15 minutes, obviously as the next \nDemocratic speaker following my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about the \nunderlying bill that is being considered, a piece of legislation to \namend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and amend \nthe prescription drug user fee provisions and so on. It may be that \nthere will be an agreement by which I and some others who will offer \nlegislation or an amendment to deal with the issue of prescription drug \nprices will do that at another time and not on this bill. If that is \nthe case, I am fine with that. I understand there are discussions \nunderway now. I would be perfectly amenable to not offering an \namendment on this legislation and instead having an opportunity to \noffer it at a different time. That amendment is about the reimportation \nof prescription drugs.\n  Let me talk just a little about this issue. This is an issue which is \ngetting a gray beard these days because it has been around so long with \nso many promises to be able to take it up here in the Congress. We have \n33 cosponsors on a piece of legislation that would try to break the \nback of the pricing monopoly that exists with the pharmaceutical \nindustry for prescription drugs in our country. The fact is, the \nAmerican consumers are charged the highest prices for prescription \ndrugs anywhere in the world. The highest prices for prescription drugs \nare charged to the American consumer. It is not right. It is not fair. \nIt ought to stop. We do have price controls on prescription drugs in \nour country; they are just controlled by the pharmaceutical industry. \nThat is why we have the highest prices in the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show a couple of bottles of \nmedicine.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, these two bottles of medicine are Lipitor. \nLipitor is a very common prescription drug used by many Americans to \nreduce cholesterol. As you can see, this drug, Lipitor, is made in \nIreland, as a matter of fact, and then imported into this country by \nthe pharmaceutical industry. From Ireland it is sent many places, but \nin this case the bottle in my left hand was sent to Canada, and the \nbottle in my right hand was sent to the United States. Same bottle, \nsame pill, slightly different color on the front of it. It is an FDA-\napproved medicine produced in an FDA-approved plant in Ireland and then \nsent to Canada and the United States.\n  The difference? No difference--same plastic in the bottle, same \nmedicine inside--except the price. The Canadian pays $1.83 per tablet, \nand the American pays $3.57--96 percent more. Let me say that again: No \ndifference, same medicine, same bottle, same price, made in the same \nplant, FDA approved. Difference? The American consumer is told: Guess \nwhat, we have a special deal for you, you get to pay 96 percent more \nfor the same medicine.\n  Is this unusual? No, it is not. I sat on a hay bale one day at a farm \nwith an old codger. He was in his eighties. This is in North Dakota. He \nsaid: You know, my wife has been fighting breast cancer. She has fought \nthis now for 3 years. We have gone to Canada. We had to go to Canada to \nget the medicine, to buy Tamoxifen, and the reason we had to drive to \nCanada every 3 months or so to get the medicine is we save 80 percent \nby buying it in Canada. We cannot afford the price in the United \nStates. We can't afford the price to have my wife fight this breast \ncancer.\n  The question is, Is it just Canada? No, not at all, but let me at \nleast describe the situation with the United States and Canada. I could \nput up the chart with Italy, Spain, Germany, France, England--I could \nput up this chart with virtually every country because the U.S. \nconsumer pays the highest prices in the world.\n  Lipitor, I just described it; Plavix, we pay 46 percent more; \nPrevacid we pay 97 percent more; Zocor, 31 percent more, Nexium, 55 \npercent; Zoloft, 52 percent more. The list goes on and on, as you might \nimagine.\n  We have a population that receives a lot of benefit from miracle \ndrugs. There are prescription drugs that allow you to manage your \ndisease without having to go to an acute care bed in a hospital. It is \na wonderful thing.\n  A substantial portion of the research to develop those drugs is done \nin the National Institutes of Health, paid for by us. We turn that \nresearch over to the prescription drug industry, they produce medicine \nfrom it, and then they sell us the medicine.\n  Another body of research is done by the prescription drug industry \nthemselves. They spend a lot of money on that. They also spend a lot of \nmoney on advertising and promotion. Now, anyone who was standing in \nfront of a mirror this morning brushing their teeth, shaving, perhaps \ngetting ready for work and had their television on, one of those little \ntelevision sets, if they have one, anyone who was engaged in doing that \nprobably saw a television commercial. It said this: You should go ask \nyour doctor whether the purple pill is right for you. It didn't \nnecessarily tell you what the purple pill was for; it just says you \nneed to talk to your doctor to see if you should have the purple pill.\n  It also makes you want to run out and say: Hey, what is this purple \npill? Maybe I should have some of those purple pills, without knowing \nwhat they are for. It goes on all day, every day, advertising directly \nto consumers for medicines that can only be prescribed by a doctor for \na prescription saying: Go talk to your doctor. Wouldn't you like some \nof these pills? We have an unbelievable amount of promotion and \nadvertising with respect to prescription drugs. That is another issue. \nI believe there is only one other industrialized country that allows \nthat; that is New Zealand. But that is another issue for another time.\n  The issue is pricing. I have described what is happening with respect \nto pricing. This is Canada, but I can describe it for other countries \nas well. The percent of adults, ages 19 to 64, not filling a \nprescription because of cost, 43 percent of the uninsured in this \ncountry--that is 45, 46 million--do not take their medicine because \nthey do not have the money. They say it costs too much.\n  The result? Well, often many of them will end up in the priciest kind \nof health care, some kind of an acute care bed through an emergency \nroom in a hospital.\n  The legislation we have developed in Congress is bipartisan. It \nstretches from--I shouldn't say stretches because I am not describing \nthe polls in Congress. But we have Ted Kennedy, Democrat; Chuck \nGrassley, Republican; Debbie Stabenow, Democrat; John McCain, \nRepublican; back and forth. Bipartisan support for a piece of \nlegislation we have crafted very carefully that says: Why shouldn't the \nAmerican people be able to take advantage of FDA-approved drugs by \nreimporting them from another country where that same drug is sold for \na fraction of the price? Why shouldn't the global economy work for \nconsumers as well? This is bipartisan legislation that has substantial \nareas of safety built into it, so there is no safety issue. This is \nfrom Dr. David Kessler, who was head of the FDA for 8 years, 1990 to \n1997. ``The Dorgan-Snowe bill''--Olympia Snowe is the principal \ncosponsor, along with me and many others who have worked on this--\nSenator Stabenow and Senator McCain and others for a long time, Senator \nKennedy.\n\n       The Dorgan-Snowe bill provides a sound framework for \n     assuring that imported drugs are safe and effective. Most \n     notably, it provides additional resources to the agency to \n     run such a program, oversight by the FDA of the chain of \n     custody of imported drugs back to the FDA-inspected plants, a \n     mechanism to review imported drugs to ensure that they meet \n     FDA's approval standards, and the registration and oversight \n     of importers and exporters to assure that the imported drugs \n     meet these standards and are not counterfeit.\n\n  Let me show you where your prescription drugs come from. The \npharmaceutical industry is engaged in a full court press with Members \nof this Chamber. They have a fair number of friends in this Chamber who \nwould want to help them derail this legislation and continue to be able \nto charge the highest prices to the American consumer.\n  Lipitor comes from Dublin, Ireland. Nexium comes from France. Of \ncourse, these are all imported by the pharmaceutical manufacturers \nthemselves. Any one of these--Vytorin, Singapore, Italy, the United \nKingdom; Actos comes from Osaka, Japan. All of these are made in other \ncountries, brought back to this country, and, by the way, sold in every \nother country in most cases for a lower price than when they are sent \nback to this country by the manufacturer.\n  The legislation we have introduced is very simple. It gives the \nAmerican consumer the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices for \nan FDA-approved drug; in many cases, by the way, a drug that was \ncreated with the very research that the American people paid for \nthrough the National Institutes of Health.\n  Some have said, as a result of the pharmaceutical industry's \nentreaties here, well, this can't be done safely. It cannot be done \nsafely. Well, apparently, they do it safely. The chain of custody, for \nexample, in Canada is virtually identical. I had a quote that I do not \nhave here. I had a quote from Dr. McClelland, the former head of the \nFDA, virtually identical chain of custody from Canada as opposed to the \nUnited States between the pharmaceutical manufacturer, the wholesaler, \nand the retailer.\n  So is the chain of custody in Canada safe with respect to \nprescription drugs being sold to Canadian consumers? The answer is yes. \nSo why would you not be able to establish a regime, just as they have \nin Europe for many years, called parallel trading? This is not new. If \nyou are in Europe and you are living in Germany and want to buy a \nprescription from Spain, or living in Italy and find a prescription \ndrug priced lower in France through a parallel trading system, you can \neasily do that.\n  To my knowledge, we have testimony from one of the people involved. \nTo my knowledge, there have been no issues of safety at all. They have \ndone it for 20 years. Are those who oppose this saying, well, the \nEuropeans are smarter than we are, they can do it but we can't? I don't \nunderstand that. That is not the case. I don't understand that.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\nThis is a very simple case. We propose an amendment that would allow \ndrug reimportation and would make it safe. That is the fact.\n\n  We understand that the pharmaceutical industry does not like it. That \nis a fact, too. I understand why they don't like it.\n  Suppose I were running a pharmaceutical company and had the ability \nto price however I wanted to price inside the United States, one of the \nmost important markets in the world, perhaps the most important market \nin the world, and I would have no competition from lower prices because \nI was able to keep that out. I understand why they would like to keep \nthat deal working for them, but it does not work for the American \npeople. It is not fair for the American people; it just isn't.\n  That is why we have put together a bipartisan piece of legislation, \nthe Dorgan-Snowe bill, that is supported by Republicans and Democrats, \nwhich now has 33 cosponsors. It is one that should pass in the Senate. \nThe House has already passed a similar piece of legislation in the last \nsession. I believe, finally, given a fair opportunity--and I believe we \nwill be given that fair opportunity whether it is on this bill or \nperhaps with some consent to do it on another bill, I believe we will \nget this done.\n  This is important. There are some things we do that are not very \nimportant at all. My criticism--it is a great privilege to serve here. \nMy criticism of this place is from time to time we treat the light way \ntoo seriously, and we treat the serious far too lightly. This is a \nserious issue that deserves to be treated seriously.\n  It has been around for a long time. We have not had a vote on it only \nbecause we have been blocked by, I would say, Senator Frist, the \nmajority leader, for a long time, despite what I thought and my \ncolleagues thought was a representation by him that he would allow us \nto have this on the Senate floor. He continued to block it.\n  I understand the pharmaceutical industry is pulling out all of the \nstops. They have a full court press, trying to find as many Members of \nthe Senate as they can who will stand up for their current pricing \nstrategy. And they will find a few, no question about that. I think \nthere are some Members of the Congress who like the pricing strategy of \nsaying let's price drugs so that the American people pay the highest \nprices in the world. But I am very anxious to get them here to the \nfloor to debate them on that subject because they are wrong. It is just \nwrong. It is wrong to do this to the American people.\n  One final point. I don't disrespect the pharmaceutical industry. I \nsay good for you when you produce a miracle drug, a lifesaving drug. \nBut miracle drugs offer no miracles to people who can't afford to buy \nthem. My problem with the pharmaceutical industry is the pricing \nstrategy, the pricing strategy which says to the American people: You \npay the highest prices in the world, and there is nothing we will let \nyou do that can alter that. That is wrong. That is why I and others \ncome to the floor of the Senate to say let's fix this. Not later, let's \nfix this now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for \nall his hard work on this issue of affordability of prescription drugs. \nHe has been such a consistent voice. I stand with him on that. I thank \nhim.\n  (The further remarks of Mrs. Boxer are printed in today's Record \nunder Morning Business).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this morning there have been a couple of \ntopics brought up. The bill before us, of course, is the \nreauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration, several important \nparts of the Food and Drug Administration, and a new section on drug \nsafety to give the Food and Drug Administration a few more tools for \ntheir tool box. So I will stick to that topic instead of addressing the \none more recently brought up. I have some very strong feelings on that \nand some very strong opinions on how America ought to be involved in \nthe war and what the consequences are of us pulling out. However, I \nwant to stick to the topic of the day, which is our pharmaceutical \nsupply.\n  Most Americans who turn to imported drugs do so because of the cost. \nWe need to answer a lot of questions before we open our borders to \nimported drugs to be sure we don't endanger consumers or jeopardize \nresearch or jeopardize the development of new lifesaving products. \nSenator Dorgan, of course, introduced a bill last year. He made the \nstatement that miracle drugs provide no miracles for those who can't \nafford them. I don't think there is anybody in this Chamber who \ncouldn't agree more with that statement, but I am sure they would agree \nthat a counterfeit or tainted drug is unsafe at any price.\n  As we consider the issue of drug importation, the safety of our \ncitizens must be our primary concern. As ranking member of the \ncommittee charged with public health, it is certainly mine. You will \nfind the focus of the bill that is before us to be on safety. I think \neverything in the bill leads to safety. I don't want to come up with a \ncountersituation now that might put people at risk.\n  I am reminded we are going to have a little bit of debate on the \nsafety of our food supply--we talked about that a little bit last \nnight--because there is a crisis with pet food, in particular, but even \nsome potential for human consumption, partly because of the pet food, \npartly because of some other possibilities. There are some kids dying \nin China because they have melamine in their food. This is a product \nthat is added to food to increase the appearance of protein. If you add \nthat to grains or other things, you can get a higher protein count, and \nusually the protein count relates to the price you get. The more \nprotein, the higher the price.\n  I was talking to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, who is a \nveterinarian, and he was pointing out this morning that if you take a \nfingernail, that is 100 percent protein. If you take the liver, that is \n100 percent protein. One of the differences is if you grind liver up \nand you put it in food, it is digestible. If you grind a fingernail up \nand put it in food, it isn't digestible at all. So you are not getting \nany protein out of it. So kids have died in China who thought they were \ngetting sufficient food, and they weren't. The cause of death was \nstarvation. One of the countries that could be getting drugs to the \nUnited States would be China. If they are fooling with our food supply, \ndo you think they would hesitate a minute to fool with our prescription \ndrug supply? It worries me a lot. There is a lot of risk that is \ninvolved in this.\n  The Senator from North Dakota held up two bottles. The bottles were \nidentical. One was cheaper in Canada than the same bottle in the United \nStates. In a minute, I will go into how that price difference happens. \nI could hold up two bottles that would look exactly the same. One would \nappear to come from Canada, but it might very well come through Canada \nfrom Saudi Arabia, have exactly the same packaging, labeling, colors, \nseals, even the same look of a pill. But one of the things we found out \nfrom some of these drugs that have come from other countries through \nCanada is that they don't work. If you grind them up, they have exactly \nthe same chemicals in them, but it isn't just the chemicals that do it, \nit is the way they are put together that makes it possible for them to \nsolve a medical problem. If they are put together wrong, they may not \neven digest. If they don't digest, similar to a fingernail, you don't \nget the benefit from the drug. If you don't get the benefit from the \ndrug, you shouldn't pay anything for it. In fact, there ought to be \nsome pretty severe action taken against the person or country or \ncompany that produced that kind of a drug. We are not able to do that.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is charged with watching our borders \nand the things that come in to see if the drugs that come into this \ncountry are legitimate. There are warehouses full of drugs they have \nfound that are not legitimate. So it is a matter of safety, and we are \nconcentrating on the safety portion of this bill. So I am hoping we \nwill save the drug importation question for a separate debate of its \nown.\n  We know each one of us takes a risk every time we take a drug, but \nAmericans who buy prescription drugs in Canada and other countries or \npurchase drugs from Internet pharmacies\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nthat operate outside the United States are taking an even greater risk \nby obtaining their prescription medicine from pharmacies and Internet \nsites that don't always meet the high standards we require here at \nhome. Here is where my concern lies. We already have a problem with \ncounterfeit and substandard drugs in the United States. Concern about \nthe quickly growing counterfeit market is not limited to the United \nStates. In Europe, dangerous counterfeit drugs are already a problem, \nand the problem is growing as the European Union expands. In addition, \nwe have little knowledge of the extent of counterfeiting in Asian \nmarkets such as India, Pakistan, and China, other than that it may be \nthe best.\n  Now, prior to legalizing an untested, drug importation project on a \nlarge scale across our Nation, we must consider any new vulnerabilities \nin our drug distribution system, especially since those vulnerabilities \ncould be massive in size. I know we all share the same goals. We want \nto ensure that drugs are safe, effective, and will not compromise the \nintegrity of our Nation's prescription drug supply or our world-leading \npharmaceutical research, and we want it to be at the lowest possible \ncost. Similar to many Americans, I am concerned about the high and \nrising cost of prescription drugs. However, I doubt the importation of \ndrugs from other countries will solve that problem all by itself. We \nbetter be certain about exactly what we are doing and how we are going \nto do it. We have had some hearings on that. We have also gotten some \nphone calls from the Canadian Minister in charge of the program who has \nsaid: Do you realize that if America suddenly started buying its drugs \nfrom Canada, we would have to prohibit Americans from doing it. We are \na small country. We could not take the amount of orders we might \npossibly get because we do have price fixing.\n\n  We talk about negotiated prices and we talk about that in the context \nof Medicare drugs. Congress passed and the President implemented \nMedicare Part D that actually came in considerably lower in cost for \ndrugs for American seniors than what we or the Government \nAccountability Office had ever anticipated--dramatically lower. Why? \nBecause of competition. How does a country negotiate drug prices? Well, \nthe way Canada did it was they said: If there are five drugs that treat \nheart problems, we make a bid for one drug against another drug. If \nthere are five heart drugs, they all don't do the same thing. Some \ndoctors would prescribe one and others would prescribe another. But if \nyou are going to negotiate prices, you make the five bid against each \nother and you pick one or two, and you tell the rest of them they can't \nsell their drugs there, that the Government would not have any part of \nit. This eliminates choices.\n  Then there is another little caveat that some of the countries add to \nthat which says: If you don't come in with a low enough price, we are \ngoing to give your patent away and you would not get anything for it. \nWe have some real patent issues if we are going to have people \ninvesting in the research to get new drugs passed and approved, and we \nshould take a little look at the process that you have to go through to \nget a drug approved. It is about a $1 billion project to get a drug \napproved. They don't do that because they are wanting to donate $1 \nbillion; they are doing it because they expect there will be some \nprofit on the other end of selling the drug. Otherwise they wouldn't go \nthrough all that research, all the trouble, all the clinical trials, \nand then turn it over to people for free. They give away quite a few \ndrugs, but that is to people who can't afford them. There is a lot to \nthe fact that we have more pharmaceutical companies developing more \ndrugs than anywhere else. I am pleased that through our committee we \nfound out there are over 650 clinical trials happening right now on \nvarious cancer drugs. That is just in the area of cancer: 650 drugs in \nthe pipeline. That is a lot of billions of dollars being spent for us.\n  Every once in awhile somebody mentions the high cost of insurance. \nThat is something else our committee is working on. I think we have \nsome potential for making some good changes there. But one thing I \nalways remind people of is I could get them 1980 insurance prices if \nthey would settle for 1980 treatments. Then they start to realize how \nmany things that have been invented since 1980 that make a difference \nin our life and in our longevity. I don't know of anybody who wants to \nsettle for pre-1980 treatments, but they are cheaper.\n  In any importation discussion, it is critical we limit imported drugs \nonly to those that have been approved by the FDA. It is important to \nunderstand how small differences between drugs can mean big differences \nin patient health. We are talking about a drug safety bill on the \nSenate floor this week. We all acknowledge that there are drug safety \nproblems that must be addressed. It makes no sense to open up our \nborders when we don't have things quite right here at home. Imagine \ntrying to handle the world's drug safety when we are having some \nproblems handling drug safety in the United States. Furthermore, we \nshould not tell companies with whom we must do business how much they \nhave to sell and at what price they have to sell it. Those are mandates \nI strongly believe will ultimately limit consumer access to drugs.\n  So I look forward to a spirited discussion. I think it will answer \nsome of my questions about the legislation and will hopefully inform us \nall on the best direction we can take from here. There are \npossibilities for solutions on drug importation. I hope it will be a \nseparate discussion from how the Food and Drug Administration \nadministers the safety of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and \nparticularly when they concern children. We actually forced the \npharmaceutical companies and the medical device companies to pay to \nhave their products tested and reviewed. That is what a big portion of \nthis bill is about: how they will pay for having the products tested \nand reviewed.\n  That needs to be reauthorized before September, or it expires. That \nwould mean a lot of additional costs on the taxpayer if we don't do \nthose two parts.\n  There is also a portion on that which deals with pharmaceuticals for \nchildren. It is important that tests be done with the pharmaceuticals \nto be sure they are safe for children and in what dosage they are safe \nfor children. There is a portion of the bill which gives incentives to \ncompanies that will go to that extra length to see which of the drugs \ncan be used for children as well. That is another potential for a \nfascinating discussion over the next couple of days.\n  I compliment the Members who have been working on that. Many are on \nthe HELP Committee and have been looking into this with as much depth \nand detail as I have seen on any bill we have ever done. I have also \nseen as much cooperation between both sides of the aisle as I have seen \non any bill we have done--working together to find a way to take care \nof the concerns and make sure we are improving the safety but also \nmaking it possible for people to get the pharmaceuticals and get them \nas quickly as possible. It doesn't do any good to have a miracle drug \nand not be able to get it on the market. It doesn't help to have a \nmiracle drug with some problems and, because FDA doesn't have the tools \nto change some of those problems, they have to pull it off the market \nand take it away from some people who really rely on that drug. That is \nwhat this bill does essentially.\n  I think in the substitute, or managers' amendment, that will be \ncoming out, many of the difficulties people have will have been worked \nout. People are working on them as we speak. That is why the managers' \namendment has not been laid down. It has been vetted with all Members \nwho are interested and working on this, and there has been incredible \ncooperation. I hope people will continue to work with us.\n  I do not want anybody to think this bill is a complete answer to \nsafety. It doesn't cover some topics. That is because we are still \nworking on some topics that are not developed to a point yet where they \ncan be done. One is this drug importation. It is being looked at, \nhearings are being held, and we are trying to find out some way prices \ncan be lowered in the United States.\n  Another problem is biosimilars. There is a whole new area of drugs \nthat has come out because the genome has\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\nbeen unlocked and proteins can be developed which can be used as \nmedication which will solve some of those genetic problems. Those are \ncalled biologics. There are people who would like them to become \ngenerics right away because that would bring the cost down. Again, we \nwant to make sure we have a bill that takes care of the safety of the \nbiosimilars, to be sure they truly are similar and will have the same \neffect. The Europeans have been working on that for a while. We have \nlooked at their model and a number of Senators--again from both sides \nof the aisle--have been working on that problem. Senator Clinton and \nSenator Hatch have been very involved in that, providing guidance from \nboth sides of the aisle. We appreciate their efforts on it. I do not \nexpect that to be a part of this bill.\n  There are a number of tobacco issues, and our committee has a lot of \nconcern on that. There are some bills which would provide a different \nway of doing that--maybe put the regulation of tobacco under the \njurisdiction of the FDA. I hope that will not be a part of this bill. \nThat is not ready yet, either. We have a lot of parts that are ready, \nand particularly the user fees need to be done before a deadline that \nis coming up.\n  I really appreciate the cooperation we are having in making sure we \ncan meet the deadline and have an FDA that is even more responsive and \nhas more tools in their toolbox to make sure the drugs out there are \nsafe and that there is a system for making sure safety is maintained \nand if there is a problem, that it can be corrected with some of the \nnew tools in the toolbox.\n  I thank everybody for their cooperation and patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am on the floor, as others have been \ntoday, to speak to an issue that I think is appropriate for this day \nand time. I say so for a variety of reasons but most importantly \nbecause it is May 1.\n  Let me put it this way, because I think it sets the context in which \nI would like to speak for a few moments.\n  Mayday, Mayday, Mayday--do you hear me calling? Do you hear the \nfrustration of the American consumer today who goes to the gas pump and \npays record-high gas prices? I saw prices in my State of Idaho today \nverging on an alltime high--$3.32, $3.35, depending how far you are \nfrom the head of the pipeline.\n  Mayday, America. Mayday. The year 1923 is when that term first came \ninto use by Frederick ``Big John'' Mockford in an airport in London, \nspeaking in the French term. What he was saying was: Help me, help me, \nhelp me.\n  I do believe that is what the American consumer is saying today--help \nme. And to the Congress of the United States and to this Senate, that \nsound ought to be echoing through this Chamber and certainly through \nthe halls and the committee rooms that deal with national energy \npolicy.\n  We are where we are today for absence of policy and for some policy \nthat has driven us to less production and becoming increasingly more \nreliant upon someone else to produce our energy for us. It is in that \ncontext of a Mayday appeal that I speak for a few moments during this \nnoon hour.\n\n  Here is what the chart shows us very clearly. From 1890 to 2030, \nthese are the trend lines. In 1950, we crossed a unique point when we \nbegan to see our demand outstrip our supply, and this now--well over 50 \npercent of our consumption--is being picked up by other countries in \nthe world that are, in many instances, less friendly to us than we \nwould like.\n  What is happening on May Day--this May Day--to a major supplier to \nthe south of us, a guy by the name of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela is \nprivatizing today all of the oil fields where our companies produce. He \nis bringing them into his control, into his form of petronationalism, \nand he is saying the priority for Venezuelan oil today is not going to \nbe to the United States, it is going to be to Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua, \nand Haiti. He is going to become their supplier first. He is also going \nto leave the World Bank and create the Bank of the South. He is one of \nour major suppliers, and he is less than friendly.\n  Shouldn't we be speaking out on May Day, as he speaks out toward \nenergy independence, toward a greater sense of our own responsibility \ntoward our own consumer? What is Fidel saying today? He didn't make the \nparade, apparently, but he sent a letter. He is talking about biofuels \nand saying that America is shifting toward biofuels and they are going \nto consume all of the food supply of the hemisphere to produce energy. \nI find that a bit of a uniqueness. Obviously, while he produces some \noil, he ships it off to have it refined, and Hugo Chavez and he are \ndeciding that Venezuela will be the largest supplier.\n  There are a few of us in Congress who read those signals, those \nsenses of emergency, that cry for the ``help me'' that I think the \nAmerican consumer is speaking out to today. Our committees are working \ntheir will at this moment to add to the National Energy Policy Act of \n2005, which will continue to push the renaissance of energy production \nin this country in all forms, not just for hydrocarbons but electricity \nand other forms, in a way that will increasingly make us independent \nand self-reliant.\n  Senator Byron Dorgan and I introduced the Safe Energy Act of 2007 a \nmonth or so ago, which strikes at the heart of the combination of \nefforts that will move us further down the road toward accomplishing \nself-help, self-reliance, and energy independence. In that act, we said \nconservation would be a part of it, as it should be. I, for the first \ntime, stepped out and said that I would accept mandatory CAFE standards \non a growth rate of 4 percent a year to drive the auto industry into \ngreater senses of efficiency and lead us toward greater levels of \nconservation. That was title I of the SAFE Act which we think the \nCommerce Committee will mark up in the next week.\n  We spoke to innovation and innovation in the advance of biofuels and \nthe importance of doing that and that we really ought to strive toward \nthe 30 billion gallons, which our President spoke to in the State of \nthe Union, by 2020--15 of that being picked up by corn but more \nimportantly, now, 15 billion gallons being picked up by cellulosic \nenergy--and advancing that as rapidly as we can and getting the loan \nguarantees out and the grants that will take it out of the lab and \ncause it to be a standup commercial refinery using straw, corn stover, \nand all of those types of things which are the production that we think \nought to go on in the cellulosic area. That is title II of the bill. We \nthink that will be marked up tomorrow in the Energy Committee.\n  But the one that hasn't yet been marked up and the one I wish to \nspend a little time on today is the area of continued production of \nhydrocarbons in the Outer Continental Shelf. I have called this in the \npast the ``no zone'' speech. Let me combine that with Mayday. While we \nare saying no, our consumers are saying: Help me, help me, because I am \nspending more of my discretionary income on consumables and in the form \nof energy at a rate and level I never had to before. It is causing the \nAmerican economy to shift significantly.\n  Here are a variety of things we have done over the years that have \nshaped the Outer Continental Shelf capability. These areas which are \npointed out on this map are known reserves of oil. Yet, because of \nattitudes at the State level, environmental concerns and frustrations, \nmuch of that production or the ability to explore within those fields \nhas simply been taken off limits. They became the ``no zone,'' even \nafter technology clearly proved that you can go into these waters, \nproduce there safely, protect the ecosystems involved, and reward the \nAmerican consumer by less dependence upon foreign oil and reserves.\n  This area here, this small area, was a sale and an area we were able \nto put through just in the beginning of this year. This, of course, is \nthe area in the gulf that is being heavily drilled today. These are the \noff-limits areas.\n  I came to the floor some time ago and spoke of what is going on in \nCuba, and I said that was an unacceptable thing and we ought to do \nsomething about it. So in the legislation we are talking about, for \ngreater flexibility\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nand opportunity in the Outer Continental Shelf, what we are really \ntalking about in the SAFE Act--that last title yet to be introduced--\nthat really balances conservation with new biofuels and increased \nproduction in this area, better known as the northern Cuban basin. It \nis an area that is off limits to our producers, and Cuba is now moving \nto produce it. They are going to do so by reaching out to other \ncountries--other than ours because we have a prohibition on our \ncompanies doing business there--and they are looking at the French, \nSpaniards, the Chinese, and others to come and drill.\n\n  Here is my frustration: While we are saying no, all around our \ncoastlines, just 45 miles off our coastline, the Cubans have let leases \nfor the purpose of drilling.\n  I was in Cuba a few years ago visiting with their Interior Minister, \nand he said: We want your companies here. Why? Because you have the \nbest technology. You are environmentally proven. You place this \nvaluable ecosystem at less risk. That we know. But our policy today \ndenies us that.\n  There is an interesting little anomaly that happened--and I praise \nthe new Secretary of the Interior for doing what he did--and that was \nopening, right off the coast of Virginia, an opportunity to seek \nnatural gas and to see if those reserves are out there, which I think \nwill drive increased production.\n  So today I come to the floor on May Day saying: Mayday, America, \nMayday, because Americans as they go to the gas pump are saying: Help \nus, help me; change the way this is happening. America, we have a great \nopportunity to move ourselves toward energy independence, less \ndependence on those unstable areas of the world where we now seek well \nover 50 percent of our hydrocarbon oil base. Shame on us. That is bad \npolicy, and we have the power to change it if we have the will to \nchange it. The will comes from the ability to build a complete \nportfolio of conservation, new technologies, and current production in \nareas where we know our reserves are, by building them up during this \nperiod of transition as our country moves to new technologies.\n  This is a great opportunity. The only reason we are not doing it is \nbecause of resistance right here in the Congress of the United States, \nin part, put on by pressure from some special interests. But my guess \nis that if we listen closely to the American consumer today, they would \nagree that the SAFE Act and all titles of the SAFE Act ought to become \npublic policy and that America clearly ought to be articulating a \npolicy of greater energy independence so that next May Day, we can say: \nWe heard you call out for help, and we are answering that call. Mayday, \nAmerica, Mayday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the Senator \nfrom Idaho who is talking about an issue that is so important for our \ncountry. It is a wake-up call. Amazingly it is on May Day. I think that \nis the appropriate moniker for what we are facing in this country \nbecause of what is happening today.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about what I see happening in Venezuela \nand what I think America should be doing to make sure we maintain the \ncapability to control our national security and our economic security.\n  Today, President Hugo Chavez is completing his latest and most \nominous scheme out of the Fidel Castro playbook. He is nationalizing \nmultibillion-dollar, heavy oilfields in the Orinoco Belt. This energy-\nrich region southeast of Caracas has so much energy potential that some \nexperts claim it could give the country more oil reserves than Saudi \nArabia.\n  By seizing the Orinoco Belt, President Chavez is consolidating his \npolitical power within Venezuela and increasing his ability to \nmanipulate global oil markets.\n  This nation now accounts for 14 percent of America's oil imports, and \nMr. Chavez has promised to use his ``strong oil card'' to, in his \nwords, ``finish off the U.S. empire,'' even if that means colluding \nwith some of the most nefarious regimes on Earth.\n  Similar to Fidel Castro, who partnered with the Soviet Union during \nthe Cold War, President Chavez is making common cause with America's \nenemies, including the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the \nGovernment of Iran.\n  Earlier this year, he met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nand made plans for a $2 billion joint fund, part of which will be used \nas a ``mechanism for liberation'' against American allies.\n  President Chavez hopes that the profits from the Orinoco Belt will \nflood his coffers for other foreign adventures. But by asserting \ngovernment control over this coveted region, he is actually killing the \ngolden goose that feeds his socialist-inspired revolution.\n  President Chavez's national oil company has already shown signs of \nstress. Despite record oil prices that should be a boon for the \nindustry, the state-run company has been forced to accumulate a rapid \nincrease in debt to pay for a doubling of ``social development \nspending.'' Meanwhile, its spending on energy exploration and \nproduction badly trails its global peers.\n  In addition, the Orinoco Belt pronouncement has made ExxonMobil, \nConoco Phillips, and other energy companies extremely cautious about \nputting their employees and billions of dollars in assets under \nVenezuelan management, and for good reason.\n  If those American corporations decide to withhold their expertise and \ninvestment, it could further weaken the Chavez Government's pursuit of \nsocialist dreams and redistribution of wealth. ``It seems as if they \nare going to strangle themselves with their own rope,'' said a foreign \noil analyst who chose not to be identified for fear of retaliation.\n  President Chavez's gross mismanagement of the economy should be no \nsurprise to anyone who has followed the career of his Cuban mentor, \nFidel Castro. In less than half a century, Fidel Castro has turned what \nwas once the third richest nation in Latin America into one of the \npoorest nations in the world, a real-life prison for 11 million people \nwho rely on remittances from abroad to avoid starvation and collapse.\n  If President Chavez continues to adopt the Castro economic model, the \ngreatest victims will be the Venezuelan people, but America will also \nsuffer. That is because the deterioration of Venezuela's oil industry \ncould spark a surge in oil prices for American consumers, and we all \nknow that prices have already jumped in the last 30 days. Anyone who \nhas filled a gasoline tank knows this would be a huge hit on the \nAmerican economy. In fact, some economists say every time oil prices \nrise by 10 percent, an average of 150,000 Americans lose their jobs \nbecause it presses the economy. Margins are narrowed, and that means \npeople are laid off.\n  So what should our response be? America must recharge its efforts to \nadopt a comprehensive plan for American energy independence, including \nmore exploration for oil and gas at home. It should be a comprehensive \nplan that includes conservation, renewable energy, new research for new \nforms of energy that we have not yet explored, and it should include \nmore exploration and drilling for our own resources which we can be \nassured of controlling.\n\n  I wrote an editorial in one of the December issues of the Houston \nChronicle that said we should be looking to the Outer Continental Shelf \nof the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and even the Virginia \nshores and other shores on the Pacific and Atlantic sides.\n  Using the comprehensive energy legislation we passed last year, I was \nvery pleased to see the announcement yesterday by the Department of the \nInterior that we would, in fact, increase production of the natural \nresources in this country. The Secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, who was once \na Member of this body, announced that there would be 21 lease sales in \neight planning areas which could produce 10 billion barrels of oil and \n45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over 40 years. That would \ngenerate about $170 billion in today's dollars.\n  The potential for this amount of oil exploration alone is equivalent \nto 20 years' worth of what we import from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela.\n  They are doing exactly what Congress has authorized them to do--\nlooking in the Outer Continental Shelf. Even the Commonwealth of \nVirginia is\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\npositive about this move because there are now incentives for States to \nallow production in the waters they control. This is one part of what \nwe must do as part of a comprehensive approach to energy independence.\n  We also need to increase research into alternative fuels, such as \nsolar and wind power. In March, I introduced legislation called the \nCREST Act, which provides a comprehensive, coordinated national \nresearch effort that would spur the development of renewable energy for \nthe marketplace. The oceans and the Gulf of Mexico have potential for \nenergy production and electricity production. Just as we have seen wind \nenergy become a factor on land, it can also be a factor in our bodies \nof water.\n  We have the resources to achieve energy independence--the resources \nunderneath our land and water--and the best resource of all, the \ningenuity of our free, creative minds. Now we need the willpower to use \nit.\n  President Chavez's announcement today is a tremendous challenge to \nAmerica's energy future, but if we choose to be proactive, as we've \nalways been throughout our history, we can regain control of our energy \nresources, and be the strongest Nation on Earth.\n  We can write our own history, and today is the wake-up call that \nassures we must do it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand the Senate has been \nscheduled to recess at 12:30. First, I thank the Presiding Officer for \nwaiting for me here. As always he is gracious and kind.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 5 \nminutes and that following my statement, the Senate stand in recess \nunder the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to join so many of my \ncolleagues, so many of those in the military and so many of the \nAmerican people in urging the President to sign the emergency spending \nbill that relates to Iraq when it reaches his desk. Despite what the \nPresident keeps repeating, we can do both--we can fund the troops and \nchange our mission in Iraq. The emergency spending bill we will send to \nthe President shortly gives our troops all the money they need and even \nmore than the President requested, and it changes our mission in Iraq \nfrom policing a civil war to focusing on counterterrorism.\n  It has been 4 long years since President Bush landed on the USS \nAbraham Lincoln and prematurely announced ``mission accomplished'' in \nIraq. Today, 4 years later, there is one thing on which the American \npeople, bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress, military \nexperts, and the Iraq Study Group all agree: We clearly have not \naccomplished our mission in Iraq, and the only way to succeed is to \nchange our current course of action.\n  It seems only the President and his small band of advisers think we \nhave accomplished our mission in Iraq. Only he thinks we should stay \nthe course. Only President Bush seems to think the only way to support \nour troops is for the Congress to be a rubberstamp to his policies. \nThat is not what the American people want, and that is not what America \nis about. The American people want a change in mission. They want a new \ndirection, not more of the same failed policies. That is why, if the \nPresident really supports our brave men and women fighting in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, he will sign the legislation that we will send to \nhim very soon.\n  The bill provides reasonable and meaningful guidelines to protect our \ntroops by ensuring that all units that are sent overseas to fight are \nready, trained, and equipped to fight. It will require the Department \nof Defense to adhere to its own guidelines to ensure that every unit \nthat is deployed is ``fully mission capable'' for the task at hand.\n  Why would the President want to send our troops into Afghanistan and \nIraq, into fierce battles against the Taliban and the Sunni insurgency \nwithout the training and equipment needed to get the job done and to \ncome home safely? But if the President vetoes this bill, he will not be \nso required.\n  More important, this legislation shows both the United States and the \nGovernment of Iraq how to change the failing strategy in Iraq. It has \nbeen clear all along that this administration has failed to plan for \nthe war. They gave no thought what it would take to accomplish this \nmission. There was no planning for the day after.\n  When you think about this, it is infuriating; to think that just \nshowing strength alone would solve the whole problem. That kind of \ncareless, narrow thinking has led us to where we are now.\n  This administration and its President seem to be lost in Iraq. They \ncan only do more of the same. We put in more troops to support a \ngovernment that every day gets weaker and weaker, that seems to be \ncrumbling from both the Shiite and Sunni side. Why are we putting more \ntroops in Iraq to defend a government that nobody seems to like and in \nwhom nobody seems to have much faith? The escalation is not working.\n  As a result, our mission in Iraq has devolved so that most of what we \ndo is patrol, police, and stand in the middle of a civil war. The \nSunnis and the Shiites have hated each other for centuries. Their \nenmity goes way back. They will continue to hate each other, to not \nwork with each other, to fight with each other long after we have gone, \nwhether we stay 3 months or 3 years. Yet most of the time our troops, \nour brave men and women, are simply caught in the middle of a civil \nwar, and we have not even chosen a side. We are just in the middle, and \nthey are just in the middle--trying to defend themselves in the middle \nof a civil war when we don't know which side we are on, and we are \nunable to bring the two sides together. It is a debacle.\n  That is why the Congress is demanding that the President change the \ncurrent mission in Iraq. As we all know, including General Petraeus, \nthe solution to violence in Iraq is ultimately political and not \nmilitary, and that is why Congress has imposed tough benchmarks on the \nGovernment of Iraq. We cannot afford to send more military troops \nwithout doing something to change this weak, almost feckless \nGovernment. Our original purpose in Iraq was to fight terrorism. I \nbelieve we must continue to fight terrorism; I know that from what \nhappened to my city, my beloved city, and the friends I lost and think \nof every day.\n  This legislation says let's go back to that original purpose, \ncounterterrorism, as well as force protection and training the Iraqis. \nInstead of policing a civil war, U.S. forces will protect U.S. \nfacilities and citizens, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces \nengaged in targeted counterterrorism missions to prevent anything that \nhappens in Iraq from hurting us at home and continue to train and equip \nIraqi security forces, although I must say that has not worked out very \nwell thus far.\n  I believe these benchmarks are reasonable and achievable with renewed \npolitical will from this administration and from the Government in \nIraq. The benchmarks were not just pulled out of the air. They were \nsuggested by the bipartisan, highly qualified, highly knowledgeable, \nhighly experienced Baker-Hamilton commission. But more important, they \nsignify the changes in strategy that must be implemented to correct the \nadministration's failing strategy in Iraq.\n  This is President Bush's war, but he has failed time and time again \nto make the difficult leadership decisions that are needed to protect \nour troops in Iraq. If he vetoes this bill, as he has threatened to do \non many occasions, our brave men and women will continue to fight a \nbrutal war with no forward-look strategy, no long-term plan, little \nregional support, and little chance of establishing a stable, \nrepresentative government in Iraq. Every day it becomes more clear the \nPresident never had a working plan for Iraq.\n  So we have a mission. It is a sacred and important mission. We must \nchange the mission in Iraq away from\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\npolicing a civil war and toward counterterrorism, which requires fewer \ntroops and gets many more of them out of harm's way. That is what our \nbill does. It is what the American people want. It is what the facts on \nthe ground demand.\n  I urge the President to strongly reconsider this threat to veto this \nlegislation. If he does, he will be making a terrible mistake, one that \nall of us and maybe even he will come to regret. I urge the President \nto sign the supplemental because it gives our troops and veterans the \nresources they need. It honors the sacrifices of those serving in Iraq \nwith a change in mission that is long overdue, and it is my hope that \none day we will all be able to say that we have accomplished our \nmission in Iraq. But until we change our mission and put in place a \nwinning strategy, that day will continue to elude us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on the bill under consideration at the \npresent time, it is my intention to--and I have already placed at the \ndesk two amendments, 987 and 988.\n  Briefly, what is the order right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. The Senator has as \nmuch time as he may consume.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Today I have submitted amendments to S. 1082 requiring \nparental consent for intrusive physical exams administered under the \nHead Start Program. Young children attending Head Start Programs should \nnot be subjected to these intrusive types of physical exams. We had an \nincident in my town of Tulsa, OK, where we felt that their rights, \nchildren's rights, were violated. They were subjected to different \ntypes of intrusive examinations. I will be bringing this up at an \nappropriate time.\n  Secondly, briefly, as I see the manager of the bill is here, we will \nbe introducing an amendment No. 988, having to do with protecting \nchildren from parents being coerced into administering a controlled \nsubstance or psychotropic drug in order to attend school.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe the Food and Drug Administration \nRevitalization Act before us today raises and addresses issues that are \ncritically important to the public's health and well-being. Congress \nhas a historic opportunity to strengthen and increase knowledge about \ndrug safety and effectiveness, bring more transparency to the process \nof drug approval and surveillance, as well as reassess the goals of the \nprescription drug and medical device user fee programs, and fortify and \nexpand essential safety programs for children. The FDA Revitalization \nAct strikes a careful balance between these many important priorities \nand objectives.\n  Recent serious adverse drug events related to several widely used \ndrugs on the market underscore the urgency with which we should address \nand improve drug safety in this country. Moreover, as the population \nages and science inevitably advances, more and more drugs will come to \nmarket, presenting potentially groundbreaking health benefits to the \npublic, but simultaneously increasing the need for sophisticated \nmechanisms for monitoring and assuring drug safety.\n  The FDA Revitalization Act is an opportunity to improve our current \nsystem of drug approval and drug monitoring, but it also adeptly \nanticipates changes in the future of prescription drugs and consumer \nsafety brought about by advances in science and an ever expanding \nmarket for prescription drugs.\n  The primary mechanism this bill uses to strengthen drug safety is to \nstrengthen and rearticulate the FDA's authority. The bill clarifies, \nand in some cases fortifies, the FDA's authority with regard to drug \nsafety. Currently, if the FDA detects a problem, or a potential problem \nwith a drug post approval, they have few options beyond what is often \nreferred to as the ``nuclear option.'' That is, pulling a drug from the \nmarket. While the FDA's authority to pull a drug from the marketplace \nis a powerful tool, it is a blunt instrument. In order to prevent \nproblems from spiraling into major public health crises, the FDA needs \nintermediary authority. The FDA's reluctance to pull a drug, \npotentially a drug upon which millions of Americans depend to manage an \nillness, unless it is overwhelmingly certain that the action is \nnecessary, is understandable. However, prescription drug users suffer \nas a result since the ``nuclear option'' offers a forceful, but \nultimately limited response. Pulling a drug from the market potentially \ndelays action and places individuals at major health risks in the \ninterim. On the flip side, pulling a drug prematurely may needlessly \ndeny patients important, and in some cases, singular, treatments for \ntheir health needs. This bill offers what I believe is a good solution \nto this paradox; one that considers input from patients rights \norganizations, industry representatives, and the FDA, but ultimately \nplaces patients at the top of the list.\n  The risk evaluation and mitigation, REMS, system, the primary tool in \nthe drug safety title of this bill, bolsters the FDA's intermediary \nauthority to require drug manufacturers to monitor and provide \nimportant information regarding their products. By so doing, the FDA \ncan actively require drug companies to provide information about the \nmedications millions of Americans are taking and not just passively \nrequest drug companies to comply.\n  Most importantly, the REMS system focuses the FDA's efforts and \nresources on postmarket surveillance. Increased drug user fees would be \nused to review REMS as well as for general drug safety surveillance. \nUser fee revenue will increase by $50 million to fund drug \nsafety activities, of which $30 million is authorized for the routine \ndrug surveillance once they are marketed. Many of us would like to \neliminate the need for industry paid user fees, but this arrangement, \nagreed on by industry and the FDA, offers the best workable solution in \nthis strained budget environment.\n\n  Another important objective of the FDA Revitalization Act is to \nimprove the integrity of the agency and to enhance transparency on its \nactions. I am pleased that this bill improves the public's access to \ninformation about clinical trials and, more importantly, the results of \nthose trials. The bill enhances patient enrollment in trials by \nrequiring late phase II, as well as phase III and phase IV clinical \ntrials on drugs are registered in a publicly available database. This \nwill improve the public's knowledge of important and potentially life \nsaving clinical studies. The bill also creates a publicly available \ndatabase of the results of those trials. This means, for instance, that \na parent who wishes to understand why a much-talked about treatment for \njuvenile diabetes failed to advance past a clinical trial stage can \ntrack the progress of a treatment using this database. It is important \nthat we empower patients and consumers to gather information from \nprimary sources so\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nthat they can engage in treatment decisions and make informed choices \nregarding their family's health care needs.\n  I am also pleased to see efforts to increase research on pediatric \ndrug safety, pediatric clinical trials, and pediatric medical devices \nin title IV of the FDA Revitalization Act. The bill includes \nreauthorizations of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, BPCA, \nchampioned by my colleague, Senator Dodd, which I have cosponsored, and \nthe Pediatric Research Improvement Act, PRIA, championed by my \ncolleague, Senator Clinton, which have been particularly successful at \nincreasing the availability of pediatric specific data on drug \nproducts, as well as greatly expanding the number of treatments that \nhave been tested and labeled for use in pediatric populations. The bill \nalso includes a new proposal to expand the collection and availability \nof pediatric data on medical devices, an area of the medical device \nmarket that remains seriously underdeveloped, and as a result places \ninfants and children at risk for inferior or inadequate care at best, \nand tragic and needless loss of life at worst. Moreover, BPCA also \nincludes a new provision on patent exclusivity for blockbuster drugs \nthat strikes a sound compromise between creating an appropriate \nfinancial incentive for drug companies to conduct much needed research, \nwhile also providing the FDA with important information about pediatric \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, the FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety of a \nwide range of products consumed by millions of Americans each and every \nday. We can and must ensure that this critical agency has the tools and \nresources it needs to perform the myriad of tasks under its purview. We \nneed to get this right for the millions of Americans who rely on the \nFDA to approve the drugs that they take to treat serious illnesses. The \nFDA Revitalization Act creates an opportunity to improve science at the \nFDA, strengthen drug safety by devoting resources to postmarket \nsurveillance, and ``revitalize'' the FDA's authority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Modification To Reported Committee Substitute\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, this basically incorporates a number of \nthe adjustments and changes that we had indicated during the course of \nour markup. We had a number of amendments that were offered. We \nindicated to the members we would try to work through some of the \npoints that were raised. I commend our staffs on both sides who have \nbeen diligent in doing so.\n  These are alterations, changes that are known to the majority and the \nminority and all the staff members. Later on in the discussion and \ndebate we can go into some in greater detail. Most of them are \nclarifications. Some of them are simplifications. I think all of them \nare worthy and justified, and I think they help to strengthen the \nlegislation. So we are very grateful to all of our colleagues on our \ncommittee who offered the amendments, and, most particularly, we are \nvery grateful for their willingness to work with us to try to work \nthrough these alterations and changes.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, as was pointed out in the excellent \nstatement made by our friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, \nand others, is complex, but it is incredibly important in terms of \nAmerican families, most precisely with regard to drug safety. We have \nreviewed those provisions. Senator Enzi made an excellent presentation \nyesterday. We tried to go through those in some detail yesterday \nafternoon. I might go through some of those again this afternoon.\n  But we want our Members to know we are ready to consider amendments. \nWe know there are several that are just about ready to be offered. We \nurge those who are considering bringing them to the floor, let's begin \nthe debate and discussion. We have one or two that are still being \nworked on. So even though it does not appear like we are making \nprogress on this legislation at the moment, progress is being made in \nmaking sure we are going to have strong FDA reauthorization \nlegislation. But we do hope we can get to the amendments very soon, and \nwe expect to be able to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to support the \nsubstitute that has been put into S. 1082, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act. I have said a lot about this \nimportant bill, and I do intend to say more. The most important thing I \ncan say right now is this is the product of a lot of bipartisan work by \nmembers of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions. We have a great process that wound up with a work in \nprogress, which wound up with this substitute bill.\n  Now we do have one major outstanding issue to figure out; that is, \nthe direct consumer advertising for prescription drugs. I do believe we \nwill work something out, but we are not quite there yet. So I would ask \nmy colleagues' indulgence to work that out, and I hope I have the \nassurance of the\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nchairman that we will engage in a serious dialog about the various \nprovisions that are included in that direct consumer issue. That will \nbe a real key to finishing up.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for the \noutstanding way he and his staff have worked with all the Members on \nour side of the aisle to clear up. As he said, in some cases, \nclarifications were needed, and in some cases it was the expansion of \nwording; in some cases, a reduction in wording. But, at any rate, we \ngot it to where I think both sides understand and agree on many of the \nissues that are included. I hope we can have other amendments brought \nto the floor so we can debate them and get them worked out.\n  Of course, it would be nice if any Senator thinking about offering an \namendment would share their idea with us prior to filing it. We might \nbe able to save some time that way and make sure debate flows in an \norderly process. We are trying to keep the bill to relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to continue working with my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, and my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, on the important issue of direct-to-consumer \nadvertising.\n  We have to strike an important balance between seeing that consumers \nget accurate information on drug safety and seeing that we do not \nimproperly restrain free speech.\n  Senator Harkin has a proposal to add safety information to drug ads. \nSenator Roberts has an idea to allow FDA to impose fines for inaccurate \nads. Our bill includes a moratorium--only to be used in rare cases--on \nDTC ads. The IOM went further and recommended a moratorium on DTC for \nall new drugs. We rejected that recommendation due to the first \namendment concerns but included more limited authority that we believe \nmeets the constitutional test.\n  Still, some have raised concerns about our current proposal, and we \ntake those concerns seriously. We will continue to work on this \nimportant issue with our colleagues and constitutional experts. I think \nwe are making progress through the afternoon and, hopefully, by \ntomorrow we will have some recommendation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business and that my remarks be printed at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5362-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5362-S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to express \nmy deep disappointment and the disappointment of so many people in my \nState with the President's expected decision to veto the supplemental \nfunding bill delivered to him by the bipartisan majority in Congress. \nThis bill provided our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with all the \nequipment and the resources they need to continue the duties they have \nbeen so bravely performing for more than 4 years. The amount \nappropriated by Congress rose well above the amount the President \nrequested to give our soldiers on the battlefield. Let it be clear: \nCongress has given our soldiers on the battlefield all the funding they \nneed. It is the President who will now be blocking it.\n  A few weeks ago, I was driving in Minnesota. It was a beautiful \nspring day outside of Ortonville, MN, and as has happened too many \ntimes in my short time as a Senator, I called one of the mothers of the \nMinnesota soldiers who died in this war. Of the 22,000 troops the \nPresident has included in this surge, 3,000 of them are Minnesota Guard \nand Reserves who were expected to come home in January and February and \nnow have been extended. Now the moms I am calling are the moms of these \nsoldiers who would have been home in January or February.\n  I asked this mother: How are you doing?\n  She said: You know, people keep asking me that, and I don't really \nknow what to say. Do you have any ideas about what I should say?\n  I thought, and I told her: Well, I can tell you what all the other \nmothers have been saying. They have been saying that they wake up every \nmorning and they try hard to hang together for their family, and then \nsomething happens. They see a picture or they remember something, and \nthey are never the same for the rest of the day. They have their good \nmoments, but their lives will never be the same.\n  I told her that her son stood tall, and that now is the time for \npeople in Washington to stand tall.\n  After 4 years of extensive American military involvement in Iraq, the \nPresident refuses to accept the prudent change of course recommended by \nthe bipartisan Iraq Study Group and supported by a clear majority of \nthe American people. By passing this bill, we in Congress fulfilled our \nconstitutional duties to, first, continue funding for America's Armed \nForces in harm's way and, second, to ensure that our Government pursues \npolicies in the best interests of our soldiers and of our Nation.\n  As we work with the President in the days and weeks and months to \ncome, we must continue to advocate for the necessary changes in our \nstrategy in Iraq. It is with this spirit that we in Congress continue \nto reach out to the President for a responsible change of course in \nIraq.\n  Last month, I visited Baghdad and Fallujah. I saw firsthand the \nbravery and commitment of our troops. The very best thing we can do for \nthese young men and women is not only give them the equipment they \ndeserve but to get this policy right. This means sending a clear \nmessage to the Iraqi Government that we are not staying there \nindefinitely. This means, as recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study \nGroup, that we begin the process of redeploying our troops, with the \ngoal of withdrawing combat forces by next year, while acknowledging \nthat some troops may remain to train the Iraqi police and special \nforces to provide security for those who remain and to conduct special \noperations. This means not a surge in troops but a surge in diplomacy \nand economy and Iraqi responsibility.\n  When I was over in Baghdad and Fallujah, I saw many things, including \nthe bravery of our troops. I was struck a few weeks later when another \ndelegation of people from Congress went there, and one of the \nCongressmen returned and said he had been visiting a market there. He \nsaid it reminded him of a farmers market in Indiana.\n  Those are not the enduring memories of my trip to Iraq. My most \nenduring memory is standing on the tarmac in the Baghdad Airport with \nnine firefighters from the Duluth National Guard, who called me over to \nstand with them while they saluted as six caskets draped in the \nAmerican flag were loaded onto a plane. As every casket was loaded on, \nthey saluted. They were standing tall for their fallen soldiers that \nday. Now is our time for Congress to stand tall. Our troops have done \neverything they have been asked to do. They have deposed an evil \ndictator, and they gave the Iraqi people the opportunity to vote and \nestablish a new government. It is now the Iraqi Government's \nresponsibility to govern.\n  But stability and progress in Iraq depend on the political reforms \nIraqi leaders have promised many times yet failed to deliver. After 4 \nyears, despite many promises, Iraq has yet to approve a provincial \nelection law. After 4 years, despite many promises, Iraq has yet to \napprove a law to share oil revenues. After 4 years, despite many \npromises, Iraq has yet to approve a debaathification law to promote \nreconciliation. After 4 years, despite many promises, Iraq has yet to \napprove a law reining in the militia. Our men and women in uniform \ncannot deliver these kinds of reforms to Iraq. This is up to the Iraqis \nthemselves.\n  As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended, Iraqi leaders must \npay a price if they continue to fail to make good on key reforms they \nhave promised the Iraqi people. After 4 years, what have we gotten? \nBenchmarks\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nwithout progress, promises without results, claims of accountability \nwithout any consequences. Why should we expect the Iraqi leaders to do \nany better when they know the President continues to accept their \nexcuses for inaction and fails to impose any penalties for their lack \nof progress.\n  That is why the bipartisan Iraq Study Group made clear that ``if the \nIraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the \nachievement of milestones on national reconciliation, security, and \ngovernance, the United States should reduce its political, military, or \neconomic support for the Iraqi government.'' That report was issued 5 \nmonths ago. Meanwhile, the President has simply stayed the course he \nhas continued to pursue for the past 4 years and, not surprisingly, \nlittle progress has been achieved in Iraq. The Iraqi Government will \nunderstand and finally take responsibility only when it is crystal \nclear to them that our combat presence is not indefinite and that \nAmerican combat troops are going to leave. That is the responsible \nchange of course we in Congress are seeking. The American people are \nlooking to their leaders in Washington at both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue to work together to get this policy right.\n  Two weeks ago, I went to the White House and met with the President, \nalong with three other Senators, including two Republicans. I \nappreciated the time he took to honestly discuss our points of \nagreement and disagreement on the war. I told him that now is the time \nto forge cooperation with our Democrats in Congress. But the President \nhas chosen instead to veto this bill.\n  As we move forward on the funding of this war, we in Congress will do \nnothing that threatens the safety of American soldiers in the field. \nBut we must continue to fulfill our constitutional duty to exercise \noversight of American policies in Iraq. A critical part of this \noversight must be demanding accountability for the way in which funds \nare spent on the reconstruction projects in Iraq.\n  For the past 4 years, the administration has demanded--and received--\na blank check to spend in Iraq. Now we are seeing the consequences of \nthis lack of planning, management, and responsibility.\n  On Monday, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nreleased a report that details widespread failures in the most basic \nreconstruction projects. The report finds that, in many cases, Iraq's \ninfrastructure and utility systems are worse off than they were before \nthe war.\n  On closer inspection, it turns out that even projects which were \ndeclared ``success stories'' were considerably less than that. In fact, \nseven out of eight of these projects which were called success stories \nwere not operating properly due to plumbing and electrical failures, \nimproper maintenance, possible looting, and the fact that expensive \nequipment was available but never used.\n  Prior to the 2003 invasion, Iraq's power system produced 4,500 \nmegawatts a day. Today, the same system produces 3,832 megawatts a day. \nIn Baghdad, the city enjoys an average of 6.5 hours of electricity a \nday. A year ago, Baghdad received 8 hours of electricity a day. Before \nthe war, the city received an average of 16 to 24 hours a day.\n  Congress has provided $4.2 billion for reconstruction of Iraq's power \nsystem, and the result has been a more than 50 percent decrease in the \nlength of time the citizens of Baghdad have access to electricity on \nany given day.\n  Congress has provided nearly $2 billion to provide clean drinking \nwater and repair sewer systems. But according to the World Health \nOrganization, 70 percent of Iraqis lack access to clean drinking water.\n  The Defense Department has estimated that the unemployment rate in \nIraq is anywhere between 13.6 percent to 60 percent. In a recent \nsurvey, only 16 percent of Iraqis said their current incomes met their \nbasic needs.\n  So after 4 years, we are facing a security situation that continues \nto deteriorate, an economic situation that continues to stagnate, and a \nreconstruction effort that cannot provide even the most basic services.\n  My colleagues and I have been asking the difficult questions and \ndemanding answers from this administration. The supplemental bill \ndemonstrates that Congress is reclaiming its rightful role in setting \nIraq policy and, more broadly, in our system of government. The \nPresident's veto only strengthens our resolve.\n  Madam President, I also wish to speak briefly in support of a few \nother provisions in this bill that I believe respond to critical \nchallenges our Nation faces and that the administration has deemed \nunnecessary.\n  The White House and many of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave argued that this bill should not contain funding for anything \nother than the current war. If we were sacrificing funding for our \ntroops in order to meet domestic priorities, I would agree. But having \ngiven our troops all they need and continuing to ignore crises at home \nwould be irresponsible.\n  Veterans funding is one of the key parts of this bill. This bill adds \nan increase in veterans funding that was long overdue. In the last 2 \nyears in my State, veterans would come up to me--particularly from the \nIraq and Afghanistan wars--and they would tell me about how they had \ndifficulty getting treatment. They clearly had mental health issues. I \ndidn't know if there was truth to this. I wasn't sure, because of the \nstate of their minds, whether this was true. Then I got here, and I \nstarted looking at the numbers.\n  In 2005, the Department of Defense estimated that about 24,000 \nsoldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan would need health care. \nThe actual number is four times that amount. Last year, they were \n87,000 soldiers short in their estimate of how many soldiers would need \nhelp coming back from this war. Now I know why those people were \nwandering around asking for help. It is because they weren't getting \nthe help they deserve.\n  Another critical problem that has been ignored by this \nadministration--and one that is particularly important to the people of \nmy State--has been the tremendous damage recent national disasters have \nbeen inflicting on our farmers and ranchers. The supplemental spending \nbill was a combination of a 2-year effort to secure disaster assistance \nfor America's farmers. Minnesota farmers have been hit with heavy \nlosses for 2 consecutive years--storms and flooding in 2005 and, again, \ndrought in 2006. All told, they lost more than $700 million in crop and \nlivestock losses.\n  The supplemental funding would have provided $3.5 billion to \ncompensate farmers for a portion of their crop and livestock losses \nover the past 2 years. Our farmers have waited too long for this \ndisaster relief. I am deeply disappointed that the President has turned \nhis back on the urgent need for their assistance.\n  The bill we sent to the President of the United States provided the \nresources and support our soldiers need on the battlefield and after \nthey return home. A few months ago, I attended a funeral of one of the \nbrave men who was killed in the line of duty. The priest stood up, and \nhe said to the thousand people in the cathedral: You know, this was a \ngood kid. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, but he was still our child.\n  When we send our kids to war and they are 6 feet tall, they are still \nour kids and they are standing tall. We need to stand tall.\n  The traumatic brain injury victims I have seen at the veterans \nhospital in Minnesota, even in their wheelchairs, are standing tall.\n  Those moms whom I talked to on the phone, as they struggle every day \njust to get out of bed to deal with the loss of their kids who were \nkilled in this war, are standing tall.\n  Now it is time for the President of the United States to stand tall.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, 4 years ago today, as we know, the \nPresident stood on an aircraft carrier underneath a banner that read \n``Mission Accomplished.'' He declared that the major combat operations \nin Iraq were over. When he spoke those words, 140\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nAmerican troops had been killed in Iraq. Since then, over 3,200 more \nAmerican troops have given their lives. Just today, we learned that \nApril was the deadliest month this year, with 104 Americans dead.\n  With every passing day, it becomes more obvious that the President \nreally should have said: My fellow Americans, major combat operations \nin Iraq are just beginning. On that day, he should have had a plan to \nmatch the rhetoric with reality. But we are where we are, as the saying \ngoes, and it is even more tragically clear to all but a few that if we \nwant to accomplish our mission in Iraq--and we all do--if we want an \nIraq that has any chance of stability and some sense of democracy, any \nsense of it, we have to change course.\n  In the past 4 years, we have lost at least 3,342 of our best young \nmen and women, and nearly 25,000 others have been wounded and many \nwounded severely. We have spent nearly $400 billion, and the cost is \nrising at a rate of over $2 billion per week. There is no end in sight.\n\n  ADM William Fallon, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, \nrecently said:\n\n       We are losing ground every day.\n\n  And even General Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, now says that \nwe can expect the situation to get worse before it gets better.\n  We were treated to a spectacle a week and a half ago with news \nreports, a front-page story, I think, in the Washington Post, that \nStephen Hadley, the President's security adviser, was casting about to \nfind a general to be the sort of supreme organizer, if you will, of the \nwar in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq.\n  What struck me about that story is here is our Nation at war, here is \na series of four-star generals whose lives are committed to Nation, to \nservice, to duty, and to military, who under normal circumstances would \nbe honored to be asked to become the point person to organize our \nNation's efforts in two wars in a front that is of serious consequence \nto this Nation. Yet all four retired four-star generals said no. One \nwas even quoted publicly as saying they don't know what the hell they \nare doing, or they don't know what direction they are going in.\n  That is a pretty remarkable statement for a career military person to \nmake about the current effort. But we also know the history of what has \nbrought us here with retired generals--a whole host of them--who \npublicly rebelled postservice against the leadership of Secretary \nRumsfeld, who is now gone.\n  It is a rather remarkable statement about the lack of planning, about \nthe lack of candor, about the scapegoating that has gone on, about the \nunwillingness of people's careers to be judged not by their ability to \ntell the truth but, rather, their willingness to tell the civilian \nleaders what they want to hear.\n  As we know from our own intelligence agencies, the war in Iraq has \nincreased the threat of terrorism by creating a breeding ground for \nterrorists that didn't exist before the invasion and by serving as a \nrallying point for extremists around the world. In fact, the State \nDepartment's annual terrorism report released yesterday shows that \nterrorist attacks worldwide were up 25 percent last year after \nincreasing nearly fourfold the year before that.\n  How does the leadership come to the country and suggest that this war \nis accomplishing our larger goals? How does it help the war on terror \nto be creating more terrorists? How can you tell the American people we \nhave made you safer, when the number of terrorist incidents have gone \nup and the number of terrorists who want to kill Americans is larger \ntoday than it was on 9/11?\n  Any businessperson, any tourist, anybody of any curiosity who has \ntraveled abroad and who has asked a few simple questions or read the \nnewspapers and listened to the news knows that our Nation, which we \nlove passionately, is now less followed, less listened to, and less \nfeared--less listened to by our friends and less feared by our enemies. \nThe fact is, we are less safe as a result. We are less unified at home, \nless respected abroad, and we are less strong as a result.\n  Obviously, there is no way we can make up for what has happened in \nthe last few years, certainly not in terms of the lives lost and the \npain and suffering endured by those wounded and by families who have \nsuffered those losses, but the fact is, we can find a responsible \nstrategy to try to deal with not just Iraq but the whole Middle East \nand, indeed, releverage America's position in the world.\n  The President today, tonight, is going to veto crucial funding for \nthe troops passed by both Houses of Congress, legislation that gives \nour soldiers all they need to complete the mission and receive the care \nthey deserve once they get home. The President is going to veto it, but \nthat is not all he is going to do. Then he is going to try to pin the \nblame on those who have pushed for a new direction. He is going to try \nto pin the blame for his failures, for his lack of planning, for his \nlack of leadership on those who are providing the only way to try to \nresolve what is happening in Iraq.\n  Instead of pressuring Iraqi politicians, this administration is \npracticing the politics of division at home, a brand of American \nsectarianism that undermines our national unity, a unity required to \nmake decisions in time of war.\n  Last week, Vice President Cheney accused Senator Harry Reid of \nputting politics ahead of our national security. I suppose we have \ngrown used to this Vice President, who has pioneered the politics of \nfear, who oversaw the politicization of the intelligence used to \nmislead the country into war, who claimed that we would be greeted like \nliberators, who told us the insurgency was in its last throws, who \ncontinues to insist that everything is on track and growing fine, I \nthink we have grown used to this Vice President not being candid with \nthe American people.\n  Clearly, he didn't hesitate to impugn the integrity of the Senate's \nmajority leader who is standing for an appropriate new direction with \nrespect to our policy in Iraq.\n  Certainly, we can disagree about those tactics or strategies without \nimpugning the motives and challenging the integrity of those who speak \nthose different possibilities.\n  If the President insists on continuing down the wrong path, it seems \nto me Congress has no choice but to be as resolute in demanding the \nright path forward for our troops, for our country, and for the Iraqis \nthemselves. I believe we have to continue to fight for the legislation \nthat gives us the best chance of bringing our troops home with some \nmeasure of success in the region.\n  Four years after ``mission accomplished,'' it is time for us to \nacknowledge the implications of what General Petraeus and every other \nmilitary commander, the Secretary of State and even the President have \ntold us. All of them have said there is no military solution to the \nviolence in Iraq. I don't know how many times I have heard that on \nSunday shows, I hear it out here in the corridors with individual \nSenators talking to the press. Everybody mouths the words: ``There is \nno military solution.'' But if there is no military solution and we are \nall agreed on that, then what is the military doing? Why is the \nmilitary and an escalation in the number of troops so critical if there \nis no military solution?\n  The administration, even after telling you there is no military \nsolution, then gives you a rationale for a military solution, which is: \nWe have to put additional troops in to have the security, in order to \nhave the compromises. But the fact is, the security which, first of \nall, is proving illusive and probably impossible to secure with the \ntroops alone, cannot be secured without the political compromises. This \nis a classic chicken-and-egg situation: Which comes first? You are not \ngoing to get the security until the stakeholders in this civil struggle \nfeel confident enough that what they are struggling about can be \nresolved to their safety and future security. That is sort of a \nfundamental issue. You are not going to change the on-the-ground \nsecurity situation and stop people from bombing and militias from \nkilling unless those fundamental stakes are properly addressed and \ndefined.\n\n  It is long since time that we started to measure progress on the \nground in Iraq by the one metric that will ultimately determine our \nsuccess or our failure, and that metric is this: Are the Iraqis making \nthe tough political compromises necessary to keep their country \ntogether?\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\n  It has been nearly a year since the Maliki Government took power. At \nthat time, General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad said that the Maliki \nGovernment had 6 months to make the political compromises necessary to \nwin the public confidence.\n  So here we have the commanding general of our forces and our trusted \nAmbassador to Iraq both saying they have 6 months to make the \ncompromises. But guess what. The 6 months went by and nothing \nhappened--nothing happened in Iraq to make those compromises happened, \nand nothing happened afterwards because the compromises didn't happen. \nThat sends a message that there is no consequence to delay, there is no \nconsequence to procrastination.\n  After that, the Iraqi Government agreed to a set of benchmarks \nbecause people were growing frustrated and those benchmarks, guess \nwhat, were pegged to specific dates for making progress toward national \nreconciliation.\n  In January, the President announced the troop escalation, and he told \nthe American people the following:\n\n       America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it \n     has announced. Now is the time to act. The Prime Minister \n     understands this.\n\n  But, once again, no real consequences, no real leverage, no real \ndiplomacy. The result is, those benchmarks proved meaningless. You can \ntake a look at the benchmarks the Iraqis agreed to. What did they agree \nto do at that point in time?\n  October 2006, over 6 months ago, that was the deadline for Iraqis to \napprove a new oil law and a provincial election law. As of today, the \noil law has yet to even be introduced in Parliament, and that is an \nimprovement over the provincial election law which hasn't even been \ndrafted yet.\n  November 2006 was the deadline for new debaathification law to help \nbring Sunnis into the Government. A draft proposal was recently \ndenounced by Ayatollah Sistani and a national commission to oversee the \nprocess, and guess what. It is nowhere near completion. In fact, 5 \nmonths after the deadline, the Shiite leader of the SCIRI Party \nrecently described the Baathists as ``the first enemy of the Iraqi \npeople.'' So much for debaathification and reconciliation.\n  December 2006 was the deadline for the Iraqis to approve legislation \nto address the militias. To date, absolutely no progress has been made \non this crucial legislation, and the militias continue to wreak havoc.\n  January 2007 was the deadline for Iraqis to complete a constitutional \nreview process. There was supposed to be a referendum on constitutional \namendments by March. Guess what. The constitutional committee hasn't \neven drafted the proposed amendments, and the Iraqis remain far apart \non key issues such as federalism and the fate of the divided city of \nKirkut.\n  We are no closer to a political solution today than we were when the \nMaliki Government took power 1 year ago, but there were more than 940 \nadditional American troops who gave their lives in that process to wait \nfor the Iraqis to procrastinate.\n  Did the President actually hold the Iraqi Government to those \nbenchmarks as promised? No. I hope the President tonight, when he \naddresses us after the veto, will address the benchmarks and where we \nare with respect to the failure of the Government to make the choices \nthey said they had to make while our soldiers continue to die.\n  The administration still refuses to get genuinely tough with Iraqi \npoliticians. They keep moving the goalposts, deflect the criticism of a \nfailed strategy which they refuse to abandon. Instead, we get more \nvague assertions that our presence is not open-ended and outright \nrejection of any proposal that would leverage that threat.\n  The administration, it seems to me, has reached a point where it has \nto stop pretending the lack of political will in America is the \nproblem. It is not the lack of political will in America that is the \nproblem, it is the lack of political will in Iraq that is the problem.\n  It is impossible to make any other judgment when you look at that \nentire series of benchmarks. I remember Secretary Rice coming before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I believe, several months ago now, and \nI asked her the question about the oil law. She said: Oh, yes, the oil \nlaw is almost done, just about done; wrapped up, we are about to \nproceed forward, we are confident it is going to be done in a few \ndays. Here we are, several months later, and there is no oil law. It is \nnot even before the Parliament yet.\n\n  The administration needs to accept the basic reality that the \nCongress has acknowledged: Iraqi politicians, if they are capable, if \nthey are capable of making these decisions, have shown they will not do \nit without a reason to do it, without a rationale that feels some heat. \nA deadline is the only thing they have responded to so far. It took a \ndeadline to be able to get them to do a constitution. It took a \ndeadline to have each of their elections.\n  Incidentally, they protested against each of the deadlines. Each time \nthey said: Don't do this to us; we can't meet it; we can't make it; it \nis too much. But each time, because we set the deadline and kept \npushing, they did meet it.\n  American security is not a security blanket for Iraqis who want to \nprocrastinate while American soldiers die. The longer the President \ncontinues to give them the sense that he is not going to change, he is \nnot going to move on them, the more they are secure in the sense that \nthey can just continue to jockey and play their political game at the \nexpense of American dollars and American interests and American lives. \nWithout real deadlines to force them, there is no way to actually \ndetermine that we can make the progress we need to make. Since January, \nwhen the President decided to disregard key elements of the Iraq Study \nGroup and announced the escalation, over 340 American troops have died, \nand there is still no fundamental progress.\n  The legislation we have sent to the President would change this \ndynamic. It would force the Iraqis to either stand up for Iraq and meet \nthe political benchmarks they have agreed to or decide they can't do it \nand have their fight.\n  It calls for a flexible timetable for the redeployment in 2008, and I \nunderscore ``flexible.'' Every time we try to do something, we get into \nthis totally phony, polarized debate where the President and his \nhenchmen go out and talk about reckless abandonment and surrender and \ndefeatism when, in fact, what we are proposing gives the President all \nthe discretion in the world--to leave troops there to finish the \ntraining of Iraqis, which is the fundamental reason we are there; to \nleave troops there to chase al-Qaida, to prosecute the war on terror, \nwhich is in our interests, and to leave troops to protect American \nforces and protect American facilities. After 6 years of the war, what \nother fundamental mission should there be for American forces?\n  It seems to me the real debate is one that should center around the \nfailures of this administration to face that reality and the few \nchoices we have now to try to achieve success. The most important \nchoice that has to be made to achieve success is to engage in full-\nthroated diplomacy, not dissimilar to the kind of meeting that will be \nheld in Sharm el-Sheikh this week. We hope Secretary Rice will take \nadvantage of that and that the countries of the region will come \ntogether around a new security arrangement and a new understanding of \nwhat has to happen.\n  The timetable for the redeployment in the legislation sent to the \nPresident is not arbitrary, and it is not precipitous. It is consistent \nwith the Iraq Study Group's recommendations and with the timeframe for \ntransferring control of Iraq to the Iraqis that was set forth by \nGeneral Casey. It also has the schedule agreed upon by the Iraqi \nGovernment itself. There is nothing arbitrary in a schedule to which \nyour own commanding general and the Iraqi Government have agreed.\n  Even the President has said, under his new strategy, responsibility \nfor security would be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this \nyear. So they are willing to set a date. The administration can set a \ndate for the transfer of the security, but it is unwilling to set a \ndate for the beginning of the drawdown of some troops so you guarantee \nthat date for the transfer of security is actually meaningful. The \nPresident has said it. Our generals have said it. The Iraq Study Group \nhas said it. Now it is\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\ntime for the President to embrace legislation that makes those words \nreality.\n  Instead of accepting the change that is necessary, we keep hearing we \nneed more of the same; we have to give the surge time to work; the \nIraqis need just a little more breathing space to start making \npolitical progress.\n  General Petraeus has said, however, that he won't be able to make any \nprogress assessment on the ground until September. Guess what. We hear \nthat Iraq's Parliament, which has only been able to muster a quorum to \neven consider legislation about once every week or two--the Iraqi \nParliament plans to take a 2-month vacation this summer, a vacation in \nthe middle of a civil war. You sort of wonder what Abraham Lincoln \nwould think of that. Iraq is descending further into chaos as thousands \nof Iraqis die each month. If the Iraqis go on vacation without making \nthe key political compromises, it will absolutely guarantee that there \nis not going to be any meaningful political progress until next fall. I \ndo not believe that America should be sending our troops to die for \nsomebody else's vacation.\n  How many more American soldiers are going to give their lives without \nany hope of achieving a real political solution? 300? 400? 500? How \nmany more doors are going to be knocked on and phone calls made? How \nmany more visits to Arlington and other cemeteries across America, \nwhile the Iraqis procrastinate and refuse to settle their differences?\n  How can any of us in the Chamber look in the eyes of the parents of \nany young American killed and tell them: Your son or daughter died so \nthe Iraqis can take the summer off?\n  With every passing day it becomes clearer this Iraqi Government is \nnot going to get the job done. It is not truly a unity government, it \nis a figleaf for politicians who are pursuing sectarian interests \ninstead of protecting the nation they are charged with saving. Now it \nis starting to crumble under the weight of its own ineffectiveness and \ncorruption.\n  Last week some prominent Iraqi legislators came out and said publicly \nthat they have lost confidence in the Maliki government. That is not \nsurprising since we recently learned that Prime Minister Maliki was \nresponsible for a politically motivated purge of Iraqi military leaders \nwho had the gumption to actually act against the Mahdi militia.\n  Yesterday the largest block of Sunni Arabs in the Parliament \nthreatened to withdraw its Ministers from the Shiite-dominated Cabinet \nin frustration over the Government's failure to deal with Sunni \nconcerns. As one Sunni legislator said:\n\n       The problem is not just with sectarian practices but with \n     the Government's ineffectiveness.\n\n  This Government we are supporting is spiraling downward into greater \nand greater ineffectiveness. In the process, Iraq is spiraling deeper \nand deeper into its sectarian divide.\n  It is not just the Iraqis. Last week we learned that several \nprominent Sunni countries are balking at complete debt relief for Iraq \nbecause of the lack of progress in political reconciliation. This past \nweekend the Saudis refused to allow Prime Minister Maliki to visit \ntheir country because he has not delivered on his promise to seek real \nreconciliation with Iraqi Sunnis. How can we expect progress and \npolitical reconciliation if the Iraqis have lost confidence in the \nMaliki government? How can we expect diplomatic progress when Iraq's \nneighbors have lost confidence in Iraqi leadership? This is a very \nserious issue.\n  The administration has finally done what they should have done years \nago: engaged, this week, in the kind of diplomacy that is desperately \nneeded. On the eve of the summit, we learned that some of the major \nplayers have no confidence in the political process. So if we really \nwant to bring about the political and diplomatic solution that is the \nonly solution, the time has come now for new leadership in Iraq.\n  When I was in Iraq in December, Prime Minister Maliki told me he was \nworking on forming a new coalition that would isolate extremists \nunwilling to compromise and empower moderates who were. Since then we \nhave heard from time to time that these negotiations continue behind \nthe scenes. But nothing has happened. It is time to get out from behind \nthe scenes. It is time to have a government that can put the pieces \nback together.\n  As one Iraqi Minister said yesterday, Mr. Maliki ``said he was going \nto appoint new Ministers; he needs to do that. . . . What is he waiting \nfor?''\n  That is a question the U.S. Congress should echo. We simply cannot go \non like this, day after day, news cycle after news cycle--more bombs, \nmore murders, more assassinations, more suicide bombings, more \nkillings, more American soldiers dead. We can't go on like this and \nexpect the situation to miraculously get better. Time is not on our \nside. Time is not on anyone's side in the end because if this does go \ndownward into greater sectarian violence, all of the Iraqis will lose.\n  If we are serious about a political solution, we need a fresh start. \nThat is why I believe it is time for Prime Minister Maliki to make \nwholesale changes in his Cabinet. He already has to replace the six \nMuqtada al-Sadr Ministers, the Sadrist Ministers who recently resigned. \nHe should use that as an opportunity to fire any other Minister who is \nnot committed to political reconciliation and replace them with \nMinisters who are.\n  We should make it clear this truly is his last chance. If reshuffling \nthe Cabinet does not produce meaningful political progress within a \nrelatively short period of time, then he should step down and allow a \nnew leader to step forward. Putting Mr. Maliki's personal political \nfuture on the line is perhaps one of the few ways left to try to create \nthe leverage necessary to find out if he is capable of moving the \nreconciliation procession forward. If he proves unwilling or unable, \nthen clearly someone else should be given a chance--if there is someone \nelse.\n  This is the moment to put that to the test. I recognize that Iraqis \nmust take responsibility for their own future and that any government \nwe impose will lack legitimacy with their fellow Iraqis. But we can use \nour own influence behind the scenes to encourage the Iraqis to make the \nleadership changes so clearly needed in order to give their Government \na chance to succeed. We certainly have a right to make that request, \ngiven the degree to which that Government is dependent on our troops \nand our money and our presence.\n  Congress has finally done what this administration has stubbornly \nrefused to do. I am proud of my fellow Members of this body who had the \ncourage to vote for this legislation. I know how divisive it can be. I \nknow how the other side uses it and how people tend to try to \npersonalize and even denigrate people's patriotism and concern for the \nNation. The fact is, the Congress has done what needed to be done \nbecause this administration has not done it.\n  People say don't micromanage. Someone has to manage. They have \nclearly mismanaged every step of this war, and they have been absent \nfrom the diplomacy necessary. It is time to have a new strategy, time \nto hold Iraqi politicians responsible for their country's future, time \nto get deadly serious about finding a political solution, and finding \nit now.\n  Somehow this President still chooses to take a different tack. If \nPresident Bush vetoes this bill, which we understand he will, then he \nis the one standing in the way of a bipartisan strategy on Iraq. The \nIraq Study Group was bipartisan. The Iraq Study Group had former \nSecretary of State Jim Baker, a Republican, a great friend of President \nBush's father. It had Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger. It had Al \nSimpson, former Senator from Wyoming and Republican leader in the \nSenate. It had Bill Perry, former Secretary of Defense; Chuck Robb; it \nhad Ed Meese, former Attorney General and Chief of Staff to a \nRepublican President. All of these are moderate, thoughtful, respected, \ntrusted voices in foreign policy and in the affairs of our country. \nThey all came together in a consensus. That consensus was summarily \nrejected by the President, just pushed aside.\n  The President decided to go his own road, which even the generals and \neven Prime Minister Maliki did not want to do. I read one Senator's \ncomment that there is no plan B, that there is just plan A, which is \nthe surge. I disagree with that. Plan B is what plan B should\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nhave been all the time, which is to engage in the legitimate kind of \nintervention on a diplomatic level and to put on the table all of the \nissues of the region in a way that proves the kind of sincerity and \nseriousness of purpose that raises the level of credibility of the \ndiscussion so people can trust that we, in fact, are going to be moving \nin a common direction, which is in their interests.\n  The reason Saudi Arabia is sending such public messages of discontent \nfor the policies of this administration today is because, given what \nhas happened, that is the way they have to play it in order to deal \nwith their own politics of the region and their own politics of the \nstreet and their nation. It is our absence from a creative, diplomatic \neffort, it is our absence from a credible and legitimate diplomatic \nlift that has left no choice even to our friends than to begin to \ndistance themselves from our country.\n  With this veto, the President will deny our troops the vehicles they \nneed, for the time being; he will deny them the basic care they \ndeserve, for the time being, because all of us know the Congress will \ncome back and we will fund those things. But the most significant thing \nhe will deny us is the kind of leadership and the kind of consensus the \ncountry deserves in order to move forward in our policy in Iraq.\n  We honor the lives lost in Iraq, not with words but with lives saved. \nWe honor the lives lost in Iraq not with words and with the political \npartisanship here but with a policy that is right for them and for the \nregion. We honor their sacrifice by creating a situation in the region \nwhere we protect America's and the region's interests at the same time \nand begin to recognize the degree to which our presence in Iraq is \nplaying into the hands of the terrorists, is advancing the very cause \nwe seek to fight, which is diminishing the ability of the United States \nto be able to leverage, not just the Middle East issues, but a host of \nother issues in the world.\n  I believe we need to change course, and it is only by changing course \nthat we will honor their sacrifice, respect our interests, and bring \nour troops home with honor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to let our Members know about the substitute that \nhas been included, that is before us now. It essentially clarifies the \nFDA's authority to place restrictions on drugs with safety problems; \napplies only to drugs like Thalidomide that could not otherwise be \napproved. We can understand why it is important that the FDA probably \nwould not have approved Thalidomide, for all of the dangers it has, but \nit has now approved it to deal with some of the problems of leprosy. We \nwant to make sure it is not going to be out there and be utilized in \nterms of expectant mothers. So we have worked this out. I thank Senator \nCoburn for his help on this issue.\n  We also make sure the FDA takes into account concerns of rural \ncommunities in setting safety policies. We have given enhanced \nauthority to the FDA in terms of safety policies. We want to make sure \nin the implementation of those, particularly in rural areas, they are \nnot going to be so restrictive as to limit the opportunities to get the \nnecessary prescription drugs. I thank Senator Harkin and Senator \nMurkowski, who were enormously helpful in working through that issue.\n  This also adds a Web portal for FDA so consumers will have a single \npoint of access, via the Internet, to drug safety information. I thank \nSenator Gregg for that. That will be very important for consumers who \nare concerned about the safety issues. All of those changes and \nalterations are very helpful and valuable in terms of the legislation \nitself.\n  I wish to speak for 3 minutes as in morning business and not under \nthe time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5367-S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the President is going to be making up \nhis mind on the issue of the supplemental and making a judgment in the \nnext several hours. President Bush stubbornly clings to the false hope \nthat success is just around the corner and that the mission will be \naccomplished. We have heard it all before. Ending the rule of Saddam \nHussein was supposed to lessen violence and bring a new wave of \ndemocracy into the Middle East. It has not. Saddam Hussein's capture \nwas supposed to quell the violence. It didn't. Free elections and the \ndrafting of the constitution were supposed to be a breakthrough. They \nweren't. The surge was supposed to bring stability, essential to \npolitical reconciliation and economic reconstruction. It has not and it \nwill not.\n  Only the Iraqi people can save Iraq and it is time for them to do so. \nAmerican military force cannot solve the problems of the Iraqi people. \nIt is time for the President to put the Iraqis on notice that our \nmilitary will begin to withdraw. No one in the administration can \nhonestly tell the American people we are making progress in Iraq. It is \ntime the President listened to the Iraq Study Group, Congress, and the \nAmerican people, and work with us to bring our troops home.\n  The President is wrong to veto the Iraq spending bill and reject its \nneeded timeline for the orderly, responsible, and safe withdrawal of \nour forces from Iraq. He was wrong to lead us into the war, wrong to \nconduct it so poorly, and wrong to refuse to change course.\n  We cannot continue business as usual in Iraq. It is time for America \nto end its participation in the brutal civil war. The message from the \nAmerican people couldn't be louder or clearer: Instead of defying the \nwill of the American people, President Bush should listen to their plea \nand begin working with Congress to bring this tragic war to an end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am going to make even briefer remarks \nthan the Senator from Massachusetts did.\n  One of the questions I had been asked over the weekend was: Why \nhasn't the President already vetoed the supplemental appropriations \nbill? He promised he would veto the bill because it has all this extra \nspending in it, with directions on the war from people who really are \nnot even involved in administering the war.\n  Of course, what I found out is the bill has not even been sent to the \nPresident yet. He cannot veto a bill until he receives a bill. So to \nchastise him for not having already vetoed the bill when there is a \nhold card keeping him from being able to veto the bill I think is \nunconscionable. Hanging on to that bill and not getting it there so the \ndecisions can be made on it one way or the other just is not right. \nThat is not the way to run the Senate. It is not the way to run the \ncountry. And it is not the President's fault if he does not have the \nbill to make the decision.\n  There can be a lot of debate on what that decision ought to be made \nand how to carry them out. I am certain the President will veto the \nbill; he has been very clear on that. There is a differing philosophy \non how a war ought to be run. There are a lot of people throwing in the \ntowel. It is kind of hard to win at anything if your opponent knows the \npoint at which you are going to give up.\n  That is where we are in this battle, with the complete direction to \ngive up, to throw in the towel, to say what has been done over there \nhas not done any good, won't do any good, and to keep calling it a \ncivil war. It is not a civil war. It is a religious war that is \nbrewing. There is a tremendous difference. It is a religious war that \ninvolves the entire Middle East, not just Iraq. And in preparation, for \nwhat the other people in the Middle East have heard said on the Senate \nfloor, armies are gearing up in Saudi Arabia and Syria and Israel and \nIran, ready to move into the vacuum that would be caused by a U.S. \ndeparture.\n  That will not be the first time there has been a religious war in the \nworld. If we do not step in, it would probably be the first time we had \nthe chance to stop a religious war and did not help.\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\nSo we could leave, have a regional religious war, and then try to \ndecide what we are going to do about that.\n  Religious wars are not easy things to solve. We have seen that with \nKosovo with religious genocide. We got to see what happened in Kosovo. \nWe helped out in Kosovo just as we are helping in Iraq.\n  So, Madam President, I hope we would actually debate the Food and \nDrug Administration bill, which is what we were set out to do this \nweek. I hope people who have amendments would bring the amendments to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as we know, the supplemental passed \nlast Thursday. It is Tuesday today. So the comments I made were \ndirected to the fact that the President has announced he is going to \nveto it. I just wanted to comment about that issue.\n  Although we differ on that issue, we are together in wanting to get \nthe Senate to both debate and dispose of amendments. The afternoon is \nmoving along. We had statements yesterday from Senator Enzi and myself \non this legislation, spelling this out. We had an opportunity in our \ncaucus today--I imagine the Senator did as well--to go through the \ndetails of the legislation. So we have addressed many of the concerns. \nBut there are still some concerns that are out there, and this is an \nextremely important piece of legislation. So we are asking our \ncolleagues to come to the floor to let us know their amendments, to see \nif we can work those out. If not, we would like to have the debate on \nthose measures and let the Senate exercise its will. We are ready for \nthose amendments, and we urge our colleagues to bring them to our \nattention at the earliest possible time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business before addressing the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there have been comments on the floor \nabout the fact that in just 2 hours the President of the United States \nwill have an opportunity to sign or veto a bill which literally will \naffect the lives of 150,000 soldiers and their families, if not every \nAmerican. It is a bill that was passed by the House and Senate, with \nbipartisan votes in both bodies, and sent to the President. It fully \nfunds the troops in Iraq, giving them all the resources they need, and \nmore, so they can execute this war and their duties in a safe manner.\n  But it also does something significant; it starts to change the \nmission in Iraq. We are in the fifth year of this war. We have lost \n3,351 American lives. I respect very much the Senator from Wyoming. He \ntries to make a point that it is not a civil war. My understanding of a \ncivil war is when people of the same nation are at war with one \nanother.\n  That, sadly, is the reality of what is going on in Iraq today--Iraqis \nkilling one another while Americans stand in the midst of the \ncrossfire. Had the President of the United States come to this Congress \nin October of 2002 and suggested we send 150,000 soldiers into Iraq for \nthe purpose of refereeing a civil war or a religious war that had \nits origins in 14 centuries of anger, had he said to us we must stay as \nlong as 5 years and spend $500 billion and risk thousands of American \nlives, with no end in sight, what were the chances we would have passed \nthat resolution? None. That is not what the President told us.\n\n  He told us Iraq was a threat to the United States of America with \nweapons of mass destruction, and nuclear weapons, that somehow they had \nbeen in concert with al-Qaida, that led to 9/11. None of those things \nturned out to be true--not one of them.\n  On that basis, we authorized the President to go to war, and he \ndecided to take a preventive course of action--not preemptive but \npreventive course of action--and invade this country before they \nthreatened the United States. That is what we are in today.\n  Within 2 hours, the President will pick up a pen and have a chance to \nstart bringing this to an end. If he signs this bill we have sent to \nhim, it will mean that American soldiers can start coming home and \nthat, equally important, the Iraqis understand it is now their country, \ntheir war, and their future, that they have to put their lives on the \nline and not rely on the bravery of our soldiers to keep their country \nintact.\n  If the President vetoes this bill, exactly the opposite message goes \nto the Iraqis. Its message: Continue business as usual. Continue \nwaiting out the political opposition, not resolving your differences, \nreally allowing this religious or civil war to become even worse.\n  The month of April was the deadliest month for American soldiers this \nyear. We continue to see thousands of Iraqis killed each month in this \ncountry. The President, though he is limited in support for this \nposition, continues to argue that with just a few more American \nsoldiers, a little longer period of time, some more money, everything \nis going to get better. Many of us are skeptical. The American people \nbelieve--and I concur with their belief--we do need a timetable to \nstart bringing American troops home on a responsible, reasonable basis.\n  I hope the President will reconsider. I hope he will sign this bill. \nI hope the troops will be funded and the direction of this war will \nchange.\n  Madam President, this bill is for the Food and Drug Administration's \nreauthorization. This is an agency which is often overlooked. Madam \nPresident, $1.7 billion a year in a Federal budget is not a huge amount \nof money. There are many other agencies with less responsibility and \nmore resources. The Food and Drug Administration is responsible for \nreally determining the safety of so many things American families take \nfor granted: when you are buying food, when you are buying drugs, when \nyou are buying over-the-counter medicines. Many of the appliances you \nbuy really have to be tested to be safe by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. We count on this small agency to do a very big job and \na job that gets bigger by the year.\n  The bill that is before us is basically the law which authorizes the \nFood and Drug Administration to do its business. I am glad we brought \nit to the floor. I salute Senator Enzi on the Republican side and \nSenator Kennedy on the Democratic side for their leadership.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is an essential guardian of the \npublic's health and safety in America. In recent years, their \nreputation has been at risk because of incidents of drug safety \nproblems and questions about their independence. The FDA has been \nfaulted for neglecting its drug safety responsibilities and for failing \nto respond to concerns raised by its own drug safety specialists.\n  Experts have warned that the FDA does not have adequate authority to \npull dangerous drugs off the market, mandate changes in drug labels, or \nsanction drug companies that do not monitor drug safety.\n  The most glaring example of a drug safety problem is the handling of \nVioxx, a painkiller that was found to increase the risk of heart attack \nand stroke and was used by 20 million people across America. Merck was \naware--the company that made Vioxx--that product raised the risk of \ncardiovascular problems, and they continued to market it, nevertheless, \nlong before it stopped selling the drug in 2004. The episode has raised \nserious questions about FDA's ability to react quickly to signs of \nsafety problems with drugs already on the market.\n  Listen to what one of FDA's own drug safety experts said in testimony \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee. I quote:\n\n       I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is \n     incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx. We are \n     virtually defenseless.\n\n  That is quite a statement. It troubles me.\n  That concern of that individual does not stand alone. A survey of FDA \nscientists conducted last year by the Union of Concerned Scientists \nfound the following: 47 percent of FDA scientists said their FDA office \nis less effective than it was 5 years ago; nearly 40 percent said the \nFDA is not acting effectively to protect public health; more than one-\nthird of FDA scientists said FDA officials care more about approving \nnew drugs and devices than ensuring they are safe; and 15 percent\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\nsaid they personally have been inappropriately asked to exclude or \nalter information or conclusions for nonscientific reasons. That is a \nhorrible comment on an agency with the responsibility of the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  Our priority must be to take this reauthorization as an opportunity \nto change the FDA. The bill does that. It restores balance between \ntimely approval of innovative drugs and safety and effectiveness.\n  Problems with drug safety in recent years highlight the limits of \nFDA's ability to monitor and respond to safety problems that arise \nafter approval. Safety problems may not be detected prior to FDA \napproval because the clinical trials FDA relies upon often involve only \na few thousand people.\n  This bill, S. 1082, responds to this problem by making postapproval \nmonitoring of drugs a core responsibility of the FDA, strengthening and \nclarifying the tools it has to make their products safer. The bill \nrequires active monitoring for drug safety problems through the use of \nFederal and private databases. It creates a system for approving drugs \nwith a specific strategy for evaluating and mitigating their risks. It \npromotes greater transparency by disclosing information on clinical \ntrials.\n  These and other provisions in this bipartisan bill will help to \nrestore public confidence in the FDA. S. 1082 will help FDA fulfill its \ncrucial and complex mission. I look forward to supporting it.\n  One of the things most people do not realize is the major \nresponsibility the Food and Drug Administration has for the food we \neat.\n  Now, let me tell you at the outset, I am not capable, having served \non Capitol Hill for a few years, to describe to the people who follow \nthis debate what we call the food safety system in America. Imagine, if \nyou will, that we have 12 to 15 different Federal agencies responsible \nfor food safety. Imagine 30 different laws and legal standards for food \nsafety, 40 or 50 different committees on Capitol Hill with \njurisdiction, hundreds, if not thousands, of lobbyists and special \ninterest groups hovering over this whole scene. Add to that thousands \nof Government workers and bureaucrats who are protecting their turf, \nand we have a system that is virtually out of control--not just when it \ncomes to drugs, as important as they are, but when it comes to the food \nwe eat.\n  I thank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi and others for partnering \nwith me on an amendment which I will offer as soon as I am given the \ngreen light by the chairman and the ranking member on the issue of food \nsafety. I thank them for working with my staff for several months to \ncome up with language to the deal with some serious challenges.\n  For too long, we have gone without updating the resources and \nauthorities of the FDA in the area of food safety. I think our system \nhas broken down. Now is the time for an appropriate amendment to close \nsome of the gaps we have in our current system.\n  In the larger picture, I have been working on this issue for a long \ntime. I said, over 10 years ago, we need a single food safety system.\n  I see Senator Lieberman from Connecticut on the floor. His House \ncolleague, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, herself a victim of food \npoisoning at an early age, has been my ally in this effort. We believe \na single food safety system, based on science and not on politics, is \nthe only answer. We need to do that and do it soon.\n  The amendment which I am going to offer does not reach that level. It \ndoes not achieve all of the goals we wanted to on a legal basis, but it \nmoves us forward.\n  How important an issue is food safety? The Centers for Disease \nControl estimates that as many as 76 million people suffer from food \npoisoning each year. Thirty-two thousand Americans will be hospitalized \neach year for food poisoning; 5,000 will die. With emerging pathogens, \nan aging population, and an increasing volume of food imports, this \nsituation isn't going to improve without decisive action.\n  I agree with Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi that we should proceed \nwith the broad issue of food safety within general order, and I \nappreciate their willingness to work with me. The amendment is not what \nI hoped for in creating a single food safety agency, but it is a step \nforward.\n  The most recent news, of course, is about pet food, but believe me, \nit hasn't been that long ago when we talked about salmonella-\ncontaminated peanut butter and E. coli-contaminated spinach. If it \nseems as if these food crises are occurring more frequently, they are. \nWe may have the safest food supply in the world, but the fact is, every \nparent, every family wants to have peace of mind that when they buy \nsomething at the grocery store, they can put it on the table, feed it \nto their family, and no one will get sick. There are questions that are \nbeing raised almost on a daily basis about whether we can have that \nconfidence.\n  The issue that came up recently was on pet food. Batches of wheat \ngluten and rice protein concentrate contaminated with a chemical called \nmelamine were imported from China by several shipping companies. We \njust learned over the last few days from stories printed in the press \nthat melamine is regularly added to animal feed in China.\n  Why would they add a chemical called melamine to something they are \ngoing to feed to livestock? Well, it is a way to increase the value of \nthe product. If there is more protein in the feed, then they can charge \na higher price. When the food product is tested to see if there is \nprotein, you look for the presence of nitrogen. The chemical, melamine, \nwhen added, tests for higher nitrogen levels, therefore they argue \nhigher protein levels, therefore they argue they should be paid more. \nSo it is an economic fraud. They have argued that this is a product \nthat doesn't hurt people. We are not sure of that, but we do know that \nthe animals that died as a result of contaminated pet food, some of \nthem were found to have melamine in their system. It is a serious \nquestion as to whether it is toxic.\n  We know now that this pet food contamination has resulted in the \ndeaths of more than 4,000 animals across America. This contaminated \nproduct came into America without inspection or without suspicion. The \nFDA did not have a memorandum of understanding with China or a \ncertification that their standards for food safety were even close to \nthose of the United States. The product made its way from the importer \nChemNutra into various manufacturers of pet food. Menu Foods is a \nCanadian company. They make pet food under a dozen different labels. \nThey learned on February 20 there was a problem. How did they know \nthere was a problem? The cats and dogs told them. They stopped eating \ntheir food and they started getting sick.\n  So you own a company that has dozens of different pet food labels, \nand you notice that animals are getting sick. What is the responsible \nthing for a company to do at that time? Pull the product off the shelf \nand notify the Federal Government. They waited 3 weeks before they sent \nout a notification. By the time the Food and Drug Administration \nlearned about this, there were millions of cans of pet food and other \nproducts under different labels spread all across America with this \ncontaminated product. Three weeks they waited. Why? Because the law \ndoes not currently require them to report on a timely basis.\n  I asked the FDA last week: What is the penalty against Menu Foods for \nwaiting 3 weeks? They said: Well, we are considering. We are talking to \nour counsel. We will get back to you. Months have passed. Nothing has \nhappened. Menu Foods waited 3 weeks instead of reporting on a timely \nbasis. By then, the product was all across America.\n  In the case of rice protein concentrate, there is less certainty. \nImporter Wilbur Ellis purchased product from the Binzhou Futian Company \nin China. It then distributed the product to a host of companies that \nproduce pet food. These brands and labels have been recalled in a \nhaphazard way over the past 3 weeks--again, delays in reporting. The \nFDA has even refused to name several companies for more than a week \ntrying to get to the bottom of this investigation because the records \nprocess is so broken down at this agency.\n  One or more of the manufacturers sold some refuse pet food that it \nproduced using contaminated product to hog farms in California and \nother States. These farms fed their hogs the\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\ncontaminated feed, some of which was sold to consumers and much more of \nit has been quarantined and is slated for destruction.\n  In addition, we just learned this week that 38 poultry farms in \nIndiana received contaminated feed. So the plot thickens, and the \nsafety issue grows as we wonder if what was originally pet food is now \nbeing fed to livestock, and if humans consume the food what impact it \nwill have.\n  There is a mystery importer involved as well from China that we have \nheard about but we can't identify yet. Supposedly this second importer \npurchased rice protein from the Chinese firm in question in larger \nquantities than the firm Wilbur Ellis.\n  In terms of the investigation in China, the FDA said: We want to send \ninspectors to China to see what they are sending to us. Well, first the \nChinese said: We deny you the visas for your FDA inspectors. Imagine \nthat. Millions of dollars worth of foodstuffs coming in from China, \ncontaminated and poisoned, killing off pets, threatening human \nconsumption, and when we say to the Chinese that we want to take a look \nat their production facilities, they denied us visas. I joined with \nCongresswoman DeLauro and sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy, and \nthey reversed their position, offering the visas. We have to make it \nclear to China and every other country that if they want to do business \nwith the United States, they will do it on our terms when it comes to \nhealth and safety. We will never allow them to compromise the safety \nand health of American citizens in the process.\n  The amendment I am going to offer--and I hope it will be accepted--\ndoes several things based on what we have learned over the last 6 \nweeks. First, during this recall, consumers, veterinarians, and \nretailers, among others, expressed concern about the scope of the \nrecall, what products were included, or what not to feed to domestic \nanimals. The FDA was slow, uneven, and inconsistent in sharing \ninformation on the recall. While there are mechanisms in place to \nproactively track human food-borne illnesses and then share \ninformation, no similar system exists for companion animals.\n\n  I visited the FDA pet food recall Web site the day before the March \n12 Agriculture appropriations hearing and found a jumble of corporate \npress releases. It was virtually unintelligible. I said to the FDA: \nCan't you make this information clearer so consumers can have the \ninformation they need to purchase these products? They took it to heart \nand made the changes. That is good.\n  In addition, following the recall, the FDA checked the records of \ncompanies such as Banfield, the largest privately owned veterinary \nhospital chain in the United States. The records kept showed a \nstatistically significant increase in the instances of renal failures \nof cats. A system in place to track these events might have caught \nsomething like melamine earlier. So the amendment creates an early \nwarning and surveillance system for companion animals and directs the \nSecretary to work with professional organizations, veterinarians, and \nothers to disseminate information.\n  While we are at it, the amendment would direct the FDA, in cases of \nboth pet food and human food, to keep up-to-date, comprehensive, \nsearchable recall lists on their Web site.\n  Second, the amendment closes the gap that FDA itself identified in an \nearlier draft framework posted on its Web site in December of 2006. The \nguidances and practices that govern the pet food industry are currently \ngenerated by the American Association of Feed Control Officers, known \nas AAFCO. The guidelines on best practices and ingredient lists are \nupdated annually and implemented on a voluntary basis by manufacturers \nand State departments of agriculture. However, there is no requirement \nunder the law for States to adopt these practices, and they don't have \nthe force of Federal guidelines. Inspections are not coordinated State \nto State, and some States have different standards. While the FDA \nparticipates in the AAFCO process, it does not provide a list of \ningredients and additives. AAFCO's list is more comprehensive than the \nFDA's. Our amendment would direct the FDA to work with AAFCO and other \nstakeholders to give these guidelines the force of law.\n  Third, the amendment closes a loophole that this contamination has \nexposed with regard to our imports of food. The source of the \ncontamination we know of was wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate \noriginating in China. Neither shipment was inspected by the FDA. If you \nhave some peace of mind or belief that a Federal inspector is watching \nfood as it comes into the United States, the odds are 99 to 1 you are \nwrong. Only about 1 or 1.5 percent of all the shipments of food \nproducts coming into the United States are actually inspected.\n  As imports have increased the number of inspectors have decreased. \nThis is an indication of U.S. food imports by country. As you can see, \nthere have been dramatic increases in these fiscal years showing that \nthe amount of food coming into the United States is increasing in \nvolume. The number of inspectors who watch for this food to protect our \nfamilies and consumers across America just hasn't kept pace.\n  In 2003, the United States imported $45.6 billion worth of \nagricultural products--in 2003; today, $64 billion. Agricultural \nimports from China have almost doubled in that period of time, from \n$1.2 billion to $2.1 billion. Due to flat budgets and increasing \nresponsibilities, the overall number of FDA inspectors looking at these \nshipments and at domestic food processors has actually decreased from \n2003 to the present time; imports up, inspectors down.\n  Are we surprised at what has happened? The FDA doesn't have the \nresources or the authority to make sure what we are bringing in from \noverseas is safe. We need to tackle it in a larger bill.\n  What our amendment does is close the loophole by improving data \ncollection and reporting. It creates an FDA database of food \nadulterants that would be filled by FDA inspectors as well as importers \nof food. The extra series of data points would better pick out trends \nand help FDA do a better risk-based inspection job. It also creates a \nsystem in which adulterations are reported quickly so as to prevent \ncontamination from spreading. This would have helped in this most \nrecent case, but because of delays in reporting it led to an expansion \nof recalled product into dozens of different companies and got \nperilously close to the human food chain. The data would then be used \nby the Secretary to issue import alerts, blocking similar risky \nproducts.\n  I have also pursued a separate track on the issue of resources for \nFDA by sending a letter to Chairman Kohl of Wisconsin and Senator \nBennett of Utah requesting additional resources for food inspection at \nthe Food and Drug Administration. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nthat effort.\n  Also, I am filing an amendment that would authorize a study on user \nfees for food producers. It is vital that we explore various revenue \nstreams for the FDA in light of the shortage of resources they have for \ninspection.\n\n  The last two items in my amendment are a sense of the Senate and a \nclarification that companies are required to maintain records and make \nthem accessible to the FDA as part of an investigation. This latter \nitem would prevent delays that keep contaminations from being known as \nquickly as possible. In the case of recalled peanut butter this past \nwinter, an FDA report showed that inspectors were denied documents when \nthey were requested. The language would clarify that when the FDA makes \nthe inspection, it will have access to those documents needed for \npurposes of safeguarding the food supply.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate language goes beyond this amendment and this \nbill, stating that it is vital to update resources, direction, and \nauthorities of the FDA to better safeguard our food supply. The sense \nof the Senate directs the FDA to work with our trading partners to \nestablish cooperative agreements.\n  Several weeks ago, Robert Brackett, Director of the FDA's food arm, \nsaid:\n\n       These outbreaks point to a need to completely overhaul the \n     way the agency does business.\n\n  I am thankful the sponsors of this legislation for the \nreauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration understand that \nexpanding the scope of our debate on this bill to include food safety \nis overdue.\n  Mr. Brackett went on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\n\n       We have 60,000 to 80,000 facilities that we are responsible \n     for in any given year. We have to get out of the 1950s \n     paradigm.\n\n  Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine \nof FDA, which has jurisdiction for pet food, implied as much when he \nwas quoted last month as saying:\n\n       In this case, we're going to have to look at this after the \n     dust settles and determine if there is something from a \n     regulatory standpoint that we could have done differently to \n     prevent this incident from occurring.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. This is a situation where we need one food \nsafety agency, not driven by the politics of Washington but driven by \nscience, to make sure the food fed to our children, the food fed to our \npets, or any food served in America is as safe as possible. As we \nimport more food with fewer inspectors, the risk increases.\n  I might add that we have looked at the pet food contamination and \nothers from the aspect of greed and negligence. In the instance of \nChina, they were adulterating their product with a chemical so that it \nwas worth more in the marketplace. That is economic fraud. In the \ninstance of spinach and peanut butter, we are dealing with negligence--\nnegligence that results in a deadly product being sold across America. \nBut we can't stop there, unfortunately. In the world we live in, with \nthe vulnerabilities we have, food could also become a terrorist weapon. \nThat may sound far-fetched to some, but when Governor Tommy Thompson \nleft the Bush Cabinet, he said in parting that he found it hard to \nimagine why the terrorists had not attacked our food supply. He said he \nworried about it on a regular basis.\n  We have to have inspection standards in place that mitigate against \ngreed and negligence and the possibility of someone intentionally \ncontaminating our food supply, causing terrible suffering and death \nacross America.\n  That is why this amendment is a step in the direction for a safer \nfood supply. I sincerely hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill support my efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nable to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to encourage \nPresident Bush to go ahead and veto the supplemental appropriations \nbill that Congress has sent him this afternoon because of the language \nin that bill on Iraq that I consider to be bad for our troops and \ndangerous for our country.\n  The legislation that Congress has passed, in my opinion, represents \nthe worst of all worlds. As I have said before, if people feel the war \nin Iraq is lost, or if people feel it is not lost but not worth \nfighting for, then what they ought to do is act to end the war. This \nlegislation would do no such thing. It would not end the war in Iraq. \nIt will not require the withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq. It \nwill not cut off funding for the war in Iraq.\n  On the contrary, what this legislation proposes to do is something \nfar worse. It would handcuff our soldiers with an inflexible and \narbitrary set of restrictions--restrictions that would take life-and-\ndeath decisions about how, when, and where our troops can fight away \nfrom those troops and their commanders. It would substitute the \njudgment of politicians in Washington for the judgment of our military \ncommanders on the ground. That is wrong.\n  What is more, this legislation will impose on our soldiers in Iraq a \nbinding deadline of October 1, 2007--5 months from today--to begin \nwithdrawal. That withdrawal would be required to begin regardless of \nconditions on the ground, regardless of the recommendations of our \nmilitary leaders, regardless of the opinions of our allies in the \nregion--in short, regardless of reality--on October 1, 2007.\n  This is a deadline as arbitrary as it is inflexible. It is a deadline \nfor defeat--defeat for America and a defeat for the hopes of the \nmajority of the Iraqi people for a better, freer future.\n  I know we have heard from some supporters of this legislation that by \nordering a withdrawal we will encourage the Iraqis to make political \ncompromises. Where is the evidence of this?\n  According to the legislation this Congress has now sent to the \nPresident, the withdrawal must begin regardless of what the Iraqi \nGovernment does. Where, then, is the incentive for the Iraqis to \nreconcile? On the contrary, there is every reason to conclude this \nlegislation will have exactly the opposite effect that its sponsors \nclaim for it.\n  Listen to the latest National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, which \nhas been saluted by Members of this Chamber on both sides of the \nquestion of what to do now in Iraq. That latest National Intelligence \nEstimate predicted that a withdrawal of American troops in the months \nahead would ``almost certainly lead to a significant increase in the \nscale and scope of sectarian violence, intensify Sunni resistance, and \nhave adverse effects on national reconciliation.''\n  How do the supporters of this legislation explain that National \nIntelligence Estimate? For that matter, how do they justify this \nlegislation, in light of what we all heard directly from GEN David \nPetraeus, the commander of our forces in Iraq, when we spoke with him \nand he spoke with us last week?\n  General Petraeus told us very clearly that we have achieved progress \nsince our new strategy in Iraq--the so-called surge--began. Consider \nthe situation in Anbar Province to the West of Baghdad, which has \ndramatically improved. That has been documented not by representatives \nof the administration or people who support the current policy but on \nthe front pages of the New York Times and USA Today in the last few \ndays.\n  At a moment when Sunnis in Anbar are finally helping us in targeting \nal-Qaida terrorists, this legislation would require us to abandon them.\n  Madam President, what message are we sending to our friends and our \nfoes with this ill-advised legislation? We have heard from some that we \nneed to abandon Iraq because it is not part of the war on terror. But \nhere again, listen to General Petraeus, who is on the ground, one of \nthe most outstanding generals of our military that I have met since I \nhave been a Senator, confirmed unanimously by the Senate a short while \nago. Here is what General Petraeus warned us:\n\n       Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-Qaida's global \n     campaign against us.\n\n  Let me repeat that. General Petraeus said:\n\n       Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-Qaida's global \n     campaign against us.\n\n  If we withdraw, as this legislation would require us to begin to do, \nal-Qaida wins--the same al-Qaida that attacked America on September 11, \n2001, killing 3,000 innocents, the same al-Qaida that intends to attack \nus again, the same al-Qaida that has made very clear to us what its \nplans for domination and control of large sectors of the world are.\n  Madam President, the violence we are seeing in Iraq today, the \nsuicide bombings in Baghdad, the chemical weapons attacks in Anbar \nProvince, the targeted assassinations of Iraq's leaders--these are all \nprimarily the work of al-Qaida. So the big question, then, for me--and \nI ask my colleagues to consider it--is whether we respond to al-Qaida's \nterrorism by pulling out, as it hopes we do, and as this legislation \nwould require us to do--abandoning the future of Iraq, the Middle East, \nand ultimately our own American security, to the very people \nresponsible for the terrible atrocities and suicide bombings we see in \nIraq today.\n  The alternative to pulling out is standing up and fighting. That is \nwhat we are doing now in Iraq and doing with some success in Baghdad \nand Anbar Province. Rather than undermining General Petraeus and \nhanding al-Qaida a victory, Congress should take swift and responsible \naction to get General Petraeus and our troops in the field the support \nthey need to prevail.\n  The Iraq war is not lost. But if this supplemental became law, it \nwould be lost and America would suffer the consequences of that defeat \nfor generations.\n  President Bush, veto this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are still looking for amendments. It \nis true that there are probably four important areas where negotiations \nare going on with the principals in a bipartisan way, and progress is \nbeing made. It does seem to us that we ought to continue that progress. \nWe will describe in greater detail those procedures tomorrow.\n  We are urging our colleagues who have amendments to get in touch with \nus. We know this is complex legislation, but it is enormously \nimportant, and we have a lot of business in the Senate. Our leaders \nhave indicated that they wanted us to be ready to move ahead on \namendments. Senator Enzi and I are quite prepared to do so.\n  I understand the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, has an \namendment she is going to speak to and offer later on. We will look \nforward to her presence.\n  We want to again underline the importance that if Members have \namendments, notify us as soon as possible, so we can work on them and \naccept them if we can. We want to be able to conclude this legislation \nin a timely way in the not-too-distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis comments. I'll make a slight addition to what he said. For some, it \nmay not look as if there is a lot of progress being made, but I assure \nyou there is a lot of progress being made. One of the secrets to our \ncommittee operation--which used to be one of the most contentious \ncommittees in the Senate, and now it works productively on issues such \nas this to get things done--is that we recognize if somebody brings an \namendment to the floor and we have not heard about it before, it \ncreates difficulty. When the amendment is filed, we don't have a real \ngood process for amending an amendment. Technically, we can, but it \nrequires a lot of time and votes. In the meantime, it polarizes people. \nInstead, we take a look at them, talk about them, and we use the body \nof knowledge we have gained from a lot of hearings on the issue to show \nwhere there could be inconsistencies and problems with the amendment. \nWe get the problems ironed out so the amendment can have a logical \nchance for inclusion if it adds to what we are doing.\n  That is what is going on as we are speaking. The Kennedy staff and \nthe Enzi staff, and those Senators with amendments are meeting together \nand working out difficulties. We will accept many of them. Some of them \nare already in the substitute bill we have. So a lot of progress has \nalready been made on this bill. We want to get the remaining things \ncleared up. We would like to get it done tonight and tomorrow, if \npossible. I think we are getting a long way down the list now on \nproblems that people had with it, and we are getting those cleared up \nin a way that I think both sides can agree on.\n  So that is why this is not quite as controversial as some people \nmight expect or perhaps even want. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for all his cooperation on this and the \ntremendous effort of all the staff. We need people to come down with \namendments, particularly if they have something new that we have not \nheard about.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on this FDA bill that \nhas been brought forward by Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi. I begin \nby thanking them for their cooperative, collegial, and inclusive \napproach over the last couple of weeks to get this bill in a form that \nmakes it much more effective, accomplishing the goals we all have.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for a long time have been great \nadvocates of making sure we have a strong and effective FDA. Senator \nKennedy, of course, has been involved in this for many years and has \nplayed a huge role in the success of the FDA, which is, as we know, one \nof the extraordinarily successful agencies in the Federal Government. \nIt gives the American people confidence, when they go into a grocery \nstore and purchase food or when they go into a pharmacy and purchase a \npharmaceutical product or have a prescription filled, that they are \ngoing to receive goods which are safe and effective and that they are \nnot going to be at risk of harm as a result of adulteration, fraud, \nabuse, or misuse of those goods.\n  It is one of the most amazing successes of our Federal Government in \nthe area of protecting consumers. It arose out of the early 1900 period \nwhen there were serious issues relative to food safety in this country, \nand has evolved into clearly one of the finest agencies, not only in \nour Government but in the world. It is respected around the world as \nthe gold standard for protecting American citizens and citizens who use \nthe products made by American companies.\n  This bill builds on that success. I congratulate the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Wyoming for doing such a strong job \nof building on that success. This bill continues the effort to make \nsure we have a prompt but safe procedure for getting drugs approved in \nthis country, something called PDUFA, which basically allows drug \ncompanies to pay a fairly significant portion of the cost of the \napproval of new drugs, which has expedited dramatically the rate of \napproval of new drugs. That means pharmaceuticals and biologics come to \nthe market, which help people, which save lives, which basically makes \nlife better. That is the good news.\n  In addition, there is, for devices, the MDUFMA proposals, which deal \nwith devices, medical devices the way we deal with pharmaceuticals, \nsetting up a fee system for the approval of medical devices. This is \nsomething, when I was chairman of this committee, I had the good \nfortune to be involved in developing. These two initiatives are the \nessence of how we maintain a vibrant drug and medical device approval \nprocess in this country. It is absolutely critical they be \nreauthorized, and this bill does it in an effective way.\n  In addition, the bill takes on a number of other issues which are \ntimely and appropriate. The most significant, from my perspective, \nalthough there are a lot of significant ones here, is the issue of drug \nsafety and how we make sure the drugs which do come to the market are \nsafe. This involves not guesswork but finding out what the science is \nand what happens when people start using these drugs and medical \ndevices. The concept behind that in this bill is that we should set up \na regime that basically collects information from all sorts of \ndifferent sources. There are literally thousands of different sources, \nbut there are some very big ones that we develop information about the \nreactions people have when they take drugs. We have the tremendous \ndatabase of the Medicare system, for example. We have the tremendous \ndatabase of provider groups, such as the Kaiser Permanente fund out in \nCalifornia. These different provider groups have a huge amount of \ninformation on what is happening when somebody takes some form of \nmedication. But what happens is that information, although it is \ncollected, is not effectively screened and is not effectively \nevaluated.\n  What this bill does, essentially, is create a regime that allows us \nto more effectively, first, collect the data; second, when there are \nred flags popping up on that data that say there is a reaction here or \nreaction there or something occurs here that was not expected, that \ninformation becomes more visible under this regime and more available; \nand then, third, if it is clear there is something that is not going \nright here, that there is a series of aberrations nobody expected, then \nit sets up a process where we take that information out and we give it \nto selected groups of specialists in the academic and private world who \nhave the ability to evaluate that information and tell us what is going \non.\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n  There are centers at MIT and I believe at Duke, for example, that do \nexactly this. The idea, of course, is to first collect the information \neffectively; second, make sure when those aberrations or red flags \nstart to show up they are noted; and, third, when there is a certain \ncritical mass of information that reflects something that may not be \ncorrect or is out of kilter, it makes sure we have that information \nevaluated in a very science-based, professional way by people who \nspecialize in this and who have the ability to do it--something which \nFDA does not have the resources, necessarily, to do right now.\n  With that information in hand, with that science in hand, then you \ncan make decisions. This bill creates a new regime for making those \ndecisions--as to what a company must tell people or tell providers when \nthey are using these different drugs and medications. But it will be a \nscience-based decision, and that is the key here. All of this will key \noff of science that is hard and that is effectively reviewed and \nevaluated in order to come to the conclusion that certain actions must \nbe taken in how you distribute this medication and how you communicate \nwhat the implications of this medication are. So this new safety and \nsurveillance regime, which is known as mining the information, and then \npulling it together and taking advantage of it, validating it and \nintegrating it--this new regime is at the essence of the safety \nconcerns which are involved in this bill.\n  It is very positive. It opens a new world of review in the area of \npharmaceuticals and medicines, a postmarket review process which will \nbe based on science and which will be very healthy to the system as a \nwhole. I congratulate and thank both Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi \nfor evolving this process in this bill.\n  In addition, there is the pediatric language in this bill. There is \nthe BSE program, which is the program which basically rewards companies \nthat are willing to go out and do extra research to see how a drug \nmight affect a child. Historically, drugs will be brought to the market \nand you would never know--because all the clinical exams have been done \non adults--how they would affect children. Some of these drugs, \nobviously, if given to a child, could have a significant negative \nimpact and, if given in the wrong doses, might have an extraordinarily \nadverse effect. Some could actually be very positive if given in the \nright dosage. So it became a guessing game as to when these \npharmaceuticals, when these medications, were good for children, in \nmany instances. As a result, doctors and prescribers simply didn't know \nwhether to make them available, in many instances, to children.\n\n  This BSE pharmaceutical procedure said essentially, We will give you, \nthe producer of this pharmaceutical, of this medication--we will give \nyou an extra 6 months of exclusivity in exchange for your testing this \nand making sure it will work effectively, or finding out if it will not \nwork effectively, on children. The practical effect of that, of giving \nthat incentive, has been that hundreds of new drugs have been made \navailable to children which were not available before. This has had a \nvery positive impact on children and the ability of children to get \npharmaceuticals.\n  With the BSE program, we also developed a program called the \nPediatric Research Equity Act, which essentially takes the opposite \napproach from the BSE program. It creates a mandate where, in certain \ninstances, certain medications have to be tested on children. They have \nto go through a process of seeing if they will work for children. The \ntwo together basically work in tandem and the idea is they will feed \noff of each other, and you will create an atmosphere out there where \nthe two different approaches--one basically being a carrot and the \nother being a stick--will lead to better medications being available \nfor children.\n  It has worked amazingly well. The key to this, of course, is to keep \nthese two in tandem. In order to accomplish that, they both, in my \nopinion--and fortunately in the opinion of the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the committee now, at least--have to be on the same \nwavelength. They have to be dealt with the same way relative to things \nsuch as their sunsets, when they get reviewed and when they don't get \nreviewed, because if you were to have one sunsetted at a different time \nthan the other or one sunset and the other not sunset, you wouldn't get \nan effective review of the two together, and they both work, as I said, \ntogether.\n  This bill makes sure they are treated the same way in that area, and \nthat is a major step in the right direction toward making sure children \nget proper pediatric care. There is still going to be an issue \ntomorrow, I understand, on exclusivity, which is going to be brought up \nby another Senator; that is, the length of the exclusivity that is \nnecessary in order to get pharmaceutical companies to pursue proper \nresearch on children is an issue. But I happen to think what we have \nnow has been shown to work, and why fix something that is not broken, \nin my opinion. So I believe we should stay with what we have for the 6-\nmonth exclusivity period.\n  In addition, there are a number of other issues floating around this \nbill. This bill, obviously being a major health care bill, attracts a \nlot of other concerns. One of them that I have filed as an amendment--\nbut I don't intend to bring it up unless we move into the issue of \nreimportation, which may be brought up on the floor--is the question of \nsafety of Internet pharmacies. I believe very strongly, when somebody \ngoes on line and purchases a pharmaceutical product over the Internet--\nwhich is happening more and more often as people become more \ncomfortable with dealing with the Internet on a variety of different \nlevels, but certainly senior citizens as people age into their senior \ncitizenship years who had been dealing with the Internet for quite a \nfew years and are comfortable with it--I believe it is critical we have \nin place a system which allows people, when they look at the site on \nthe Internet, to know whether that Internet pharmacy is selling the \nproduct they say they are selling and whether the product they say they \nare selling has received FDA approval.\n  The problem we have here is a lot of these pharmacies will represent \nthat they are selling some sort of pharmaceutical good and it turns out \nthat product is, in many cases, adulterated or inappropriately made, in \nwhich case people end up getting a pharmaceutical product which is bad \nfor them. In some cases it can actually lead to death. So it is \ncritical that we have a way so when somebody goes on the Internet and \nlooks at a site on the Internet, they know that Internet pharmacy they \nare looking at is legitimate and the products they sell are legitimate \nand have been through the FDA approval process.\n  In order to accomplish that, we need to set up a whole new regime, \nbasically, and we need to pay for it. This amendment which I have put \nin accomplishes that. It essentially gives the FDA the authority to \nreview pharmacy sites on line, to meet with the people who have set up \nthose sites, to make sure to set up a certification process where they \nare guaranteed the sites are meeting the conditions of selling \npharmaceutical products or medications which have met the FDA approval, \nand then to put sort of a Good Housekeeping seal on that site, which is \ntamperproof, which says this site has FDA-approved products. It would \nbe a huge step forward in safety for American citizens using Internet \npharmacies.\n  It is complicated, though, in its enforcement. It is simple to state \nbut complicated to enforce because it means the FDA needs the resources \nto deal with these sites and also to deal directly with these \npharmaceutical Internet sales places which may be somewhere other than \nthe United States. Second, you have to have in the United States a \npoint at which you can deal with the site if something goes wrong, a \nresponsible representative on the ground in the United States who has \nthe economic wherewithal to basically bond the site, for all intents \nand purposes.\n  Setting up that type of regime will be expensive. The language of \nthis amendment puts in place a fee system which allows that to be paid \nfor so we can be assured that the FDA has the resources necessary to \nreview these sites and accomplish this goal of making sure these \nInternet pharmacy sites are safe for Americans to use. I think this \nwould be a tremendous step forward in safety for all Americans, \nespecially as we move toward a much more\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nInternet-oriented purchasing process in this country.\n  Another issue which is going to be discussed here, and which I \nunderstand from the chairman may be held over for conference or come \ninto play in some area, is a crucial issue of follow-on biologics or \nsimilar biologics.\n  We know we can produce a generic pharmaceutical and do it with a fair \namount of predictability. We know that if a generic company brings on a \npharmaceutical product which has run its course, it has proper patent \ncoverage, that that generic is going to be safe and effective and be \nessentially the same thing as the pharmaceutical because they are \nchemical compounds.\n  In the biologics area, this is not the case because you are dealing \nwith a much more complex process of producing the biological \nmedication. It is a fermentation process, it involves proteins, it \ninvolves mutation of proteins, which depends to a great extent on a \nhuge number of factors which are very uniquely identified with the way \nthat that vat of medication was evolved through the process.\n  Anyone who has been to one of these facilities can see how complex it \nis to maintain consistency, even within the facility that is producing \nthe medication. If you stepped out of that facility and tried to \nreproduce that medication, the complexities would even be more \ndifficult to replicate.\n  It is critical that as we move into this biologic area, we understand \nwe are not dealing with generic pharmaceuticals. You know, when you put \nthe title ``generic pharmaceuticals'' on something that is sort of a \nmotherhood term, that is a good idea. It is a good idea if it works. \nBut if you put the generic title on biologics, you are probably going \nto mislead a lot of people and, in the process, potentially produce \nmedicines which can be extremely harmful or could not accomplish the \npurposes.\n  So as we move down this road of looking at biologics and how we give \nthe opportunity to produce similar biologics to people after the patent \nlife has run, we have to be very careful that we don't oversimplify the \nexercise in the name of getting something, as ``motherhoodish'' as \ngenerics; rather, we have to make sure we put in place a process which \nallows those biologics, when they are produced as similar biologics, to \nhave been properly reviewed to be sure they accomplish what they claim \nthey are going to accomplish.\n  This means that almost in every instance of an individual biologic, \nyou are going to have to have clinical trials for the similar biologic. \nThere are going to be very rare instances where you can actually bring \nto the market something that doesn't go through clinical trials in this \narea, in my opinion, and you have to be very sure that you demonstrate \nsafety and effectiveness of the similar product before you step into \nthis arena of awarding the authority to go ahead and sell that product \nin the market generally.\n  You will also need very aggressive postmarket surveillance in this \narea because you do not know, in many instances--you hope you know, but \nyou do not necessarily know--how individuals will react to taking this \ntype of medication, which is developed as a similar medication, as \nversus the basic medication which is trying to be replicated.\n  This area of biologics is a complex one. It should not be rushed \ninto. I know there is a great desire to step forward and say: We have a \nhuge victory for the American people, we can now have generic \nbiologics. But if we rush into this exercise and create a process with \napproval which does not adequately account for the significantly, the \nexponentially more complex process of bringing online a biologic when \ncompared to a chemical pharmaceutical, then we will not have done our \njob as policy people but will simply have given ourselves a good press \nrelease and in the end probably have given ourselves a very dangerous \nprocess relevant to protecting the American people in the area of \nbiologics.\n  As we move down this road of generics, I do hope we will move in a \nway that understands there is a significant difference in \npharmaceuticals and that those differences are going to require a much \nmore detailed and a much more complex approval process than we \npresently have in moving in the generic pharmaceutical area.\n  Those are some of the concerns I have relative to other issues that \nmight be brought up in this bill. But I do again wish to congratulate \nthe Senator from Wyoming, I wish to congratulate the chairman from \nMassachusetts for once again bringing to the floor a very strong piece \nof legislation, which will significantly improve the capacity of the \nFDA to continue its extraordinary record of protecting the American \npeople relevant to food and drug safety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, for the tremendous effort he put into this bill. \nHe spent years on the committee. He became chairman of the committee. \nHe used those years with the institutional memory and the experience \nwith a great deal of diligence and creativity which he has always used \non that committee to provide us with fuller explanations and wording \nfor several of the provisions that are in this bill.\n  I thank him for helping us to perfect those and the diligence he \nalways has on all of the issues we bring up in the committee. I also \nappreciate the work he has done on Internet safety. This is not \nsomething he just developed now. He has been working on it for at least \n3 years that I am aware, to make that as safe a system as possible if \nwe ever have to put it into place.\n  I am hoping we will not have to have that full debate at this time \nand appreciate his submitting it in case we need to have that debate.\n  I also appreciate the explanation he gave on the follow-on biologics. \nIt is a hard thing for people on the committee who have been through a \nnumber of hearings to understand. I am sure the public as a whole has \nan even greater difficulty with it. But it is a whole new phase of \nmedications. By the name, ``biologics,'' it is alive. That makes it a \nlot more complicated than a set of chemicals that are ground up and put \ntogether in a particular order. Even with the chemicals that are ground \nup and put together in a particular order, if they aren't done quite \nright, they would not dissolve and people do not get any benefit from \nthem. That is why we are doing the bill. Then we will be working on \nbiologic similars to see if there is some way that that can be done \neffectively and safely. I thank the Senator for his comments and his \ntremendous work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would add a note of thanks to the \nSenator as well. We are strongly committed to information technology, \nthe use of information technology eventually. We have that on our list. \nWe passed it unanimously through this body a couple of years ago, but \nthe House didn't act and we are going to act further.\n  But what we are talking about in the database, which the Senator from \nNew Hampshire talked about, is using the information technology and \ndatabase in terms of the postmarketing or approval surveillance. This \nmakes a great deal of sense. That is a key aspect of safety in the \nlegislation. The Senator from New Hampshire is very interested in \nshaping that.\n  The second is to make sure we are going to bring the latest \ninformation on drug safety to the consumers; that is more scattered at \nthe present time than it should be.\n  We have accepted the recommendation of Senator Gregg to include one \nwhat they call portal in the Internet to make sure that that \ninformation will be collected and available to the consumers on safety, \nwhich is a useful addition. So these are important. I thank him for his \nstrong support for this legislation. This is very helpful.\n  Now we are beginning to see, we have got broad support on our side \nand on both sides of the aisle for this legislation. We are working \nhard to clear up some of the--still a few of the outstanding items, but \nwe are moving ahead. We want to indicate to our colleagues again that \nwe want to try and respond to many of their amendments, but we want to \ndo it in a timely way. We were in here yesterday afternoon with the \npresentation. We welcomed suggestions during the course of the evening \nlast night, and we have done so during the course of the day. We are \nmoving along we hope that anyone who\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\nhas any other further amendments would be in close touch with us \nbecause we are giving every opportunity to our colleagues to make any \nrecommendations they have or would like to move along to conclusion at \na reasonably swift time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1004\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Taking that advice to heart, Mr. President, I call up \namendment No. 1004.\n  I would like to speak about that amendment now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1004.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Food and Drug Administration to permit the \nsale of baby turtles as pets so long as the seller uses proven methods \n                    to effectively treat salmonella)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n              TITLE __--DOMESTIC PET TURTLE MARKET ACCESS\n\n     SEC. __. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle Market \n     Access Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that also carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regiment that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat these turtles for salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Food and \n     Drug Administration shall not restrict the sale by a turtle \n     farmer, or wholesaler commercial retail seller of a turtle \n     that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a pet if--\n       (1) the State or territory in which such farmer is located \n     has developed a regulatory process by which pet turtle \n     farmers are required to have a State license to breed, hatch, \n     propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, transport, export, or \n     sell pet turtles or pet turtle eggs;\n       (2) such State or territory requires certification of \n     sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian who is licensed \n     in the State or territory, and approved by the State or \n     territory agency in charge of regulating the sale of pet \n     turtles;\n       (3) the certification of sanitization requires each turtle \n     to be sanitized or treated for diseases, including \n     salmonella, and is dependant upon using the Siebeling method, \n     or other such proven method, which uses an antibiotic to make \n     the turtle salmonella-free; and\n       (4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the possibility that salmonella can re-colonize in \n     turtles;\n       (ii) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iv) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, as the turtle may \n     become an invasive species to the local community, but should \n     instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or \n     other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted \n     as pets.\n       (b) FDA Review of State Protections.--\n       The Food and Drug Administration may, after providing an \n     opportunity for the affected State to respond, restrict the \n     sale of a turtle only if the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services determines, that the actual implementation State \n     health protections described in subsection (a) are \n     insufficient to protect consumers against infectious diseases \n     acquired from such turtles at the time of sale.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This amendment, I will discuss briefly at this time, \nand then according to the leaders on how they would like to go ahead \nand proceed with these amendments, it can be voted on at another time.\n  Mr. President, sometimes we offer amendments that affect large \nindustries and millions and millions of people in large industries. \nSometimes they are smaller industries but very important industries \nthat we have to stand for as well.\n  One of them is a small, relatively small industry in my State. That \nis the industry of turtle farmers who grow and produce and trade and \nsell turtles to be used in a variety of different ways. One of the ways \nis by selling them for pets. In 1975, the FDA banned the sale of small \nturtles for pets domestically but allowed those sales to continue \ninternationally.\n  So there is a group of farmers, turtle farmers, in Louisiana \nparticularly, but I am sure there are others around the country, who \nhave maintained their business by selling overseas. Recently, because \nof the competition and development of overseas markets, they are \ngetting very constricted in what they can sell because they have now \ngotten competition from the countries in which most of these sales \noccur.\n  There has been a great deal of pressure to try to reopen the domestic \nmarket. That is what this amendment will do. It will open a domestic \nmarket again because the science has caught up with the regulations. We \nnow have developed a vaccine, universally-tested and proven, that can \nkeep those small turtles nearly free of salmonella, and with the right \nlicensing procedures this amendment calls for and the right information \nthat is required when these turtles are sold for pets, either to a \nwholesaler or retailer or to a family who might purchase them, I \nbelieve the safeguards are in place, as the science and technology have \ncaught up with the problem.\n  There are many wonderful aspects about technology. Sometimes we can \nthink our way through a problem. That is basically what has been done \nover the last 35 years. I am proud of the role that LSU, Louisiana \nState University, has played in developing these treatments. I am proud \nthe industry survived through a very difficult time and proud they are \nnow proposing very strict rules and regulations.\n  I might add that when this ban went into place for this particular \nreptile, there was no such ban for other reptiles that also can carry \nsalmonella, which are still continuing to be sold on the domestic \nmarket. So on behalf of this industry, which is small but important, \nmainly in Louisiana, and I am certain there are turtle farmers in many \nplaces, I offer this amendment to repeal this 1975 ban in light of the \nnew technology and new opportunities that are out there to give \nprotection to our general public.\n  That is the essence of the amendment. I would like to set it aside \nnow and speak to it at a later time when votes are scheduled.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  We are reviewing the proposal. I understand the State of Louisiana \nhas had a very strong regulatory process in terms of safety, which has \nbeen recognized and commended for some period of time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator is correct, because I \nunderstand, as I am learning more about this industry, it is more \nrobust in the State of Louisiana than elsewhere. So I think our \nlegislature has put the appropriate restrictions, licensing, \ninformation, as well as keeping the research going, that could develop \nthe appropriate ways to treat these reptiles so we can maintain an \nindustry, allow people to make a living, and keep our population safe \nas well.\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. We are reviewing the \nproposal. We will work very closely with the Senator, and we will be \nback in touch making a recommendation, working with her. We thank the \nSenator very much.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1082, the Food and \nDrug Administration Revitalization Act.\n  This legislation addresses many critical issues, including the need \nfor provide proper incentives and support for the development and \nreview of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, including products for \nchildren, and the need for heightened efforts to assure the safety of \nmedications.\n  As we debate this legislation, let us remember we all have the same \ngoals in mind.\n  We want Americans to benefit from life-saving, life-enhancing drug \nand device products.\n  We want Americans to have access to drugs that are safe and \neffective.\n  We want Americans to have all the relevant safety information \navailable on their drugs.\n  And, indeed, we want Americans to know that the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the agency responsible for ensuring drug and device \nsafety, has the resources to do its job.\n  That is what this bill is all about protecting Americans and giving \nthe FDA the tools to do its job.\n  The legislation before us reauthorizes both the Prescription Drug \nUser Fee Act, better known as PDUFA, and the Medical Device User \nModernization Fee Act, better known as MDUFMA.\n  It is of critical importance that both programs be authorized by the \nend of the fiscal year. This legislation embodies the agreements \nreached by both industries and the FDA, along with refinements added by \nthe Congress.\n  Let me make clear that I am supportive of these reauthorizations. It \nis fair to say that I had reservations about PDUFA when it was enacted \nin 1992, questioning the wisdom of whether an industry should be \nrequired to support a governmental function. To a certain extent, I \nstill have those reservations. That being said, it has become \nabundantly clear that there are not the resources in the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill to support these review functions absent a user \nfee, and thus I recognize their necessity.\n  With regard to MDUFMA, I have been particularly concerned about the \nimpact that user fees could have on small medical device manufacturers, \nmany of which are located in Utah. Indeed, I am proud that there are \nover 100 medical device companies in Utah, companies that represent the \nbest in American innovation. They are true world leaders in their \nindustry.\n  The changes made in the last reauthorization at my request, along \nwith the new structure of the user fee in FDARA and the improved \ntrigger provision satisfy me that the manufacturers are being fairly \ntreated by the user fee program in this bill. And, indeed, this is a \nserious concern.\n  In February of 2006, the Lewin Group prepared a report for the FDA \nentitled ``Medical Device Industry Perspectives on MDUFMA. That report \nrevealed that senior industry experts felt FDA is generally doing an \nexcellent job in premarket regulation of medical devices and that the \nindustry was generally supportive of the purpose and goals of MDUFMA. \nHowever, key among the findings was the fact that the industry \nperceived little or no evidence of attaining the main intent of the \nprogram or in realizing a favorable return on investment from user \nfees. In fact, whenever I return to Utah to meet with medical device \nexecutives, I hear the same concern. And it is a concern I share.\n  Indicative of that concern is the astounding fact that 70 percent of \nresponding device manufacturers perceived that MDUFMA goals have not \nresulted in meaningful improvements in either the predictability or \ntimeliness of reviews. In fact, when I reviewed the device approval \ntimes, I understood those concerns. For some classes of devices, FDA \nhad made great progress. For others not. This was disturbing to me, \nsince we would all hope that progress would have been made across the \nboard.\n  It is my hope with the new fee structure embodied in S. 1082, we will \nmake better progress in achieving the approval time goals. I am pleased \nthat Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi included provisions at my \nrequest which make certain the fees for smaller companies are \naffordable.\n  Let me turn to the issue of direct-to-consumer advertising, or DTC. \nThis is an issue on which our colleague, the senior Senator from \nKansas, Mr. Pat Roberts, has shown great leadership, both in the HELP \nCommittee, and here in the Senate Chamber. Senator Roberts has led the \ncharge to eliminate the 2-year moratorium on prescription advertising \nfor newly approved drugs. He has expressed constitutional concerns \nabout such a moratorium. I share those concerns. He is right to bring \nthis up.\n  In general, I believe we should be guided by a very simple rule. \nAdvertising about products the FDA regulates should be truthful and not \nmisleading.\n  I do understand the arguments that some in this body make with \nrespect to pharmaceutical advertising. Some nights, when I watch \ntelevision, those ads do become tiresome. But I could say that about a \nlot of ads.\n  Some have argued we need to be particularly careful about what \npharmaceutical advertising is allowed, because we have limited \nknowledge about drugs, especially when they come on the market.\n  Those who make such arguments fail to recognize that FDARA will \nguarantee that consumers have access to greater clinical and safety \ninformation about medications because it gives the FDA more authority \nto review and react to drug safety data. User fees created by S. 1082 \nwill bolster the FDA office responsible for reviewing drug \nadvertisements.\n  The FDA has told my office and others that drug manufacturers \ncooperate fully with the FDA when a concern is raised about an \nadvertisement. That would be my preference for how these ads should be \nhandled.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to address this issue and I am \nencouraged by recent discussions involving the Senator from Kansas and \nothers members of the Senate HELP Committee.\n  The bill's drug safety provisions are probably its most important \ncomponent. Indeed, shortly after the Institute of Medicine issued its \nreport on this issue, we all began to see a floor of letters in support \nof efforts to improve the drug safety program.\n  Members of the HELP Committee undertook serious discussions on how to \naddress the problems that have been identified, and the result is this \nlegislation developed by Senator Enzi and Chairman Kennedy. The Enzi-\nKennedy bill has benefited from the guidance of our colleagues, former \nChairman Gregg and Senator Burr, who have pointed out the necessity for \nmore flexibility in determining when a risk evaluation \nmitigation plan--or REMS--is needed. Senator Coburn added greatly to \nthe discussion by raising issues relating to the access of our \nconstituents in rural areas to needed pharmaceuticals.\n\n  I believe the product of these discussions strikes the appropriate \nbalance. It requires, for example, that determining whether the FDA \nshould further assess the safety of a drug should be based on \nscientific evidence. To me, that is probably the most integral part of \nthis bill--when concerns are raised about drugs, these concerns must be \nbased on scientific evidence and not on innuendos or hearsay. This \napproach allows proper evaluation of relevant information and gives the \nFDA greater authority to warn consumers when there are problems.\n  In addition, the drug safety title strengthens the FDA's existing \nauthority to monitor drugs once they have been approved by making it \nclear that evaluation must occur before and after approval. One of the \nmost important components of this legislation is that more drug safety \ninformation will be made more available to the public. I believe that \nis an important victory for the American consumer.\n  I also want to take a few minutes to talk about the pediatric testing \nand research provisions included in this bill.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\nI have supported both the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the \nPediatric Research Improvement Act. In fact, I have supported these \nefforts since our former colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, \nbrought the need for additional pediatric testing of prescription drugs \nto our attention during consideration of the FDA Modernization Act of \n1997. He fought long and hard to encourage drug companies to conduct \nclinical trials on pediatric uses of their drugs. His efforts paid off \nand this program has been extremely successful.\n  My good friend and colleague from Connecticut, subcommittee Chairman \nChris Dodd, has also shown great leadership on this issue when FDAMA \nwas being considered in 1997. He held a hearing on this issue earlier \nthis year with his ranking Republican member, Senator Lamar Alexander. \nThat hearing was very insightful and I believe that many of us are \ntrying to do the right thing as we reauthorize both programs.\n  I urge my colleagues not to lose sight of the purpose of these two \nprograms as we make decisions on this part of the bill. We want good, \nsolid information about the safest way to prescribe drugs for children. \nAnd by giving companies market exclusivity to conduct clinical trials, \nwe will know the safest dosage levels for children. So let us not lose \nsight of the original propose of these programs--to help children have \nthe safest dosages for prescriptions. I am hopeful that we will be able \nto work out our differences on these provisions on these very important \nissues.\n  Food safety is another issue that is on nearly everyone's mind these \ndays. When I was a kid, we were always told to eat our spinach so we \ncould grow muscles like Popeye. Peanut butter is almost a staple for \nmost Americans. And yet these ordinary, common foods have harmed rather \nthan helped. Pets are getting sick and we have discovered that their \nfood has been contaminated. Something needs to be done.\n  I have worked with Senators Kennedy, Enzi, Durbin and Allard to \nfigure out a constructive approach to these important issues. I think \nthat we have made a lot of progress and I look forward continuing those \ndiscussions as the bill progresses toward enactment.\n  One factor that is not discussed enough is the need to appropriate \nmore funding for inspectors and inspector training, especially abroad. \nI can recall over a decade though when Jim Phillips, a former \ninvestigator for the FDA, brought to our attention the woefully lacking \nFDA resources for foreign inspections. We were shocked then, and \nunfortunately, we are shocked now.\n  Today, only one percent of imported food is inspected. I believe this \nissue needs to be carefully reviewed by Congress so people no longer \nhave to worry about whether food for them or their pets is safe.\n  I offered and withdrew an amendment during the HELP Committee \nconsideration of this bill that would address another important issue. \nMy amendment had several provisions which encouraged innovation and \ndevelopment of safe antibiotics, required the FDA to convene a meeting \nto determine how the Orphan Drug Act should be applied to antibiotics, \nand reauthorized the grant programs for the Orphan Drug Act. Finally, \nmy amendment provided for a 5-year exclusivity for enantiomers of \npreviously approved racemic drugs if and only if, one, they are \napproved for new therapeutic uses and, two, a completely new data set \nhas been created for approval of this enantiomer. It is my expectation \nthat our current discussions on these provisions will lead toward their \nadoption later in the week.\n  I also want to point out that there have been many discussions on \nways to ensure that citizens' petitions do not unfairly delay generic \ndrug approvals. I believe this is a problem, although I do not believe \nit is of a magnitude as some would suggest. I do not oppose making \nchanges to ensure that any abuses in this area are stopped, as long as \nFDA still has the ability to do the appropriate scientific and legal \nreview of abbreviated new drug approval applications in the timeframe \nit desires.\n  Let me turn now to one provision which is not in the bill: language \nauthorizing a pathway for the Food and Drug Administration to approve \ncopies of biologics. This is commonly referred to as the \n``biosimilars,'' ``biogenerics,'' or ``follow-on biologics'' \nlegislation. Senator Gregg spoke so well about this subject just a few \nminutes ago.\n  While language on this issue is not included in the bill we consider \ntoday, I want to make perfectly clear that it is my intention to work \ntoward development of an acceptable compromise that can be included in \nthe final version of FDARA and signed into law. It is my hope Senators \nwill refrain from offering any amendments on this issue until we have \ntime to develop consensus. And I do believe consensus can be developed \nwithout delay. It is my intention to do so.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I am the Hatch of Hatch-Waxman. I have a \nserious interest in making certain the law Chairman Waxman and I \ndeveloped in 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act, is used as the basis for development of legislation to \nprovide an abbreviated pathway for approval of follow-on biological \nproducts. In so doing, we must make certain we include the appropriate \nincentives for development of those products. Indeed, that is my high \npriority.\n  By any estimate, the Hatch-Waxman law has done consumers tremendous \ngood by fostering today's modern generic drug industry. It has saved \npatients literally billions of dollars. Similarly, using it as a basis \nfor development of a pathway for follow-on biologics will help \nconsumers with access to the innovative, life-affirming biologic \nproducts. But in so doing, we must be mindful of the fact that we need \nto encourage and nurture the innovation that provides the biologics \nthat the generic companies seek to copy. This is a tremendously \ncomplicated task, but it is one worth doing.\n  In 1984, when Chairman Waxman and I undertook a series of \nnegotiations that led to approval of the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act, it was a very different time.\n  There were no cell phones, no DVDs, almost no one had a personal \ncomputer, and a stamp cost 20 cents\n  It was a much less complicated time. Generic drugs were a small, \nstruggling industry, with no discernible footprint in the \npharmaceutical world. The innovators had yet to respond to their first \nparagraph IV certification. In 1984, brands versus generics largely an \nAmerican endeavor. Today, the pharmaceutical market--both innovator and \ngeneric--is an international marker--for research, development and \nmarketing.\n  Biological products were not an issue in 1984. Today, they are \nbecoming an increasingly larger part of pharmaceutical spending.\n  It is my strong belief that we can learn from this experience and \nbuild another solid law that will help consumers--both by supporting \nthe incentive to discover and develop new biologics, and by fostering a \nclimate that will lead to lower prices. This is a classic win-win \nsituation.\n  And why is that so important?\n  A February report by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \npaints the picture very well: America's health care spending in the \nnext 10 years will double to $4.1 trillion. Or, to look at it another \nway, that is 20 cents out of every dollar spent. We spend about $7,500 \nper capita on health care in the U.S. Yet in 2016, that will rise to an \nastounding $12,800 per person. Greater spending for pharmaceuticals is \nexpected to fuel much of the increase, the report's authors concluded.\n  And there it is in a nutshell. The good news and the bad news.\n  Not much worries Congress more than the costs of medical care--both \nfrom the perspective of a balanced budget, and from the view of our \nconstituents' pocketbooks.\n  In many ways, it is an embarrassment of riches.\n  We have exciting new therapies to treat our medical ills--new drugs, \nnew devices, stem cell treatments. Their potential to improve human \nhealth and well-being is almost limitless.\n  And yet the cost of those treatments, the impact they have on the \nbudget, at times seems equally limitless. In fact, in 2005, \nprescription drug spending was estimated at $214 billion, a healthy \namount by anyone's measure. That same year, spending on biologics was \nestimated at $32 billion.\n  Since biologicals are generally more expensive products, ways to \nreduce their costs interest policymakers and\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nother stakeholders in expenditure of the health care dollar, foremost \namong them employers, insurers, pharmacy benefits managers, and of \ncourse, the government.\n  Comes now the generic drug industry, which has been proven to provide \nalternative, safe and effective therapies in a much more cost \nbeneficial manner. We look to them to be part of the solution to this \nproblem. And they, in turn, look to us to help them be part of that \nsolution.\n  It is no secret that several senators have been meeting to develop a \nbill that would establish a pathway for biosimilar products to be \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration. We had hoped to have it \nready for inclusion in FDARA, but it was not, despite the talks of the \nfour Senators. I am referring to Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee Chairman Ted Kennedy, the committee's ranking Republican, \nMike Enzi, Senator Hillary Clinton, and me. All members of the HELP \nCommittee, we have worked to develop consensus on what legislation \nwould include.\n  Senator Kennedy and I began these talks several months ago. He is \ncommitted to developing a bill on a priority basis. Our staffs \nliterally have been working night and day.\n  Our work has been aided immeasurably by the leadership of Chairman \nWaxman, and in the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Clinton, \nwho have introduced the companion to the Waxman bill. Their \nlegislation, the Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act, H.R. 1038/S. 623, \nprovides a solid starting point for discussions. It is an important \nwork that has added immeasurably to the congressional dialogue.\n  It is my hope that our discussions will also be informed by the work \nof Representatives Jay Inslee, Gene Green and Tammy Baldwin, who \nrecently introduced the Patient Protection and Innovative Biologic \nMedicines Act of 2007, H.R. 1956, and by the views of the many, many \nstakeholders in this legislative effort.\n  The time to develop a pathway for approval of biosimilar products is \nlong past overdue. It should be our priority, and it should be our high \npriority, to get it done this year. But, we should get it done right. \nOur deliberations must be based on science. The original balance of the \nlaw must be maintained, but we must also recognize the emerging \nrealities of this new world.\n  And what are those realities? First, biotechnology products are not \ndrugs; they are very complicated molecules that are not easily \nreproduced. An inadvertent change in the structure of that molecule can \nlead to very devastating consequences.\n  Second, today, it is unlikely that any follow-on company will be able \nto produce an exact copy of a biotech molecule, a generic biologic if \nyou will, at least at first.\n  Third, because science advances, and because American researchers are \nvery good at advancing science--stem cell research is one example that \ncomes readily to mind--we must hold open the possibility that one day \nthere will be true biogenerics.\n  And we must also develop a pathway so that biosimilar products can be \napproved without a full biologics license application, a time-consuming \nand expensive process.\n  But whatever policy we develop, it must be based on soundness of \nscience, rather than the practicalities of politics.\n  Fourth, we must take into account the unique nature of today's \nindustry. This is so much more than an exercise between big Pharma and \nthe generics, or even between big bio and the generics.\n  Indeed, there are about 1,400 biotech companies in the United States. \nHow many of them are profitable? Astoundingly, only 20.\n  Many of these companies are small, with revenues of under a million \ndollars per year. Many do not even have a product on the market.\n  We must examine closely the issue of who will be making biosimilars? \nWill it be the Barr Labs and Tevas of the world? Undoubtedly.\n  But it may also be generic subsidiaries of innovator companies.\n  It is also very likely to be companies in India and China. As we have \nseen with the recent concerns over pet food, inspecting foreign \nmanufacturing plants has historically been a problem for the resource-\nconstrained Food and Drug Administration.\n  Fifth, we must use the framework of Hatch-Waxman where we can, but we \nmust recognize there may be ways to improve it.\n  There are obvious differences between regulating a pathway for \nbiosimilars and for copies of chemical drugs. For example, as I \nmentioned, today's science will probably not allow identical copies of \ntoday's biologics. So, the concept of bioequivalence cannot be imported \ninto this debate. Instead, we must work carefully to define \nbiosimilarity.\n  Another difference today is the fact that process patents are much \nmore integrally tied to the manufacture of biologics. Current law does \nnot require listing of process patents in the orange book.\n  Waxman-Hatch is inherently a litigious process. But its framework--\nthe patent holder or drug manufacturer--v. the generic--does not easily \ntranslate to a system in which multiple patent holders may exist, \nincluding, for example, major universities and research centers.\n  Sixth, the incentives for development of biotech products must be \nmaintained, enhanced where it advances public policy. But at the same \ntime, we cannot seed a new generation of roadblocks that preclude \nbiosimilar entry. This is the nub of the key, crucial balance.\n  Seventh, the role of the FDA must be carefully evaluated. We must \nempower the agency to evaluate pure, safe and potent copies of biotech \nproducts, but we must all recognize that there must be a bright line \nthat separates a safe copy from a new product which should be subject \nto a full biologic license application.\n  We need to free the agency and provide it with the flexibility to \nevaluate the adequacy of a biosimilar submission based on good science, \nbut we must also recognize that, as Commissioner von Eschenbach has \nsaid, there may be some products which cannot be copied safely with \ntoday's science.\n  Eighth, we must make certain the resources are there for the FDA to \ndo the job right. I must note that negotiations between the agency and \nthe pharmaceutical industry on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act \nreauthorization, or PDUFA, took over one year. Every indication I have \nis that review of a biosimilar application is very likely to be more \ncomplex and time consuming than that for a new biologics license \napplication.\n  There must be authority for a fee to be collected that reflects this \ncomplex workload. If we do not provide adequate resources to the FDA, \nthen review of new products could suffer at the expense of cheaper \ncopies as reviewers become siphoned off from new products to the \nbiosimilars. We should not design a system in which this occurs.\n  And I must digress at this point to underscore that the FDA is \nalready cash-strapped and that situation simply must be corrected. The \ndire FDA resources issue appears to have manifested iself in such \nrecent revelations as to the inadequacy of food inspections for some of \nthe most ubiquitous products in American life, including pet food and \npeanut butter.\n  Federal policymakers must take this into account when legislating, \nand the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act is a good place \nto start.\n  Enacting follow-on biologics legislation is a top priority for me. I \nwant us to finalize a bill on a priority basis, and it is my hope it \ncan be included in the final version of FDARA that emerges from the \nconference committee.\n  Before I close, I want to talk about one other issue that is often \ndebated when FDA-related legislation is considered on the floor: \nimportation of prescription drugs. This morning, I listened to our \ncolleague, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, talk about his \nlegislation which allows prescription drugs from other countries to be \nimported into the United States from other countries. My colleague \nrefers to this as drug reimportation which I believe gives people the \nfalse impression that these drugs are originally manufactured in the \nUnited States, exported to another country and then imported back to \nthe United States. I just want to clarify that is not typically the \ncase.\n  In addition, I saw the Senator from North Dakota hold up two bottles \nof\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\nLipitor and say that there is no difference between a drug manufactured \nin Ireland and a drug manufactured in the United States. He suggested \nthat the pills may be different colors but the bottles are the same and \nthe medicine in the bottle is the same.\n  That may be true for the two bottles of drugs that he had on the \nSenate floor. But how could we be assured that is always the case? Can \nwe always guarantee that pills in a bottle labeled from Ireland are \nactually manufactured in Ireland? I don't think so.\n  This issue is the crux of the problem--unless the FDA has approved \nthese medications, we have no way of knowing what is actually in the \nbottle. In fact, when I served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I held a hearing on drug importation and this issue was \nraised by one of the members of the committee. At that July 14, 2004, \nhearing, one Senator specifically asked about a prescription drug \nbottle labeled as being from Canada. William Hubbard, the Associate \nCommissioner for Policy and Planning for the FDA, told her that even \nthough the label said the bottle was from Canada, the FDA had no idea \nwhere that bottle had originated.\n  In fact, at that hearing, Mr. Hubbard said:\n\n       Although some purchasers of drugs from foreign sources may \n     receive genuine product, others may unknowingly buy \n     counterfeit copies that contain only inert ingredients, \n     legitimate drugs that are outdated and have been diverted to \n     unscrupulous resellers, or dangerous sub-potent or super-\n     potent products that were improperly manufactured. \n     Furthermore, in the case of foreign-based sources, if a \n     consumer has an adverse drug reaction or any other problem, \n     the consumer may have little or no recourse either because \n     the operator of the pharmacy often is not known, or the \n     physical location of the seller is unknown or beyond the \n     consumer's reach. FDA has only limited ability to take action \n     against these foreign operators.\n\n  On a related issue, I would like to share Mr. Hubbard's insights on \nthe safety of drugs that have been imported from other countries.\n\n       FDA remains concerned about the public health implications \n     of unapproved prescription drugs from entities seeking to \n     profit by getting around U.S. legal standards for drug safety \n     and effectiveness. Many drugs obtained from foreign sources \n     that either purport to be or appear to be the same as U.S.-\n     approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown quality. \n     Consumers are exposed to a number of potential risks when \n     they purchase drugs from foreign sources or from sources that \n     are not operated by pharmacies properly licensed under state \n     pharmacy laws. These outlets may dispense expired, subpotent, \n     contaminated or counterfeit product, the wrong or a \n     contraindicated product, an incorrect dose, or medication \n     unaccompanied by adequate directions for use. The labeling of \n     the drug may not be in English and therefore important \n     information regarding dosage, warnings and side effects may \n     not be available to the consumer. The drugs may not have been \n     packaged and stored under appropriate conditions to prevent \n     degradation, and there is no assurance that these products \n     were manufactured under current good manufacturing practice \n     (cGMP) standards. When consumers take such medications, they \n     face risks of dangerous drug interactions and/or of suffering \n     adverse events, some of which can be life-threatening. More \n     commonly, if the drugs are subpotent or ineffective, they may \n     suffer complications from the illnesses that their \n     prescriptions were intended to treat, without ever knowing \n     the true cause.\n\n  Mr. President, this was a sobering hearing and I urge my colleagues, \nespecially those who support the importation of prescription drugs into \nthis country, to take the time to review the testimony from the July \n14, 2004, hearing. We had many witnesses who provided valuable insights \non this issue.\n  To address Senator Dorgan's other point regarding the cost of \nprescription drugs, I want to make one thing perfectly clear--I want \nAmericans to have access to affordable drugs, but I also want these \ndrugs to be safe and effective. As one of the authors of Hatch-Waxman, \nI understand the problem of pharmaceutical costs, and I have a record \nof working to find solutions. But bringing potentially unsafe \nmedicines, medicines uncertified by the FDA, into the United States is \nnot a solution.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues who are skeptical about this bill \nto reserve judgment and listen carefully to the debate. While I \nsupported this bill when it was considered by the Senate HELP Committee \n2 weeks ago, I honestly believe that members of the HELP Committee have \nworked hard together to make the reported bill even better. So I urge \nmy colleagues to take the time to review the bill because there are a \nlot of good provisions in it.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the hard work of \nthe staffs of both our committee chairman, Senator Kennedy, and our \nranking minority member, Senator Enzi. I would specifically like to \nthank Amy Muhlberg and David Dorsey for their dedication and hard work \non this issue--they have been working on drug safety legislation for \nover 2 years and I want both of them to know how much all of us \nappreciate their efforts. I also want to recognize Shana Christrup and \nDavid Bowen for their leadership in helping their bosses get this bill \nto the floor under very difficult time constraints. All of the HELP \nCommittee members' staff have worked long hours and many weekend hours \nand I just want you to know how much I appreciate all of you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 4 years ago, I stood in this very spot and \nwarned against an ill-advised invasion of Iraq. Today, the situation in \nIraq has spiraled out of control, into a bloody, deadly, sectarian \ncivil war. Yet the President and his team continue to hold fast to \ntheir ``stay the course'' nonsense. While they do, thousands of brave \nyoung Americans place their lives in jeopardy every day. That reality \nis one this Nation and the world did not have to experience. It is a \ntragic reality, brought on by a war of choice and an occupation that \nhas yielded neither stability nor reconciliation.\n  Four years ago today, the President landed on the deck of the USS \nAbraham Lincoln to declare, ``Mission accomplished.'' Four years ago--\nit feels like an age. For thousands of our soldiers and their families, \nand likely for the Iraqi people, it feels like a lifetime. How wrong \nour President was then, and how wrong our President continues to be \ntoday.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson said:\n\n       A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, \n     adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\n\n  No matter how many times the President wishes it were so, peace in \nIraq will not be found at the barrel of an American gun. No matter how \nhard the President hopes that it will happen, sectarian violence will \nnot be quelled with U.S. forces occupying the Iraqi nation. Cross your \nfingers, pull out your lucky rabbit's foot, even nail a horseshoe over \nthe Oval Office door, but hoping for luck will never change the deadly \ndynamic in Iraq.\n  Peace demands an Iraqi-led political solution to transcend the ethnic \nand sectarian divisions that are splitting the country apart--a \npolitical effort which, to date, the Iraqi Government has been unable \nor unwilling to take on. Our legislation could have spurred that \nprogress, but President Bush has defiantly said no. This White House \nclings to its ``foolish consistency.''\n  When he took office as President more than 6 years ago, George W. \nBush issued a call for renewed responsibility in government. Where are \nthe echoes of that call today? What is responsible about clinging to \nthis failed course in Iraq and refusing to consider a new path? What is \nresponsible about the President continuing to foster and manipulate the \nfears of the American people?\n  Faced with the tragic consequences of its misjudgments in Iraq, the \nBush administration is paralyzed, unwilling to acknowledge, much less \nremedy, its catastrophic blunders. President Bush has gone so far as to \nsay that the way out of Iraq will be decided by future Presidents.\n  What an outrageous abdication of responsibility. It is unacceptable \nto pass this buck to future leaders while our brave troops fight and \ndie today in the crosshairs of this Iraqi civil war. The time to begin \nrectifying this dreadful blunder is now, not in 2 years, not with the \nnext President but now.\n  With the supplemental bill, Congress responded to the call of the \nAmerican people. We offered a new beginning in reconstruction and \nstability for Iraq. Our proposal could have generated political \nreconciliation and economic security in Iraq. Our bipartisan plan \nshifted the responsibility for the Iraqi nation's long-term success to \nthe Iraqi\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\npeople themselves. But plainly Congress offered a plan that could have \nmeant a brighter future for Iraq, a future controlled by the Iraqi \npeople themselves with continued support from the United States. But \nthe President has flatly rejected that plan. It is a sad day for our \nNation and for the world.\n  Before the war began, I urged the President to think through the \nconsequences. There was no doubt as to the military outcome of the war \nbetween the United States and Iraq. Our military might was certainly \nunquestioned. I was very concerned about the repercussions that would \nfollow this certain military victory. Tragically, the repercussions I \nfeared all have come to pass. Oh, how I wish, yes, how I wish that I \nhad been wrong.\n  Once again, I urge the President to think through the consequences of \nhis choices, the consequences of his rejection of this new plan for \nIraq, the consequences of clinging to false hopes, for that is what \nthis veto does. This veto endorses the falsehoods that took us to war. \nIt cements failed policy in place. This veto ensures that hundreds, \nmaybe thousands, more will die in Iraq without any true plan for peace. \nIt forces our military to continue to pursue a mission impossible, \ncreating democracy at the point of a gun.\n  I am sorry this day has come to pass. I am so sorry the horrors of \nthis deadly and mishandled occupation have become the stuff of \npolitical gamesmanship. There is ample blame to go around for that \nfact.\n  I have seen clashes between the legislative and executive branches. I \nhave seen Presidents make mistakes in the past. Everyone, yes everyone, \nmakes mistakes. I certainly have made mistakes, but I have never seen \nsuch arrogance in a White House that seals its eyes and ears and \nblindly sends so many people to their doom. I pray for our troops, for \nour President--yes, I do--and I pray for our country, yes, for our \ncountry, and for the people of Iraq.\n  President Bush has chosen to hold hostage $100 billion for our troops \nto his, President Bush's, policies, his failed policies. But his \nchoice, his choice, is not the last word. Congress will get to work on \na new version of the supplemental appropriations conference report. We, \nwith the Lord's will, will not delay, but we also will not stop our \nefforts to stand for what is right and to craft policies that reflect \nthe true strength of America: humility, modesty, honesty.\n  We will continue to press for a strong, intelligent foreign policy \nthat does not rely on military might alone. And we will not stop in our \nefforts to bring peace to Iraq and our troops home from war, so help me \nGod.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 1082 is before the Senate. The Landrieu \namendment is currently pending.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Landrieu \namendment be set aside and that I may be able to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 990\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have amendment No. 990 at the desk. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Ms. Snowe, Mr. Grassley, Mr. McCain, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Nelson \n     of Florida, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mrs. \n     McCaskill, proposes an amendment number 990.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nSnowe and other cosponsors, including Senator Stabenow, Senator \nGrassley, Senator McCain, Senator Pryor, Senator Sanders, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator McCaskill.\n  This amendment comes from a piece of legislation we have previously \nintroduced dealing with the reimportation of prescription drugs, FDA-\napproved, lower priced prescription drugs that are sold in other parts \nof the world for much lower prices than they are priced in the United \nStates. There are 33 cosponsors on the bill as it was introduced in the \nSenate. It seems clear to me that the best approach to advancing this \nlegislation is to offer it as an amendment to the legislation that \nreauthorizes the Food and Drug Administration. Inasmuch as this subject \ndeals with the FDA, it would provide funding for the FDA, guidelines \nfor the FDA on reimportation of drugs. I am not going to speak at \nlength today. I spoke earlier today. I intend to come back tomorrow \nmorning to speak at some greater length.\n  I know my colleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Grassley and Senator \nStabenow and Senator Sanders--I have talked to him--I know others will \nwish to come and speak as well. But suffice it to say, we have a \nsituation in this country today in which the U.S. consumer is charged \nthe highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is just a \nfact. Today I held up two pill bottles on the floor of the Senate, \nidentical bottles that contained the same prescription drug medicine \nmade in Ireland. It was called Lipitor, for controlling cholesterol. \nThe tablets were made in a manufacturing plant, FDA-approved plant in \nIreland. The two bottles I held up today were different only in that \none was sent to Canada and one was sent to the United States.\n\n  The one sent to the United States was priced nearly double the price \nof the medicine sent to Canada. But that is not unusual. The same thing \nwould be true with respect to medicine that was sold in Germany or \nItaly or France or Spain or England. They all pay much lower prices for \nthe same prescription drug, the identical drug made in the identical \nplant--FDA-approved, sold all around the world, except the U.S. \nconsumer is given the privilege of paying the highest prices in the \nworld, in some cases 80 or 90 percent higher, in some cases 120 percent \nhigher than others pay for the identical prescription drug.\n  Our point with this amendment simply is that if the global economy is \ngoing to work, why doesn't it work for everybody? How about the little \nguy who is buying prescription drugs and is paying the highest prices \nin the world.\n  We have put together a piece of legislation with very significant \nsafety precautions so that there are no safety issues at all. I \nmentioned today that Europe does this routinely. They have a parallel \ntrading system in Europe. They have had it for a couple of decades. If \nyou are in Germany and want to buy a prescription drug from France, no \nproblem. If you are in Italy and want to buy it from Germany, no \nproblem.\n  They have a parallel trading system that allows the consumers to \naccess the best prices. It is only the American consumer that is \ndisadvantaged by a sweetheart deal that allows the prescription drug \nindustry to engage their own price controls, which means that we pay \nthe highest prices in the world.\n  We have offered an amendment. We have 33 cosponsors on the underlying \nlegislation. The amendment I offer on behalf of myself and Senator \nSnowe, bipartisan legislation, as I indicated--Senators Grassley and \nMcCain, Stabenow, Pryor, Sanders, Whitehouse, McCaskill.\n  This is a good amendment. It is good public policy. I know the \nprescription drug industry, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't like \nit. I understand that. I do not come here with a grievance against that \nindustry. I just do not like their pricing policy. I do not like the \nfact that they say to the American people: You pay the highest prices \nin the world.\n  That is not fair. It ought to change. Our amendment is aiming to \nchange it.\n  Mr. President, I will speak at greater length on the subject \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. As usual, my dear friend from North Dakota is articulate, \nand he deserves to be listened to, but I disagree with him.\n  The Dorgan amendment allows individuals to import a qualifying drug, \nand this will pose an overwhelming set of resource burdens for the FDA, \nCustoms, and other agencies, especially\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\nthe FDA. It would, as I have mentioned before, create very significant \nsafety concerns.\n  This amendment establishes a complicated system for the regulation of \nimported drugs. Now this system that he suggests is so vast, it would \ntake and require a lot of money, more than all of the proposed fees \ncould support.\n  Where would an already strapped Federal agency such as FDA get these \nadditional dollars? So far we have not given it to them. There have \nbeen estimates that these dollars would amount to so much that there is \nno way that we could give them enough money.\n  This amendment allows foreign-imported products to be approved for \ndistribution in the United States even when they may not be \nbioequivalent to the FDA-approved products. Now the reason I cite that \nis because the letter from the FDA, this letter was sent to the \nHonorable Byron L. Dorgan, Senator Dorgan. This letter was sent April \n10, 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. In that letter, just to mention a couple of things, the \nActing Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Randall W. Lutter, Ph.D.--let me \njust mention a couple of sentences.\n  He said:\n\n       Nevertheless, the Agency continues to have concerns with \n     enacting such a sweeping importation program and fears that \n     intermediaries would likely swallow the bulk of cost-savings, \n     preventing the American consumers from enjoying much, if any, \n     practical benefit from such a program.\n\n  On safety concerns, he said:\n\n       We have safety concerns related to both the identification \n     of unsafe or non-complaint drug products and about the \n     substitutability for domestic products.\n\n  On identifying unsafe/noncompliant drug products, he said:\n\n       The section of the bill that would allow individuals to \n     import a qualifying drug from a registered exporter would \n     likely pose an overwhelming resource burden for the Agency \n     and create significant safety concerns.\n\n  Just reading at random:\n\n       S.242 would establish a complicated system for the \n     regulation of imported drugs. This complex system is so vast \n     that it would be enormously resource-intensive, likely much \n     greater than the proposed registration fees and inspection \n     fees could support.\n\n  On a lack of substitutability, he said:\n\n       The proposed bill provides a mechanism for foreign imported \n     products to be approved for distribution in the U.S. even \n     though these products may not be bioequivalent to the FDA-\n     approved product.\n  This letter is a serious letter. I don't think we should ignore \nletters such as these in our zeal to resolve problems. I believe the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota is very well intentioned. I \nhave a tremendous regard for him and for his ability to explain things \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts \nof the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 14, \n2004, entitled ``Examining the Implications of Drug Importation,'' of \nMr. William Hubbard, Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning of \nthe U.S. FDA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Testimony: United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary\n\n\n     Examining the Implications of Drug Importation, July 14, 2004\n\n Mr. William Hubbard, Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning, \n                   U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am Mr. \n     William K. Hubbard, Associate Commissioner for Policy and \n     Planning at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the \n     Agency). With me is John M. Taylor, Associate Commissioner \n     for Regulatory Affairs at FDA. We appreciate having this \n     opportunity to discuss with you the issues relating to the \n     importation of prescription drugs into the United States and \n     the use of the Internet to facilitate the sale of these \n     drugs.\n       At FDA, our statutory responsibility is to assure the \n     American public that the drug supply is safe, secure, and \n     reliable. For more than 60 years, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic (FD) Act has ensured that Americans can be \n     confident that, when they use an FDA-approved drug, the \n     medicine will be safe and effective and will work as intended \n     in treating their illness and preventing complications. In \n     carrying out this responsibility, FDA is working to do all we \n     can under the law to make medicines accessible and help \n     doctors and patients to use them as effectively as possible, \n     through such steps as expanding access to generic medicines, \n     reducing the time and cost of showing that new medicines are \n     safe and effective, and providing up-to-date information for \n     health professionals and patients to obtain the benefits and \n     avoid the risks associated with powerful medicines. That is \n     the primary mission of the thousands of dedicated staff, \n     including leading health care experts, doctors, economists \n     and scientists who work tirelessly at FDA in public service \n     for the American people. FDA remains strongly concerned about \n     counterfeit, and/or illegally imported pharmaceuticals whose \n     safety (and effectiveness cannot be assured because they are \n     distributed outside the legal structure and regulatory \n     resources provided by Congress.\n\n\n                   IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n       Sixty-five years ago, Congress responded to widespread \n     instances of unsafe drugs by directing FDA to implement a \n     system for assuring that Americans have a drug supply they \n     can trust will not harm them. Over forty years ago, Congress \n     required that legal drugs be proven to be effective as well, \n     because modern medicines--when they are produced, \n     distributed, prescribed, and used properly--should not only \n     be safe but effective in the treatment of disease. More \n     recently, in 1988, Congress enacted the Prescription Drug \n     Marketing Act (PDMA) to establish additional safeguards to \n     prevent substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit drugs from \n     entering the U.S. Under PDMA, it is illegal for anyone other \n     than the drug's original manufacturer to re-import a \n     prescription drug into the U.S. that was manufactured in the \n     U.S. This law was enacted with strong bipartisan support \n     because of high-profile cases of unsafe and ineffective drugs \n     entering the U.S. in large volumes. In one instance, over 2 \n     million unapproved and potentially unsafe and ineffective \n     Ovulen-2l ``birth control'' tablets from Panama were \n     distributed into the U.S. as ``American goods returned.'' In \n     another case, a counterfeit version of Ceclor, a widely used \n     antibiotic at the time, found its way into the U.S. drug \n     distribution from a foreign source. Over the years, FDA has \n     employed PDMA and other authorities to build a drug safety \n     infrastructure to ensure that Americans enjoy the highest-\n     quality drug supply in the world.\n       Unfortunately, the drug supply is under unprecedented \n     attack from a variety of increasingly sophisticated threats. \n     This is evident in the recent significant increase in efforts \n     to introduce counterfeit drugs into the U.S. market. FDA has \n     seen its number of counterfeit drug investigations increase \n     four-fold since the late 1990s. Although counterfeiting was \n     once a rare event, we are increasingly seeing large supplies \n     of counterfeit versions of finished drugs being manufactured \n     and distributed by well-funded and elaborately organized \n     networks. At the same time, inadequately regulated foreign \n     Internet sites have also become portals for unsafe and \n     illegal drugs. For example, FDA recently worked with domestic \n     and international authorities to shut down a website that was \n     advertising ``FDA-approved'' and safe ``European'' birth \n     control pills and other drugs, but was actually responsible \n     for importing ineffective, counterfeit drugs. Evidence \n     strongly suggests that the volume of these foreign drug \n     importations is increasing steadily, presenting an \n     increasingly difficult challenge for Agency field personnel \n     at ports-of-entry, mail facilities, and international courier \n     hubs, and our laboratory analysts and border and law \n     enforcement partners.\n       FDA is doing its best to use its limited resources and \n     international authorities to stop the increasing flow of \n     violative drugs into this country, but the task is daunting. \n     FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs has inspectors working in \n     the field who perform investigations pertaining to imported \n     prescription drugs, a job that is not limited to inspections \n     at ports-of-entry. Each day, however, thousands of individual \n     packages containing prescription drugs are imported illegally \n     into the U.S., simply because the sheer volume has grown to \n     exceed the capability of FDA field personnel to properly \n     process.\n\n\n                SAFETY CONCERNS RELATING TO IMPORTATION\n\n       FDA remains concerned about the public health implications \n     of unapproved prescription drugs from entities seeking to \n     profit by getting around U.S. legal standards for drug safety \n     and effectiveness. Many drugs obtained from foreign sources \n     that either purport to be or appear to be the same as U.S.-\n     approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of unknown quality. \n     Consumers are exposed to a number of potential risks when \n     they purchase drugs from foreign sources or from sources that \n     are not operated by pharmacies properly licensed under state \n     pharmacy laws. These outlets may dispense expired, subpotent, \n     contaminated or counterfeit product, the wrong or a \n     contraindicated product, an incorrect dose, or medication \n     unaccompanied by adequate directions for use. The labeling of \n     the drug may not be in English and therefore important \n     information regarding dosage, warnings and side effects may \n     not be available to the consumer. The drugs may not have been \n     packaged and stored under appropriate conditions to prevent \n     degradation, and there is no assurance that these products \n     were manufactured under current good manufacturing practice \n     (cGMP) standards. When consumers take such medications, they \n     face risks of dangerous drug interactions and/or of suffering \n     adverse\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\n     events, some of which can be life-threatening. More commonly, \n     if the drugs are subpotent or ineffective, they may suffer \n     complications from the illnesses that their prescriptions \n     were intended to treat, without ever knowing the true cause.\n       Patients also are at greater risk because there is no \n     certainty about what they are getting when they purchase some \n     of these drugs. Although some purchasers of drugs from \n     foreign sources may receive genuine product, others may \n     unknowingly buy counterfeit copies that contain only inert \n     ingredients, legitimate drugs that are outdated and have been \n     diverted to unscrupulous resellers, or dangerous subpotent or \n     super-potent products that were improperly manufactured. \n     Furthermore, in the case of foreign-based sources, if a \n     consumer has an adverse drug reaction or any other problem, \n     the consumer may have little or no recourse either because \n     the operator of the pharmacy often is not known, or the \n     physical location of the seller is unknown or beyond the \n     consumer's reach. FDA has only limited ability to take action \n     against these foreign operators.\n       The Agency has responded to the challenge of importation by \n     employing a risk-based enforcement strategy to target our \n     existing enforcement resources effectively in the face of \n     multiple priorities, including homeland security, food safety \n     and counterfeit drugs. However, this system, as it works \n     today, is already overwhelmed by the number of incoming \n     packages, and this presents a significant ongoing challenge \n     for the Agency.\n       Recent spot examinations of mail shipments of foreign drugs \n     to U.S. consumers revealed that these shipments often contain \n     dangerous or unapproved drugs that pose potentially serious \n     safety problems. In 2003, inspectors found that the majority \n     of the packages examined in these ``blitzes'' contained \n     illegal drugs. Last summer, FDA and the U.S. Customs and \n     Border Protection agency (CBP) conducted blitz examinations \n     on mail shipments at the Miami and New York (JFK Airport) \n     mail facilities in July, and the San Francisco and Carson, \n     California, mail facilities in August. In each location, the \n     agencies examined packages shipped by international mail over \n     a 3-day time span. Of the 1,153 shipments examined, the \n     overwhelming majority (1,019 packages, or 88 percent) \n     contained unapproved drugs. The drugs arrived from many \n     countries. For example, 16 percent entered the U.S. from \n     Canada; 14 percent were from India 14 percent came from \n     Thailand, and 8 percent were shipped from the Philippines.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. These are serious statements by serious people. I don't \nthink we should ignore them. It is one thing to argue that you don't \nlike the pharmaceutical companies, and many don't. It is another thing \nto argue that these drugs that are going to be imported or reimported \nare absolute identical copies of what they represent. I would pay \nattention to what these people are saying.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the statement of \na Customs officer who came and testified on the 14th.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  U.S. Senator Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT) Holds Hearing on Drug Importation\n\n       Mr. HATCH. Ms. Durant.\n        Ms. Durant. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank \n     you for this opportunity to testify.\n       I'm Elizabeth Durant, director of trade compliance and \n     facilitation in the Office of Field Operations at the Bureau \n     of Customs and Border Protection.\n       Today I'd like to discuss with you CBP's efforts to address \n     the ever-increasing trend of personal and bulk importation of \n     pharmaceutical products and controlled substances into the \n     United States.\n       Although the main focus of the CBP has shifted to \n     protecting the United States from terrorist attacks, we also \n     enforce over 400 requirements for more than 40 other federal \n     agencies at U.S. borders. These include the laws that \n     prohibit the importation of illegal or unapproved \n     pharmaceuticals that fall under the jurisdiction of the Food \n     and Drug Administration, as well as those controlled \n     substances that are under the jurisdiction of the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration.\n       The issue of U.S. consumers buying prescription drugs from \n     foreign sources has become a significant concern. A growing \n     number of Americans obtain their medications from foreign \n     locations. However, the safety of drugs purchased from these \n     sources cannot be insured. Drugs produced outside the United \n     States may be counterfeit. Counterfeiting can apply to both \n     brand name and generic drugs where the identity of the source \n     is deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled in a way that \n     suggests that it is the authentic approved product.\n       The CBP is concerned with three avenues that \n     pharmaceuticals are imported: Those that are purchased \n     through the Internet and shipped through our international \n     mail express courier facilities; those carried into the \n     States by individuals transiting our land borders; and bulk \n     shipments of adulterated or counterfeit pharmaceuticals. \n     During the course of the past year we have taken several \n     steps to address each of these areas.\n       Millions of packages come through the mail and express \n     courier facilities every year. Thousands of packages, \n     particularly in the mail, are found to contain illegal and \n     approved pharmaceuticals. We also estimate that 10 million \n     people cross the land border annually carrying unapproved \n     products.\n       Additionally, we have found bulk pharmaceutical shipments \n     that were attempted to be imported through the mail \n     potentially indicating that these products could be making \n     their way to pharmacy shelves.\n       In order to address what is clearly a growing threat to \n     this public health, CBP has been working cooperatively with \n     the DEA, the FDA, our own U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement, ONDCP and the Department of Justice attorneys in \n     an interagency working group directed at addressing issues \n     related to the importation of prescription drugs and \n     miscellaneous pharmaceuticals.\n       The working group has conducted regular meetings since \n     January 2004 and has achieved several key accomplishments \n     since its inception, including conducting a joint interagency \n     enforcement operation known as Operation Safety Cap, which \n     was designed to look at passenger importations of \n     pharmaceuticals from Mexico.\n       Operation Safety Cap was an interagency plan to enforce \n     laws related to the importation of prescription drugs at the \n     border. Both FDA and ICE participated in the enforcement \n     operation. The plan began with a public outreach, followed by \n     an enforcement effort at the Ports of Andrade, Yuma, Tecate, \n     San Luis and Calexico. The purpose was to evaluate compliance \n     with laws related to the importation of prescription drugs.\n       During the course of the operation there were several \n     troubling instances of returning U.S. residents receiving \n     different medications than the ones they thought they were \n     being prescribed.\n       In one instance there was no active ingredient in the \n     unmarked, undeclared bottle that was brought into the U.S. \n     The overall seizure detention rate was nearly 7 percent of \n     the number of individuals inspected, which was significant \n     enough to warrant additional enforcement efforts at our land \n     borders.\n       Based on an operation nicknamed ``Operation Safeguard'' \n     that we have carried out over the last couple of years, we \n     have found the volume of pharmaceuticals shipped through \n     international mail to be enormous. We have also found a \n     significant number of these products do not contain an active \n     pharmaceutical ingredient, but merely contain substances such \n     as starch or sugar.\n       Other problems include expired materials, unapproved \n     products, improper use instructions and products made in \n     facilities not under proper regulation. The vast majority of \n     the pharmaceuticals that enter the United States via the mail \n     do so in a manner that according to FDA violates present FDA \n     and other requirements.\n       It is clear that the importation of pharmaceuticals and \n     controlled substances remains an overwhelming problem for \n     CBP. We are working with the FDA, the DEA, ICE and other \n     regulatory agencies to develop a more practical and workable \n     approach to solve this huge problem.\n       I want to thank you and the members of the committee for \n     considering Customs and Border Protection in your review of \n     the importation of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. \n     This is an issue that speaks directly to our mission. We will \n     continue to make every effort possible to work with the \n     Congress and our fellow inspection agencies to address the \n     health and safety concerns of the American people.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to responding to \n     any questions today.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. It was a startling statement. I know at least one \nDemocratic Senator, who takes matters very seriously and who was for \nimportation or reimportation of drugs, was shocked at some of the \ntestimony because she did not believe things could be as bad as they \nrepresented and was kind of shocked that they made a pretty darn good \ncase that these matters are much more serious than some are taking \nthem.\n  I don't have anything more to say at this time, but I hope we will \nthink this through before we saddle the American people with something \nthat can be disastrous in their lives. I am familiar with how some of \nthese drugs that people think are good drugs that come into this \ncountry are adulterated. Some are made with contaminated water, do not \nhave any efficacy in them at all. Yet they look identical to what our \nU.S. manufacturers are making or what other qualified manufacturers are \ndoing. We can't ignore these things. I think even if we could give FDA \nall the money--and it would amount to trillions of dollars, certainly \nhundreds of billions of dollars but I think trillions of dollars--to \nhandle this, there is still no way FDA can take care of all the \nproblems that would come up.\n  We have a pretty good system here. I have to admit, I wish we could \nget drug prices down. As the author of the Hatch-Waxman Act, we worked \nhard to get the generic business into action. At the time we did Hatch-\nWaxman, generics were no more than 17 or 18\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\npercent of the total marketplace. Today they are over 50 percent. \nHatch-Waxman is the reason they are there. In every case, every year we \nhave saved at least $10 billion for the consumers. What many in this \nbody seem to ignore is that it costs these innovator companies upwards \nof $1 billion to create one of these drugs. Most of them go through at \nleast 6,000 failed experiments before they arrive at one of these \ndrugs. We can't ignore that fact. The only way they can recoup that \nmoney is within the few years that are left of their patent life.\n  This is the only industry I know of--there may be others, but I can't \nthink of any--where if you create a widget, you have 20 years of patent \nlife, market exclusivity. In this industry, a lot of that is eaten up \nby the FDA process. It means that the innovator companies have very few \nyears in which to recoup that billion dollars, upwards of a billion \ndollars. A few years ago, it was $800 million, which was astounding to \nme. Now it is approaching a billion; in some cases, maybe even more.\n  It is one thing to throttle the pharmaceutical companies in the \ninterest of politics. It is another thing to ignore reality and ignore \nwhat happens here.\n  One reason for Hatch-Waxman was because one side wanted all drug \nprice competition. They wanted 100 percent generics if they could get \nthem. The problem is, there would not be any generics if you don't have \nthe innovator companies doing the innovative drugs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My friend from Utah did not mean to suggest those of us \nwho are offering this amendment on a bipartisan basis are doing so for \nthe purpose of politics, as he said. My expectation is, he would think \nthis would be a serious and thoughtful amendment that he disagrees \nstrongly with, but I hope he would not suggest the motive is politics. \nCBO has suggested this bill will save $50 billion for the American \nconsumer, $5 billion of which is for the Federal Government. This is a \nserious issue and a thoughtful issue. One might disagree, but I hope \nthat one would not ascribe motives of politics to those of us on a \nbipartisan basis who are offering this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have heard some who I believe are using it politically \nin the Congress. But I would never ascribe that type of attitude to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota. I believe he is very sincere. \nI believe he is truly trying to represent the consumers in the best \npossible way. I just believe he is ignoring some of these comments and \nstatements made under oath before committees of the Senate that fly in \nthe face of what is being said here. I would like to see drug prices \nreduced. There is no question about it. I worked hard to get them \nreduced. That is what Hatch-Waxman is all about. But there are two \nsides to that. One was drug price competition, to make sure we could \nget drugs in generic form immediately, once they come off patent, which \nwe did. The other, of course, is the patent term restoration so that we \ncould give innovator companies some restoration of patent life or \nmarket exclusivity so they could recoup the moneys, the extraordinary \ncosts that are involved.\n  When I say I have heard some in the Congress who I think have \nexploited this for political purposes, I would never say that about my \nfriend from North Dakota. I don't particularly want to disparage \nanybody else, but I can say this: There have been some who have used \nthis issue politically, and there is no doubt about it. I believe the \nSenator from North Dakota is articulate and means what he says and is \ndoing so for the right reasons. Having said that, I don't think we \nshould ignore the testimony of these top people in the administration \nwho say this could be a disaster for the American consuming public. I \ndon't think you can ignore those comments. I am suggesting that I hope \npeople will read these comments, and I will put more into the record \nbefore we are through with this debate. We are all interested in \ngetting drug prices down. There is no question about it. I don't think \nthere is anybody in this Congress who has done more to bring drug \nprices down than I have, through Hatch-Waxman and my friend Henry \nWaxman over in the House and others who supported that bill. There is \nno question about it. I am as interested as anybody in making sure the \nconsumer public is not ripped off.\n  On the other hand, these innovative drugs cost a lot of money to \ndevelop. When we get into follow-on biologics, it apparently costs even \nmore for these large-molecule drugs that may not be readily duplicated. \nIn fact, under current science, they are not readily duplicated. I am \nvery concerned about this whole issue. I am very concerned about making \nsure that the record shows that we have brought out how serious this \nissue is and how serious the consequences are if people are wrong, if \nthey happen to get this type of legislation through.\n  Let me add one other thing. I would suggest to my friend from North \nDakota that the President has already said that if this language is in \nthis bill, he is going to veto it. I believe that veto would be \nsustained. I think it should be sustained. It is one thing to come out \nand argue for something such as this, but I would hope that he will \nwithdraw his amendment because I would hate to see a bill as important \nto our country as this drug safety bill, a bill that has brought \ntogether Democrats and Republicans from the left to the right, a bill \nthat would help to save as many lives as this bill will do, a bill that \nwill help bring to the forefront the FDA in a way that it should be \nbrought, a bill that has the MDUFA and PDUFA moneys in, a bill that has \nchildren's programs in, I would hate to see this bill vetoed, but I \nwould not blame the President one bit if he vetoes it based upon the \ntestimony of scientists who have testified before our committees.\n  Frankly, I would think he would be right if he vetoed it. But be that \nas it may, I am only one Senator, and I think most people know I am \nvery sincere in this area. I work very hard in these areas. I have a \nrecord of accomplishment in these areas. I just want to make sure that \nour consuming public has every protection they possibly can. \nUnfortunately, it costs a lot of money to give them that protection. I \nwish there was some way we could bring those prices down.\n  Having said that, back in the early 1990s, I helped put through this \nbody the FDA Revitalization Act. Among the purposes of that act was to \ncreate a unitary campus for FDA rather than have over 30 different \nlocations in the greater metropolitan area around the District of \nColumbia, to have a central campus, state-of-the-art equipment, the \nhighest technology we can, with an incentive to bring the very best \nscientific minds we can into FDA. We all know the White Oak complex is \nbeing built now. It didn't start until about 5 or 6 years ago. It is \ngoing to take another 10 years and probably cost a lot more than it \nwould have had we done what that bill said we could do immediately. It \nwas only an authorizing bill. The appropriators did not appropriate the \nfunds to develop that campus. But we have to find a way of helping FDA. \nThe sooner we get that campus and they have all of the integral online \nservices and equipment and top-of-the-line approaches that they can \nbring to bear, we should be able to bring drug prices down through \nthat. But we are a long way from the completion of White Oak, as we \nstand here today.\n  Frankly, at least we are doing it. At least we are going somewhere. I \nwish to attribute some of that to the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, Barbara Mikulski, and others in the House who have worked \nvery hard to make sure that the FDA revitalization approach finally \ncomes to fruition.\n  One of the biggest problems we have in Government today is to get top \nscientists at FDA. We can't pay them commensurate with scientists at \nthe major pharmaceuticals or even the major generic companies. In fact, \nthey can start at three times or more what we pay at FDA. So we have a \nvery difficult time continuously getting top scientists to come and \nwork at FDA. That is a big problem. It is a blessing that we do have \nsome of the best scientists in the world working there who are willing \nto sacrifice to do what they consider to be the important work of the \nFood and Drug Administration. This bill will help the Food and Drug \nAdministration to do a better job, to go forward with more backing from \nthe Congress and, in the end, benefit all of us who benefit so much \nfrom the work of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n           Administration\n                                    Rockville, MD, April 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade and \n         Tourism, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     testify at the March 7, 2007, hearing entitled, ``Policy \n     Implications of Pharmaceutical Importation for U.S. \n     Consumers,'' before the Senate Subcommittee on Interstate \n     Commerce, Trade, and Tourism. The Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the Agency) is responding to address \n     the March 9, 2007, correspondence you sent in follow-up to \n     that hearing.\n       Your correspondence included statements made by former FDA \n     Commissioner, David Kessler, at an April 19, 2005, hearing \n     entitled, ``Examining S. 334, to amend the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the importation of \n     prescription drugs,'' held by the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions. Dr. Kessler's statements \n     focused on the issues of safety, resources, supply chain \n     security, and standards for approval of foreign versions of \n     FDA-approved drugs. You asked that I explain my views on the \n     ``Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act'' in the \n     context of these issues. The bulk of this response details \n     our views about these issues.\n       I would like to start, however, by commending you for your \n     efforts to address American consumers' concerns regarding \n     access to affordable prescription medications. Nevertheless, \n     the Agency continues to have concerns with enacting such a \n     sweeping importation program and fears that intermediaries \n     would likely swallow the bulk of cost-savings, preventing \n     American consumers from enjoying much, if any, practical \n     benefit from such a program. We expect such a result might \n     lead consumers to continue to look for substantial savings on \n     their prescription medications by seeking products outside \n     the legalized importation system, just as some do now. We \n     continue to observe that many consumers buy drugs from \n     foreign Internet sources even though generic versions of \n     those products are approved by FDA and such products are \n     generally cheaper in the United States than abroad.\n       We note that legalizing commercial importation may have \n     unintended effects on protection of intellectual property and \n     may reduce incentives for research and development, as noted \n     in the 2004 report issued by the Health and Human Services' \n     (HHS) Task Force Report on Drug Importation.\n\n\n                            safety concerns\n\n       We have safety concerns related to both the identification \n     of unsafe and or non-compliant drug products and about the \n     substitutability of foreign products for domestic products.\n     Identifying unsafe/non-compliant drug products\n       The section of the bill that would allow individuals to \n     import a qualifying drug from a registered exporter would \n     likely pose an overwhelming resource burden for the Agency \n     and create significant safety concerns. Under such a program, \n     the anticipated high volume of products would make it \n     extremely difficult for FDA and U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection officials to examine adequately all of the \n     personally imported drug products to ensure that they comply. \n     In fact, the HHS Task Force estimated that it would have cost \n     $3 billion annually to examine and process each of the 10 \n     million packages that entered the U.S. in 2003. Even if a \n     lower level of examination were considered adequate, the \n     costs to FDA would still be very high.\n       Despite its registration and inspection fee provisions, the \n     bill likely provides inadequate resources to conduct such \n     examination on a routine basis. Resources are limited to 2.5 \n     percent of the total price of qualifying drugs imported by \n     registered exporters, an amount likely to be a small fraction \n     of the cost of inspecting packages at international mail \n     facilities. This is a particular concern because, once \n     personal importation is given the appearance of legality, \n     consumers may be less vigilant in scrutinizing the drug \n     shipments they receive from abroad.\n       S. 242 would establish a complicated system for the \n     regulation of imported drugs. This complex system is so vast \n     that it would be enormously resource-intensive, likely much \n     greater than the proposed registration fees and inspection \n     fees could support. The bill and its associated fees also do \n     not appear to account for the costs of the increased volume \n     of packages likely to inundate the U.S., or address the \n     accompanying and likely substantial enforcement work that \n     will arise as a result of legalized importation as more \n     unscrupulous vendors set up shop to circumvent the new U.S. \n     system.\n     Lack of substitutability\n       The proposed bill provides a mechanism for foreign imported \n     products to be approved for distribution in the U.S. even \n     though these products may not be bioequivalent to the FDA-\n     approved product. This mechanism seems to by-pass the \n     existing drug approval process for drug products that are not \n     bioequivalent to an FDA-approved product, which is through \n     the submission of a new drug application (NDA) that is \n     thoroughly reviewed for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the \n     bill appears to establish for imported drugs an alternative \n     to FDA's existing generic drugs program.\n       The bill would allow non-bioequivalent products to be sold \n     in the U.S. as approved ``variations'' of the innovator \n     product under the existing NDA, which would create confusion \n     for doctors and pharmacists in prescribing or dispensing, \n     respectively. Dr. Todd Cecil of the U.S. Pharmacopeia \n     testified at the April 2005 Senate HELP hearing regarding \n     pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence and his \n     concerns with this bill. In addition, doctors cannot \n     anticipate which version of a drug product their patients \n     will receive, and pharmacists may not know which version of a \n     drug the doctor intended to prescribe. The possibility of \n     confusion is significant and poses a real public health \n     concern as this increases the chance of error in prescribing \n     and/or dispensing of medications. In addition, the domestic \n     and foreign versions of prescription drugs may become \n     commingled in the drug supply chain. It is unclear whether a \n     patient will be able to specify if he wants the foreign \n     version or the original FDA-approved version when he gets his \n     prescription filled at the pharmacy or receives medication at \n     a hospital or other medical treatment facility.\n\n\n                          Inadequate Resources\n\n       It is uncertain whether the anticipated fee revenues will \n     be realized because the market response to legalization of \n     importation cannot be accurately predicted. This uncertainty \n     could pose problems for FDA's program, because large costs of \n     starting and developing a program to regulate imports will \n     have to be incurred even if the volume of legalized imports \n     is initially low. Although the bill does assume certain sales \n     volumes in the first several years for purposes of collecting \n     inspection fees, with only a few registered importers and \n     exporters participating initially, the high pro rata share of \n     fees may actually discourage participation and make it \n     difficult for FDA to collect fees at the designated levels. \n     Even once a program is developed, the bill is not likely to \n     provide the necessary funds to continue an adequate \n     regulatory program if inspection fees are low because imports \n     do not reach the anticipated levels.\n\n\n                         Supply Chain Security\n\n       We are proud of FDA's efforts with supply chain \n     stakeholders and states to maintain a safe and secure drug \n     supply in the U.S. that is premised on a closed, tightly \n     regulated system. The type of drug importation program in the \n     bill would increase the number of foreign entities FDA would \n     have to monitor and regulate. It can be difficult for FDA \n     enforcement to reach foreign entities violating our laws and \n     regulations. This bill would open the door to more entities \n     outside our domestic legal framework. We also have grave \n     concerns for consumers who may be harmed from products \n     from these foreign sources. The bill does not take into \n     account protecting the rights of the consumer if they are \n     injured after using one of these products.\n       As we all agree, counterfeit drugs must be kept out of the \n     U.S. drug supply chain. FDA is currently using its resources \n     and authorities as efficiently as possible to secure the drug \n     supply chain and protect American consumers from counterfeit \n     and diverted drugs. Opening the U.S. drug distribution system \n     to foreign markets would provide more opportunity for \n     counterfeit drugs to enter our currently closed system and \n     would significantly complicate FDA's efforts to investigate \n     irregularities in the drug supply chain.\n       Conducting foreign investigations and prosecutions is \n     inherently costly and difficult and often is complicated by \n     language barriers and issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction \n     and extradition. We are concerned that the bill does not \n     provide sufficient enforcement tools and penalties to deter \n     foreign entities from introducing counterfeit or otherwise \n     substandard drugs into the U.S. drug supply chain.\n\n\n                      Approval of Foreign Versions\n\n       We believe the bill creates complicated application and \n     inspection requirements for imported ``foreign'' versions of \n     FDA-approved products. These requirements would be difficult \n     to implement, as each foreign country has its own regulatory \n     scheme and requirements for the information necessary to \n     approve a drug product. FDA would essentially have to review \n     foreign information in a foreign format, all in less time \n     than is required for review of traditional NDAs. In addition, \n     the bill would require imported ``foreign'' versions of a \n     drug bear the labeling associated with the original FDA-\n     approved product. This practice would essentially legalize \n     the misbranding of these products, and raises concerns for \n     FDA not only in the approval context but also in the \n     counterfeits context. It is difficult enough for FDA and \n     other federal enforcement agencies to detect counterfeit drug \n     products and packaging; creating a mechanism that would allow \n     persons to label foreign drugs with reproductions of FDA-\n     approved labeling would make it even harder to distinguish \n     between ``legal'' foreign products and counterfeits.\n       U.S. consumers currently have a number of options available \n     to them when looking for affordable medications within the \n     closed U.S. drug distribution system. Many essential drugs \n     have a generic alternative and some even have many generics, \n     which are generally less expensive than the brand product. We \n     continue to find that many consumers currently buying foreign \n     products are actually trying to purchase, or are unknowingly \n     receiving, a foreign product that\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n     often is more expensive than the U.S. product. In addition, \n     the consumers are at risk when receiving foreign drug \n     products, as there are documented cases where the wrong \n     medication was received (the haloperidol case mentioned in my \n     testimony). Many pharmaceutical companies and Pharmaceutical \n     Research and Manufacturers Association of America offer \n     discounts and sometimes even free medications for consumers \n     who cannot afford them. Medicare Part D has also helped some \n     seniors cut their prescription costs. Consumers should not \n     feel restricted to higher priced innovator (brand) products.\n       Consumers must also understand that if a medication is \n     costly, they should discuss other treatment options with \n     their doctor and pharmacist, as most often there are lower-\n     cost alternatives available. We will continue to strive to \n     make more affordable medicines available to consumers, but we \n     remain concerned about the implications of legalizing drug \n     importation as one of those options.\n       In conclusion, I would like to reiterate concerns about the \n     economic implications of prescription drug importation, as \n     stated in the 2004 HHS Task Force Report on Drug Importation. \n     Even if all the safety concerns could be allayed, these \n     concerns would remain: that savings to U.S. consumers would \n     be small as a percent of total drug spending; that \n     implementing such a program would incur significant costs; \n     and that legalized importation would likely adversely affect \n     the future development of new drugs for American consumers. \n     In 2004, the HHS Task Force Report noted that generic drugs \n     account for most prescription drugs used in the U.S. and that \n     these are usually less expensive in the U.S. than abroad. We \n     thus have a well-functioning system of intellectual property \n     rights that balances the short-term interests of consumers \n     with the long-term research incentives.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to address some of our \n     concerns with S. 242.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Randall W. Lutter,\n     Acting Deputy Commissioner for Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Exoneration of Senator Frist\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a great injustice has come to an end. I \nrise to recognize the clearing of a good man's name.\n  Former Senator Bill Frist, with whom I and my Republican colleagues \nhad the honor of serving for 12 years in the Senate, was cleared last \nweek of every allegation of wrongdoing related to his ownership and \nsale of stock while serving as majority leader.\n  I rise because, with the exception of an editorial in this morning's \nWall Street Journal, the clearing of this good and honorable man's name \nhas gone largely unreported.\n  It is a sad fact of political life in America that the mere \nallegation of wrongdoing--the mere allegation of wrongdoing--has the \npower to tarnish someone's name and dog them for years. But worse still \nis the silence that so often greets the vindication of the accused.\n  I remember the rush to judgment that followed the allegations. I \nremember the memo Democrats sent out attacking Bill on ethical grounds. \nThe authors were later forced to apologize, but the piece had its \nintended effect.\n  Republicans knew then--and everyone now knows--those allegations were \nabsolutely false. But the damage, of course, was already done. As the \nJournal writers put it today:\n\n       Despite flimsy evidence, the media storm cast a shadow over \n     [Frist's] office . . . [and] the Nashville heart surgeon \n     chose . . . to take a sabbatical from public life.--\n       [And] Dr. Frist now joins a long line of public servants to \n     be smeared on page one and [then] exonerated next to the \n     classifieds, only to wonder if anyone noticed.\n\n  Well, his friends noticed. Still, it is hard not to lament the damage \nthese reckless claims have caused--caused for Bill, his family, and \npotentially our political system.\n  The Founders envisioned a nation in which citizen legislators would \nbe willing to leave the plow and the workbench to serve.\n  Bill embodied this ideal by leaving his profession and the comforts \nof private life for a career of public service. He graced this body \nwith his intelligence, his thoughtfulness, and his vision.\n  We can only hope that future citizen legislators, and judges, are not \ndeterred from entering and elevating politics because of the threat of \nsimilar treatment.\n  A great American statesman once said:\n\n       Reputation is like fine china and glass--easy to crack, but \n     hard to mend.\n\n  We hope a political culture that allowed the abuse of Bill Frist's \ngood name for political gain does not deter others from choosing the \nsame path that he chose--and so honorably followed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial entitled \n``Frist's Vindication'' from today's Wall Street Journal be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 1, 2007]\n\n                          Frist's Vindication\n\n       When insider-trading allegations against former Senate \n     Majority Leader Bill Frist surfaced back in 2005, they were \n     splashed on the pages of major newspapers from coast to \n     coast. Now that Dr. Frist has been vindicated, the silence is \n     instructive. Is anybody out there?\n       Senator Frist was alleged to have received an insider tip \n     and then sold shares in a hospital company run by members of \n     his family. The Securities and Exchange Commission and \n     Justice Department investigated for 18 months, and last week \n     the SEC announced that it had closed its probe without taking \n     action--that is, the doctor was cleared. Thanks in part to \n     his meticulous email archives, Dr. Frist was able to show \n     that he had begun the process of selling his HCA stock in \n     April of 2005, months before he was alleged to have received \n     the inside whispers.\n       The controversy surrounding his involvement in health care \n     was a perennial bugaboo for Dr. Frist. For years he was \n     harassed by such liberal lobbies as Public Citizen, and \n     Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which \n     alleged conflicts of interest. These groups objected even to \n     those stocks he held in the blind trust he had created to \n     avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Yet when he \n     sold those stocks, with a possible eye on higher office, he \n     was pilloried for doing what the ethicists had asked him to \n     do all along.\n       Today, even this muted absolution is surely a relief to Dr. \n     Frist. Yet it's impossible to undo the damage to his \n     political career. Despite flimsy evidence, the media storm \n     cast a shadow over his office, derailing any thought of a \n     Presidential bid this year. The Nashville heart surgeon chose \n     instead to ``take a sabbatical from public life.''\n       Democrats naturally cared less about the actual facts than \n     about pinning another scandal on Congressional Republicans in \n     the run-up to the fall elections. But what about others who \n     thought it clever or funny or perhaps mandatory to get their \n     share of media attention by confusing accusation with proof \n     of wrongdoing?\n       American University Professor James Thurber got his name in \n     the paper for quipping that Senator Frist ``came in like \n     Jimmy Stewart and was leaving like Martha Stewart.'' What a \n     card. As for the press corps, it ran off in a braying \n     stampede in pursuit of the theme dujour, which was Abramoff-\n     DeLay-GOP corruption. The accusations against Dr. Frist fit \n     that template, so there was no need for the herd of \n     independent minds to inspect the evidence and make \n     distinctions. A Washington Post editorial from the day now \n     looks especially embarrassing--and unfair.\n       As a medical professional with strong Tennessee roots, Bill \n     Frist was the kind of person we'd hope would occasionally \n     choose to participate in politics, as opposed to the \n     permanent political class that now dominates Congress. That \n     his previous engagement in the real world, even carefully and \n     transparently managed, made him an unfair target of political \n     attacks shows why so few people of accomplishment run for \n     office. These are the kind of people that the goo-goo \n     Naderites and their media acolytes end up driving from public \n     life.\n       Dr. Frist now joins a long line of public servants to be \n     smeared on page one and exonerated next to the classifieds, \n     only to wonder if anyone noticed. As former U.S. Secretary of \n     Labor Ray Donovan asked after his legal ordeal, ``Which \n     office do I go to to get my reputation back?''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Iraq Supplemental\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 1 hour ago, the President of the \nUnited States vetoed the supplemental appropriations bill for the war \nin Iraq. It was a bill that we have worked on in Congress since its \narrival in the middle of February. It was the subject of lengthy \ndeliberations. There were long debates on the floor of the House and \nSenate. There was a lot of compromise that led to the final work \nproduct and a bipartisan vote which sent it to the President.\n  There were people who were skeptical as to whether the Senate and the \nHouse\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\nof Representatives could rise to this challenge. In a nation that is so \ndivided on so many political issues, in a nation where the war in Iraq \nis the biggest issue by far, there were serious doubts as to whether \nthis Congress, with scant majorities of Democrats in both the House and \nthe Senate, could produce a bill for President Bush to consider.\n  Congress rose to that occasion. With the leadership of Speaker Pelosi \nand the leadership of our majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, we \nproduced a bill which attracted not only the overwhelming support of \nthe Democratic caucus but also the support of Republican Senators who \njoined us in passing this bill.\n  It was our hope that our work product would be considered seriously \nby the President. It was sent to him this afternoon. A few hours after \nreceiving it, the President vetoed it and announced his veto in a \npublic press conference.\n  I am disappointed. The President had a chance to sign a bill that \nwould have funded the troops in this war. More importantly, it was a \nbill he could have signed which could have changed the course of this \nwar--something that is long overdue.\n  I listened in my office as the President gave his veto message to the \nAmerican people. It was short, direct but, in many ways inadequate when \nyou consider the awesome responsibility we face in Congress and in the \nWhite House.\n  The President referred to our timetable to start bringing American \ntroops home as a date for failure. It is ironic the President would \nmake that statement on the fourth anniversary of his appearance on the \nUSS Lincoln aircraft carrier under a banner announcing, 4 years ago, \nthat our mission was accomplished. For the President to announce \nsuccess and failure, accomplishment and lack of accomplishment, leaves \nsomething to be desired after that experience 4 years ago.\n  I am particularly troubled as well by the President's notion of what \nthis bill was all about. You see, he said, at one point, for us to set \na timetable to bring American troops home would--in the President's \nwords--``demoralize the Iraqi people.'' Those were his words.\n  Mr. President, excuse me, but I am not as interested in building up \nthe morale of the Iraqi people as I am in inspiring the leaders of the \nnation to stand up and lead. For too long now, with the protection of \nthe U.S. troops, this Iraqi Government has failed to make even basic \nprogress in taking control of their country. They have failed to \naddress the key political issues that would lead to stability.\n  So the President is arguing that if we continue to send 150,000 or \nmore American soldiers to risk their lives, it will build up the morale \nof the Iraqi people to seek nationhood, stability, and peace. So we \nexpect American soldiers to stand in this crossfire of a bitter \nreligious and civil war, hoping that the Iraqi people will be inspired \nenough to ask their Government for leadership?\n  Mr. President, 3,351 American soldiers have fought and died in Iraq, \nas I stand here today. Mr. President, 3,351 American lives should be \nenough to inspire the Iraqi people and their Government. How many more \nAmerican lives will it take for that inspiration the President is \nlooking for?\n  I am troubled by this notion that unless we will sacrifice our \ntreasure and the lives of our brave soldiers, the Iraqis cannot rise to \nthe occasion and lead themselves out of this morass.\n  I also listened to the President when he characterized the money that \nwe added in Congress to his budget request. He called it--and I will \nquote--``billions in nonemergency spending that has nothing to do with \nfighting the war on terror.''\n  I wonder if the President's staff put the bill in front of him for \nhim to take a close look at, in the few hours he had it before vetoing \nthe bill.\n  Is the President arguing to the American people that providing $2 \nbillion more in equipment to keep our troops safe in Iraq has nothing \nto do with fighting the war on terror?\n  Is the President arguing that the $1 billion in our supplemental \nappropriations bill--the $1 billion to replenish National Guard \nequipment destroyed and lost in the war in Iraq--that $1 billion has \nnothing to do with the war on terror?\n  Is the President arguing that the $2 billion in this bill for \nmilitary hospitals--such as Walter Reed, so we do not relegate our \nfallen soldiers and those who were injured to a flophouse motel across \nGeorgia Avenue from Walter Reed Hospital--is he arguing that the $2 \nbillion that is in the bill for military hospitals has nothing to do \nwith the war on terror?\n  Perhaps the President is not aware of the fact there was $2 billion \nin this bill for veterans hospitals all across America, for those who \nhave come home with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain \ninjury, and amputations who need the services of the VA hospitals. Is \nthe President arguing that money for VA hospitals has ``nothing to do \nwith the war on terror''? That is what he said. That is an exact quote.\n  This bill has add-ons that relate to real emergencies in America. I \nhave outlined a few related directly to the war on terror, directly to \nour troops, directly to our national security.\n  There is money, as well, for the base closing commission, which it is \nmy understanding the President wanted included. There is money, as \nwell, for Hurricane Katrina. Here we are, a year and a half after that \nterrible tragedy, still trying to put New Orleans back on its feet and \nrebuild Louisiana and Mississippi and areas affected by Katrina and \nRita. Yes, there is money in the bill for those emergency purposes.\n  For the President to dismiss this as billions in nonemergency \nspending suggests his staff did not do their job, they did not spell \nout to the President what was in that bill before he vetoed it.\n  Well, the President knows--and he said as much--we do not have the \nvotes to override his veto. That is a reality. It takes 67 votes in the \nSenate. We have been able to rally 51 or 52 votes on a good day to \nquestion the President's policies in Iraq. Two or three Republican \nSenators have stood by our side on the Democratic side of the aisle. \nFew others have been willing to do so. So the thought of reaching 67 \nvotes is probably a bridge too far. I think we know that reality.\n  But this much I will say: Congress cannot override the President's \nveto, but the President cannot override the reality of Iraq. The \nreality of Iraq is this: We are in the fifth year of a war. We have \nseen 3,351 American lives sacrificed, 25,000 or more injured, 7,000 or \n8,000 seriously injured with traumatic brain injury and amputations.\n  Americans have sacrificed from their hard work and earnings $500 \nbillion for this war and for rebuilding Iraq. That is the reality of \nIraq today.\n  The reality is, this last month of April was the deadliest month this \nyear for American soldiers. The reality is, this President has no plan \nto exit that country and bring our troops home. That is the reality. We \nmay not be able to override this veto, but the President cannot \noverride those realities.\n  Now it is time for the American people to understand what happens \nnext.\n  We will fund these troops. We have made that promise, and we will \nkeep it. They will not be bargaining chips in our policy debate in \nWashington. But we will continue, through this bill and through other \nlegislation this year, to continue to put the issue of the Iraq war in \nfront of the President, in front of the American people. They expect \nnothing less.\n  For those who are frustrated by the President's veto today, I join \nthem in that frustration. But I join them, as well, in believing that \nas the American people speak out on this issue, the likelihood that \nRepublicans will cross this aisle and join us increases.\n  The time will come--I am not sure when but I hope soon--that tipping \npoint will be reached where the Republicans finally say to their \nPresident: Enough. We cannot ignore the reality of this war and what it \nhas done to America. Then they will join us. Then this will truly \nbecome a bipartisan effort. Then we will be able to override vetoes and \npass legislation that will make a meaningful change in the policy of \nthis war.\n  I encourage those across America seeking a new direction in Iraq, do \nnot be discouraged by this veto. There will be another day. There will \nbe another bill. There will be another chance for us to change this \npolicy. We need to keep our forces together--the forces for change in \nIraq on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. We cannot allow \nthe President's veto pen to be the\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\nlast word on this war in Iraq. We have to stand together, and we have \nto work together.\n  The President comes up with rosy reports on what is happening in \nIraq. But we know the reality. Sectarian deaths are down, he said. \nWell, I guess they are down slightly, a small percentage, of those \ninnocent civilians killed last month. There were fewer this month. I \nguess that is progress. But those who are there say the violence is \nsubsiding while the surge is underway, and they are afraid it will \nreturn. I am, too.\n  We need to pass a bill for the troops, and sometime soon. We will \nwork hard to try to find a way with the President. He has invited the \nleadership of the Senate and the House to meet with him tomorrow in the \nWhite House. I have been to those meetings before. There have been \nlittle results to point to for the time we have met and the dialog we \nhave exchanged. But I go tomorrow with the hope that things will be \ndifferent. I hope this President, after his moment in the sun with this \nveto, will now understand that we face the grim reality of Iraq, and \nthe reality that we have no exit plan. This failed policy in Iraq must \ncome to an end. We will continue to fight, with this democratic \nCongress, to make a change in that policy. We will stand by our \nsoldiers, but we will not stand by a failed policy. I am encouraged by \nthe fact that so many of my colleagues are ready to continue this \nfight, and I encourage the American people: Don't give up. Don't lose \nheart. This democracy works when you work with us to bring the will of \nthe people to the law of the land.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Iraq Supplemental\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, tonight is a sad night for America, but \nwhat the President's veto indicated was not that Democrats don't want \nto support the troops--we do--but that he does not want a change in \ndirection, a change in mission, a change in course. It indicates the \nPresident is still in his bunker thinking everything is going fine in \nIraq, and it clearly isn't.\n  The bottom line is very simple: We can do two things at once. We can \nsupport the troops and at the same time we can change our mission. The \nbottom line is simple, and that is that the present policies have \nfailed. Everyone except a handful of supporters of the President, and \nthe President and the Vice President themselves, know that, but \nunfortunately they stubbornly cling to staying on the same course, to \nthe detriment of about everybody else in this country and the world.\n  The bottom line is very simple: that President Bush, when he asked \nAmericans to go to war, never talked about policing a civil war, and \nyet that is the largest part of our efforts in Iraq. We on this side of \nthe aisle hope to change that direction so that we are fighting \nterrorism and directing counterterrorism and not simply policing a \ncivil war.\n  The next few weeks will be momentous in our history. Frankly, when \nthese few weeks began, the President, with his bully pulpit, his harsh \nrhetoric, his idea that he was trying to persuade people we didn't \nsupport the troops, many thought he would win the fight--the fight here \nin this Chamber and in the minds of public opinion. But that hasn't \nhappened at all. In fact, the American people are so disgruntled by \nthis war in Iraq, that the old name-calling, the old kneecapping, the \nold attempts to instill fear in people who disagreed with him don't \nwork for this President anymore. He has only one choice. That choice is \na simple one, which is to change the course of the war in Iraq. It is \ninevitable. It will happen. It will happen sooner or it will happen \nlater, but it must happen because failed policies can never continue on \nand on and on.\n  They have asked us to have faith in the surge. If it won't work with \n150,000 troops, it won't work with 180,000 troops, and it won't work \nbecause the Government in Iraq does not have the support of the people, \nis unable to accomplish any goals, is unable to bring Sunnis, Shiites, \nand Kurds together. It doesn't matter how many troops we have there; \nthe bottom line is simple. Our President is in the twilight days of his \nadministration, and he has only two choices. One is to do what his \npredecessor Ronald Reagan did: See that things have gone off course and \nseek a correction. Ronald Reagan did that in 1986, and by 1988 the wall \ncame down and Ronald Reagan had restored the faith of the American \npeople. Why this President can't see the necessity to do the same when \nhis policies, if anything, are in far worse shape than those of \nPresident Reagan, speaks either to an inability to sense what is going \non or a stubbornness despite the facts. We can't tolerate that.\n  We here tonight make a pledge to the American people. We will \ncontinue this struggle to change our direction in Iraq. We will not run \naway from fighting terrorism. We believe it every bit as fervently as \nanybody else, but we will also not run away from fighting terrorism \nsmartly, which is what we are not doing here.\n  So we will continue to try to reach a compromise with this President, \nto try to figure out a way we can both support the troops and change \nthe course of the war in Iraq in maybe a different way, but we will not \ngive up on our mission. The American people demand no less and we will \nnot disappoint them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      senator frist's vindication\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the good fortune of working with \nSenator Bill Frist for 4 years as a leader. He was a leader. There were \ntimes he and I had some political disagreements, and that is an \nunderstatement, but on a personal basis we had no misunderstandings. He \nwas in public service for the right reason. He was a very fine, \noutstanding, nationally recognized transplant surgeon. He comes from a \ngood family. He and I had many discussions, personal in nature. He was \nalways available to anyone in the Senate. When there were any medical \nproblems involved, he was always there to give advice and counsel. I \nwent to him on many occasions about situations involving my friends and \nhe would lay things out for me and head me in the right direction.\n  Senator Frist had a situation arise front page in many of the \nnewspapers, problems with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nSenator Frist comes from a family that has done well. They have been \ninvolved in health care for many years. He and I had conversations \nabout this and he said at the time it was unfair. He had to spend a lot \nof money hiring lawyers and accountants and consultants.\n  This matter was closed yesterday, but the closing of this in the \nnewspapers and on the news was certainly not the top story, not at the \ntop of the newspaper. It was buried some place in the back. At no time \nduring my conversations with Senator Frist or in my dealings with \nSenator Frist did I ever have any doubt about his integrity.\n  His wife Karen and my wife are good friends. They worked together on \na number of activities that Senate spouses work on. They had to do \nthings because Senator Frist and I were the two leaders of the Senate \nand they did them together based on our relationship.\n  I extend to Senator Frist my congratulations on getting this put \nbehind him. I want the Record to be spread with the fact that I know \nthis was a difficult time for him on occasion, but never at any time \ndid I doubt his integrity, his honesty. I will long remember Senator \nFrist and I appreciate my dealings with him over these many years.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nXXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a \nclose debate on the Dorgan amendment No. 990 to S. 1082, the FDA \nRevitalization bill.\n         Byron L. Dorgan, Dick Durbin, Claire McCaskill, John \n           Kerry, Ted Kennedy, Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Ken \n           Salazar, Mark Pryor, Daniel K. Inouye, Chuck Schumer, \n           Harry Reid, Ron Wyden, Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin, \n           Blanche L. Lincoln.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a cloture motion on Senator Dorgan's \nlongstanding endeavor to allow Americans to go to other countries for \nthe importation of cheaper drugs. We know people are going to Canada \nnow from around the country who live on the border, and it works pretty \nwell. But if you are someone who lives in Nevada, you certainly need \nthese drugs as well as someone living in Minnesota, and it makes it \nmuch more difficult. Nevadans go to Mexico a lot of times for cheaper \ndrugs. It is unfortunate.\n  Senator Dorgan is right. He has worked on this very hard for a number \nof years. This is an effort to bring this matter to a close. I hope the \nSenate votes to invoke cloture so we can have a vote on this amendment. \nIt is important. I am confident it will pass if cloture is invoked. It \nis something that has been needed for such a long time to help in one \nway to lower the cost of medicine for the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5388-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last week I attended a ceremony in the \nCapitol Rotunda to commemorate the 2007 Holocaust Days of Remembrance.\n  Fred Zeidman and Joel Geiderman, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, spoke eloquently about the horror and \ncourage, the unspeakable tragedy and unimaginable heroism that even 62 \nyears later we cannot begin to comprehend.\n  Sara Bloomfield, Director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, as \nwell as my colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, added their own powerful \nwords.\n  I was privileged to sit beside Steven Schwarz. As we sat together, \nSteven listened silently, tears streaming down his face. Afterward, he \ntold me his story.\n  Born in Poland, Steven lost both parents and a brother in the \nHolocaust. Forged with sheer willpower and blessings from God, he, his \nlate wife Tina, and his brother Henryk managed to survive by hiding out \nin Poland. In 1953, they came to the United States and were welcomed \nwith open arms. In the years that followed, Steven and his brother rose \nto become prominent and successful businessmen, overcoming great \nsuffering to live the American dream.\n  Steven Schwarz embodies the grace and fortitude of all those who \nwrested triumph from despair. I am honored to have shared that day of \nremembrance with him and pleased to now pay tribute to his life story \nin the Record of the U.S. Congress as a powerful and poignant example \nof the unbreakable human spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5388-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AAA SCHOOL SAFETY PATROLLERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to recognize several young people who \nwere recently selected by the American Automobile Association to \nreceive special awards for their work as school safety patrollers.\n  More than 560,000 students in 52,000 schools across the country \nparticipate in AAA's School Safety Patrol Program. These young people \nhave taken on the important responsibility of making the streets around \ntheir schools safer for their classmates. Though their responsibilities \nare often routine, the patrollers on occasion must place themselves in \nharm's way in order to save lives. It is my honor today to recognize \ntwo students who were selected to receive the AAA Lifesaver Award for \ntheir selfless and heroic actions in fulfilling their duties as \npatrollers.\n  Taylor Pitzer and Caleb Jarrell participate in the AAA School Safety \nPatrol Program at Southdale Elementary in Kettering, OH. On November 8, \n2006, Taylor and Caleb pulled a younger child to safety when a speeding \nvan ran the red light at the intersection they were patrolling. The \nyounger child was watching carefully for the ``walk'' signal. When the \nlight changed, she began crossing the street and did not notice the \noncoming vehicle approaching the intersection. Responding to an adult \nguard's ``hold back'' indication, Taylor and Caleb reacted quickly by \nlocking arms so the child could not cross the street, which allowed the \nvan to speed by without incident or injury to the child.\n  I would also like to thank AAA for making the school safety program \npossible. This program has helped save many lives over the years and \nhas made our schools safer for our students, though, as the story of \nthe Life Saver Award recipients demonstrate, the streets around our \nschools are not safe enough. That is why I worked to create the \nnational Safe Routes to School Program, which was adopted as part of \nthe Federal transportation bill on July 29, 2005. Funds for this \nprogram can help communities construct new bike lanes, pathways, and \nsidewalks, as well as launch Safe Routes education and promotion \ncampaigns in elementary and middle schools.\n  I am pleased to commend this important program today before the \nSenate. I know I speak for every member of the Senate in expressing our \ngratitude for their valuable work in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5388-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NORTHERN NEVADA CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to honor the Northern Nevada Center \nfor Independent Living, NNCIL. I am honored to congratulate this \norganization for their 25 years of dedicated service to the people of \nnorthern Nevada.\n  NNCIL has helped disabled citizens in Nevada in all aspects of their \nlives. They have empowered disabled citizens to become more independent \nand have given disabled people a stronger voice in matters that \ndirectly affect their lives. With the skills taught by NNCIL, disabled \npeople who were benefactors of this program are now participating fully \nin the community by volunteering in the center and in other service \nagencies across Nevada.\n  NNCIL has helped disabled citizens thrive socially as well. The \ncenter has instituted ``recreation night'' that has helped disabled \npeople form peer support groups. They have incorporated game night and \nmovie night into their organization to build communities throughout \nNevada.\n  The efforts of NNCIL have garnered broad respect and support from the \ncommunity as a whole. NNCIL has incorporated multiple programs to \neducate the public concerning issues concerning disabled citizens. They \nhave encouraged Nevada residents to get involved in their communities, \nand the citizens of northern Nevada have responded by volunteering in a \nhome-modification program that has helped install ramps, handrails, and \nother improvements to make life easier for disabled people.\n  I would like to commend NNCIL for their many years of dedicated \nservice to the people of Nevada. They have been an important part of \nimproving the lives of disabled members of our community, and I wish \nthem continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5388-5", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5388-S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING NEVADA'S 45TH ANNUAL RENO JAZZ FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. REID.

He was 28 years old.\n  Sergeant Locker graduated from Burwell High School in 1997. He \nenlisted with the Army while he was still in high school. Bob Lee, his \nhigh school math teacher, said that after he enlisted, Sergeant Locker \nbecame a much more focused young man whose grades shot up.\n  After high school, Sergeant Locker spent 3 years in the Army, 2 years \nwith the National Guard, and eventually reenlisted with the Army. He \nhad been in Iraq since August 2006 with the Army's historic 82nd \nAirborne Division.\n  Sergeant Locker was previously injured in Iraq by a land mine. He was \nawarded a Purple Heart and lived with shrapnel in his neck. Thousands \nof brave men and women like Sergeant Locker are serving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his life as a soldier, Sergeant Locker was father to \nthree young sons and believed he was making a safer world for his \nchildren.

Mr. President, today I have placed a hold on the \nnomination of R. Lyle Laverty to be Assistant Secretary for Fish, \nWildlife and Parks at the U.S. Interior Department. Consistent with my \npolicy of publicly announcing whenever I place a hold on a nomination, \nI want to notify my colleagues of my objection to allowing Mr. \nLaverty's nomination to be considered under a unanimous-consent \nagreement. and to take a few minutes to explain to my colleagues why I \nam doing so.\n  The Interior Department has suffered no shortage of scandals in \nrecent years. To name just two of the most egregious: Its former No. 2 \nofficial, a Deputy Interior Secretary who previously had been a coal \nindustry lobbyist, pleaded guilty earlier this year to felony \nobstruction of justice for lying about his relationship with disgraced \nlobbyist Jack Abramoff. And we discovered that the Minerals Management \nService, an agency within the Interior Department, has known for years \nabout flawed drilling leases that allow companies to pay no royalties \non valuable oil and gas they take from Federal land in the Gulf of \nMexico, but the MMS did nothing until news reports brought the facts to \nthe public last year. Indeed, the MMS has silenced auditors on its \nstaff who tried to blow the whistle on companies not paying their fair \nshare.\n  ``Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest \nlevels of the Interior Department,'' the Interior Department's \ninspector general has warned us.\n  Last year, when Dirk Kempthorne was nominated to be Secretary of the \nInterior and he appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee for confirmation, I secured from him a pledge. He told me \nthat he would reform that troubled department and introduce a higher \nethical standard. The scandals would stop coming.\n  However, in late March, the inspector general once again released a \nscathingly critical report warning us about bad things happening at the \nInterior Department. This time the subject was Julie MacDonald, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Mr. Laverty would be \nthe immediate supervisor of the position Ms. MacDonald held.\n  In detail, the inspector general told us two things about Ms. \nMacDonald. One, she violated Federal rules by leaking internal Fish and \nWildlife Service records to business groups actively challenging the \nGovernment's environmental rulemaking process. In the process, she has \nbeen undermining her own agency's cases in court. Two, without any \nformal education in the natural sciences, she has bullied and \nthreatened FWS scientists and forced changes in their reports to suit \nher own political and personal agendas. FWS attorneys no longer will \nsign off on reports if they know the reports passed through her hands \nbecause they no longer are certain of the accuracy.\n  This sort of conduct is simply unacceptable. If you agree to work in \nthe Interior Department, your loyalty should be with the Interior \nDepartment and protecting this country's natural treasures. Ms. \nMacDonald's loyalty lay elsewhere.\n  The inspector general sent his report on Ms. MacDonald to the \nInterior Department for administrative action more than a month ago. \nThe Interior Department had no public comment. Only after I announced \nthat I would place a hold on Mr. Laverty's nomination did Ms. MacDonald \nresign. That removes her from the equation, but not the atmosphere that \nallowed her to operate as she did for so long.\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\n  In case I wasn't perfectly clear last year at his confirmation \nhearing, I want to be sure that Secretary Kempthorne knows that I am \nserious. The Interior Department has been a source of shame to this \ngovernment for too long. It is failing in its mission to protect the \npublic land and balance the needs of the American people with wisdom \nand integrity. It has stumbled from one misstep to another, from one \nscandal to another, and I have to question who is in charge over there.\n  I want to hear from Secretary Kempthorne what action he plans to take \nto be certain that we won't see this sort of problem again. I want to \nhear from Mr. Laverty what he would do, if he is confirmed to the post \nof Assistant Secretary, to end the politicization of the Fish and \nWildlife Service. We cannot continue to have government scientists \nwhose work is manipulated and conclusions are rewritten by political \nappointees. We cannot continue to have federal officials working \nsecretly with groups challenging their own agencies.\n  Until I receive these assurances, I will object to any unanimous \nconsent agreement to allow Mr. Laverty's nomination to come to a vote \nin the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5390-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IDAHO GUNFIGHTERS HONORED\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on March 30, Secretary of Defense Robert \nGates announced that Mountain Home Air Force Base in my home State of \nIdaho had earned the coveted 2007 Commander in Chief's Annual Award for \nInstallation Excellence. This Presidential honor is given only to a \nsingle installation in each of the military branches for outstanding \nand innovative efforts by installation personnel. I am honored to be \nable to publicly herald this tremendous achievement by Colonel Rock and \nall the men and women of Mountain Home Air Force Base.\n  This high honor reflects a sustained level of excellence by all the \nGunfighters of Mountain Home. Installation of the Year can only be \nachieved if everyone, from the wing commander to airmen working in all \naspects of operations and support, has their priorities straight and \nexpectations for personal duty performance at the highest level. \nImproving the structures that protect valuable aircraft, creative and \nresponsible financial management with regard to improving facilities, \nand a commitment to Air Force families are just some of the ways in \nwhich Mountain Home Air Force Base demonstrated its excellence this \nyear. The Gunfighters have maintained this strong tradition of \nsuperiority and excellence for over half a century. The missions have \nchanged over the years, but Gunfighter commitment and performance has \nnot.\n  Idahoans can be very proud of their Gunfighters. Mountain Home Air \nForce Base is as much a part of Idaho history as the magnificent \nvalleys, rivers, and plateaus that surround the base. The 366th Fighter \nWing is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the national \nsecurity of the United States. The missions currently headquartered at \nMountain Home comprise a vital component of our comprehensive military \ndefensive and offensive force. Idaho is fortunate to be host and home \nto these defenders of freedom.\n  Idaho benefits from Mountain Home Air Force Base, not just when the \nmilitary men and women serving out their assignments there call our \nState ``home'' for a time in their military careers but also when some \nreturn to call Idaho home permanently in retirement.\n  I offer my sincere congratulations to the Gunfighters and my \nheartfelt gratitude for their service to our great country, in defense \nof my freedom and that of my family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5390-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB HUDSON\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nthe public service of Bob Hudson, city manger of Farmington, NM.\n  Bob first came to New Mexico in 1982 to take on the job as director \nof parks, recreation & cultural affairs in Farmington. Since that time \nhe has served the citizens of Farmington faithfully, eventually \nbecoming city manager in 1999.\n  Bob's commitment to the community of Farmington did not end with his \nofficial duties. He has also served on the boards of several local \norganizations including the Boys & Girls Club, the Farmington Inter-\ntribal Indian Organization, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  The citizens of Farmington are well aware of Bob's contributions to \ntheir community and have honored him with numerous awards, including \nthe New Mexico Distinguished Public Service Award in 1991 and the Elks \nCitizen of the Year award in 1995. Bob was also inducted into the \nHistory Makers Hall of Fame by the Farmington Chamber of Commerce in \n2001 and the recipient of the 2005 Public Employee of the Year award.\n  Bob is retiring in April to devote more time to his family, but I am \nsure his dedication to the community of Farmington will not end. I wish \nhim the best in retirement and thank him for his long years of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5390-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 3:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the Speaker has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1591.

A bill to protect Indian arts and crafts through the \nimprovement of applicable criminal proceedings, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \nSenator Thomas, Senator Kyl, and Senator Domenici in introducing a bill \nto amend the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. This legislation would improve \nFederal laws that protect the integrity and originality of Native \nAmerican arts and crafts.\n  The Indian Arts and Crafts Act prohibits the misrepresentation in \nmarketing of Indian arts and crafts products, and makes it illegal to \ndisplay or sell works in a manner that falsely suggests it is the \nproduct of an individual Indian or Indian Tribe.\n  Unfortunately, the law is written so that only the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, FBI, acting on behalf of the Attorney General, can \ninvestigate and make arrests in cases of suspected Indian art \ncounterfeiters. The bill we are introducing would amend the law to \nexpand existing Federal investigative authority by authorizing other \nFederal investigative bodies, such as the BIA Office of Law \nEnforcement, in addition to the FBI, to investigate cases of \nmisrepresentation of Indian arts and crafts. This bill is similar to \nprovisions included in the Native American Omnibus Act, S. 536, and S. \n1375, which passed the Senate at the end of the last Congress but were \nnot acted on by the House.\n  A major source of tribal and individual Indian income is derived from \nthe sale of handmade Indian arts and crafts. Yet millions of dollars \nare diverted each year from these original artists and Indian tribes by \nthose who reproduce and sell counterfeit Indian goods. Few, if any, \ncriminal prosecutions have been brought in Federal court for such \nviolations. It is understandable that enforcing the criminal law under \nthe Indian Arts and Crafts Act is often stalled by the other \nresponsibilities of the FBI including investigating terrorism activity \nand violent crimes in Indian country. Therefore, expanding the \ninvestigative authority to include other Federal agencies is intended \nto promote the active investigation of alleged misconduct. It is my \nhope that this much needed change will deter those who choose to \nviolate the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1256. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to reauthorize loan \nprograms under that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join with \nSenator Kerry in introducing, the Small Business Lending \nReauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. This bill is especially \ntimely considering the Nation recently celebrated National Small \nBusiness Week, and this body just passed the America COMPETES Act, a \nbill that invests in innovation and education to improve the \ncompetitiveness of the United States in the global economy.\n  The impact small businesses have on our country's economy and the \ntechnological innovations they create simply cannot be overstated. \nSmall hi-tech firms represent the most innovative sector in America. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, \nthese businesses hold over 40 percent of the Nation's patents, obtain \n13 to 14 times more patents per\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\nemployee than large businesses, and secure patents which are twice as \ntechnologically significant as larger firms. With American jobs and our \nsecurity at stake, it is essential that we support innovation programs \nto meet national challenges in defense, healthcare, energy, and \ninformation technology.\n  A critical partner for small businesses is the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, whose fundamental purpose is to ``aid, counsel, \nassist, and protect the interests of small-business concerns.'' The \nSBA's methods for carrying out this mandate vary widely, but the \nagency's primary tool is found in its small business lending programs. \nThe SBA's 7(a), 504, and Microloan programs are tailored to encourage \nsmall business growth and expansion. With small businesses representing \n99 percent of all employers, creating nearly 75 percent of all net new \njobs, and employing 51 percent of the private-sector workforce, it is \nessential that Congress affirms long-term stability in the lending \nprograms the SBA provides to the small business community.\n  As it has in the past, the SBA continues to meet the demands of small \nbusinesses, both in my home state of Maine and across the county. In \nfiscal Year 2006, the SBA backed a net 100,197 loans totaling over \n$19.1 billion under the 7(a) and 504 programs. In fact, both the number \nof loans and the dollar amount represent record amounts for the \nagency--dramatically highlighting the significance of the SBA and the \ncritical role it plays in our nation's economy.\n  The foundation for the bill Senator Kerry and I are introducing today \nstarted during the 109th Congress under an extensive reauthorization \nprocess which I led. This process ultimately culminated in the \nunanimous Small Business Committee passage of a comprehensive SBA \nreauthorization bill. I firmly believe that the Small Business Lending \nReauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007 will help the SBA continue \nits legacy of achievement.\n  The SBA's loan and investment programs have produced success story \nafter success story, which include assisting the founders of Intel, \nStaples, and Federal Express, as well as thousands of other successful \nbusinesses. Our bipartisan measure will build upon these past successes \nand make the SBA even more effective. As former Chair and now ranking \nmember of the Small Business Committee, I believe we must do everything \npossible to sustain prosperity and job creation throughout the United \nStates. To achieve that goal, I have long fought to solidify and expand \nthe reach of the SBA's programs that have helped millions of aspiring \nentrepreneurs and existing small businesses.\n  Small businesses yearn to grow, flourish, and thrive, and the SBA has \nthe experience and the resources to be their bridge to success. It is \nessential that we upgrade the SBA's core lending programs for the 21st \ncentury entrepreneur. The American economy needs a strong and vibrant \nSmall Business Administration. The Small Business Lending \nReauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007 will build on the previous \nsuccess of the Agency, and help to ensure the success of tomorrow's \nentrepreneurs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1257. A bill to provide the District of Columbia a voting seat and \nthe State of Utah an additional seat in the House of Representatives; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, to introduce bipartisan legislation that I believe \nis the breakthrough we have been searching for to bring House voting \nrepresentation to the residents of the District of Columbia, who have \nhistorically been denied this fundamental birthright.\n  I am proud to join with, DC Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and \nRepresentative Tom Davis, and the many others from both parties and \nboth houses who have worked without rest to remedy the \ndisenfranchisement of District residents since the capital was \nestablished in Washington in 1800. I especially want to thank my friend \nSenator Hatch for his influential support of this voting rights \nproposal, which would bring to an end a gross inconsistency with the \nfounding principles of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity today to finally bestow \nupon the citizens of the District of Columbia the civic entitlement \nevery other tax-paying American citizen enjoys no matter where he or \nshe resides, democracy's most essential right, voting representation in \nCongress.\n  The bill is simple. It would increase the number of voting \nrepresentatives in the House from 435 to 437 by providing the District \nwith a voting representative and by adding another congressional seat \nfor Utah, the next State in line to increase its representation based \non the 2000 Census.\n  Working cooperatively in the spirit of service to the people of \nWashington, DC, and Utah, Congresswoman Norton and Congressman Davis \nshepherded a similar proposal through the House Government Reform \nCommittee on March 13 by a vote of 24-5. The full House approved the \nmeasure April 20 by a vote of 241-177, a historic day unlike any other \nsince 1978 when Congress approved a constitutional amendment to give \nDistrict residents voting rights in the House and Senate. Of course, \nthat amendment came to naught when too few States ratified it.\n  The people of this city have waited far too long for this right. They \nhave been the direct target of terrorist attacks, and yet they have no \nrepresentative to vote in Congress on policies to protect their \nhomeland security. Citizens of Washington, DC, pay income taxes just \nlike everyone else. In fact, they pay more: Per capita, District \nresidents have the second highest Federal tax obligation. And yet they \nhave no voice in how high those taxes will be or how they will be \nspent. The District is also the only jurisdiction in the country that \nmust seek congressional approval, through the appropriations process, \nbefore spending locally-generated tax dollars. When Congress fails to \npass appropriations bills before the beginning of the fiscal year, the \nDistrict's budget is essentially frozen. And yet DC has no say in that \nappropriations process.\n  DC residents fight and die for our democracy but they cannot \nparticipate fully in it. I ask you, how can we effectively promote \ndemocracy abroad while denying it to hundreds of thousands of citizens \nin our Nation's Capital?\n  There is no good reason why DC residents have been denied \ncongressional representation. In 1800, when the nation's capital was \nestablished as the District of Columbia, an oversight left the area's \nresidents without congressional representation. Maryland and Virginia \nceded land for the capitol in 1788 and 1789, respectively, but it took \nanother 10 years for Congress to establish the District of Columbia. In \nthe interim, residents continued to vote either in Maryland or \nVirginia, but Congress withdrew those voting rights once the District \nwas founded. Unfortunately, apparently by omission, Congress neglected \nto establish new voting rights for the citizens of the new district.\n  The right to be counted, to have your voice heard by your government \nis central to a functioning democracy and fundamental to a free \nsociety. If we are willing to sacrifice our young men and women in the \nname of freedom, we must be willing to protect their freedoms as well. \nThis legislation would do just that.\n  In 2002, 10 cosponsors and I introduced the No Taxation without \nRepresentation Act. I held a hearing on the bill in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which I then chaired. It was the first hearing in \nCongress on DC voting rights since 1994. We reported the bill out of \ncommittee, but the Senate never took action on it.\n  Today, the tide has changed. Members from both parties have come \ntogether to find a solution to break the stalemates of the past that \nhave denied DC residents equal representation in Congress. The State of \nUtah has united in favor of a fourth congressional seat, and Senator \nHatch has lent his considerable support to this effort. Mr. President, \nthis legislation represents an uncommon victory for fairness and a rare \nbut hopefully increasingly more common example of what we can do if we \nwork together to accomplish our mutual goals.\n  The essence of our work in the legislative branch is compromise, and \nthe compromise reached by Senator Hatch\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nand I will bring partial voting representation to the District while \nensuring Utah receives the additional representation it is due.\n  I know there are those who believe this bill is unconstitutional. But \nthe District clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power \nto legislate ``in all cases whatsoever'' pertaining to the District, \nprovides ample authority for the legislative branch to give DC \nresidents voting rights.\n  Mr. President, this is our moment to do right here at home, just as \nwe have done throughout our history for our democratic allies abroad. \nBy giving the citizens of the District of Columbia a vote in the House, \nwe will ensure not only that their voices will finally be heard. We \nwill be following the imperative of our history and moral values. The \nFramers of our Constitution in effect placed with Congress the solemn \nresponsibility of assuring that the rights of DC citizens would be \nprotected in the future, just as it is our responsibility to protect \nthe rights of all citizens throughout this great country. Congress has \nfailed to meet this obligation for more than 200 years, and I am not \nprepared to make DC citizens wait another 200 years.\n  Mr. President, the tax-paying citizens of the District of Columbia \nhave been without congressional voting representation for too long. The \nHouse has acted. Now it is time for the Senate to act. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Hatch and me in support of this essential \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senate Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Joseph Lieberman \nand Senator Robert Bennett in introducing the District of Columbia \nVoting House Rights Act of 2007. Our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives recently passed similar legislation, H.R. 1905, that \nwould provide a fourth congressional seat for my home state of Utah and \nthe first voting member for the District of Columbia. No doubt, this is \na historic time for the citizens of the District of Columbia and a \nunique opportunity for Utah to receive a long overdue fourth \ncongressional seat.\n  The Founding Fathers made clear in article 1, section 8 of the \nConstitution that the District of Columbia would be the seat of the \nnational government and granted Congress the power ``[t]o exercise \nexclusive Legislation, in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not \nexceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, \nand the Acceptance of Congress become the Seat of the Government of the \nUnited States . . .'' This clause became effective in 1790 when \nCongress accepted land that Maryland and Virginia ceded to the United \nStates to create the national capital. Ten years later, in December \n1800, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia was vested in the \nFederal Government. Since then, District residents have not had the \nright to vote for Members of Congress. Additionally, article 1, section \n2 and section 3 of the Constitution provides that citizens of States \nshall have voting representation in the House and Senate.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have heard from many District \nresidents who believe strongly that their voice should be heard in \nCongress. They pay taxes, vote in presidential elections, and serve in \nthe military. Yet these nearly 600,000 Americans do not have a voting \nrepresentative in Congress. Many, including myself, have been reluctant \nto support previous proposals based upon the constitutional principle \nthat States, not territories, are afforded congressional \nrepresentation. I understand the argument that congressional \nrepresentation is dependent on statehood and, therefore, the \nConstitution would need to be amended before the District is given a \nvoting representative in Congress. While the Constitution does not \naffirmatively grant District residents the right to vote in \ncongressional elections, it does affirmatively grant Congress plenary \npower to govern the District's affairs. Indeed, the Constitution grants \nCongress exclusive authority to legislate all matters concerning the \nDistrict, and I believe this authority extends to the granting of \ncongressional voting rights for District residents.\n  I support this legislation not only because it rectifies the \nDistrict's undemocratic political status, but it gives my home State of \nUtah a long overdue fourth voting Member in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  During the 2000 Census count, Utah missed out on a fourth House seat \nby only 857 people. The Census Bureau counted members of the military \nserving abroad as residents of their home State, but did not count an \nestimated 14,000 Utah missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints living abroad. Utah took its fight for a fourth seat \nall the way to the Supreme Court, but lost. Instead, North Carolina \ngained another seat in the House by 856 residents. Since then, I have \nheard from many Utahns and share their frustrations about the outcome \nof the 2000 Census.\n  Why push for an additional seat now? Under normal circumstances, Utah \nwould have to wait until the 2010 Census to see if its growing \npopulation justifies another congressional seat. However, the proposed \nlegislation provides Utah a chance to receive another voting member of \nCongress 5 years early. That is equivalent to two and a half terms for \na Member of Congress and places the new Member well on his or her way \nin establishing seniority and influence for the benefit of Utah's \ncitizens. I don't think this is an offer we should dismiss.\n  I have some constitutional concerns with H.R. 1905's attempt to \nimpose an at-large seat upon my State of Utah. In States with more than \none seat in the House, Members are expected to represent insular \nconstituencies. Under H.R. 1905, residents of one State would be \nrepresented by two House Members while citizens in other States would \nhave one. In addition, in our constitutional system, States are \nresponsible for elections and Utah has chosen the approach it wants to \ntake by redistricting. I see no warrant for Congress to undermine this \nbalance and impose upon Utah a scheme it has not chosen for itself. For \nthis reason, in the proposed Senate legislation, I insisted that Utah \nbe required to redistrict to provide for the new seat. I believe that \nUtah's legislators deserve the freedom to determine their \nrepresentatives' districts without unjustified intrusion or mandate of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Additionally, the House bill would require Utah to hold a special \nelection in 2007 if the bill passes. The Senate version requires that \nboth seats be elected in the November 2008 general election. \nThereafter, both new Members would begin their service at the start of \nthe 111th Congress in 2009.\n  In conclusion, let me say that I recognize there are many who \nstrongly oppose this legislation. There are many who wish the District \nvoting rights issue would simply go away. The Democratic-controlled \nCongress could have simply pushed forward with legislation giving the \nDistrict of Columbia a seat without balancing a ``Democrat'' seat with \na ``Republican'' seat. I am pleased that this was not the case. The \nHouse of Representatives has already voted in favor of moving this \nlegislation forward. Now it is up to the Senate. Let me be clear, the \nproposed legislation does not provide Senate representation for the \nDistrict of Columbia. I am not in favor of granting two Senators for \nthe District and would not support such a proposal.\n  As one who represents Utah, I have an important responsibility to \nensure\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\nthat my State is dealt with properly and fairly. And, in light of the \nHouse's recent legislative action, I am determined to do all that I can \nto ensure that Utah's fourth seat configuration is done right. I want \nmy fellow Utahns to know that the window of opportunity is quickly \nclosing. In fact, I dare say there won't be another opportunity like \nthis again. For this reason, I intend to make the most of it and hope \nthat my Senate colleagues will support me in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 1259. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide assistance for developing countries to promote quality basic \neducation and to establish the achievement of universal basic education \nin all developing countries as an objective of United States foreign \nassistance policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce, along \nwith Senator Gordon Smith, the Education for All Act of 2007. This bill \nwould enable us to increase our spending on global education \ninitiatives in order to help millions of children around the world have \nthe opportunity to receive an education.\n  Worldwide, more than 77 million children do not have access to \nprimary school education. The majority of these--approximately 44 \nmillion--are girls. Approximately half of the school-age children who \nstart primary school do not complete it. And there are hundreds of \nmillions more children who are denied the opportunity to complete a \nsecondary school education--to become the next generation of doctors, \nnurses, lawyers, scientists, and teachers. These statistics represent a \nunconscionable misuse of human potential--a misuse that we can and must \nremedy.\n  In 2000, the United States, along with other governments around the \nworld, committed to the goal of achieving universal basic education by \n2015. Through some of the initiatives and partnership in which our \ngovernment is participating, such as the Education for All Fast Track \nInitiative, we have made progress. Since the Fast Track Initiative was \nlaunched in 2002, approximately 4 million children each year have \ngained access to school.\n  Yet despite such gains, we are not on track to meet our 2015 goal. In \norder to do so, we would need to help millions more children enter \nschool each year--requiring a global financial commitment of more than \n$7 billion every year.\n  The Education for All Act of 2007 would authorize $10 billion in \nspending over the next 5 years, enabling the U.S. Government to make a \nsignificant commitment to reach the 2015 goal, and help children in \ndeveloping countries, particularly areas experiencing conflict or \nhumanitarian emergencies, have access to a quality basic education. The \nbill that I am introducing today will make a tangible difference in the \nlives of children around the world, by helping them to attend school \nand receive a quality education. And its impact will go far beyond the \nindividual, but will also benefit families, communities, and countries.\n  A 2004 report by Barbara Herz and Gene Sperling from the Center on \nUniversal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations detailed the \ngains that are to be made when we invest in education, particularly for \ngirls. A single year of primary education correlates with a 10-20 \npercent increase in women's wages later in life. An extra year of a \nwoman's education has been shown to reduce the risk that her children \nwill die in infancy by 5-10 percent, and a study of South Asia and Sub-\nSaharan Africa found that from 1960 to 1992, equality in education \nbetween men and women could have led to nearly 1 percent higher annual \nper capita GDP growth.\n  We have the data to show that education is the path to good jobs, \nstrong democracies, and stable societies. We have the capacity, \nresponsibility, and opportunity to help millions of children worldwide. \nAll it takes now is the will to expand access to educational \nopportunity.\n  I believe with bipartisan support we can turn this bill into law, and \nlead the world in meeting the goal of universal basic education, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in Congress in making \neducation for all a reality.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Education for \nAll Act of 2007 with my colleague from New York, Senator Hillary \nClinton. This legislation will focus U.S. efforts to help provide all \nchildren worldwide with a basic education. At this time, at least 77 \nmillion children of primary school age around the world are not in \nschool.\n  Basic education is a critical part of a child's development. In \naddition to providing children the tools necessary to succeed in life, \neducation provides a secondary purpose of helping to reduce poverty and \ninequality. A strong basic education system also lays the foundation \nfor sound governance, civic participation, and strong familial \ninstitutions. Without an education, children are less able to \ncontribute to a country's development, often becoming a burden on \nsociety.\n  A recent Government Accountability Office concluded there are seven \nU.S. Federal agencies providing international basic education services \nin approximately 70 countries. Unfortunately, the GAO also found \ninstances when agencies did not coordinate the planning or delivery of \ninternational basic education activities. To maximize the impact of \nU.S. aid dollars, we must efficiently coordinate between government \nagencies to decrease redundant spending on overlapping programs. The \nEducation for All Act will help achieve this.\n  In 2000, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, the United \nStates was one of 180 countries to commit to the goal of universal \nbasic education by 2015. Since then, we have enhanced our efforts to \nprovide basic education overseas. From fiscal years 2001 to 2006, \nUSAID, the Departments of State and Defense and the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation allocated $2.2 billion to support our basic \ninternational education efforts. During this same period, the \nDepartments of Agriculture and Labor further allocated an estimated $1 \nbillion to programs with basic education as a component. I am proud of \nour country's generosity and commitment to this important goal.\n  Our bill will ensure the United States provides the resources and \nleadership necessary to supply all children with a quality basic \neducation. It calls on the President to establish a comprehensive \nstrategy for achieving universal basic education by 2015. This strategy \nshould include actions toward improving coordination, reducing \nduplication, expanding public-private partnerships, leveraging \nresources and maximizing the use of American technical experts. The \nbill also establishes a U.S. Education for All Coordinator, an \nambassador-level position appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate. The Coordinator will manage U.S. efforts to ensure aid \ndollars are used in the most effective manner possible.\n  The bill further establishes a fellowship program at USAID which \nallows qualified individuals to serve 3-year terms as Basic Education \nfellows, helping establish and carry out basic education policy and \nprogramming. This fellowship will broaden U.S. capabilities in the \nareas of technical assistance and training. Finally, the bill \nauthorizes $1 billion for fiscal year 2008, $1.5 billion for fiscal \nyear 2009, $2 billion for fiscal year 2010, $2.5 billion for fiscal \nyear 2011, and $3 billion for fiscal year 2012 for international basic \neducation programs.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting the noble ambition of \nachieving universal basic education by endorsing the Education for All \nAct of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1261. A bill to amend title 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nrepeal the 10-year limit on use of Montgomery GI Bill educational \nassistance benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \ninvestment program in lifelong education for our service members and \nveterans. The Montgomery GI Bill is consistently cited as an important \nreason people join the military and continues to be one of the most \nimportant benefits provided for military service today. There is no \nreason why 100 percent of our active duty, selected reserve, and \nveteran servicemembers should not have the\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\nopportunity to take advantage of their earned education benefits.\n  That is why I'm reintroducing the Montgomery GI Bill for Life Act of \n2007, which would allow Montgomery GI Bill participants an unlimited \namount of time to use their earned benefits.\n  I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, is again joining \nme in sponsoring this legislation and that Senator Sherrod Brown has \nalso signed on to further extend MGIB benefits.\n  The MGIB is a program that provides up to 36 months of education \nbenefits for educational opportunities ranging from college to \napprenticeship and job training, and even flight training. Upon \nenlistment, the GI Bill also requires service members to contribute \n$100 per month for their first 12 months of services.\n  Basically, the MGIB is divided into two programs. One program targets \nactive duty and veteran members, paying over $1,000 per month to \nqualified students. That's more than $36,000 for school. The other is \ndirected at the Selected Reserve. This program provides educational \nbenefits of $288 per month, for a total of $10,368.\n  If recruits are overwhelmingly declaring that education opportunity \nunder the GI Bill is the key incentive for them to join the military, \nthen it makes sense that most--if not all--of our troops, who signed up \nfor the program, would also be cashing in on their benefits. But \nreports show that the majority, 40 to 60 percent, do not actually use \nthe benefits they have earned.\n  Currently, MGIB participants have up to 10 years from their release \ndate from the military to use their earned education benefits. Members \nof the Selected Reserve are able to use their MGIB benefit for 14 \nyears. However, that means your earned education benefits expire if you \ndon't use the within the required timeframe, closing your window of \nopportunity to go to school or finish your college education. Plus, you \nlose the $1,200 dedicated for your GI Bill during your first year of \nenlistment.\n  Originally, the intent of 1944 GI Bill of Rights was to help veterans \nsuccessfully transition back into civilian life as education is the key \nto employment opportunities. Looking back now, we know that the GI Bill \nopened the door to higher education, helping millions of service \nmembers and veterans who wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to pay \nfor college. That is, servicemembers benefited from the GI Bill because \nthey used the payments within the 10 and 14 year limitation.\n\n  But there are many others who did not use their earned education \nbenefits within that timeframe. For example, after leaving the \nmilitary, some servicemembers postponed going to school because they \nhad to go straight to work in order to support their family. Others \nunfortunately, were either homeless or incarcerated for long periods of \ntime due to disability associated with military service, but are now \nready to move forward in their lives, and going back to school is their \nfirst step. In some cases, due to random life circumstances, some \npeople just lost track of time. Additionally, because of misinformation \nand bureaucratic language, the GI Bill is known as a complicated \nprogram to navigate.\n  A constituent of mine, Ruben Ruelas--who is a Local Veterans \nEmployment Representative, LVER, for the WorkSource in Wenatchee, \nWashington, wrote to me saying, ``It's been my experience that most \npeople don't know what they want to do in life or are placed in \nsituations where, due to changing economic times, they are displaced \nand need further education and training to compete for jobs. But most \ndon't have access to training resources to do so.''\n  In terms of Vietnam Era veterans, Mr. Ruelas goes on to say, ``many \n50 year olds are unemployed, untrained and uneducated and could use \ntheir educational benefits to improve their skills to compete for \nbetter jobs. Many have come to realize, too late, that they need \ncollege or retraining and don't have the resources to do so.''\n  While times have changed remarkably, one thing remains constant: \neducation is critical to employment opportunity. In the 21st Century \nglobal labor market, enhancing skills through education and job \ntraining is now more important than ever. The need for retraining is \neven more underscored for our military service members and veterans.\n  My legislation, the Montgomery GI Bill for Life, would ensure that \neducational opportunities are lifelong, allowing service members and \nveterans the flexibility to seek education and job training \nopportunities when it is the right time for them to do so.\n  Higher education not only serves as an individual benefit, but \npositive externalities have transpired: the GI Bill was instrumental in \nbuilding our country's middle class and continues to help close the \ncollege education gap.\n  Today, employers are requiring higher qualifications from the \nworkforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that six of the ten \nfastest-growing occupations require an associate's degree or bachelor's \ndegree. By 2010, 40 percent of all job growth will require some form of \npostsecondary education. While a highly skilled workforce is one \ncharacteristic of the new economy, working for one employer throughout \na lifetime is no longer routine, but rather an evanescent feature. \nAccording to findings by Brigham Young University, the average person \nchanges jobs or careers eight times in his or her lifetime. To keep up \nwith these trends, expanding access to education and training is a must \ndo in the 21st Century global marketplace.\n  A 1999 report by the Congressional Commission on Service members and \nVeterans Transition Assistance stated that the GI Bill of the future \nmust include the following: Provide veterans with access to post-\nsecondary education that they use; assist the Armed forces in \nrecruiting the high quality high school graduates needed; enhance the \nNation's competitiveness by further educating American veterans, a \npopulation that is already self-disciplined, goal oriented, and \nsteadfast; and attract the kind of service members who will go on to \noccupy leadership positions in government and the private sector.\n  Eliminating the GI Bill 10 and 14 year limitation for service \nmembers, veterans, and Selected Reserve moves one step toward improving \nthe MGIB. The Montgomery GI Bill for Life would allow MGIB members, \nincluding qualified Vietnam Era Veterans, the flexibility to access \ntheir earned education benefits at any time.\n  As the nation's economy continues to recover and grow stronger, the \nGI Bill will continue to be the primary vehicle keeping our active duty \nservice members and veterans of military service on track, helping to \nensure our country's prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5398-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5398-S5400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 178--EXPRESSING THE SYMPATHY OF THE SENATE TO THE \nFAMILIES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS MURDERED IN GUATEMALA, AND ENCOURAGING THE \n  UNITED STATES TO WORK WITH GUATEMALA TO BRING AN END TO THESE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 178\n\n       Whereas, since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have \n     been murdered in Guatemala;\n       Whereas most of the victims are women ranging in age from \n     18 to 30, with many of the cases involving abduction, sexual \n     violence, or brutal mutilation;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to 2006, the rate at which women have \n     been murdered in Guatemala has almost doubled, increasing at \n     a higher rate than the murder rate of men in Guatemala during \n     the same period;\n       Whereas, according to data from Guatemala's Public \n     Prosecutors Office, few arrests and fewer convictions have \n     occurred, and prosecutors, forensics experts, and other state \n     justice officials have not brought the perpetrators to \n     justice;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to 2006, there were only 20 convictions \n     for the murders of women and girls;\n       Whereas the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Government of \n     Guatemala has reported that in 1 year alone police officers \n     were implicated on 10 separate occasions in the murder of \n     women in Guatemala, and recommended that such officers and \n     other officials be held accountable for their acts;\n       Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial \n     system is key to the administration of justice, and the \n     failure to ensure proper investigations and prosecutions \n     hampers the ability to solve crimes and punish perpetrators;\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\n       Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical \n     resources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical \n     expertise, have impeded the arrest and prosecution of \n     suspects;\n       Whereas the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Women of \n     the Government of Guatemala has reported that her office has \n     reviewed approximately 800 incidents of domestic violence per \n     month, with some of those cases ending in murder, and that \n     deaths could have been prevented if the legal system of \n     Guatemala provided for prison sentences in cases of domestic \n     violence;\n       Whereas the murders of women and girls in Guatemala have \n     brought pain to the families and friends of the victims as \n     they struggle to cope with the loss of their loved ones and \n     the fact that the perpetrators of these heinous acts remain \n     unknown to the proper authorities;\n       Whereas many countries in Latin America face significant \n     challenges in combating violence against women, and \n     international cooperation is essential in addressing this \n     serious issue;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) has provided assistance to the Government \n     of Guatemala to implement judicial reform and rule of law \n     programs, and in fiscal year 2006, Congress provided \n     $1,500,000 for programs to combat impunity, corruption, and \n     crimes of violence, of which $500,000 is to be allocated to \n     strengthen the special prosecutorial units charged with \n     investigating the murders of women in Guatemala;\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala has undertaken efforts \n     to prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its \n     ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Torture \n     and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984, the United \n     Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women, done at New York December 18, \n     1979, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, \n     Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women, done \n     at Belem do Para, Brazil June 9, 1994, and other \n     international human rights treaties, and the enactment of \n     laws and the creation of state institutions to promote and \n     protect the rights of women;\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala has created special \n     police and prosecutorial units to address the brutal murders \n     of women in Guatemala;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, the Government of Guatemala \n     successfully abolished the ``Rape Law'' which had absolved \n     perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape and certain \n     other crimes of violence upon the perpetrator's marriage with \n     the victim;\n       Whereas legislators from various parties in Guatemala have \n     joined lawmakers from Mexico and Spain to form the \n     ``Interparliamentary Network against `Femicide' '';\n       Whereas the Government of Guatemala and the United Nations \n     recently entered into an agreement to establish the \n     International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala \n     (CICIG), which has a mandate to investigate and promote the \n     prosecution of illegal security groups and clandestine \n     security organizations that function with impunity and are \n     suspected of attacking human rights defenders, justice \n     officials, and other civil society actors; and\n       Whereas continuing impunity for crimes against women is a \n     threat to the rule of law, democracy, and stability in \n     Guatemala: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its sincerest condolences and deepest \n     sympathy to the families of women and girls murdered in \n     Guatemala, and recognizes their courageous struggle in \n     seeking justice for the victims;\n       (2) expresses the solidarity of the people of the United \n     States with the people of Guatemala in the face of these \n     tragic and senseless acts;\n       (3) condemns the ongoing murders of women and girls in \n     Guatemala, and encourages the Government of Guatemala to act \n     with due diligence in order to promptly investigate these \n     killings, prosecute those responsible, and continue to work \n     toward eliminating violence against women;\n       (4) urges the Government of Guatemala to recognize domestic \n     violence and sexual harassment as criminal acts and to \n     provide the resources and commitment necessary to strengthen \n     the integrity of the prosecutorial and judicial systems;\n       (5) urges the President and the Secretary of State to \n     incorporate the investigative and preventative efforts of the \n     Government of Guatemala regarding the murder of women and \n     girls into the bilateral agenda between the Governments of \n     Guatemala and the United States;\n       (6) encourages the Secretary of State to support efforts by \n     the Government of Guatemala to train and equip the special \n     police and prosecutorial units of the Government of Guatemala \n     to conduct thorough and proper investigations of crimes of \n     violence against women, and to implement judicial reform and \n     rule of law programs;\n       (7) encourages the Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General to provide assistance in establishing a comprehensive \n     missing persons system and an effective state protection \n     program for witnesses, victims' relatives, and human rights \n     defenders;\n       (8) urges the Government of Guatemala to hold accountable \n     those law enforcement and judicial officials whose failure to \n     investigate and prosecute the murders adequately, whether \n     through negligence, omission, or abuse, has led to impunity \n     for these crimes;\n       (9) encourages the Secretary of State to support efforts to \n     identify perpetrators and unknown victims through forensic \n     analysis, including assisting the Government of Guatemala in \n     adequately funding the National Institute for Forensic \n     Science (INACIF) and training lab personnel in investigatory \n     and evidence gathering protocols;\n       (10) urges the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to express support for the efforts of the victims' \n     families and loved ones to seek justice for the victims,\n       (B) to express concern relating to any harassment of these \n     families and the human rights defenders with whom they work, \n     and\n       (C) to express concern with respect to impediments in the \n     ability of the families to receive prompt and accurate \n     information in their cases;\n       (11) encourages the Secretary of State to continue to \n     include in the Department of State's annual Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices all instances of improper \n     investigatory methods, threats against human rights \n     activists, and the use of torture with respect to cases \n     involving the murder and abduction of women and girls in \n     Guatemala;\n       (12) recommends that the United States Ambassador to \n     Guatemala continue to meet with the families of the victims, \n     women's rights organizations, and the officials of the \n     Government of Guatemala who are responsible for investigating \n     these crimes; and\n       (13) recommends that the Secretary of State develop a \n     comprehensive plan to address and combat the growing problem \n     of violence against women in Latin America.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragic \ndeaths of women and girls in Guatemala, and to submit a resolution \nurging increased U.S. involvement in addressing this serious issue.\n  Since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have been murdered in \nGuatemala. The murder rate of these women almost doubled from 2001 to \n2006, increasing at a higher rate than the murder rate of men. While \nthese killings may be due to a variety of factors, what clearly unifies \nthese cases is the fact that very few of the perpetrators have been \nbrought to justice. Indeed, it is my understanding that as of 2006 \nthere have been only 20 convictions for these killings. In some of the \ncases police have been implicated in the crimes.\n  The lack of respect for the rule of law, inadequate legal protections \nfor women, ongoing violence in the country, corruption, insufficient \nresources, substandard investigations, and the lack of independent and \neffective judicial and prosecutorial systems, all contribute to the \ninability of the Government of Guatemala to hold those responsible for \nthese killings accountable for their crimes. The result is a general \nsense of impunity for crimes against women in the country.\n  The Government of Guatemala has taken some steps to address these \nkillings. Guatemala has created special police and prosecutorial units \nto investigate these murders, and repealed the so called ``Rape Law'' \nwhich had absolved perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape \nupon the perpetrator's marriage with the victim. The Government also \nrecently entered into an agreement with the United Nations to establish \nthe International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, \nwhich has a mandate to investigate and prosecute illegal security \ngroups operating with impunity. And Guatemala established the National \nInstitute for Forensic Sciences to improve investigatory and evidence \ngathering efforts.\n  The resolution I am submitting today is aimed at raising awareness of \nthis issue and encouraging the governments of Guatemala and the United \nStates to work together to stop these killings. Among other things, the \nresolution: condemns these murders and expresses the sympathy of the \nSenate to the families of women and girls murdered in Guatemala; \nencourages the Government of Guatemala to act with due diligence in \ninvestigating and prosecuting those responsible for these crimes; urges \nthe Government of Guatemala to recognize domestic violence as a \ncriminal act and to provide adequate resources necessary to strengthen \nthe integrity of the prosecutorial and judicial systems; urges the \nPresident and the Secretary of State to incorporate this issue into the \nbilateral agenda between the governments of Guatemala and the United \nStates; and encourages the Secretary of State to provide assistance in \ntraining and\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nequipping special police units to investigate these crimes, \nimplementing judicial reforms and rule of law programs, establishing a \nmissing persons system, creating an effective witness protection \nprogram, and supporting efforts to enhance forensic capabilities.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nresolution and give this issue the attention it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5400-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 179--WELCOMING THE PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE ON THE \nOCCASION OF HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n    THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN), EXPRESSING \n  GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE FOR ITS STRONG COOPERATION \n     WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM, AND \n   REAFFIRMING THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CONTINUED \n EXPANSION OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND \n                               SINGAPORE\n\n  Mr. BOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. VITTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1082, to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct to reauthorize and amend the prescription drug user fee provisions, \nand for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                TITLE--IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market Access \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 1,000 percent more to fill \n     their prescriptions than consumers in other countries.\n       (2) The United States is the world's largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals yet consumers still pay the world's highest \n     prices.\n       (3) An unaffordable drug is neither safe nor effective. \n     Allowing and structuring the importation of prescription \n     drugs ensures access to affordable drugs, thus providing a \n     level of safety to American consumers they do not currently \n     enjoy.\n       (4) Prescription drug costs are a leading cause of the \n     growth in United States health care spending, which reached \n     nearly $2,000,000,0000 in 2005, of which spending on \n     prescription drugs amounted to $200,700,000,000.\n       (5) According to the Congressional Budget Office, American \n     seniors alone will spend $1,800,000,000,000 on \n     pharmaceuticals over the next 10 years.\n       (6) Allowing open pharmaceutical markets could save \n     American consumers at least $635,000,000,000 of their own \n     money.\n\n     SEC. _03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) give all Americans immediate relief from the \n     outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals;\n       (2) reverse the perverse economics of the American \n     pharmaceutical market;\n       (3) allow the importation of prescription drugs only if the \n     drugs and facilities where such drugs are manufactured are \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and to exclude \n     pharmaceutical narcotics;\n       (4) ensure continued integrity to the prescription drug \n     supply of the United States by--\n       (A) requiring that imported prescription drugs be packaged \n     and shipped using counterfeit-resistant technologies;\n       (B) requiring Internet pharmacies to register with the \n     United States Government for Americans to verify authenticity \n     before purchases over the Internet;\n       (C) requiring all foreign sellers to register with United \n     States Government and submit to facility inspections by the \n     Government without prior notice; and\n       (D) limiting the eligible countries from which prescription \n     drugs may be imported to Canada, member countries of the \n     European Union, and other highly industrialized nations with \n     safe pharmaceutical infrastructures.\n\n     SEC. _04.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle Market \n     Access Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that also carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regiment that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat the turtles for salmonella and maintain a safe pet.\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Food and Drug Administration shall not restrict the \n     sale by a turtle farmer or other commercial retail seller of \n     a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a \n     pet if--\n       (1) the turtle is raised, shipped, and sold using methods \n     that are proven to keep the turtle free of salmonella, using \n     salmonella safety standards that are comparable to such \n     standards relating to other animals, including reptiles and \n     amphibians, that are allowed for sale as pets, or animal \n     products that are allowed for sale as food products;\n       (2) the Administration has approved a plan submitted by the \n     turtle farmer or commercial retail seller involved relating \n     to compliance with paragraph (1); and\n       (3) the farmer or other commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (ii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iii) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, as the turtle may \n     become an invasive species to the local community, but should \n     instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or \n     other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted \n     as pets.\n       (b) Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--A turtle farmer or other commercial seller \n     that desires to sell a turtle as provided for under \n     subsection (a) shall submit a plan to the Food and Drug \n     Administration that details the manner in which the farmer or \n     seller will ensure compliance with the requirements of \n     subsection (a)(1) with respect to the turtles involved. The \n     plan shall include use of non-antibiotic compounds that \n     suppress or eliminate the presence of salmonella in turtle \n     hatchlings.\n       (2) Action by fda.--Not later 30 days after the date on \n     which the Food and Drug Administration receives a plan under \n     paragraph (1), the Administration shall accept or reject such \n     plan. If such plan is rejected, the Administration shall \n     provide clear, specific guidance on the reasons for such \n     rejection. The Administration may only reject such a plan if \n     it is determined that the plan fails to achieve the same \n     salmonella safety standards as such standards relating to \n     other animals, including reptiles and amphibians, that are \n     allowed for sale as pets, or animal products that are allowed \n     for sale as food products.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to permit the Food and Drug Administration to hold \n     the sale of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\n     diameter as a pet to any greater salmonella safety standard \n     applicable to other reptiles or amphibians sold as pets, \n     animals sold as pets, or food products regulated by such \n     Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 987.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drugs make up 11 percent of the national \n     health care spending but are 1 of the largest and fastest \n     growing health care expenditures;\n       (2) 56 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United \n     States are generic drugs, yet they account for only 13percent \n     of all expenditures;\n       (3) generic drugs, on average, cost 63 percent less than \n     their brand-name counterparts;\n       (4) consumers and the health care system would benefit from \n     free and open competition in the pharmaceutical market and \n     the removal of obstacles to the introduction of generic \n     drugs;\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n       (5) full and free competition in the pharmaceutical \n     industry, and the full enforcement of antitrust law to \n     prevent anticompetitive practices in this industry, will lead \n     to lower prices, greater innovation, and inure to the general \n     benefit of consumers.\n       (6) the Federal Trade Commission has determined that some \n     brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic \n     drug manufacturers to delay the marketing of competing, low-\n     cost, generic drugs;\n       (7) collusion by the brand name pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers is contrary to free competition, to the \n     interests of consumers, and to the principles underlying \n     antitrust law;\n       (8) in 2005, 2 appellate court decisions reversed the \n     Federal Trade Commission's long-standing position, and upheld \n     settlements that include pay-offs by brand name \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to generic manufacturers \n     designed to keep generic competition off the market;\n       (9) in the 6 months following the March 2005 court \n     decisions, the Federal Trade Commission found there were \n     three settlement agreements in which the generic received \n     compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to \n     market the product;\n       (10) the FTC found that more than \\2/3\\ of the \n     approximately ten settlement agreements made in 2006 include \n     a pay-off from the brand in exchange for a promise by the \n     generic company to delay entry into the market; and\n       (11) settlements which include a payment from a brand name \n     manufacturer to a generic manufacturer to delay entry by \n     generic drugs are anti-competitive and contrary to the \n     interests of consumers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between \n     brand name and generic drug manufacturers intended to keep \n     generic drugs off the market;\n       (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion in the \n     pharmaceutical industry; and\n       (3) to clarify the law to prohibit payments from brand name \n     to generic drug manufacturers with the purpose to prevent or \n     delay the entry of competition from generic drugs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Pet Turtle Market \n     Access Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter have \n     been banned for sale in the United States by the Food and \n     Drug Administration since 1975 due to health concerns.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale \n     of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other \n     amphibians or reptiles that are sold as pets in the United \n     States that also carry salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug \n     Administration also does not require that these animals be \n     treated for salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets.\n       (3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, and \n     make them safe for sale, has greatly advanced since 1975. \n     Treatments exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella from \n     turtles, and individuals are more aware of the causes of \n     salmonella, how to treat salmonella poisoning, and the \n     seriousness associated with salmonella poisoning.\n       (4) University research has shown that these turtles can be \n     treated in such a way that they can be raised, shipped, and \n     distributed without having a recolonization of salmonella.\n       (5) University research has also shown that pet owners can \n     be equipped with a treatment regiment that allows the turtle \n     to be maintained safe from salmonella.\n       (6) The Food and Drug Administration should allow the sale \n     of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as pets as \n     long as the sellers are required to use proven methods to \n     treat these turtles for salmonella.\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF BABY TURTLES.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Food \n     and Drug Administration shall not restrict the sale by a \n     turtle farmer, wholesaler or commercial retail seller of a \n     turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter as a \n     pet if--\n       (1) the State or territory in which such farmer is located \n     has developed a regulatory process by which pet turtle \n     farmers are required to have a State license to breed, hatch, \n     propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, transport, export, or \n     sell pet turtles or pet turtle eggs;\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\n       (2) such State or territory requires certification of \n     sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian who is licensed \n     in the State or territory, and approved by the State or \n     territory agency in charge of regulating the sale of pet \n     turtles;\n       (3) the certification of sanitization requires each turtle \n     to be sanitized or treated for diseases, including \n     salmonella, and is dependant upon using the Siebeling method, \n     or other such proven method, which uses an antibiotic to make \n     the turtle salmonella-free; and\n       (4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail seller includes, \n     with the sale of such a turtle, a disclosure to the buyer \n     that includes--\n       (A) information regarding--\n       (i) the possibility that salmonella can re-colonize in \n     turtles;\n       (ii) the dangers, including possible severe illness or \n     death, especially for at-risk people who may be susceptible \n     to salmonella poisoning, such as children, pregnant women, \n     and others who may have weak immune systems, that could \n     result if the turtle is not properly handled and safely \n     maintained;\n       (iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including an \n     explanation of proper hygiene such as handwashing after \n     handling a turtle; and\n       (iv) the proven methods of treatment that, if properly \n     applied, keep the turtle safe from salmonella;\n       (B) a detailed explanation of how to properly treat the \n     turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, using the proven \n     methods of treatment referred to under subparagraph (A), and \n     how the buyer can continue to purchase the tools, treatments, \n     or any other required item to continually treat the turtle; \n     and\n       (C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles should not \n     abandon the turtle or abandon it outside, as the turtle may \n     become an invasive species to the local community, but should \n     instead return them to a commercial retail pet seller or \n     other organization that would accept turtles no longer wanted \n     as pets.\n       (b) FDA Review of State Protections.--The Food and Drug \n     Administration may, after providing an opportunity for the \n     affected State to respond, restrict the sale of a turtle only \n     if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that \n     the actual implementation of State health protections \n     described in subsection (a) are insufficient to protect \n     consumers against infectious diseases acquired from such \n     turtles at the time of sale.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1005.

JACK VALENTI\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to honor my good friend Jack \nValenti, who, passed away last week on April 26.\n  Throughout his life, Jack Valenti wore several hats, including that \nof a soldier, a devoted public servant, and a pioneer in the film \nindustry.\n  Jack was born on September 5, 1921, in Houston, TX and was the \ngrandson of Sicilian immigrants. At age 15, he became the youngest high \nschool graduate in the history of the city of Houston and began a \ncareer as an office boy with Exxon Oil.\n  Jack served honorably in the Army Air Corps during World War II, \nflying in 51 separate combat missions as pilot of the B-25 attack \nbomber with the 12th Air Force in Italy. He obtained the rank of \nlieutenant and received multiple decorations, including the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with four clusters, the \nDistinguished Unit Citation with one cluster, and the European Theater \nRibbon with four battle stars.\n  After serving in the war, Jack attended college at the University of \nHouston, doing all his undergraduate work at night as he worked during \nthe day. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1946 and later became \nthe University of Houston's first graduate ever to be admitted to \nHarvard Business School. He received an MBA from Harvard in 1948.\n  In the intervening years, Jack held many positions in this town, but \nin 1966 Jack resigned from a top position in the White House to become \nonly the third president of the Motion Picture Association of America, \nMPAA. He held this, his most famous position, for 38 years before \nretiring in 2004.\n  As president of MPAA, Jack arbitrated one of the most famous \ndevelopments the film industry has ever come out with--the voluntary \nrating system. The ratings ``G,'' ``PG,'' ``PG-13'' and ``R'' have \nbecome staples, not only in the movie-going practices of every American \nbut also in our Nation's cultural consciousness. However, more \nimportant than the societal notions and the cliched images associated \nwith these ratings is the real assistance that this system has provided \nto parents and families in evaluating the appropriateness of various \nmovies. Indeed, the MPAA rating system pioneered by Jack Valenti has \nbecome a prime example of the effectiveness of industry self-regulation \nwithout government intervention, and I am very grateful for Jack's work \nin this area even when many in his industry fought him along the way.\n  In addition to pioneering the rating system, Jack Valenti also worked \nto advance the film industry into the 21st century. Indeed, during his \ntenure at the MPAA, he presided over unprecedented changes in the \nworldwide film industry, including the advancement of the digital era. \nI remember having several conversations with Jack as the film industry \nstruggled to deal with the new challenges presented by digital \ndistribution of their content. Together, Jack and I worked tirelessly \nto balance the competing demands of consumer's rights and the \nprotection of one of America's largest exports--entertainment.\n  With Jack's help, we were able to refocus the Federal Government's \nresources to more effectively protect the creative genius of a great \nAmerican industry--the film industry. We all know how blatantly some \nbad actors around the world pirate America's movies and rob the United \nStates of jobs. Thanks to Jack's efforts, we have made great strides in \nthis area and laid the groundwork to allow us to stamp out this \ncriminal activity in the years ahead. Combating the theft and piracy of \nintellectual property was a real passion for Jack, and I was privileged \nto work with him in this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, those of us who knew Jack Valenti personally will \nalways remember him as a charitable man who was devoted to his family. \nWhile his influence on the film industry has been famous and \nunmistakable, many of us will remember him more for the personal \nfriendship we shared with him. I will miss him greatly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 182) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 182\n\n       Whereas Jack Valenti was born September 5, 1921, in \n     Houston, Texas, the grandson of Sicilian immigrants, Joe and \n     Josephine Valenti, and was the youngest high school graduate \n     in the city at age 15;\n       Whereas Jack Valenti married his beloved Mary Margaret in \n     1962, with whom he had 3 children, John, Alexandra, and \n     Courtenay;\n       Whereas Jack Valenti joined the United States Army Air \n     Forces in 1942 and flew 51 combat missions as a pilot of a B-\n     25 attack bomber with the 12th Air Force in Italy during \n     World War II, obtained the rank of lieutenant, and received 4 \n     decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the \n     Air Medal with 4 clusters, the Distinguished Unit Citation \n     with one cluster, and the European Theater Ribbon with 4 \n     battle stars;\n       Whereas Jack Valenti received a B.A. degree from the \n     University of Houston in 1946 after doing all of his \n     undergraduate work at night and working during the day, and \n     became the first University of Houston graduate to be \n     admitted to Harvard Business School, receiving an M.B.A. \n     degree in 1948;\n       Whereas, in 1952, Jack Valenti cofounded Weekley and \n     Valenti, an advertising and political consulting agency that \n     worked on Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential campaign in \n     Texas, Representative Albert Thomas's run for Congress, and \n     John Connally's campaign for Governor of Texas;\n       Whereas Jack Valenti met then-Senate Majority Leader Lyndon \n     B. Johnson in 1957, the two became close friends, and Valenti \n     worked on Lyndon Johnson's presidential campaign during the \n     primaries of 1960;\n       Whereas Weekley and Valenti handled press during President \n     John F.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 183.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 183) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of National Charter Schools Week, April 30, 2007, through May \n     4, 2007.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to honor National Charter \nSchool Week. The role of charter schools has become increasingly \nimportant as these institutions have become one of the fastest growing \ninnovative forces in education policy. The District of Columbia and 40 \nStates have laws that allow charter schools. There are over 4,000 \npublic charter schools serving more than 1.1 million students and there \nare many more students on waiting lists who want to attend.\n  As many of you know, I have been a part of that charter school \ngrowth, both here in Washington, DC, and in my home, Louisiana. Today, \nmore than 30 percent of all DC public school students attend charter \nschools and are largely successful. These charter school projects are \nlargely successful. These charter schools not only help to better \neducate students, but are also helping to build a better, stronger, \nmore prosperous city.\n  In addition to having an impact in Washington, DC, charter schools \nare also helping to rebuild the school system in New Orleans. \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita did not just wash away our levees--they \nalso washed away our homes and schools. We must seize upon this \nopportunity and build a better, stronger school system for New Orleans \nand throughout Louisiana.\n  Charter schools are key players in this process by not only \nrebuilding our school system, but reinventing it. Every step in this \nprocess is based on what is best for our students, with the goal of \ndelivering learning and achievement for all students. The new school \nsystem effectively eliminates the previous system of have and have-\nnots, allowing parents to choose from any school in the network, making \nquality school options available to all students and raising the bar \nfor educators throughout the system.\n  The new Educational Network Model will organize schools, the majority \nof them charters, into small groups to provide support, foster \ncollaboration and ensure accountability. This will shift the majority \nof money and decisionmaking to the school level, where it can be \nmanaged based on the needs of the students in each school. It will also \ncreate a lean district office focused on academic standards and \nperformance monitoring, allowing more dollars to go to schools. \nFinally, it will migrate toward a single, aligned and highly-effective \ngoverning board that provides a stable leadership team with skills to \noversee successful implementation of the plan.\n  Today, over 50 percent of our schools in New Orleans have reopened as \ncharter schools. They have provided us with an expedient means to \nrestart public education in New Orleans. It is my hope that we can \ncontinue this trend by utilizing the Educational Network Model for \nthese schools and others nationwide by engaging community involvement \nand support through a shared services model.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 183\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by \n     designated public entities to respond to the needs of \n     communities, families, and students, and to promote the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, charter schools are held accountable by \n     their sponsors for improving student achievement and for \n     their finances and other operations;\n       Whereas 40 States and the District of Columbia have passed \n     laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas more than 4,000 charter schools operating across \n     the United States serve more than 1,140,000 students;\n       Whereas, over the last 13 years, Congress has provided more \n     than $2,026,225,000 in support to the charter school movement \n     by providing facilities, financing assistance, and grants for \n     planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination of \n     information;\n       Whereas many charter schools improve the achievement of \n     students and stimulate improvement in traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under section 1111 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311) in the same manner as traditional public schools, and \n     often set higher and additional individual goals to ensure \n     that charter schools are of high quality and truly \n     accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     public schools, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and communities;\n       Whereas nearly 56 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,100 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public school system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the President, Congress, State governors and \n     legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the eighth annual National Charter Schools Week, to \n     be held April 30 through May 4, 2007, is an event sponsored \n     by charter schools and grassroots charter school \n     organizations across the United States to recognize the \n     significant impacts, achievements, and innovations of charter \n     schools: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and commends charter schools and students, \n     parents, teachers, and administrators of charter schools \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening the public school \n     system;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of the eighth annual \n     National Charter Schools Week; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to conduct \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to \n     demonstrate support for charter schools during this week-long \n     celebration in communities throughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5434-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5434-S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CHILDHOOD STROKE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

and\n       Whereas in light of this conference, the anti-Semitic \n     rhetoric of President Ahmadinejad, and a resurgence of anti-\n     Semitism in part of the world, the opening of the archives at \n     Bad Arolsen could not be more urgent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends in the strongest terms all countries that have \n     to date ratified the amendments to the Agreement Constituting \n     an International Commission for the International Tracing \n     Service, signed at Bonn June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly \n     known as the ``Bonn Accords'') to allow for open access to \n     the Holocaust archives of the International Tracing Service \n     (ITS) located at Bad Arolsen, Germany;\n       (2) commends the countries that have committed to expedite \n     the process of releasing the archives and expects those \n     countries to abide by their commitments;\n       (3) strongly urges all countries that have to yet to ratify \n     the amendments to abide by the treaty obligations made in May \n     2006 and to expedite the ratification of the amendments;\n       (4) strongly urges all member countries of the \n     International Commission of the ITS to consider the short \n     time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to \n     open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the \n     amendments by May 2007;\n       (5) expresses the hope that bureaucratic and diplomatic \n     processes will not further delay this process; and\n       (6) refuses to forget the murder of 6,000,000 Jews and more \n     than 5,000,000 other victims during the Holocaust by Nazi \n     perpetrators and their collaborators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5435-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5435-S5436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2007, AS ``DIA DE LOS NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG \n                              AMERICANS''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \nagreed to S. Res. 146, a bipartisan resolution establishing a national \nAmerican Eagle Day, on June 20, 2007, the day the bald eagle was \nselected as our national emblem during the Second Continental Congress \nin 1782. I am delighted that the bald eagle is scheduled to be \n``delisted'' from the Endangered Species Act on June 20 of this year. I \ncommend Senators Alexander and Byrd for their work on this resolution.\n  The bald eagle has been protected under Federal law since Congress \npassed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in 1940. This law \nprohibits the taking, possessing, or commerce of both bald and golden \neagles. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 reinforced protection of the \nbald eagle. I am a longtime supporter of the Endangered Species Act, a \nlandmark environmental law that provides crucial protection to fish and \nwildlife on the verge of extinction.\n  Vermont is actually one of the only States in the continental United \nStates without nesting bald eagles. Senator Jeffords funded a program \nabout three years ago where orphaned or threatened nestlings were \nrelocated from sites between Maryland and Maine to nests in the Dead \nCreek State wildlife management area in Addison County, VT, along Lake \nChamplain.\n  About 25 individual birds were successfully raised and released from \nnests there. While eagles usually return to nest in the general area \nwhere they were nestlings, it can take up to 4 years. Vermont fish and \nwildlife staff are closely monitoring the effort to see if Vermont will \nbe successful in joining other states as a home to the bald eagle.\n  I support the passage of this resolution, which would allow all of us \nto celebrate the successful recovery of the bald eagle, and to remember \nthe freedoms and ideals that the eagle represents as a symbol of our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5437-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5437-S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution (S. Res. 162) \ncommemorating and acknowledging the dedication and sacrifice made by \nthe men and women who have lost their lives while serving as law \nenforcement officers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering \ntoday a bipartisan resolution to designate May 15, 2007, as National \nPeace Officers Memorial Day that Senator Specter and I introduced along \nwith the majority leader, and Senators Biden, Grassley, Cornyn, \nStabenow, Menendez, Durbin, Kohl, Kennedy and Brownback. Last week, the \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported this resolution unanimously. I \nthank all members of the Judiciary Committee and the cosponsors on this \nbipartisan resolution for their support in recognizing\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\nthe sacrifices that law enforcement officers make each day for the \nAmerican people.\n  This is now the eleventh year running that I have been involved in \nthis resolution to honor the sacrifice and commitment of those law \nenforcement officers who give their lives serving their communities. \nFor many years I introduced this resolution with my friend Senator \nCampbell, a former deputy sheriff. Both Senator Campbell, and I, as a \nformer prosecutor, witnessed firsthand the risks faced by law \nenforcement officers every day while they serve and protect our \ncommunities. I am pleased that Senator Specter, himself a former \nprosecutor, former chair of the Judiciary Committee, and now our \nranking member, has become the lead Republican sponsor of this \nbipartisan measure.\n  Currently, more than 870,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade \nCenter in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died \nwhile trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings \ngot to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of \npeace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our \ncountry, and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the \nCongress to provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers \nin the line of duty.\n  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more \nthan 17,900 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with \nthe fewest officer deaths in history. With 19 deaths, however, that is \n19 deaths too many. In 2006, 147 law enforcement officers died while \nserving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 \ndeaths annually, and a drop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed. \nThat is 147 officers too many. We need to continue our support for \nbetter equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, \nimproved training, and advanced emergency medical care. I hope as the \n110th Congress moves forward that all Senators can work together to \nensure that all of our law enforcement officers and their families have \nthe full support and the resources they need from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am proud of the work I have been involved in to help make it safer \non the beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I \nauthored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act in response to the \ntragic Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in \nwhich two State troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. \nSince then, we have successfully reauthorized this program three more \ntimes: In the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the \nState Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently \nas part of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice \nReauthorization Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 million per \nyear through fiscal year 2009 to help State, tribal and local \njurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. \nI have already begun to work with my colleagues to make sure that the \nbulletproof vest partnership grant program is fully funded this year. \nBulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are \na fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. I know \nI am not alone in calling for the Senate to fully fund the bulletproof \nvest partnership program and I hope the Congress agrees that it is \ncrucially important that we provide the funding authorized for this \nprogram. Hundreds of thousands of police officers are counting on us.\n  I am also pleased to join with Senator Reed and others to introduce \nthe Equity in Law Enforcement Act, which will provide parity in Federal \nbenefits for law enforcement officers working in private educational \ninstitutions and for our Nation's rail carriers. Among these benefits \nare access to grants under the bulletproof vest partnership, and \nsurvivor benefits. All of the men and women who serve our society as \nlaw enforcement officers should be equally entitled to all of the \nbenefits the Federal Government provides, no matter where they serve.\n  I think we can all agree that the men and women in law enforcement \nwho have sacrificed for our safety deserve our deep gratitude and \nrespect. National Peace Officers Memorial Day will offer the people of \nthe United States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and \nin the Nation's Capital, the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police \nforces.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers deserve our commitment to \nprotect those who help keep us all safe. They are the real-life heroes; \ntoo many of whom too often make the ultimate sacrifice. It is important \nto support and respect our State and local police officers and all of \nour first responders, and to recognize their role in upholding the rule \nof law and keeping our Nation's citizens safe and secure. During the \nweek of May 13, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather \nin Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades. I \nthank the Senate for joining in honoring their service and passing this \nbipartisan resolution.\n  The amendment (No. 1007) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1007\n\n       On page 2, strike the first whereas clause and insert:\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting \n     the schools and schoolchildren of the United States;\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 162\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of the peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting \n     the schools and schoolchildren of the United States;\n       Whereas 147 peace officers across the United States were \n     killed in the line of duty during 2006, which is below the \n     decade-long annual average of 167 deaths;\n       Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction \n     in deaths, including--\n       (1) better equipment and increased use of bullet-resistant \n     vests;\n       (2) improved training;\n       (3) longer prison terms for violent offenders; and\n       (4) advanced emergency medical care;\n       Whereas every other day, 1 out of every 16 peace officers \n     is assaulted, 1 out of every 56 peace officers is injured, \n     and 1 out of every 5,500 peace officers is killed in the line \n     of duty somewhere in the United States; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2007, more than 20,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C., to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2007, as ``Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day'', in honor of the Federal, State, and local officers \n     that have been killed or disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     that day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/01/senate-section/article/S5438-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 2, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.
