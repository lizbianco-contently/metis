Mr. President, I rise this morning, prior to our break for \nthe Fourth of July holiday, to talk about Medicare and in particular \nsome of the activity on the floor in the last couple of weeks, but \nespecially last night.\n  I wanted to highlight some of the provisions of the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 because sometimes, \nwhen something gets voted on here, whether it is the bill or a measure \nto get us to the bill, it can go right by a lot of us and certainly can \ngo right by the American people without enough focus on some of the \nprovisions of the bill and some of the detail. I think it was a real \nmissed opportunity, and I will talk about that in a moment, but now \njust some of the highlights.\n  First of all, with regard to physicians in America, the bill \neliminates the pending 10-percent cut in Medicare payments to \nphysicians for the remainder of 2008 and provides a 1.1-percent update \nin Medicare physician payments for 2009. It provides a 2-percent \nquality reporting bonus for doctors who report on quality measures \nthrough 2010 and provides financial incentives to providers to \nencourage the use of electronic prescribing technology.\n  I don't think anyone in America needs to be reminded of how important \nthis is, not just to make sure our Medicare system works well because \nof the positive impact this could have on doctors, but also anything we \ncan do to encourage the use of information technology or other kinds of \ntechnology to make our system more efficient and more safe is critical. \nSo that is one part of the physician section of this bill.\n  For hospitals in particular and especially in my home State of \nPennsylvania, there are so-called section 508 benefits. I will give a \nquick summary of what that means.\n  This bill would extend 508 benefits to hospitals so they can continue \nto pay doctors and other providers in accordance with wages from \nsurrounding areas. For northeastern Pennsylvania especially, this is a \ncritical provision.\n  Basically, and I am generalizing here, sometimes what happens is you \nhave regions of a State that are categorized or given definitions that \ndon't apply, and the reimbursement level goes down, and therefore the \nwages are impacted and they have trouble recruiting skilled personnel \nfor positions in those hospitals. So we need a long-term fix for this \nsituation. What this bill would do is continue to extend some help we \nhave given in the past, but we do need a long-term fix, and we are \nworking on that. For now, we need to provide this wage assistance to \nhospitals--and many hospitals in Pennsylvania have been hit hard by \nthis--so they do not lose critical personnel to surrounding areas. It \nis a very competitive business, the business of recruiting qualified \nmedical personnel.\n  That is the physician section.\n  The second section--and I am going to review just two or three more--\nthe beneficiaries. There is a lot to talk about here, but this bill \nadds a critical benefit for low-income older citizens, who are among \nthe most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries. It extends and improves \nlow-income assistance programs for Medicare beneficiaries whose income \nis below $14,040. This includes the so-called Qualified Individual \nProgram, which pays Part B premiums for low-income beneficiaries with \nincomes between $12,480 and $14,040. This provision is important to \nbeneficiaries. The bill would increase the amount of assets low-income \nbeneficiaries can have and still qualify for financial help with \nMedicare costs.\n  The Presiding Officer knows from his own work in the State of Ohio \nand the people he represents that as we went through the farm bill, one \nof the points we focused on with regard to food stamps was that some \npeople who get a benefit from food stamps were adversely affected \nbecause things such as childcare expenses--so essential for a family--\nwere being included as part of their assets, and it made it harder for \nthem to get food stamp benefits. The same kind of principle is at stake \nhere, where too often the eligibility determinations for low-income \nbeneficiaries are unfair. This would improve that.\n  Another area I wish to talk about are pharmacies. The bill requires \nMedicare to pay pharmacies on time--as they should anyway. Isn't that \nan interesting provision? These pharmacies have to pay out on \nprescriptions, and they need reimbursement quickly so they can stay in \nbusiness. Many of them are the only pharmacies serving their \ncommunities in small towns.\n  When people think of my State, they think of big cities such as \nPhiladelphia or Pittsburgh or Erie or Scranton or Harrisburg or \nAllentown. But in between, we probably have more small towns than most \nStates in the country. In those smaller communities, that pharmacy is \nsometimes the only option for many families--and not just rural \nfamilies but many families who just live in small towns. It is \ncertainly reasonable to expect these pharmacies to be reimbursed within \n14 days, and that is what this bill does. It forces the Federal \nGovernment to do what it should do, which is to pay pharmacies on time.\n  Medicare Advantage. That is something we are going to be talking more \nabout, but that is a subject of significant debate in the country. This \nbill deals with that issue directly. It also deals with rural providers \nand other beneficiaries.\n  The bill protects access to care in rural America by extending and \nbuilding upon expiring provisions, including improving payments for \nsole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and ambulances. It \nextends expiring provisions that preserve payment equity for rural \nphysicians and rural hospitals that run clinical laboratories.\n  I could go on from there, but I won't. This isn't just about some \nMedicare concerns we have in our cities, this is about rural America \nand access to care in rural America. And Pennsylvania has as much of a \nrural population as virtually any State in the country. We are at least \nin the top five, at last count.\n  So all of this is a way to summarize the bill and not do justice \nnecessarily to the detail of the bill. This was a bill that was worked \non here, worked on in the Finance Committee for many weeks, and worked \non in the House in consultation with the Senate. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Max Baucus, and his team and people\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\non that committee worked very hard, and I will tell you, to have it \nstopped, as so many things have been blocked around here--when I look \nat the total votes, Democrats did their job. We voted, every one of us, \nin unison to get this legislation moving forward. Yet, if you look at \nthe total, on this vote last night there were eight Republicans who \nvoted to move the bill forward.\n  When you consider what is at stake--I mean, we listened to the \narguments from the other side, but when you talk about making sure \nphysicians are treated fairly so they can treat older citizens in \nPennsylvania, Ohio, and across the country; when you talk about \nreimbursement in the case of hospitals in northeastern Pennsylvania, \nwhere they are competing for skilled personnel, yet we are not going to \nmove something forward that can help them on their wages so they can \nhave the best possible care for older citizens--in my home area of \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, we have the highest percentage of people \nover 65 of anyplace in the country. We need help with this wage index \nproblem to recruit the best personnel.\n\n  When you talk about beneficiaries, these are very vulnerable low-\nincome beneficiaries, some of whom do not just have to worry about \ntheir Medicare benefits, but they are standing in lines to get food \nfrom food pantries. The Presiding Officer has talked about this a lot \nover the last year. The price of everything in their lives has gone \nup--gasoline and food, they are worried about Medicare, they are \nworried about their children and their grandchildren. And we can't vote \nto move something forward? It is outrageous that we have this split \nwhere you get all these Democrats voting for it and only eight \nRepublicans.\n  Finally, when it comes to pharmacies and rural providers, my \ngoodness, if we can't move legislation forward to make sure the Federal \nGovernment pays pharmacies within 14 days, what are we doing? We can't \nget the votes to move forward.\n  People across America and families on Medicare are worried. They are \nworried about Medicare and how it is going to impact their lives. I \nwant them to be aware of what happened here. Democrats voted in unison \nto move this forward, to make these changes to the Medicare Program. \nThe other side did not. It is a very simple equation. I know we will \nvote on this again, and I hope our colleagues on the other side, when \nthey consider what is at stake for rural America--for small towns \nacross the country and for very vulnerable people--I hope they would \ntake that into consideration and vote the right way for older citizens \nand for those families.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor raising some important issues with regard to the way our Medicare \nsystem works--and Medicaid, too, for that matter. In many areas of the \ncountry at least half the health care that is provided goes through \nthose programs. I would like to associate myself with what I understood \nto be one comment that he made about rural health care and wage index \nproblems.\n  Hospitals in America are reimbursed at different rates. If you are a \nhospital in a smaller area, the Federal Government calculates how much \nyou should be reimbursed based on what they call a wage index, and that \nwage index pays substantially less or results in a payment \nsubstantially less than is given to hospitals in urban areas for the \nvery same procedure and the very same care.\n  We tried to make some progress, and did make some progress, a few \nyears ago under the leadership of Senator Grassley. He understood the \nissue. He believed it was adverse to some of the smaller communities in \nIowa. We had some discussion about it. We made some progress, but it is \nstill very dramatic.\n  Let's say the average is $100 for a procedure; this is what a \nhospital would be paid. If your wage index is 80, then you would be \npaid $80. If your wage index were 120, you would be paid $120. If you \nhave two hospitals, one of them with a higher wage index, it gets paid \n$120, and a poorer, rural hospital would get paid $80.\n  This has some ramifications that go beyond common sense in that the \nequipment that a rural hospital needs to utilize may be utilized less \noften, and therefore is more expensive per procedure, than one that \nwill be utilized in a wealthier hospital in a wealthy area. I think \nthis is a big issue.\n  In response to the concern about the bill, I understand there is a \nfirm view of Members on this side, and the President, that the Medicare \nAdvantage program not be eliminated in this bill. That is basically \nwhat has happened. We want to see many, if not all, the reforms in \nhere, or most of these reforms, but there are one or two matters that \nthis side of the aisle feels very strongly about. If we could work \nthose out, I think we could pass that legislation in prompt order.\n  Some would say it has been blocked by those on this side, and some on \nthis side say it has been blocked by the unwillingness to discuss the \nconcerns that we have, and therefore it is blocked on the other side.\n  I see our distinguished majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6311-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6311-S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE PEPFAR REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 2003, Congress responded to President \nBush's call for action by creating the Global HIV/AIDS Program. The \ngoal of that program was to confront the crisis which has killed more \nthan 30 million Africans since 1982. Thousands are dying every day. \nAbout 5,000 are dying every day in Africa--every day, weekends, no \nholidays off. This strongly bipartisan effort to create this \nlegislation has already helped tens of millions of Africans affected by \nHIV/AIDS. It has been 5 years since we passed that legislation, and now \nit is time to reauthorize the Global HIV/AIDS Program.\n  This program was started with bipartisan support, and that support \nremains today. The House of Representatives passed the reauthorization \non a strong bipartisan vote. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nalso passed the bill with broad bipartisan support. This legislation \nhas the strong support of Senate Democrats, most of the Senate \nRepublicans, and President Bush.\n  Unfortunately, as happens often, the legislation has been blocked by \na small group of Republican Senators who have placed a hold on this \nlegislation, preventing us from moving forward. That is why several \nmonths ago I asked Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar to negotiate \na compromise. They worked tirelessly on this challenge. I thank them \nfor their hard work. Also, Senator Enzi, the ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee, in the absence of Senator Kennedy, has worked very hard to \nget rid of some of the holds.\n  Given the importance of this legislation and the overwhelming amount \nof work we have to do in the Senate, I thought it would be appropriate \nto set a deadline to get something done, and that deadline was this \nweek for the negotiations to be completed. First, it was Monday, then \nTuesday, then Wednesday. Then yesterday I was told by Senator Enzi \nthere was one more person to work it out with and we could clear it \ntomorrow. That is today--he told me that yesterday.\n  We thought an agreement had been reached, and we have a final text of \nthe agreement. I thank everyone for their work and their leadership \nduring these negotiations, for their hard work over the past few days \nto close the deal on the final issues.\n  Senators Coburn, Enzi, Burr--I indicated, and the White House--have \nall taken part. I certainly hope my colleagues on the other side will \nnot block this bipartisan agreement.\n  President Bush will be attending the G-8 conference over the July \nrecess and\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\nshould have this bill in hand to show the commitment of the United \nStates on HIV/AIDS. As President Bush said in February of this year:\n\n       Congress needs to make sure that this HIV/AIDS plan, \n     PEPFAR, gets reauthorized for a 5-year period of time. We \n     don't want people guessing on the continent of Africa whether \n     or not the generosity of the American people will continue.\n\n  Mr. President, we really must act now. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will refrain until the \nmajority leader finishes his request.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2731\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Calendar No. 698, S. 2731--this legislation \nis named after Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, with whom I had the good \nfortune of serving in the House of Representatives. They were both \nwonderful men. This is called the Lantos-Hyde U.S. Global Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 698, S. 2731, that the only amendment in \norder, other than the committee-reported substitute, be the Biden-Lugar \nsubstitute which is at the desk; that the substitute be agreed to, the \ncommittee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill and there be no further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object for a number of Senators who have not been a \npart of this negotiation and have some concerns.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed, to say the least, that \nagain the Republicans objected to passing this bill. The White House \nmade a number of calls this morning but obviously not enough. They are \nconcerned that the President is going to be embarrassed when he goes to \nEurope and not be able to say that this legislation is going to be \napproved.\n  I now will offer a unanimous consent agreement, another one, which I \nthink is reasonable based on the bipartisan agreement we have reached \nso far, which allows Senators on both sides to offer amendments. So I \nsay to everyone, if people do not like this, let's bring this to the \nfloor and have some amendments. That is what this is all about. The \nconsent agreement will have the bill come to the floor at a time when \nboth leaders agree--not just me.\n  A lot of things we do here say: The majority leader in consultation \nwith the minority leader. That is not what we are saying today. It will \ntake the consent of both leaders. I hope this will be something that is \nacceptable.\n  With this consent agreement, we are making the commitment to move the \nbill to the floor but giving both Democrats and Republicans a voice in \nthe process. This agreement is fair and allows for a substitute to \nrepresent the bipartisan agreement--and, as I said, this offer is more \nthan fair. So here is my next unanimous consent request that I will \npropound.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 698, S. 2731, at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, and that the \nonly amendments in order, other than the committee-reported substitute, \nbe the following: Biden-Lugar managers' package substitute amendment, \ntwo amendments from each side that are germane to the Senate bill, \ncommittee-reported substitute and the Biden-Lugar substitute; with \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the four amendments that are \ngermane to the amendments to which offered.\n  There will be two amendments on each side with second-degree \namendments in order to the four amendments. As you multiply that, that \nis a lot of amendments. They have to be germane, would be the only \nstipulation.\n  General debate on the bill will be limited to 2 hours equally \ndivided, controlled between the leaders or designees; debate time on \nany first-degree amendment be limited to 60 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; and any second-degree amendments be \nlimited to 30 minutes equally divided and controlled in the usual form; \nthat upon disposition of all amendments, the use or yielding back of \ntime, the substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time, and the Foreign Relations Committee then be \ndischarged of H.R. 5501, the House companion, and that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2731, as amended, be \ninserted, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of H.R. 5501, as amended; that the provisions of this \nagreement become effective only after each of the amendments covered \nunder this agreement have been available for 24 hours for review and \nprinted in the Record; and each leader notifies the legislative clerk \nthat they have no objections, and places a statement in the Record; \nfurther, that S. 2731 then be returned to the calendar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I think some Senators \nwho have concerns about this are not here at this time. I am not at \nliberty, therefore, to agree to the plausible scenario for moving this \nbill forward that the majority leader proposed. I note the House has \ngone out of session, so without their consent the bill would not clear \nand become law in any case before we get back from our upcoming recess. \nBut I would note that some fabulous progress has been made as a matter \nof policy in this bill. I feel far better about it from what I learned \nthis morning--although that was the first time I heard about it--than I \ndid previously.\n  For those reasons, I will object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed. We are going to \nfinish this bill sometime during the next work period, or certainly \ngive it a real try.\n  Democrats have listened to the concerns of every Senator, especially \na small group of Republicans standing in the way of international AIDS \nassistance. We have compromised, and we have negotiated for months.\n  The unanimous consent agreement that I have offered is more than fair \nand will bring forward a strong bipartisan bill. As I said, we will \nhave to finish this when we get back in 10 days or so. We have to \nfinish the housing bill, we have to do the work on FISA; that should \ntake up the first week.\n  And, of course, we have other things to do. But this will be part of \nwhat we plan to do during the next work period. There are literally \nmillions of people depending on us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a request for unanimous consent means \nthat the bill passes the Senate without debate, as written. Each \nSenator should honestly evaluate that before they give their consent.\n  Senator Coburn was raising a number of concerns, and I think he has \nbeen satisfied in them.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. For example, one of the things he and I felt strongly \nabout was the rule that more than half the funding should be used for \nmedical care. That has a lot of science behind it. And AIDS groups in \nAfrica pleaded with us. That was changed. That is now in there. So I \nwas very pleased with that.\n  Another change also affirmed abstinence-only programs. Another reform \nSenator Coleman asked for and has received would prevent funding from \ngoing to more wealthy nations such as Russia, China and India than \nwould have been available under the original bill.\n  It would now prevent substandard medicines from being used and would \ntreat faith-based groups that are working hard in Africa now in a fair \nway. So some real progress has been made on this legislation. I would \ncertainly be the first to acknowledge that.\n  I have not had a chance to fully look at all of it. But I do think \nPresident Bush and the majority leader and others who have worked on \nthis have made the legislation better.\n  Mr. REID. We will certainly hope to make it good enough that we can \nget it out of the Senate. We have tried very hard to do that. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\n  This is something the President has wanted. He talks about it all the \ntime. We have done our best for him, and we will keep everyone advised \nof our progress.\n  We are going to do our very best to finish this next work period. I \nam confident it may take a little bit of time that people do not want \nto spend, but we are going to have to do that because it is too \nimportant not to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \never-increasing problem and crisis we have in this country with the \nrising price of gasoline.\n  Many of my colleagues saw that yesterday oil futures hit $140 a \nbarrel; I think today it is up to $141 a barrel. The stock market, I \nthink, is responding to the anxieties that oil costs are causing to our \neconomy and the future prospects of some people speculating it might \neven be going up to $150 or $200 a barrel. This is a problem for us and \na problem that this body needs to address and needs to address quickly.\n  Many people at home are understanding--because at almost $4.30, \nwhatever people are paying for gasoline across the country, in \nWashington State we seem to pay a higher price than the Nation, on \naverage--are starting to understand what the oil futures market is and \nhow much speculation is happening.\n  But we can see today that on world consumption, there are about 86 \nmillion barrels of oil a day that are consumed. But what people might \nfind surprising is that the volume of that oil traded back and forth on \na daily basis is over 1 billion barrels per day.\n  So we produce 86 million, but yet we trade it over and over and over \nagain. In fact, 14 times we trade and sell one barrel of this oil back \nand forth every day. Many of my colleagues and myself have concerns \nabout the fact that much of this trading, at least this chunk of it, \ndone on the Intercontinental Exchange is done in a dark market. So we \ndo not know what kinds of positions people hold, we do not have the \nsame requirements for excessive trading that we do on NYMEX and on the \nChicago Mercantile Exchange.\n  So we have a lot of anxiety that there is a lot of trading going on \nin the dark that people do not understand and that this situation, \nwhile we are out on recess, could be exacerbated; that we could have a \ngrave problem while we are seeing this continue to shoot up.\n  A few weeks ago, we had the price shoot up $10 in 1 day. So my \ncolleagues in the House responded to this, knowing it is an emergency \nsituation. In fact, 402 House Members recognized this is an emergency \nsituation, passed legislation yesterday that was brought to the floor, \nnot a lot of discussion or debate. There have been many hearings, but \nthe decision was made, because we are leaving, to bring up this \nemergency declaration to say to the CFTC that they should use their \nemergency authority to make sure they are cracking down on any \nexcessive speculation in all markets, including those that currently \nhave loopholes, such as the Foreign Boards of Trade, such as ICE, those \nexempt electronic markets and any exempt swaps and bilateral energy \ntrading.\n  That is what 402 of our House colleagues said, is that they believe \nit is an emergency and that the CFTC should use its emergency authority \nand use that authority to make sure that excessive speculation is \ninvestigated, that they demand that people reduce position limits, that \nthey have overall stricter position limits, and that they be aggressive \nwhile we are gone on recess.\n  So while we are taking a holiday, there is no holiday for consumers \nfrom higher gas prices. But one thing we can do is make sure the chief \nagency in charge of policing these oil markets uses its emergency \nauthority while we are gone to do everything they can to protect \nconsumers.\n  I think this is important legislation. And the fact that 402 of our \ncolleagues also agreed in the House of Representatives, led by \nRepresentative Chris Van Hollen and Representative Bart Stupak, it is \ntime we do the same thing.\n  As I said, they did not have a lot of time to discuss this, they were \nall in agreement that this is an emergency situation, and we should \nmake sure the CFTC uses that emergency authority.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.r. 6377\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of this House bill, H.R. 6377, the Energy Markets \nEmergency Act, which was received from the House; the bill be read \nthree times and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object. Would the Senator amend \nthe unanimous consent request, that this legislation be the first order \nof business following disposition of the FISA legislation and that the \nfirst amendment in order be a McConnell amendment, which is the text of \nS. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction Act?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I do not agree to the modification of my request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the leaders on \nthis side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am obviously disappointed that my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle is objecting to this request \nbecause this legislation passed by us could go to the President's desk, \nand we would be sending a very strong message today, that while we are \ngone, this is a serious crisis, and we expect the Federal regulator, \nthe policeman on the beat, to be doing their job while we are gone.\n  We have tried to say to this agency that they should be more \naggressive. We have pushed them with letters; we have pushed them with \noversight hearings. But now we have our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives saying: You shall use your emergency authority.\n  It is disappointing that even though 402 Members, a majority of \nRepublicans and a majority of Democrats--I think only 19 people did not \nvote in favor of this particular measure--that over 400 Members thought \nthis was such an emergency that we should take this action.\n  It is very unfortunate that while we are going on holiday, our \nconsumers are not going to have a holiday from high gas prices and will \nnot have the protections and the indication that we have said is \ncritical to making sure oil markets are properly policed and that we do \nnot continue to see this rising and huge increase in gas prices while \nwe are gone.\n  I am very disappointed in the objection and will continue to fight \nthis issue to make sure our consumers are protected by the Federal \nagencies that are supposed to be doing their job in protecting them \nfrom excessive speculation and manipulation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to the body about an \nannouncement made by the administration yesterday that is probably best \ncaptured on the front page of the Washington Times: `` `Axis of evil' \nmember to be scratched from list.'' These are the announcements of the \nadministration policy of what they are going to take that was announced \nyesterday regarding North Korea.\n  I believe the administration's announcement yesterday about lifting \nsanctions on North Korea and removing it from the list of state \nsponsors of terrorism is shocking, is sad, and it belies the facts. I \nsay ``shocking'' because of the extent to which we have allowed Kim \nJung Il to manipulate the situations and the negotiations. I know some \nare calling this a victory, but I want us to just review what has taken \nplace and the facts on the ground and the facts in North Korea and the \nfacts for the North Korean people.\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\n  I have spoken several times on this floor about North Korea, about \nits abysmal record of human rights, about the gulag system that is \ntaking place, about 10 percent of its population being killed over the \nlast 15 years through either starvation, depravation, or the gulag \nsystem. When this place finally opens up, we are going to see a level \nof depravity that is going to rival some of the worst situations we \nhave seen in the last 50 years. Yet now we are removing them from the \nstate sponsor of terrorism list, we are lifting sanctions on them for \ntheir nuclear explosions, and we are saying: OK, it is going to be \nbrought into the normal group of nations.\n  I wish to talk about factually what we know is taking place today in \nNorth Korea and ask my colleagues to ask themselves: Is this something \nwe really should be doing? Does this really factually address what the \nsituation is today in North Korea?\n  North Korea sent the Chinese a declaration that is 6 months late on \ntheir nuclear involvement. It does not include any information on \nuranium enrichment. It has nothing on the secret, illegal nuclear \nreactor exported to Syria that was bombed a year and a half ago by the \nIsraelis, and it has no indication on the number of nuclear weapons \nNorth Korea produced. That is what is missing.\n  I will talk about what we have done, and yet we do not have that base \nof information about which I just spoke. In return for this paltry and, \nfrankly, I think insulting lack of information handed over by Kim Jung \nIl--and I hesitate to call this a declaration for its severe \ndeficiencies--our Government is legitimizing this regime by waiving the \nTrading With the Enemy Act and removing it from the list of state \nsponsors of terrorism.\n  I have heard the argument that these sanctions are only symbolic and \nthat there are many more sanctions still in place to continue the \nisolation. But let me show you what the State Department gave me on \nthis very subject yesterday.\n  As shown on this chart, this is the list of sanctions that remain, \nand they list on it the Glenn amendment sanctions, which I remind the \nbody is a set of mandatory sanctions, that if you use or detonate a \nnuclear device, these sanctions automatically go on you. They are \nlisted as sanctions being maintained, and yet yesterday this body, in \nthe supplemental, provided the administration with waiver authority on \nGlenn amendment sanctions toward North Korea. This was something \nlobbied for heavily by the State Department and this administration. So \nwe cannot say those sanctions are still in place when the \nadministration now has the authority to waive those as well because of \nlobbying in this body.\n  We may recall last month when the State Department came to the Hill \nand lobbied intensively for Congress to waive these Glenn amendment \nsanctions. I heard about how important it was to give the Department a \nwaiver to carry out disablement and dismantlement. Then that waiver was \nincluded in the supplemental without any Senate hearings on the matter. \nThere were no Senate hearings on waiving Glenn amendment sanctions \ntoward North Korea. When the State Department says not to worry, I have \nvery little reason to feel comforted by their assurances that there are \nplenty more sanctions on the books when they worked hard to lift these \nvery sanctions.\n  Another point on delisting: What does this say to the other state \nsponsors of terrorism? It tells President Bashir of Sudan or Castro \nfrom Cuba that the way to get off the list is to go out and start a \nnuclear program and then bargain it away in exchange for getting \ndelisted.\n  Does anyone really believe North Korea should be removed from this \nlist? That is the pointed question I would like to ask Members of this \nbody and the administration. Does anybody really believe North Korea \nshould actually be taken off the state sponsor of terrorism list when \nthey provided missile technology to Iran, a nuclear reactor to Syria, \nfunding of any number of groups--I want to back off of that statement. \nI want to only state ones that are obvious and well known. While Iran \nremains the most active state sponsor of terrorism, North Korea is the \nonly one as far as I know that has built a secret nuclear reactor for a \nfellow member of this malicious group.\n  On top of that, the CRS report from just a few months ago provides \nample evidence of significant North Korean assistance to terrorist \ngroups. There are reports that North Korea sent trainers and advisers \nto southern Lebanon to help Hezbollah build tunnels. Other sources say \nthey provided materials for the rockets fired into Israel.\n  The other piece, as I mentioned, is that today's announcement is \nsaddening. I say saddening because no progress was made on human rights \ndespite all the concessions we handed over, no progress made on human \nrights in spite of 10 percent of the population being killed in the \nlast 15 years in North Korea. No progress made on human rights--not a \npart of the agreement, not a part of delisting them, not a part even of \nthe specific items listed by the President that must be done for North \nKorea to gain its way back into a reasonable relationship with other \nnations. Despite all the concessions we handed over, there has been no \nprogress at all. We have no assurance that any will be made going \nforward in this process.\n  Let me read what the President said about what North Korea must do to \nend its isolation. This is what the President said yesterday morning:\n\n       To end its isolation, North Korea must address these \n     concerns. It must dismantle all of its nuclear facilities, \n     give up its separated plutonium, resolve outstanding \n     questions on its highly enriched uranium and proliferation \n     activities, and end these activities in a way that we can \n     fully verify.\n\n  What about shutting down the concentration camps?\n  I want to show a picture from Google Earth, so anybody can go and see \nthese. This is Camp 22. If you would like to spot it on Google Earth, \nthese are blown up from Google Earth. The administration probably has a \nlittle better resolution on some pictures they have. This is one of the \nmost notorious gulag prison camps in the world. It is in North Korea. \nOnce you go into Camp 22, you do not come out. Nobody has come out of \nthis camp alive. This exists in North Korea today. It continues to \nexist. Nobody in the administration or elsewhere is calling for it to \nbe shut down. Yet we are going to take them off the state sponsor of \nterrorism list--while people go in and never come out of this place. \nDoes this sound familiar? Have we heard this story before? Have we \nheard it before in any dealings with other regimes?\n  Let me show you a few other pictures of this place from Google Earth. \nAnyone can go and look at it yourself. Here are some of the barracks at \nCamp 22. It is a large place. It is larger than the city of Los Angeles \nareawise, with big mining operations, timber operations where they work \npeople to death. Shown in the picture are some of the barracks of this \nplace. You have fencing, guard posts, the road coming in, the road \ngoing to a coal mine where people die mining for coal.\n\n  This is a picture of some people--there is not much resolution, \nagain, on that--people probably just going in, never to come out. If we \nstand here in a couple years, after this regime is no longer in power \nor it opens up, and we start to get the data and we start to get the \nevidence and we start to find the bodies and get the body count of how \nmany people died here, I want you to remember this picture. We saw it.\n  We have done this before where we have said: OK, well, yes, we think \nthere may be something going on, but we are not sure about it, and plus \nit is more important that we just deal with this specific issue of \nplutonium and forget these people and them dying, when we have it in \nour power to negotiate this and say: No, we are not going to take you \noff this terrorism list until you do something on human rights, until \nyou close down this camp and highlight that piece of it instead of just \nhaving this narrow piece, and then this is the way forward to deal with \nand delegitimize the regime and stop getting the people killed.\n  The weapon of mass destruction is Kim Jung Il, and what he is doing \nit on right now is his own people, and we know it.\n  As I have noted before, Google Earth has made a witness of us all. \nThese images are available to anyone and everyone with an Internet \nconnection.\n  What about the starvation policy of the regime? What about the kids \nwho are starving in the regime? Let me\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\nshow you a picture. I do not have this one blown up. It is a picture of \norphans looking out of an orphanage. You can see their emaciated \nbodies. The German physician, a few years back, who was going around \nand treating some people in North Korea snuck out pictures very similar \nto this--not very happy. What about the thousands of refugees who flee \nto China, many of whom are trafficked into the sex slave trade, while \nothers get repatriated back to North Korea by Chinese authorities to \nface torture, execution, or a trip to Camp 22? These are issues that by \nlaw must be addressed in these negotiations under the North Korean \nHuman Rights Act, signed under this administration, which declares it \nso.\n  Furthermore, does anyone really believe we can trust Kim Jung Il to \nbe truthful with these declarations that he is handing us when he has \nno qualms about treating his own citizens in such a barbaric way? There \nis a report in the Washington Post that the documents he handed over to \nus about plutonium and their plutonium plant actually had traces of \nuranium on the very documents themselves--on the documents.\n  So while we are dealing with plutonium and we are delisting them as a \nState sponsor of terrorism, the documents they hand over to verify this \nhave traces of uranium on the documents. Is that mind boggling? We are \nsaying we are going to delist you because you dealt with plutonium, but \nwe are not going to require anything on uranium and we are going to \nwaive the Glenn amendment, push the Congress to waive the Glenn \namendment for you detonating a nuclear device, when you built a nuclear \nreactor in another state-sponsored terrorism country of Syria. We are \nnot going to require anything on that, and we are going to waive these \nsanctions of Trading with the Enemy Act when you are giving missile \ntechnology to Iran which has missiles pointed at Israel and other \nallies of ours in that region and possibly, in the future, to have \nrange to the United States.\n  I am stunned. The things we are saying and doing are absolutely \ncounter to the facts on the ground.\n  I am happy we are dealing with plutonium, but for what we are giving \nup--`` `axis of evil' member to be scratched from the list''--and we \ndon't have anything on uranium. We don't have anything on human rights. \nWe don't have anything on missile technology being shipped out to Iran, \nof all places; we don't have anything on the nuclear reactor that was \nbuilt in Syria, and we are going to waive all of these things? \nMeanwhile, the people die.\n  This seems like a very bad deal to me, but that is not the biggest \nreason I am mad. The biggest reason I am mad is because of people still \ngetting killed and we end up with blood on our hands when we have the \nchance to be able to deal with this differently.\n  I hope we will start to take into consideration this picture of these \norphans. I hope we start to take into consideration uranium and what is \nhappening in Iran, what is happening in Syria, and that we don't invite \nNorth Korea back into the fair standing of countries with what they \ncontinue to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last February, the Iraqi Government set \nOctober 1, 2008, as the date for provincial elections to occur. These \nelections are critical to U.S. and Iraqi efforts to bring about \nreconciliation in their country. For instance, those elections will \ngive members of the Sunni community, many of whom did participate in \nthe previous rounds of provincial elections, a chance to vote for fair \nrepresentation in Iraqi's provincial councils. Unfortunately, the \nprovincial elections law, which is the enabling legislation needed for \nthese elections to take place, remains stalled in the Iraqi Council of \nRepresentatives and will likely delay provincial elections by at least \nseveral months.\n  The administration's silence on the Iraqi Government's failure to \nadopt election laws that were promised in February--and which set a \ndate of October 1 for those elections--is disturbing, and it is the \nexact wrong way to send a message to the Iraqi leaders. Many of us have \ntried repeatedly to get this administration to shift responsibility to \nthe Iraqi leaders for their own future, since there is a broad \nconsensus that there is no military solution and only a political \nsettlement among the Iraqis can end the conflict. The administration, \nhowever, has repeatedly missed opportunities to shift this burden to \nthe Iraqis and appears willing to miss another opportunity.\n  President Bush indicated in February that he was confident that the \nIraqi Government was ``going to continue to work to make sure that \ntheir stated objective of getting provincial elections done by October \nof 2008 will happen.'' And after meeting the Iraqi leaders in Baghdad \nin April, Secretary Rice said, ``They know that provincial elections \nneed to be held before October 1, as has been the announcement.'' The \nadministration is well aware that the failure of the Council of \nRepresentatives to pass a provincial elections law in the near future \nis likely to cause the previously established October 1 date for Iraqi \nprovincial elections to be postponed.\n  The recent GAO report, entitled ``Securing, Stabilizing and \nRebuilding Iraq,'' paints an even bleaker picture. According to that \nGAO report, it is likely to take 4 to 8 months to prepare for elections \nafter a provincial election law is passed. That means that even if this \nlaw was passed next week, the October 1 deadline is unlikely to be met.\n  Ambassador Crocker said on April 10:\n\n       The way forward for a stable Iraq lies as much through \n     successful elections, in my view, over the long term, as it \n     does through the necessary application of force against those \n     who resist the state.\n\n  Where is the pressure on the Iraqi Government to keep their \ncommitment to an October election? Where is the administration's \nmessage of disappointment? Iraqi leaders are likely to read the \nadministration's silence on their failure to act as a shrug of our \nshoulders.\n  We have made some security gains in Iraq, but progress is spotty on \nmost political benchmarks set by the Iraqis for themselves, including \nprovincial elections. The administration's silence on this issue needs \nto end. It needs to make clear to the Iraqi Government that further \ndelay in passing the provincial election law is totally unacceptable.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Friday, July 4, the United States will \nconduct the 232nd celebration of Independence Day. On this day, we \ncommemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. \nFlags will fly and rousing music will be heard before the faint whiff \nof gunpowder and thunderous boom of fireworks reminds us of the great \nstruggle that took place to set our Nation upon its course through \nhistory.\n  Amid all the parades, fireworks, and backyard barbeques, it is \nworthwhile to consider the document itself. The Declaration of \nIndependence is an amazing and powerful manuscript. Phrases in its \nopening paragraphs are familiar to most Americans: ``We hold these \ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they \nare endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that \namong these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.'' That \nline may well be the most recognizable sentence in American political \nhistory. It is certainly among the top 10.\n  As famous as the phrase ``Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of \nHappiness,'' is, however, it is not the first sentence of\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nthe Declaration. The lead sentence reads: ``When in the Course of human \nevents, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another and to assume among the \npowers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws \nof Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the \nopinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation.'' This sentence sets the stage for the \nbody of the Declaration, which lists in some detail the abuses of power \nthat drove the Founders to a war of secession.\n  Unlike the philosophical goals of life, liberty, and happiness, which \nAmericans today readily understand and revere, the complaints listed in \nthe Declaration rarely fire the popular imagination. But they should. \nThe abuses of the King listed in the Declaration are the very issues \nthat the Constitution strives to prevent. They are the issues that the \nBill of Rights specifically protects us against. They are issues, and \nbattles, still being fought today, as the recent debates and court \nactions over the rights of detainees and the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, or FISA, demonstrate.\n  Reading the list of the colonists' grievances paints a vivid picture \nof life in those times. One can readily imagine the frustrations of a \npeople trying to build a working society, ruled by laws, that welcomes \nnew settlers and that promotes trade and commerce but is continually \nset back by contempt and indifference. The colonies' governments are \ndissolved or are forced to meet in out-of-the-way, uncomfortable places \nor at times that discourage part-time legislators from attending. Laws \nare arbitrarily suspended until the King, can rule on them, but he \nnever does provide a ruling. New courts cannot be established unless \nthe King, thousands of miles and months of travel away, will agree to \nthem. Judges depend on the King's favor for their jobs and their \nsalaries, so they rarely rule against him, anyway. New taxes and new \nrules from Britain are continually imposed upon the colonists, from \nstamp taxes to tea taxes, and their complaints about them are met with \nsilence or violence. Large armies are camped among the colonies and \ntake what they demand from the colonists, but they are immune from \nprosecution for any wrongs they commit. Mercenaries are brought in, and \ncolonists are seized and forced into military service on behalf of the \nKing.\n  The colonists complain, but the King does not care. The Declaration \nconcludes, therefore, ``A Prince, whose character is thus marked by \nevery act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free \npeople.'' In the Constitution to come, the Founding Fathers will design \na government that limits the power of the executive in order to prevent \ntyranny by one man, and will protect the rights of the individual \nagainst the state. Courts will be independent, and taxes must be levied \nonly by the representatives of the people.\n  Our Government was expressly designed to prevent anyone from having \nto live under the same conditions suffered by the colonists. As Thomas \nJefferson wrote, ``In questions of power then, let no more be heard of \nconfidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the \nConstitution.''\n  Ultimately, the colonists declared in their Declaration of \nIndependence that `` . . . these united Colonies are, and of Right \nought to be Free and Independent States . . . Absolved from all \nAllegiance to the British Crown . . . '' and held Britain, `` . . . as \nwe hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.''\n  On this Independence Day, the current generation can look back upon \nthose strong, resolute words with pride and gratitude. We would do well \nto remember the abuses that finally compelled our Founding Fathers to \ndeclare war, so that we never let the freedoms that were won for us to \nbe lost. Remember the words of John Adams, who warned that ``The jaws \nof power are always open to devour, and her arm is always stretched \nout, if possible, to destroy freedom of thinking, speaking, and \nwriting.'' He further wrote, ``Be not intimidated . . . nor suffer \nyourselves to be wheedled out of your liberties by any pretense of \npoliteness, delicacy, or decency. These, as they are often used, are \nbut three different names for hypocrisy, chicanery and cowardice.'' \nThose are the words of experience, speaking across the ages. This \nIndependence Day, we best honor our legacy by caring for it with the \nsame passion and vigilance that John Adams did.\n  Mr. President, I wish you, and everyone listening, a happy \nIndependence Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6316-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6316-S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEATH OF NICOLE SUVEGES IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have just learned of the death in Iraq \nof an extraordinarily brave woman from my State of Illinois who died \nthis week in a bombing in the Sadr City section of Baghdad. Nicole \nSuveges was a civilian assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team for the \n4th Infantry Division.\n  She was a political scientist from Illinois and a doctoral student at \nJohns Hopkins University. She was participating in a program that \nembeds academics into military units to help personnel in Iraq and \nAfghanistan navigate difficult local environments.\n  She chose to go to Iraq for her employer, BAE Systems, because she \nwas interested in learning how people make the transition from an \nauthoritarian society to freedom; that was the focus of her doctoral \ndissertation. She hoped she might use her knowledge to help Iraqis \ndevelop the habits and institutions of democracy.\n  When she died in a bombing on Tuesday, she was helping local \nofficials mediate disputes in Sadr City. Also killed in the blast were \ntwo U.S. soldiers and a State Department Foreign Service Officer.\n  Iraq was not the first war zone Nicole had worked in. She served as \nan Army Reservist in Bosnia in the 1990s.\n  Nicole graduated from the University of Illinois in Chicago in 1992. \nShe was 38 years old. She was one of more than 180 American civilians \nto die in the war in Iraq. Their deaths are in addition to the 4,113 \nmembers of the U.S. military who have lost their lives in Iraq.\n  Nicole Suveges represented what is best about America. She used her \nconsiderable courage and knowledge to try to help heal a badly scarred \nnation and help Iraqis create for themselves a freer, more secure \nfuture. Her death is a loss to Iraq, to America, and to the world.\n  We extend our condolences to her husband and family, and her friends \nand colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that a CNN account of Nicole \nSuveges' life and work be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   American Grad Student Dies in Iraq\n\n       An American graduate student who went to Iraq to find ways \n     to help ordinary citizens persevere in a transitioning \n     government was one of two American civilians killed in a Sadr \n     City bombing.\n       Nicole Suveges' a married political scientist from \n     Illinois, was part of a program that embeds academics into \n     military units to help personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan \n     navigate the local environment, according to her employer, \n     BAE Systems.\n       Suveges, who started her tour with Human Terrain System in \n     April, had been assigned to support the 3rd Brigade Combat \n     Team for the 4th Infantry Division in ``political, cultural, \n     and tribal engagements,'' a statement from the program said.\n       She was one of four Americans to die in the Sadr City \n     bombing Tuesday. Two U.S. soldiers and a State Department \n     employee, Steven Farley, who worked with the provincial \n     reconstruction team, also were killed in the blast.\n       ``Nicole was a leading academic who studied for years on \n     how to improve conditions for others,'' Doug Belair, \n     president of BAE's Technology Solutions & Services, said in a \n     written statement. ``She came to us to give freely of herself \n     in an effort to make a better world.''\n       Suveges was the second BAE employee to die in a combat zone \n     this year. Michael V. Bhatia, 31, a social scientist from \n     Medway, Massachusetts, died in a roadside bombing May 7 in \n     Afghanistan, BAE said.\n       Scott Fazekas, BAE's director of communications, said \n     Suveges and Bhatia were among three dozen social scientists \n     hired by the company and its subcontractors to support the \n     program.\n       The Johns Hopkins University graduate student was also \n     working toward a doctorate in political science with an \n     emphasis on international relations. The focus of her \n     dissertation was on the transition from an authoritarian \n     regime to democracy and how it affects ordinary citizens, the \n     university said.\n       ``Nicole was committed to using her learning and experience \n     to make the world a better place, especially for people who \n     have suffered through war and conflict,'' William R.\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\n     Brody, president of the university, said in a message \n     Wednesday to the campus community. ``She exemplifies all that \n     we seek to do at Johns Hopkins: to use knowledge for the good \n     of humanity.''\n       Mark Blyth, Suveges' primary faculty adviser, said that \n     when Suveges came to Johns Hopkins, she planned to write her \n     Ph.D. dissertation on how ideas move across borders from \n     society to society, exploring how radical Islamic ideas \n     filtered through Western European mosques.\n       After the outbreak of the Iraq war, Suveges decided to \n     shift her focus to the experience of ordinary citizens under \n     a transitional government, said Blyth, a topic that had \n     interested Suveges since her experience in Bosnia with the \n     SFOR/NATO Combined Joint Psychological Operations Task Force.\n       ``She was a very bright, engaging, sweet person, very \n     intellectually curious,'' Blyth said Wednesday.\n       BAE said Suveges' experience, which included a tour in Iraq \n     as a civilian contractor and a stint in Bosnia in the 1990s \n     as an Army reservist, made her especially valuable in efforts \n     to improve the lives of Iraqis.\n       A Human Terrain System statement said Suveges and others \n     were attending a meeting of the District Advisory Council on \n     Tuesday to elect a new chairman.\n       The officials were helping mediate disputes among the Sadr \n     City leadership and ``facilitate the development of a more \n     representative local government,'' the statement said.\n       The attack was blamed on a Shiite insurgent cell.\n       Suveges graduated from the University of Illinois at \n     Chicago in 1992 and received a master's degree in political \n     science from George Washington University in 1998.\n       She had delivered papers to international relations \n     organizations and served as a graduate teaching assistant, \n     the company said.\n       At Johns Hopkins, she was managing editor for the Review of \n     International Political Economy, the university said.\n       Maj. Mike Kenfield, spokesman for the Army's training and \n     doctrine command, said that the program was credited for \n     ``reductions in non-lethal operations'' and that there had \n     been talk about expanding the purview of the team to outside \n     Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6317-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6317-S6320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ARMS CONTROL AND NONPROLIFERATION BUREAUCRACY OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the U.S. arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation bureaucracy and its impact on our national \nsecurity.\n  Recently, I chaired two hearings of the Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee concerning the national security \nbureaucracy for arms control and nonproliferation. I examined several \noptions for improving our ability to control proliferation. They \nincluded: Reestablishing an independent arms control and \nnonproliferation agency, creating a semiautonomous arms control and \nnonproliferation agency within the State Department, and reestablishing \nan arms control bureau in the State Department. Other issues discussed \nwere elevating the role of the head of the arms control and \nnonproliferation bureaucracy and ensuring that there are enough \nqualified arms control and nonproliferation experts to protect our \nnational security and meet our international obligations.\n  Witnesses for both hearings had decades of experience in managing our \nnation's arms control and nonproliferation issues. Ambassador Thomas \nGraham and Ambassador Norman Wulf, along with Dr. Andrew Semmel, who \nrecently retired as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for \nNuclear Nonproliferation Policy and Negotiations, provided perspective \nabout the changes to this bureaucracy over the past decade and the need \nfor reform. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed into \nthe Record, following my remarks, a report submitted by Ambassador Wulf \nwhich represents consensus findings of a number of experts and former \nU.S. officials experienced in this field.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. The second hearing featured Ms. Patricia McNerney, the \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International \nSecurity and Nonproliferation, and Ms. Linda Taglialatela, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Human Resources. They gave greater \ninsight into the controversial, and damaging, arms control and \nnonproliferation bureaucracy reorganization at the State Department in \n2005 and the ongoing human capital changes the bureaus involved \ncontinue to face today. The State Department's use of short-term, Band-\nAid fixes to cover a loss of qualified civil servants and a lack of \ncommitment by senior leaders to address the Department's cultural \ntensions, primarily between regional and functional issues, troubled me \nsince these problems affect both human capital and organizational \ncapacity to confront the evolving threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  In 1961, when President John F. Kennedy entered office, the United \nStates faced a perceived missile gap against its foe, the Soviet Union. \nThe Kennedy administration, confronting the critical challenges of the \nday, advocated a new government ``agency of peace'' which would work \ntoward ``ultimate world disarmament.'' This agency, the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency, ACDA, helped craft and implement the policy \ndecisions that would reduce the nuclear, biological, and chemical \nweapons threat to Americans through multiple, lasting, and verifiable \ntreaties. The world was at a nuclear tipping point, where a small \nchange could make a significant difference. The Kennedy administration \nchallenged the conventional wisdom that argued for only an increase in \nnuclear weapons. It instead focused on controlling and limiting the \nspread of nuclear weapons by creating the small, but agile, Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency that gradually began to increase \ninternational security.\n  The world appears to be at another nuclear tipping point. Today \ninternational security does not hinge on an arms race between two \nmighty superpowers. Rather, international security is increasingly \nthreatened by the wide proliferation of nuclear programs, material, and \nknowledge. Countries such as India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran \nhave either achieved a nuclear weapons program or have aspirations to \ncreate one. Others soon may follow. Along with these headline-grabbing \nnuclear proliferation concerns, many countries are seeking nuclear \npower and assured access to uranium to satisfy their growing energy \ndemands. The peaceful application of civilian nuclear programs \nheightens the risk of diversion or the proliferation of plutonium and \nenriched uranium. Both presidential candidates have expressed their \ncommitment to addressing proliferation and working with other nations \nto reduce the threat of nuclear conflict.\n  The next administration must confront this tipping point head on and \nsolve the problem of our troubled arms control and nonproliferation \nbureaucracy. Along with its organizational structure, fundamental human \ncapital issues must be resolved. They include: Addressing what is \nconsidered by some a cumbersome hiring process; recruiting, developing, \nand retaining a diverse and highly qualified workforce; involving key \nstakeholders during organizational changes; and making it desirable for \nForeign Service Officers to serve in the fields of arms control and \nnonproliferation.\n  We need to consider the gravity of this issue now. I urge my \ncolleagues to advocate an arms control and nonproliferation workforce \nand organization that will support effectively the policies of the next \nadministration and prepare us for the nuclear threats developing \nthroughout the world.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                Foreword\n\n       This report was prepared by a volunteer task force. The \n     task force solicited views from participants through two \n     general meetings and from contributors via written comments.\n       These two groups included many former U.S. officials most \n     with decades of experience in nonproliferation or arms \n     control who graciously gave of their time to this project. \n     They are named below--a short biography of each appears in \n     the annex.\n       This report contains a general consensus that the \n     Administration taking office in January 2009 should \n     strengthen the organizational capacity of the State \n     Department to meet critical nonproliferation and arms control \n     challenges. Participants and contributors endorse the general \n     thrust of this report though not necessarily every finding \n     and suggestion.\n       Christopher Mitchell of the Institute for Conflict Analysis \n     and Resolution (ICAR) of George Mason University served as \n     convener of the two meetings that were held. Norman Wulf led \n     those discussions and along with Dean Rust and Barclay Ward \n     drafted the discussion papers and this report.\n       The task force also included Linda Gallini, Fred \n     McGoldrick, and Sharon Squassoni.\n       Participants in at least one of the two meetings included \n     members of the task force and Vic Alessi, Kevin Avruch, \n     Joseph M.\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\n     DeThomas, James E. Goodby, Allan Krass, Frances Omori, Randy \n     Rydell and Andy Semmel.\n       Among those commenting upon various drafts of the paper \n     were William Burns, Ralph Earle II, Mark Fitzpatrick, Bob \n     Gallucci, John Holum, Edward Ifft and John Rhinelander.\n       No funds were made available to the task force other than \n     by ICAR for use of their new retreat and conference center \n     located on Mason Neck in Northern Virginia and for \n     refreshments at the two meetings. Special appreciation is \n     expressed to Gina Cerasani and Aneela Shamshad, and Saira \n     Yamin, graduate students at ICAR, who served as volunteer \n     note-takers at the two meetings.\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       All three major presidential candidates have endorsed (i.) \n     maintaining and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation \n     regime and (ii.) pursuing nuclear arms control measures with \n     Russia and others. Regrettably, the State Department, which \n     will bear the brunt of the work on nonproliferation and arms \n     control, has lost significant capability--critical personnel \n     have left, the arms control bureau has been abolished, and \n     the bureau whose mandate includes nonproliferation is \n     burdened with tasks outside its traditional purview that \n     dilute its mission. Moreover, the State Department is simply \n     not organized to ensure continued access and accountability \n     to the Secretary of State and President on these critical \n     issues.\n       Following the election, the President-elect should appoint \n     a high-caliber individual to head up a task force charged \n     with laying out detailed priorities in nonproliferation and \n     arms control and recommending structural changes needed \n     within the executive branch to achieve those priorities. The \n     White House and National Security Council will need to be \n     well-organized to serve the President, but the task force \n     should direct its primary attention to the Department of \n     State. Restoring focus at State will require creating a \n     bureau focused on arms control, removing non-core tasks from \n     the bureau whose responsibilities include nonproliferation, \n     and limiting the activities of the verification and \n     compliance bureau to those required by law. If there are \n     substantial obstacles to near-term creation of an arms \n     control-focused bureau, then those functions should be \n     consolidated in the verification and compliance bureau \n     effectively making it the arms control and verification \n     bureau while seeking a long-term structure. Aggressive steps \n     must be taken to redress the loss of expert staff. For the \n     civil service, this means rehiring, recruiting, and \n     strengthening career paths for personnel, including physical \n     scientists, with expertise in nonproliferation and arms \n     control. For the foreign service, this means providing \n     training in these topics and career paths that reward those \n     working on these functional issues.\n       Particular attention should be focused on ensuring that \n     nonproliferation and arms control views get to the Secretary \n     of State and the President. Both not only need advice but \n     someone accountable in these areas. Existing law makes \n     provision for such advice but it has proven difficult to \n     implement those provisions effectively. Relying on personal \n     relationships can work up to a point, but as personalities \n     change, other priorities intrude, and administrations change, \n     a more enduring channel and focus not dependent upon personal \n     relationships is needed.\n       Decisions on these structural issues are critical in the \n     transition period so the new administration can hit the \n     ground running. Iran and North Korea, among others, will not \n     delay their proliferation progress while a new administration \n     organizes itself. Delaying decisions until after the \n     inauguration risks subordinating structural questions to the \n     crisis of the day or decisions being thwarted by ``turf'' \n     issues as political appointees are put into place. A variety \n     of alternatives should be considered ranging from creating a \n     special office attached to the Secretary, or creating a \n     separate agency within the State Department or an independent \n     agency.\n\n    Ensuring the U.S. Government Has the Capacity To Meet Critical \n              Nonproliferation and Arms Control Challenges\n\n       This short Report which is the result of meetings and \n     discussions between a number of experts focuses on improving \n     the Nation's capacity for dealing with the increasingly \n     complex issues associated with nonproliferation and arms \n     control. It lays out a number of alternative strategies for \n     improving the Government's currently attenuated capacities \n     for effective nonproliferation and arms control action.\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       All three major presidential candidates have endorsed the \n     following objectives: (i.) maintaining and strengthening the \n     nuclear nonproliferation regime and (ii.) pursuing nuclear \n     arms control measures with Russia and others. Regrettably, \n     what the next President will find is a diminished capability \n     within the Executive Branch to achieve either objective.\n       The historical leadership role of the United States in \n     nonproliferation and arms control has been severely \n     downgraded and the nonproliferation regime significantly \n     weakened. Along with this overall decline, there has been a \n     loss of valuable expertise and bureaucratic structure \n     diminishing the capacity of the United States to pursue \n     nonproliferation and arms control measures.\n       Restoring U.S. leadership in these areas will require a \n     personal commitment by the new President. Within the \n     Executive Branch, there will need to be a strong organization \n     to execute policies and be accountable to the White House. \n     This paper looks at key organizational issues that must be \n     met, particularly in the State Department, if the new \n     administration is to meet its nonproliferation and arms \n     control objectives.\n\n\n                 II. Critical Proliferation Challenges\n\n       The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the \n     foundation for global cooperation in this area. Its primary \n     goal is to decrease the risk of nuclear war by preventing the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. It also obligates the five states \n     which the NPT recognizes as possessing nuclear weapons--U.S., \n     Russia, UK, France and China--to work toward nuclear \n     disarmament The urgency of dealing with the threat posed by \n     nuclear weapons has been highlighted recently by former \n     senior officials of both political parties--Secretaries of \n     State Kissinger and Shultz, Secretary of Defense Perry, and \n     Senator Nunn--who have called for renewed efforts to work \n     towards a nuclear weapon free world, arguing that ``the world \n     is now on a precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era.'' \n     Their agenda, known as the Hoover plan after the Stanford \n     institute where the group meets, is built around the NPT and \n     focuses on U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control as well as on \n     specific nonproliferation measures. No vision of a nuclear \n     weapon free world or major progress toward that goal can be \n     achieved without an intensive focus on both nonproliferation \n     and arms control.\n       The three major candidates for the Presidency have called \n     for strengthening the NPT and other elements of the \n     nonproliferation regime and for reducing the nuclear arsenals \n     of the United States and other nuclear powers; two have \n     endorsed specific portions of the Hoover plan. Any new \n     administration will likely focus on a wide variety of other \n     nuclear-related challenges as well, e.g., Iran and North \n     Korea; protecting against the theft or diversion of nuclear \n     material; strengthening export control and interdiction \n     activities; and developing nuclear fuel cycle strategies to \n     reduce the spread of sensitive nuclear facilities. It may \n     reconsider the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the \n     Senate failed to endorse in 1999, and give higher priority to \n     U.S-Russian cooperation on strategic nuclear and missile \n     defense issues and to a fissile material cutoff treaty. The \n     new administration will have to continue specific measures to \n     prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear, radiological, \n     chemical and biological weapons.\n\n\n                        III. Structural Factors\n\n       The first year of a new administration offers a unique \n     opportunity for progress. Grasping that opportunity requires \n     diligent preparations during the transition period. To \n     prepare, the President-elect should establish a task force to \n     identify key substantive goals and devise a plan for the \n     creation of nonproliferation and arms control structures to \n     achieve those goals. The task force should be led by an \n     individual of stature who is directly accountable to the \n     President-elect and well-known to the Congress. The task \n     force could continue beyond the inauguration but should not \n     be permanent. After the inauguration, the task force leader \n     might be directly attached to the White House with the \n     assignment of ensuring that substantive and structural goals \n     are achieved.\n       As cabinet departments with equities in nonproliferation \n     and arms control have appointees put into place, a senior \n     official in each department should be identified to work with \n     the relevant White House and NSC officials. The NSC structure \n     must include interagency groups responsible for integrating \n     the activities and resources of each department, promoting \n     transparency and information flow among agencies, and \n     ensuring the input of the intelligence community. The \n     appointment of a Deputy National Security Adviser for \n     Nonproliferation and Arms Control would demonstrate the \n     priority attached to these issues and allow for greater \n     coordination of interagency activities.\n       The task force must pay special attention to the \n     organizational structure under the Secretary of State, as \n     State will bear the brunt of the work. State must be capable \n     of performing a wide range of daily activities such as \n     monitoring information, crafting and implementing policy \n     initiatives, anticipating problems, advising high-level \n     political officials, coordinating with other agencies, \n     consulting with Congress, informing the public, and most \n     importantly engaging in extensive diplomacy to maintain and \n     strengthen the nonproliferation regime. Effective \n     nonproliferation can only be achieved if the U.S. works \n     closely with others.\n       A good organizational structure will help to set \n     priorities, allocate resources, maintain the quality and \n     morale of staff, and get issues to decision-makers in a \n     timely manner. Among the key determinants of an effective \n     structure are: (i) enough senior policy officials and \n     supporting bureaus to focus attention on the full range of \n     issues; (ii) an experienced multi-disciplinary career staff \n     with a high percentage of civil servants including physical \n     science officers; and (iii) high-level channels for getting \n     views to the Secretary of State and President.\n       As shown below in Section IV, the current structure, which \n     reflects the priorities and approach of this Administration, \n     is entirely inadequate for pursuit of a more comprehensive \n     approach by the new administration. The suggestions offered \n     in Section IV do not\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\n     require legislation but should lead to near-term improvements \n     in State's capacity. Even though not required, the \n     administration and Congress may decide that it would be \n     beneficial to codify some of these Section IV changes to \n     ensure that the United States maintains over the long term \n     a high level of capability in these critical areas.\n       Section V looks at other possible legislative approaches \n     that would create either a semi-autonomous agency within the \n     State Department or a separate agency for nonproliferation \n     and arms control with an independence similar to that \n     possessed by the former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \n     (ACDA), which was merged with the State Department in 1999.\n       If not already decided by campaign commitments, the \n     President-elect should decide during the transition whether \n     to pursue a separate agency or limit structural reforms to \n     near-term changes that do not require legislation. Even if \n     the President decides on a separate agency, some improvements \n     in the State structure will still be desirable while awaiting \n     the necessary legislative action. Thorough consultations with \n     the Congress should occur regardless of which direction is \n     chosen.\n\n\n IV. Suggested Changes to the Current State Department Organizational \n                               Structure\n\n     A. Bureaus and Special Representatives\n       At the outset of this Administration, three separate \n     bureaus in State dealt with nonproliferation, arms control, \n     and verification and compliance. The arms control bureau was \n     abolished in 2005. Some of the arms control functions, e.g., \n     START, were taken over by the verification and compliance \n     bureau but that bureau's duties remain largely verification \n     and compliance as prescribed by law. Other arms control \n     duties were transferred to the former nonproliferation \n     bureau, now renamed International Security and \n     Nonproliferation. A quick inventory of this bureau's \n     jurisdiction includes: six treaties, five export control \n     regimes, three international organizations that specialize in \n     nonproliferation or arms control topics, conventional arms \n     proliferation, missile proliferation, missile defense, the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative, implementation of several \n     U.N. Security Council resolutions and negotiation of \n     resolutions in the U.N. General Assembly, combating nuclear \n     terrorism, country strategies, cooperative threat reduction \n     in the former U.S.S.R., and securing and disposing of fissile \n     material.\n       Diluting the focus of the bureau charged with \n     nonproliferation by adding such areas as missile defense and \n     General Assembly resolutions makes it much more difficult to \n     achieve priority nonproliferation objectives. Abolishing the \n     arms control focus and scattering its remains renders it \n     unlikely that a renewed arms control agenda as proposed in \n     the Hoover plan can be successfully pursued. Finally, while \n     verification and compliance remain important, the need for \n     U.S. global engagement on nonproliferation and arms control \n     measures should have higher priority and greater focus.\n       Suggestions\n       1. Establish a bureau focused solely on nonproliferation by \n     shifting all non-core duties, such as missile defense and \n     General Assembly resolutions, to a bureau with an arms \n     control focus.\n       2. Revitalize the organizational structure for arms control \n     by bringing back a bureau solely focused on arms control. \n     Given the difference in priorities in 2005 and what will \n     exist in 2009, new priorities can best be met by creating \n     such a single-focus bureau.\n       3. Through administrative action, limit the activities of \n     the verification and compliance bureau to the minimum \n     necessary to fulfill its statutory duties. The goal should be \n     to eliminate bureaucratic infighting and free up staff from \n     this bureau for high priority nonproliferation and arms \n     control activities.\n       4. If there are substantial obstacles to near-term creation \n     of an arms control focused bureau, then consolidate those \n     functions in the verification and compliance bureau \n     effectively making it the arms control and verification \n     bureau while seeking a long-term structure. This approach \n     should include clearly defining the verification role as \n     suggested above.\n       5. Utilize existing statutory authority to appoint \n     ``Special Representatives of the President'' at the \n     ambassadorial level, with at least one dedicated to \n     nonproliferation treaties and related activities; and another \n     to the reemerging arms control agenda. They would work with \n     the assistant secretaries for nonproliferation and arms \n     control and be responsible for negotiations, conferences, and \n     consulting with other governments.\n     B. Staffing\n       The State Department should have skills and experience \n     relevant to bilateral and multilateral diplomacy and \n     negotiations; the development, testing and manufacture of \n     nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and their delivery \n     systems; the civil nuclear fuel cycle; and to the \n     implementation of interdiction measures, export controls, \n     treaties and international organizations. An \n     interdisciplinary group of civil servants from the physical \n     and social sciences is needed along with foreign service \n     officers (FSOs) and detailees from the military services. \n     This mix has worked well in the past.\n       Unfortunately, there has been a significant loss of civil \n     servants from the State Department in recent years, and \n     recruiting physical scientists in particular faces strong \n     competitive pressures outside the government. Moreover, with \n     the elimination of ACDA, it has become more difficult to \n     sustain civil service career patterns up through the office \n     director position. Within the relevant bureaus, the State \n     Department has reduced the number of senior executive service \n     positions (SES) for civil servants and several office \n     director positions have gone to FSOs. Such officers have much \n     to offer, including in some cases as office directors or \n     other senior positions. But FSOs must meet the qualifications \n     of the positions, and in most leadership positions, including \n     office directors; the qualifications require a high level of \n     expertise in the field. Regrettably, the foreign service \n     creates few incentives for FSOs to obtain the requisite \n     knowledge for leadership positions in nonproliferation and \n     arms control.\n       Suggestions\n       1. Halt any further ``bleeding'' of the career \n     nonproliferation and arms control staff. Encourage those who \n     transferred out of these jobs in recent years to return. \n     Promote a civil service career path leading to office \n     director positions, including at the SES level. Launch a \n     recruiting program to hire the next generation of civil \n     service specialists, including in relevant scientific and \n     technical fields. Seek special hiring authority, if \n     necessary, to recruit individuals with technical competence \n     and to tap the skills of those officers who have retired from \n     State.\n       2. Develop the technical competence of FSOs by creating a \n     career path for nonproliferation and arms control with a \n     protocol of training and assignments in these areas. For all \n     FSOs, regardless of their career path, at least one \n     assignment in nonproliferation and arms control or other \n     functional bureaus should be a factor in promotion decisions \n     to mid or senior level FSO positions. Such assignments could \n     reduce some cultural barriers that exist between the regional \n     and functional areas.\n     C. Advising the Secretary of State and the President\n       Competing interests are a fact of life at the highest \n     political levels and it is important that those advocating on \n     behalf of controlling nuclear weapons be heard. The Under \n     Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \n     Security (``the Under Secretary'') is the most senior State \n     official with clearly defined responsibilities for \n     nonproliferation and arms control, although that position's \n     mandate covers other issues including security assistance and \n     conventional arms. This official is subordinate to the Deputy \n     Secretary of State, is one of six under secretaries and ranks \n     below the Under Secretary for Political Affairs who oversees \n     the powerful regional bureaus. This senior level structure is \n     further complicated by policy officials attached directly to \n     the Office of the Secretary of State for diverse areas, such \n     as reconstruction and stabilization, foreign assistance, \n     development aid, counter-terrorism, and global AIDS programs.\n       Seeking to ensure that nonproliferation and arms control \n     were not lost among the competing interests, the legislation \n     merging ACDA into State authorized the Under Secretary to \n     assume the former ACDA Director's role of senior adviser to \n     the Secretary and the President on arms control and \n     nonproliferation and to attend NSC meetings at the \n     President's direction (22 U.S.C. Sec. 2651 a. (b) (2)) \n     (emphasis added). Use of this authority, however, was not \n     embraced by the current Administration.\n       It has long been clear that the State Department structure \n     tends to favor regional interests. This tendency is reflected \n     in the fact that the under secretary to whom the regional \n     bureaus report is the third ranking official in the \n     department. This does not mean that functional interests must \n     give way to regional interests but it does mean that a \n     Secretary of State or a President must ensure that functional \n     priorities are clearly understood and always given \n     appropriate weight. For that to happen, a mechanism must be \n     found to ensure that nonproliferation and arms control \n     equities are represented.\n       Different approaches--with varying degrees of success--have \n     been taken by different administrations. Some administrations \n     have relied upon the personal relationships among the \n     relevant assistant secretaries, under secretaries, the Deputy \n     Secretary and the Secretary to ensure that nonproliferation \n     and arms control are accorded adequate priority. Others have \n     created various additional mechanisms such as an ambassador-\n     at-large to obtain this result. Of course, up to 1999, the \n     ACDA Director had the rank of Deputy Secretary of State and \n     the authority to advise the Secretary and the President.\n       Relying solely on personal relationships places at risk \n     over time the capability to sustain the attention of the \n     Secretary of State as personalities change and the inevitable \n     crush of foreign policy issues competes for the Secretary's \n     attention. Continuity of attention to these critical issues \n     could be enhanced by having a structure not dependent upon \n     personalities. Set forth in the suggestions immediately \n     below, which would not require new legislation, and in \n     Section V, which would require new legislation, are various \n     alternatives that should be considered. They could supplement \n     any NSC or White House structural components set up to advise \n     the President. As noted earlier, decisions with respect to \n     these issues should be taken during the transition--delaying \n     those decisions until after the inauguration risks\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\n     critical substantive issues crowding out attention to \n     structural questions and ``turf'' mentalities developing that \n     hamper organizational change.\n       Suggestions\n       1. Establish procedures to implement the Under Secretary's \n     already existing statutory role as senior adviser to the \n     Secretary and the President on nonproliferation and arms \n     control matters. This would allow the Under Secretary to \n     weigh in on major policy questions, including with the \n     President. It would elevate this position in relation to the \n     other under secretaries. Implementing such an approach would \n     work only if understood and accepted up front by all \n     involved, including the President. Actual use of this \n     authority by the Under Secretary with the President is likely \n     to be rare, in any event, given this person's subordinate \n     position to the Secretary.\n       2. Establish a position in the Secretary's office such as \n     Coordinator, Ambassador-at-Large, or Special Adviser to the \n     Secretary of State and President, that would focus on nuclear \n     policy or nonproliferation. The mandate could be limited to a \n     few critical topics, e.g. Iran, North Korea, anti-nuclear \n     terrorism, and/or elements of the Hoover plan, or could be \n     broad enough to focus on all aspects of nuclear \n     proliferation. This would elevate nuclear issues to the \n     highest level in State and permit more focus than the Under \n     Secretary, whose mandate is far broader. This sort of \n     arrangement was used with varying degrees of success during \n     the Carter, Reagan and Bush I administrations. It would \n     require a high degree of coordination between the Under \n     Secretary and the new position, as well as with the relevant \n     assistant secretaries. It would not create any clearer path \n     to the President for views that are contrary to the \n     Secretary's.\n\n\n                           V. Separate Agency\n\n       State and ACDA working in tandem over nearly three decades \n     were able to sustain a high level of U.S. global leadership \n     in nonproliferation and arms control. This was in large part \n     due to ACDA's exclusive focus on the mission, its status as \n     an independent sub-cabinet agency with statutory authority to \n     advise the Secretary of State and the President, and a strong \n     cadre of civil service experts. The ten years since ACDA's \n     demise have seen a decline in U.S. diplomacy in this area. \n     That said, there seems little doubt that ACDA-like resources \n     and strengths will be needed for the foreseeable future. The \n     question is will a strengthened State structure as suggested \n     above in Section IV be adequate to the task over the long \n     run or should the new Administration seek legislation to \n     transfer the nonproliferation and arms control functions \n     to a separate agency? Two different approaches to a \n     separate agency are set forth below.\n     A. Separate Agency, But Part of State\n       A semi-autonomous agency within State would be similar to \n     the concept of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     within the Department of Energy. The agency's Director would \n     be the nonproliferation and arms control adviser to the \n     Secretary, and have a rank equivalent to the Deputy Secretary \n     of State. The Director would also have the right to \n     communicate directly with the President. The agency would \n     work closely with State regional bureaus and related \n     functional bureaus, but there would be no need for additional \n     nonproliferation and arms control offices elsewhere in State \n     since this agency would represent the coordinated view of the \n     State Department on these issues.\n       This approach would ensure optimal access to the Secretary. \n     The agency's unique identity and mission should improve the \n     recruitment and retention of the diverse professional staff \n     needed, including scientists and other technical experts. The \n     elevation of nonproliferation and arms control within State \n     will make clear to other governments the importance placed on \n     these topics by the United States and lead to regular \n     consultations with friends and allies. A separate agency is \n     the best way to promote an enduring focus on nonproliferation \n     and arms control policy, in contrast to embedding it in the \n     Department's traditional structure with the vast array of \n     competing interests and predominant focus on country and \n     regional factors. On the other hand, establishing a separate \n     agency would require legislation and presently Congress is \n     focusing on structural issues relevant to post-conflict \n     stabilization and reconstruction, development aid, and \n     foreign assistance. Some argue that a separate agency is not \n     needed; and that State can be structured so that these issues \n     get the attention they deserve and the Secretary gets the \n     necessary advice.\n     B. Independent Agency\n       The principal difference from alternative A would be the \n     agency's independence from State. The agency's director would \n     have a seat at NSC meetings dealing with relevant issues, and \n     the agency would participate as a separate entity in \n     interagency deliberations. The agency would have a status \n     similar to that of the former ACDA, which would imply a \n     return to a pre-1999 situation where State had its own \n     nonproliferation and arms control offices. The duties and \n     structure of the new agency, however, would have to reflect \n     the priorities and threats of today. Many of the arguments in \n     alternative A are also applicable here.\n       In addition, this approach is the only one guaranteed to \n     ensure that the President could hear the nonproliferation and \n     arms control perspective even when the Secretary of State has \n     a different view. Equally important, having an independent \n     agency would make certain that unfiltered nonproliferation \n     and arms control views are considered at all levels of \n     interagency policy formulation, a situation that gave ACDA \n     influence. On the other hand, as experience with ACDA \n     demonstrated, the option of going to the President in \n     opposition to the Secretary of State can be more theoretical \n     than real, and might rarely be exercised. An independent \n     agency would result in State creating its own \n     nonproliferation and arms control officials and they would \n     have more influence on the Secretary on a day-to-day basis \n     than would a separate agency. Some in Congress would also not \n     be receptive to creating a new agency, believing that more \n     than a decade is needed to determine whether State can \n     effectively do the job on its own.\n\n\n                             VI. Conclusion\n\n       The above suggestions are, we feel, both practical and \n     necessary although which approach to advising the Secretary \n     of State and the President is actually taken up by a new \n     administration remains a topic for debate and discussion, \n     which we hope will occur over the coming months. These \n     suggestions are offered not as firm conclusions but as \n     alternative ways of improving the country's capacities for \n     planning and implementing a coordinated and flexible, but \n     above all effective, strategy for dealing with \n     nonproliferation and arms control issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6320-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        30,000 MISSING FIREARMS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to data released this month by \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, gun \ndealers in this country ``lost'' an average of 82 firearms every day \nlast year. That means more than 30,000 firearms are mysteriously \nunaccounted for in gun dealers' inventories in 2007 alone. With no \nrecord of sale, these guns could be prime candidates for sale on the \nblack market.\n  Perhaps even more disturbing is that the Brady Center to Prevent Gun \nViolence believes that the 30,000 guns are actually likely an \nundercount of the total number of guns that disappeared from gun shops \nlast year. The ATF conducted inspections at approximately 10,000 of the \nNation's 60,000 gun dealers last year, finding over 30,000 firearms \nmissing from the dealers' inventories with no record of sale. The other \n50,000 dealers were not inspected due to limited ATF resources. In \nfiscal year 2005, the ATF examined 3,083 gun dealers and found 12,274 \nmissing firearms.\n  The underground market for guns is apparently largely supplied by the \ndiversion of this massive number of guns from licensed gun shops into \nthe hands of criminals. Based on its own gun-trafficking \ninvestigations, the ATF has concluded that corrupt gun dealers are the \nlargest source of firearms diverted to the illegal market. The Brady \nCenter report, ``Death Valley: Profile of a Rogue Gun Dealer,'' details \none particular gun dealer who was cited over 900 times for Federal gun \nlaw violations. Over 480 guns from this dealer were apparently traced \nto gun crimes, including 41 assaults and 11 murders. In 2003 alone, the \ndealer reportedly failed to account for 422 guns, more than one-quarter \nof his entire inventory, during a single inspection.\n  This kind of activity can be addressed by vigorously enforcing our \ngun laws, providing law enforcement with stronger tools to crack down \non gun trafficking, corrupt gun dealers, and criminals, and by passing \nsensible gun safety legislation. Unfortunately, the failure of Congress \nto act on several common sense bills has allowed criminals and possibly \nterrorists continued easy access to guns. I urge my colleagues to \nreverse this trend of inaction, and to help put a stop to this huge \nsource of guns for the black market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6320-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6320-S6321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this Medicare legislation is a very \nimportant bill. I believe that it is vital for the Senate to take up \nthis important measure to have open debate to give Senators an \nopportunity to offer amendments and to have the Senate work its will on \nthese important questions.\n  As noted in previous floor statements, I have been concerned about \nMajority Leader Reid's practice of employing a procedure known as \nfilling the tree, which precludes Senators\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nfrom offering amendments. This undercuts the basic tradition of the \nSenate to allow Senators to offer amendments. Regrettably, this has \nbeen a practice developed in the Senate by majority leaders on both \nsides of the aisle, so both Republicans and Democrats are to blame.\n  On June 12, 2008, I voted in favor of cloture on the motion to \nproceed on S.3101, legislation similar to H.R. 6331, to prevent the \nreduction in Medicare payments to physicians. At that time, I was \nassured by Majority Leader Reid that he would not make a procedural \nmotion to fill the tree. Following the failure to obtain cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S.3101, Finance Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley began to negotiate a bipartisan bill that could be brought \nbefore the Senate. I have concerns with some provisions that may have \nbeen contained in such an agreement. However, the prospect of the \nSenate working its will and allowing myself and other Senators to offer \namendments to such a bill is more favorable than filling the amendment \ntree.\n  The posture of the Senate is such that for the Majority Leader to \ncomplete action on H.R. 6331 and send it to the President before the \nphysician payment reduction is scheduled to go into effect at the end \nof June, the Senate must pass the same legislation the House of \nRepresentatives passed. This is the case because the House of \nRepresentatives adjourned for the Independence Day recess prior to the \nSenate vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R.6331. Since the \nHouse will be out of session, there will be no possibility for the \nHouse to consider a Senate amended Medicare bill. To guarantee that the \nsame Medicare legislation will be passed by the Senate, no amendments \nto the legislation were permitted. By bringing this legislation up at \nthe last minute after the House of Representatives adjourned the \nMajority Leader prevented the opportunity to offer amendments and \nundermined Senate procedure.\n  If cloture were to have been obtained on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 6331 the legislation would have been vetoed by President Bush. \nThat veto would have resulted in a further delay, since the House would \nnot be in session to override the veto and the scheduled physician \npayment reductions would go into effect at the end of June. There was \nan expectation that the Senate would extend the current physician \npayment rate for 30 days and prevent the pending reduction from going \ninto effect. However, when this legislative extension was offered by \nSenate Republican Leader McConnell it was objected to by Majority \nLeader Reid.\n  This vote was a crass partisan political exercise. The majority \nleader has been aware of this issue for some time and scheduling should \nhave accommodated for the amendment process. I have consistently voted \nin favor of increasing Medicare physician payments and will continue \nto, but I am not going to vote in favor of cloture when there is no \nopportunity to amend the legislation that comes before the Senate. I \nwill not submit to procedures that prevent the Senate from performing \nits traditional duty. This is why I voted against cloture on the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 6331. I expect that this very important issue will \nbe taken up as soon as we return from the Independence Day recess so we \ncan correct this grave problem in a manner that allows the Senate to \nwork its will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6321-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PAKISTAN COALITION SUPPORT FUNDS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the wake of 9/11, Congress developed \na new program to provide financial assistance to allied countries as \nthey joined us in combating al-Qaida. This program reimbursed partner \ncountries for defense spending above and beyond their normal military \nbudget. And of the 27 coalition partner countries who receive this \nassistance--also known as Coalition Support Funds--Pakistan has been by \nfar the largest recipient, receiving more than $5.5 billion out of a \ntotal $7 billion allocated for this program.\n  This program could have been an important part of our global fight \nagainst terrorists who pose a very real threat to our country. But a \nnew Government Accountability Office report shows that, in fact, the \noutcome was just the opposite. Over the past 7 years, U.S. taxpayer \ndollars have continued to flow with only minimal oversight while we \nhave still not found Osama bin Laden and his senior officials and while \nal-Qaida has developed a safe haven in Pakistan.\n  The GAO report details numerous examples of this wasteful spending, \nincluding $20 million paid to the Pakistani Government for road \nconstruction and $15 million to build bunkers--with no evidence that \neither was ever built. Or what about the more than $200 million \nprovided for air defense radars with no analysis into whether such \ntechnology was needed to fight al-Qaida--an organization not known to \nhave air force capacity? Confronting the threat of al-Qaida and its \naffiliates must be our top national security priority, and this GAO \nreport sends a strong signal that we need to seriously step up our \noversight when providing U.S. taxpayer dollars to our partners in this \nfight. We can not give them a blank check and expect to them to take \ncare of the job.\n  The Defense Department's carelessness and negligence has led to a \nsituation where billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars cannot be fully \naccounted for. With so many domestic programs here at home feeling the \nbrunt of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan this is simply unacceptable. \nAnd given the implications for our national security both here at home \nand abroad, it cannot continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6321-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6321-S6322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GAS PRICE REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nlegislation introduced yesterday entitled the Gas Price Reduction Act. \nI have agreed to join over forty of my Republican colleagues to \ncosponsor this legislation because I believe Congress needs to take \naction to address high oil and gasoline prices, as well as America's \noverall energy security going into the future.\n  My cosponsorship of this bill does not mean that every provision has \nmy full support. My office received the final legislative text late \nyesterday morning and I have not had a great deal of time to analyze \nall of the details. That said, I have reluctantly decided to cosponsor \nthis bill to signal my concern with the state of our Nation's energy \nsituation. I have long supported efforts to reduce U.S. oil demand \nthrough conservation and efficiency whenever practical, as well as \nincrease domestic oil production in an environmentally safe manner, and \nencourage energy markets that are free of price manipulation.\n  I am extremely concerned about the high cost of oil, gasoline, diesel \nand other fuels which are exacerbating our nation's already difficult \neconomic situation and truly hurting American consumers and families. \nWith oil near $140 per barrel and gasoline over $4 per gallon, we are \nfacing an unsustainable situation.\n  The legislation introduced today proposes to increase the supply of \noil, promote technology to lower fuel consumption, and increase \noversight and transparency of energy markets. Specifically, the bill \nwould allow consideration for oil exploration and production on the \nOuter Continental Shelf on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts with \nappropriate environmental protection at the request of a State's \nGovernor and State legislature. Any authorized drilling could only \noccur beyond 50 miles offshore and only if the federal government \ndetermines that leasing would not create an unreasonable risk of harm \nto the marine, human, or coastal environment. Further, all existing \nenvironmental laws would have to be followed.\n  The second part of the bill would allow the Department of Interior to \nmove forward with leasing of land in the Western U.S. to develop oil \nshale. It is my understanding that there are very large deposits of \nenergy resources that could be tapped with significant investments in \nrock extraction technology. This resource is much less understood than \noil and natural gas drilling. I support locating as many domestic \nresources as we can in an environmentally safe manner. However, I am \nconcerned about claims made by opponents that opening these lands at \nthis time is premature until Congress and the executive branch have the \nability to study the results of research and development efforts. \nFurther, some argue that Congress should first review regulations \ndrafted by the Bureau of Land\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nManagement, but which are under review by the Office of Management and \nBudget. Finally, we should be fully informed about the energy and water \ninputs that may be necessary for extraction, as well as the greenhouse \ngas emissions associated with production of oil from shale.\n  The third title of this bill seeks to increase research, development \nand deployment of advanced plug-in electric cars and trucks. There is a \ngreat deal of emphasis being placed on the promise of plug-in electric \nvehicles as a replacement technology for today's fuel-consuming \nvehicles. The potential benefits of plug-in electric vehicles includes \nmuch higher energy efficiency, elimination of the need for oil, and use \nof existing and expanded electric infrastructure. The legislation under \nconsideration would increase research and development for advanced \nbatteries, which will be required to allow these vehicles to drive long \ndistances without needing to recharge. The bill also authorizes a loan \nprogram for the re-tooling of advanced battery manufacturing \nfacilities. Finally, it calls on the federal government to purchase \nplug-in electric vehicles to the extent practicable to help increase \nmarket penetration of the technologies and make significant reductions \nin government-related fuel use.\n  Finally, this legislation attempts to strengthen futures markets. \nThere are concerns that the role of speculation in these markets is \nimpacting today's oil and gasoline prices. Therefore, this bill \nauthorizes increased funding and staff for the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission--CFTC. It requires the President's Working Group on \nFinancial Markets to conduct a study of international regulation of \nenergy commodities markets. It codifies recent CFTC action on position \nlimits and transparency for foreign boards of trade that are involved \nin the U.S. oil trading market. Finally, it requires the CFTC to gather \ninformation on index traders and swap dealers. Many of these proposals \nresult from the fact that a lack of information in the oil markets is \nmaking it very difficult to pinpoint whether and to what extent new \nactors in the oil markets may be causing some of the price increases we \nhave experienced.\n  I have been working for many years to tackle the high price of oil \nand gasoline and improve U.S. energy security. I have long been \nconcerned about OPEC--Oil Producing and Exporting Countries--fixing the \nprice of oil, which makes up the largest share of gasoline prices. I \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass \nS. 879, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act--NOPEC. NOPEC \nclarifies that it is unlawful under the antitrust laws for OPEC members \nto agree to limit the production or distribution, or to set or maintain \nthe price, of petroleum products or natural gas.\n  Further, on May 7, 2008, I questioned top oil company executives on \nhigh oil and gasoline prices at the Senate Judiciary Committee. Among \nother points, I asked them to justify the record profits their \ncompanies have earned while Americans pay record high prices at the \npump. When I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I held two \nhearings in February and March of 2006 to consider the effects of \nconsolidation in the energy industry and whether such concentration had \nresulted in increased prices of gasoline, other petroleum-based fuels \nand natural gas. Those hearings prompted me to introduce the Oil and \nGas Industry Act of 2006 to require U.S. antitrust agencies to further \nconsider whether mergers within the oil and gas industry have violated \nantitrust laws and if such mergers and information sharing among \ncompanies should receive further scrutiny.\n  Dating back to 2002, I was the lead cosponsor of fuel savings \nlegislation, including the Carper-Specter amendment to save 1 million \nbarrels of oil per day by 2015 and in 2003 the Landrieu-Specter \namendment to save 1 million barrels per day by 2013, which passed by a \nvote of 99-1. I believe the foundation we laid in the Senate helped \nlead to the eventual passage of the first automobile fuel efficiency \nstandard increases since the 1970s. On December 19, 2007, the President \nsigned the Energy Independence and Security Act which contained \nlegislation I cosponsored to increase automobile fuel efficiency \nstandards to 35 mpg by 2020. This increase in efficiency, and the \nanticipated decrease in consumption, could substantially decrease oil \nuse and bring down prices over time.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nproposals to address today's unacceptable oil and gasoline price \nsituation. However, I do not think any purely partisan exercise will \nultimately prove successful. While I joined my Republican colleagues in \nintroducing legislation today, I am convinced that we must work in a \nnonpartisan fashion to tackle this issue of paramount importance to our \nconstituents and the economic health of our Nation. As evidenced by the \nunification of the parties that occurred in December 2007 with the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act, when the parties work together, \nthe American people benefit. I recommend we all rise above politics and \nwork toward constructive solutions to the energy crisis we currently \nface.\n  As we consider the Gas Price Reduction Act and other proposals, it is \nessential that we not act in haste, but rather consider all potential \nconsequences. When we talk about opening new areas for domestic oil \nproduction, we must have all of the facts not just about the potential \noil reserves, but also about the precise environmental impacts and the \nstatus of the advanced technologies like directional drilling that are \npurported to mitigate these impacts. When Congress involves itself in \nvery complex energy markets, we ought to be very cautious to avoid \nunintended consequences that could exacerbate the high and volatile \nprices we have seen in recent months and years.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these difficult, but \nextremely important matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6322-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6322-S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Crapo: Thank you for letting me respond to this \n     subject. Energy prices are hitting every family hard in their \n     pockets. With prices going up on fuel it effects every \n     product that we buy. These energy prices are causing more \n     inflation on America than any other number one item we have. \n     This country is purchasing 60-70 percent of our oil from \n     foreign sources. What we need to do is become energy \n     independent. We need to do everything we can do to meet this \n     goal.\n       To me, the way we do that is doing everything such as; \n     renewable nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, biomass energy. But \n     just doing renewable energy is not enough. We still need oil \n     for lots of things, so we need to be deep drilling off \n     shores, drilling in Alaska, using shell oil and also the use \n     of coal. We also need new refineries to meet our future \n     needs.\n       I know that all of this will take a little bit of time to \n     accomplish but its time to get started. Please do not just \n     think of today but way out in the future. If this country \n     becomes energy independent it will lower our prices and help \n     keep inflation low.\n       So, please, all Senators and Representatives, work together \n     to make this country strong and energy independent.\n           Sincerely,\n     William, Hayden.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are riding our bicycles to work.

Our usage was up only very slightly, and we \n     had only about $4.00 to pay to balance out our account \n     following this past year's payments. We were about as close \n     to ``even'' as you can get. Our level pay (for Idaho Power) \n     went from $70 to $103. This is a nearly 50 percent increase \n     without a corresponding increase in usage. (Again, almost no \n     increase in usage at all.) Energy costs are affecting even \n     electrical power.\n       Gas prices are, of course, rapidly increasing. Diesel \n     prices, however, continue to rise even more. One of the \n     reasons we purchased a pickup with a diesel engine (for about \n     $5,000 extra) was because of the increased fuel mileage. Yet \n     we are being punished for choosing fuel efficiency because \n     the diesel prices continue to run far above even premium \n     grade gasoline. I have read many times that diesel is not the \n     most highly refined product from a barrel of oil. Because of \n     the high fuel prices, we cannot afford to go camping as many \n     times this year as last year, and I know of several others \n     who either are not camping at all or are cutting back \n     significantly.\n       I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, who for many \n     years with his family, was a missionary in Indonesia. He \n     simply said that in Indonesia people riot and rebel when fuel \n     prices go up because they know that when fuel costs rise, all \n     costs rise. Of course, I would not want to see the civil \n     disturbances in America, but I would like to see more people \n     (including those in Congress who apparently do not see this) \n     understand that fuel and energy costs affect all costs. We \n     are not facing an isolated issue of a rise at the gas \n     station. Shipping costs (whether by truck or plane) are up. \n     Shippers will not just ``eat'' those costs--they will be \n     cumulatively passed on to people who no longer have the \n     economic cushion to absorb it.\n       I am frustrated by the current Congress' position of \n     practicing opposition to oil exploration, increased refining \n     capacity, and any other short-term responses to an immediate \n     situation other than blaming us for using energy and blaming \n     oil companies for the amount of profits gained by a low \n     percentage of profit on an extremely high volume of business. \n     I too would like to see alternative energy sources--but those \n     are only long-term or very long-term solutions. Reducing \n     usage sounds nice until people realize that shutting down a \n     portion of our economy will have a ripple effect on every \n     other part of the economy. When fuel costs get too high, \n     businesses will end up closing either because of their own \n     costs or because their customers no longer have money to pay \n     them.\n       Another friend of mine owns a small plumbing business. He \n     described just last week that because of the fuel prices he \n     is now forced to either tell one of his employees to stay \n     home and run the routes himself (taking time away from \n     management and finding new accounts) or combine two \n     plumbers into one truck instead of them each going to \n     separate jobs during the day. This reduces the number of \n     customers he can serve during that day, which has a ripple \n     effect both to and through his business.\n       How nice it would be to have available the mass transit \n     from the Northeastern Corridor, from The Bay Area of \n     California, or from the Los Angeles area. For Idaho and much \n     of the West, this is not economically feasible without \n     massive subsidies from the federal government. The distances \n     between towns is too great to justify running buses or \n     building rails--there are not enough riders.\n       Sometimes it would be nice to make some of the people in \n     the Congress sit in a car as it travels at the posted speed \n     limit the ``short'' trip between Boise and the next city of \n     equal or greater size (Salt Lake? Spokane? Portland?). \n     Perhaps this all-day trip through minimally-populated areas \n     would help them understand that fuel is vital, distances \n     great, and practical and affordable alternative travel \n     options non-existent.\n       And none of this deals with the fact that when farmers know \n     they will lose money on a field because the costs of \n     production will exceed the possible revenue, they will simply \n     not plant.\n     Carl, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Thank you for this opportunity to share \n     an example of how we are dealing with high energy costs. Our \n     family is in Pocatello, and we have a son in school at the \n     University of Idaho. It costs $150 even with our 30 MPG cars \n     for the round trip to either visit him or have him visit us. \n     There is no real alternative of getting to Moscow from here \n     as plane fare is much more than that, and the travel time is \n     long no matter what the method. Getting a specialized \n     education in Idaho such as a law degree necessitates students \n     attending universities that are long distances from home. I \n     am sure there are other families with students in far-off \n     places that need face to face support making long journeys a \n     regular occurrence.\n       I am not an expert on energy reserves, but it has been said \n     by people that I trust to know these things that domestic oil \n     production has been stalled/curtailed due to strict laws and \n     environmental concerns. America has oil reserves in Alaska, \n     Texas, the Dakotas, and offshore that we are not using due to \n     various regulations. I would recommend allowing this domestic \n     production to happen as soon as possible.\n       Nuclear energy production is a necessity. With recent \n     advancements, this type of energy is low-cost, safe, \n     environmentally-friendly, and good for the domestic economy. \n     I would request that more nuclear plants be approved for \n     construction and use.\n       I appreciate your time and consideration in these matters.\n     John, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello Senator Crapo: A quick little story with a huge \n     impact. I live in a nice apartment complex and know several \n     people who live here. I have recently talked to a couple of \n     them, and they are having to outright move to get closer to \n     their jobs in order to make more per hour than the cost of a \n     round trip in their car. I myself am a 100% disabled Veteran. \n     I have to routinely make trips to Spokane, Washington, in \n     order to get medications to be monitored for my health \n     problems. Recently, I have had to postpone/reschedule trips \n     in order to save for the trip due to the huge increase in \n     fuel prices. People here in Sandpoint are also losing their \n     jobs left and right due to company downsizing caused directly \n     from rising fuel prices. What is this country coming to? I \n     think ``many'' Senators and Congressman/ladies should be \n     reminded that they work for us, the people of this country, \n     because if we want to we can elect them right out of office \n     just as quickly as we elected them into office. That also \n     goes with the President of this country. All this lip service \n     and no action. People just expect this any more and have \n     little faith that anyone will do anything to help this nation \n     rather than line their pockets with dirty money or favors for \n     selling the U.S. out in one way, shape, or form. Again, thank \n     you for voting no regarding the increase in gas prices. \n     Idahoans are ``so'' proud to be in this state. We are proud \n     that the upper management such as yourself still believe in \n     our Constitution and defend all amendments, not just the ones \n     that will get you elected. This means more to us that \n     anything I believe. Also, you carry through with your \n     promises to Idaho State and the people of this state. You set \n     the example for all the Senators, Congressmen, and the \n     President to follow.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Unfortunately, the high prices of energy are not just \n     hitting Idahoans at the pumps. The high gas prices have \n     opened the floodgates for the cost of consumer products to be \n     increased across the board. Everywhere we turn, it costs \n     more. Any mode of travel, food, clothing, household repair \n     (the repairman has to figure in the extra cost of gas), the \n     cost of fertilizer and feed for our livestock. Everyone is \n     concerned about the amount of foreclosures in the state. That \n     will only get worse as what income Idahoans had is diminished \n     by the additional cost of everything including gas. It will \n     be even harder for Idahoans to pay their house payment and we \n     may see even more foreclosures.\n       Mother Nature is having her way with our agriculture states \n     with flooding, etc. That will drive the cost of food and feed \n     even higher, and so much for ethylene. Be careful or it will \n     be a battle between feed and ethylene. If our nation does not \n     wise up and start producing our own food, fuel, etc. and quit \n     building houses on our most fertile ground. The legacy we \n     will leave ourselves and the future generations will be that \n     we gave away or built on our future and the nation by buying \n     and outsourcing too much to foreign countries. We will be at \n     their mercy for our food and fuel.\n       My humble opinions,\n     Mary, Bonners Ferry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Your vote against climate change \n     legislation smacked of partisan politics more to please the \n     oil companies and less to do with supporting Idahoans paying \n     less for gas.\n       Regarding your request for my observations on the current \n     situation:\n       I do NOT support: nuclear energy technologies (because of \n     the catastrophic consequences when failure happens); rampant \n     destruction of natural habitats for meager results. (i.e., \n     Alaska. What is the sense in investing millions of dollars to \n     drill for oil in the ANWR when estimates say it contains only \n     enough oil to solely support U.S. consumption for 7 months?); \n     tax breaks for oil companies making windfall profits.\n       I DO support: Wind and solar power; effective renewable and \n     alternative fuels; more stringent gas mileage demands on \n     automobile manufacturers; more research on affordable \n     hybrids; reduction in price on hybrids; tax incentives for \n     both building and purchasing hybrids; tax penalties for \n     purchasing Large SUV and low gas mileage autos; incentives \n     for conservation; penalties for price gouging on oil \n     companies; Government support for States developing better\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n     public transportation in smaller towns; tax incentives for \n     oil companies that reinvest their windfall profits into more \n     economical oil production and research and development.\n       On a personal note, I have been looking for a job, but \n     because of higher gas prices, I have been forced to limit \n     potential job interviews because of the cost of travel.\n       I would call that a catch 22!\n     Vera, Hope.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I absolutely agree that we are in \n     serious trouble vis-a-vis our energy situation. Here is my \n     story:\n       We have not been overly impacted by the high price of gas \n     because we deliberately choose to live less than five miles \n     from our office and we drive a Prius. Many days we do not \n     even need to take our car out of the garage. However, we see \n     many families in dire straits.\n       What needs to happen rather than increase our foolish \n     belief in oil by doing things like encouraging more oil \n     drilling in the U.S., is that we need to provide support and \n     incentives for Idaho families and all U.S. families to make \n     wise energy choices like we have. We need to provide even \n     greater tax incentives to those who choose hybrid or electric \n     vehicles. We need to institute tax credits for those who buy \n     or rent homes within walking/biking distance of their \n     workplaces. We need to demand of federal and local \n     governments that public transportation be provided in urban \n     areas and that areas like rural Idaho be connected to nearby \n     areas by fuel efficient means--for example, the electric fast \n     trains of Europe would work beautifully in a state like \n     Idaho--one line running from Moscow to Boise, one from Boise \n     to Pocatello or Salt Lake and one line running from Boise to \n     Sun Valley would make it possible to access almost all the \n     state now accessible by car by electric train.\n       We need to provide tax and other incentives for energy \n     produced by wind and solar power. We need to provide tax and \n     other incentives to our farmers to adopt less petroleum \n     dependent farming methods. We need to provide encouragement \n     to individuals to eat locally produced, non-petroleum based, \n     sustainable foods.\n       The only way we are going to save our national and our \n     personal economic well-being is to get off of oil. The only \n     way we are going to resolve the war between ourselves and the \n     Islamic fundamentalists is to reduce our military presence in \n     their lives and the only way we can do that is to release \n     ourselves from our dependence on the oil under the Middle \n     East. Once we do not need that oil, we will finally be free \n     and we will no longer be a target.\n       That is my story. Our family was lucky because we made wise \n     energy choices some time ago. We do not commute, we buy only \n     one 10-gallon tank of gas per month, and we get as much of \n     our food as possible from local growers. While we are feeling \n     the aware of the pinch of gas prices and mostly food prices \n     for items that we can't grow ourselves or get from local \n     growers, we are not suffering as so many Americans are. We \n     need to address the long term-issues so that more people will \n     be in the position we are in rather than simply putting out \n     small fires by doing things like reducing gas taxes or \n     drilling in Alaska. It is no good to put out small fires when \n     your whole house is in flames.\n     Deborah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6324-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GWINN, MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, small towns are at the heart of our \ncountry's history and cultural heritage. These communities, and the \ninstitutions and groups that make up these towns, are an enduring \naspect of our political, economic and social structure, offering their \nunique and special chapters to the American story. It is in this spirit \nthat I recognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of Gwinn, MI. \nThis town, which is flanked by the Escanaba River in Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula, is an important part of America's industrial history.\n  Situated in the Swanzy region, this area is rich in red iron ore, \nwhich attracted companies to the region as early as the 1870's for \nmining. As a result of these mining efforts, Gwinn was formally founded \nin 1908 by William Gwinn Mather, president of the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron \nCompany as a ``model town'' for its company's employees. Gwinn is one \nof only three ``model towns'' built in the Lake Superior mining region. \nMather named the town in honor of his mother, and hired Warren Manning, \na prominent architect from Boston, to design the layout of the town. \nIntended to provide for the social, physical, and cultural well-being \nof its residents and inspired by European and northeastern design, this \nthoughtfully conceived town remains a fine and relatively pristine \nexample of a model town of that era. On June 24, 2002, the town of \nGwinn was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, an \nimportant federal recognition of its historical significance.\n  Like many small mining towns, Gwinn has weathered some major \nindustrial shifts in the century following its founding. Mining \noperations in the region began to decline between the 1920s and 1940s \nand were all but eliminated after World War II. In the mid 1950s, KI \nSawyer Air Force Base was established in Marquette County and quickly \nbecame a major, and much needed, source of employment for the region. \nAfter the closure of Sawyer in 1995 as a result of the Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission process, it was successfully transformed into a \nhub of private enterprise. Now home to many businesses and some \nresidential housing, the former base is a testament to the collective \nefforts of this region to reinvent itself after experiencing yet \nanother significant blow to its economic base.\n  Gwinn's 100th anniversary is a tribute to the strength and \nperseverance of its citizens and of America's working families. This \nmilestone will be celebrated through festivities spanning from July 3 \nto July 12. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing \nthe residents of Gwinn as they celebrate their town's 100th \nanniversary. I wish them another 100 years achievement and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6324-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SARAH C. SNIDER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize a few of the many accomplishments of Sarah \nSnider, an outstanding health administrator with 15 years of experience \nin broadening health care access throughout rural America.\n  As the administrator of the Richard G. Lugar Center for Rural Health \nat Union Hospital in Terre Haute, IN, Ms. Snider has worked in \nconjunction with the hospital's Family Medicine Residency Program to \nincrease the number of primary care physicians who seek careers in \nrural medicine. She has also led the center's staff in the development \nof strategies that have greatly increased the exposure of needed rural \nhealth training programs. While serving in this role, Ms. Snider has \naccumulated an impressive list of accomplishments.\n  For example, in 1996, Ms. Snider worked in collaboration with her \ncolleagues to obtain needed funds for the building of the Clay City, \nIN, Center for Family Medicine. This clinic serves as a model training \nsite for family physicians and functions today as a vital primary care \naccess point for the citizens of Clay and surrounding counties. More \nrecently, Ms. Snider worked with community leaders in Clinton, IN, to \nestablish the Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center. Similar to the \nClay City facility, this community health center will serve as a \nteaching and learning site for primary care clinicians and address the \nconsiderable mental, physical, and dental health needs of surrounding \ncommunities.\n  Ms. Snider has also applied her talents towards the development of \nthe Landsbaum Center for Health Education in Terre Haute, IN. Dedicated \nin 2003, the Landsbaum Center is a state-of-the art building that \ncombines the prestigious teaching facilities of Union Hospital with the \neducational assets of Indiana State University and the Indiana \nUniversity School of Medicine.\n  It has been a tremendous pleasure for me to witness Sarah's efforts \nover the years. Her leadership, dedication, and counsel have benefited \nmany individuals. While she will be dearly missed in Terre Haute, I \nwish Sarah and her family all the best as they pursue new and exciting \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6324-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6324-S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SCOTTY COLSON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on Friday, June 20, 2008, \nUkraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oleh Shamshur, appointed \nScotty Colson, assistant to the mayor of Birmingham, AL, as an Honorary \nConsul of the Government of Ukraine.\n  This designation acknowledges in gratitude the work that the city of \nBirmingham and its citizens, under the leadership of Scotty Colson, \nhave done to assist the people of Ukraine, especially in the cities of \nKrasnodon and Vinnytsia since 1997, and in helping to\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nbuild the U.S.-Ukraine strategic partnership at the grassroots level. \nThis Birmingham-Ukraine relationship began in 1997 within the U.S.-\nUkraine Foundation's U.S.-Ukraine Community Partnerships Project, which \nwas funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, \nwith the strong support of Congress.\n  It is almost impossible to comprehend the positive impact the U.S.-\nUkraine Foundation's Community Partnership Program has had all across \nUkraine and the amazing collateral benefits it has brought to U.S.-\nUkrainian relations. And, with Scotty Colson's leadership the \nBirmingham-Krasnodon partnership exemplifies the very best of what \nAmerica has to offer--American volunteers, Americans giving of a \nhelping hand, and Americans demonstrating their commitment to a better \nworld.\n  Through the relationship fostered by the Community Partnership \nProject, Birmingham and Krasnodon worked together to enhance citywide \ndevelopment. Birmingham shared its health experience with Krasnodon \nenabling the city to make substantial improvement to its outdated \nmedical system. Due to the installation of mini-boilers in city \nbuildings, the city of Krasnodon significantly reduced costs during the \n2000-2001 winter season. Coming from the top-down control model of the \nCommunist system but learning from citizen participation in Birmingham, \nKrasnodon established public committees on health care and city \nbeautification, public hearings on government performance and future \nplans and a roundtable discussion on housing and neighborhood \ncommunities. Transparent government with genuine citizen involvement \nflourishes. To help enable future growth Krasnodon established a one-\nstop office to register businesses.\n  Through Scotty Colson and the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation's relationship \nwith Birmingham, other associations and contacts developed for the \nfoundation in and out of Alabama for the purpose of developing U.S.-\nUkraine related technical assistance projects. These associations have \nall assisted the foundation in its mission to aid Ukraine in the \ndevelopment of democratic institutions, economic development and human \nrights. It is my understanding that one of the favorite slogans within \nthe U.S.-Ukraine Community Partnerships Project, which was officially \nfunded from 1997 to 2007, came from Birmingham's neighborhoods: ``You \ndon't have to move to live in a better neighborhood.''\n  Thirteen other cities across the United States partnered with \nUkrainian communities to work on strategic planning, economic \ndevelopment, citizen participation, and communal services. There are \nmany success stories. Hundreds of citizen diplomats from the U.S. \ncommunities, who volunteered their professional services at a value of \nover $5 million to aid Ukraine, represented their own communities and \noffered the best of America through this program.\n  Four mayors from Birmingham, as well as many other community \ncitizens, and officials, actively participated in this program during \nthe period of 1997-2007. As I have said, these personal and voluntary \nefforts represented the best of America.\n  The people of Birmingham, AL, who continually develop their own \ncommunity, are sharing their experience and giving confidence and hope \nto cities and towns in Ukraine, that they too can have a better future \nand that they don't have to move to live in a better neighborhood. I am \nproud to call the recognition Scotty has received from Ukraine to the \nattention of my Senate colleagues. This recognition of Scotty, really \non behalf of the fabulous contributions of the volunteers from \nBirmingham, AL, has contributed greatly to the advancement of our \ncountry's foreign policy interests and specifically to our strategic \ninterests with Ukraine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6325-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING 65 YEARS OF MARRIAGE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it is rare these days to see one \ncouple make it to 65 years of marriage. It is even more rare to see two \ncouples, who are best friends, make it to that rather remarkable \nmilestone at the same time. This weekend in Murdo, SD, Harold and Pat \nThune and John and Virginia Parker will both celebrate 65 years of \nmarriage.\n  When Harold Thune and John Parker graduated Murdo High School \ntogether in the spring of 1937, neither realized how entwined their \nlives would become over time. After high school graduation John moved \nto California. Harold went on to become a basketball star at the \nUniversity of Minnesota and then a fighter pilot during World War II. \nHarold returned to Murdo with his young wife Patricia when the war \nended to take over the family business at the request of his father who \nwas in poor health.\n  It was the summer of 1951 when John returned to Murdo with his wife \nVirginia and reconnected with his high school classmate, who by this \ntime had three young children. In the intervening years since high \nschool, John had found real purpose in his life through his Christian \nfaith. Anxious to share that faith with his high school friend, he \nbegan a small Bible study in that summer of 1951. Through that Bible \nstudy, first Pat, then Harold made a profession of faith that has \nserved as their life's foundation to this day. They would be the first \nto tell you that it is hard to imagine them celebrating this blessed \noccasion absent that life-changing experience.\n  We honor both couples on this occasion of 65 years of marriage, for \nstaying true to their God, to each other, and to their families. Their \nexample of steadfast commitment and devotion is a powerful witness and \ninspiration to those who have come after about what a Christian \nmarriage should be.

A bill to establish a small business energy emergency \ndisaster loan program; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the temperatures pushing 90 degrees \nhere in Washington, today might strike some as an odd time to introduce \na bill on heating fuels. But for those of us who know the costs of a \ncold winter ahead, the real fuel crisis is now--and the clock is \nticking when it comes to Washington's ability to step in and help \nbefore it's too late and this problem becomes a crisis and another \nstate of emergency is declared on Massachusetts. Now and in the coming \nweeks, families and businesses will be sitting down to sign their \nheating fuel contracts, with record prices creating impossible \ndecisions between feeding one's family and heating the home, and laying \noff employees or going further into debt.\n  This week the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held a \nhearing entitled ``Examining Solutions to Cope with the Rise in Home \nHeating Oil Prices'' in which we heard testimony on the effect the \nhistoric spike in heating oil prices is having on small businesses. \nNationally, 7.7 million households heat their homes with home heating \noil. In Massachusetts, more than 963,000 households use home heating \noil delivered by over 800 distributors, many of them small businesses.\n  It is reality--not rhetoric--that price spikes will force people to \ndecide whether to feed their families or heat their homes, and will \nforce small businesses to layoff employees and in some cases shut their \ndoors. The Energy Information Administration is projecting that heating \noil prices will be up 56 percent in 2009 as compared with 2007, and \neven that estimate may be modest. Prices for a gallon of home heating \noil sit at over $4.50 today compared with less then a dollar 10 years \nago. That means consumers will have to pay thousands more than ever \nbefore to heat their homes this winter, and small businesses who rely \non these and other fuels to heat their businesses will face \nskyrocketing bills at a time when the economy and the credit crunch are \nalready squeezing their bottom lines.\n  While oil companies are reaping record profits, small business owners \nare hard hit by these price spikes. Most heating oil distribution is \ndone by small businesses who are victimized many times over by the \nrising price of fuel. Their accounts receivables go through the roof--\nwhich isn't a pretty picture, especially during a credit crunch. Their \ncustomers have a difficult time paying their bills and rising credit \ncard fees eat into their margins. The volatility in the market also \ncauses price hedging--a practice of locking into a price in order to \nbuy certainty--to rise from a few cents a gallon a few years ago to \nupwards of 40 cents a gallon today, rendering almost useless this tool \nthat used to be helpful in giving distributors and consumers an \ninsurance policy against more crippling prices during the winter when \nthe market pressures were greater. These problems are affecting small \nbusinesses who work with other heating fuels as well, such as kerosene, \npropane, and natural gas.\n  There are many viable and successful small businesses that need \nassistance to get through times when heating fuel prices spike. This is \nwhy I, along with Senator Snowe, am reintroducing the Small Business \nEnergy Emergency Relief Act to provide assistance through affordable, \nlow-interest Small Business Administration disaster loans to small \nbusinesses that have suffered economic\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nharm and can't pay their bills because of the huge price increases in \nheating oil, propane, kerosene, and natural gas. Whether they are small \nfuel distributors or business owners who rely on those fuels to heat \ntheir stores, many small businesses are dependent on these four heating \nfuels.\n\n  This bill would amend the Small Business Act to authorize the Small \nBusiness Administration to make disaster loans of up to $1.5 million, \nand an exception can be made by the Administrator for higher loans if \nthe borrower constitutes a major source of employment, to assist small \nbusinesses that have suffered substantial economic injury as the result \nof a significant increase in the price of kerosene, propane, natural \ngas, or heating oil. Heating fuel prices would have to go up by 50 \npercent over the average price during the same 10-day period in the \nprevious 2 years to trigger an energy emergency declaration from the \nPresident or the Administrator, though a Governor of a State that has \nexperienced a significant rise in the price of home heating oil may \nalso request assistance for small businesses in that State.\n  The qualifications for an economic injury disaster loan are the same \nas for economic injury loans for a physical disaster. A small business \nmust have demonstrated economic injury as a result of the price \nincreases; demonstrate the inability to pay its bills; be unable to \nlocate financing elsewhere; and demonstrate the ability to repay the \nloan. As in years past, the bill retains a provision authored by \nSenators Harkin and Kohl to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural \nDevelopment Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans \nto farm operations that qualify as a small business and that have \nsuffered substantial economic injury on or after October 1, 2007, as \nthe result of a significant increase in energy costs in connection with \nan energy emergency declaration by the President or the Secretary.\n  This bill has been a collaborative process over many years, which is \ndemonstrated by other provisions that we have retained, including one \nby Senator Levin to allow small businesses to use the proceeds of the \nloans not only for working capital to recover from the economic injury \nof the energy costs but also to convert their systems to use \nalternative or renewable energy sources. That was complimented by a \nprovision added by Senator Enzi to allow the proceeds for cogeneration \nsystems.\n  This bill was originally introduced in the 107th Congress as S. 295 \nand it passed the full Senate with 34 cosponsors. Since then, it has \npassed the Senate twice more, both times in the 109th Congress, once as \nan amendment to H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and once as part \nof a larger Katrina relief amendment to H.R. 2862, only to be dropped \nin conference both times. Furthermore, this bill has passed the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship several times, \nincluding in 2006 as a stand alone bill and in 2007 as part of the \nSmall Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act.\n  With heating fuel prices soaring to never before seen heights, and \nwith no end in sight, it is time we pass this bill and make it law. \nSmall businesses across the country already operate on razor thin \nmargins, and the spike in heating fuels this winter will push many \notherwise successful businesses over the edge and into bankruptcy. With \nthe credit markets tightening, giving these small businesses low \ninterest loans to help them make it through the winter is a common \nsense, low cost way to help small businesses, save jobs, and secure the \nbackbone of our economy.\n  I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her tireless work on these \nissues and for cosponsoring this bill, and I ask that this statement is \nprinted for the record. I would also like to thank Senators Kennedy, \nSchumer, Stabenow, Landrieu, Durbin, Collins, Clinton, Harkin, Dodd, \nand Sanders for joining me as original cosponsors, and I ask that all \nSenators join me in supporting this bill that will help save small \nbusinesses across this country who are struggling to adjust to the \nworld of skyrocketing energy prices that we must deal with today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Energy \n     Emergency Relief Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean \n     the Small Business Administration and the Administrator \n     thereof, respectively; and\n       (2) the term ``small business concern'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     632).\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a significant number of small business concerns in the \n     United States, nonfarm as well as agricultural producers, use \n     heating oil, natural gas, propane, or kerosene to heat their \n     facilities and for other purposes;\n       (2) a significant number of small business concerns in the \n     United States sell, distribute, market, or otherwise engage \n     in commerce directly related to heating oil, natural gas, \n     propane, and kerosene; and\n       (3) significant increases in the price of heating oil, \n     natural gas, propane, or kerosene--\n       (A) disproportionately harm small business concerns \n     dependent on those fuels or that use, sell, or distribute \n     those fuels in the ordinary course of their business, and can \n     cause them substantial economic injury;\n       (B) can negatively affect the national economy and regional \n     economies;\n       (C) have occurred in the winters of 1983 to 1984, 1988 to \n     1989, 1996 to 1997, 1999 to 2000, 2000 to 2001, 2004 to 2005, \n     2006 to 2007, and 2007 to 2008; and\n       (D) can be caused by a host of factors, including \n     international conflicts, global or regional supply \n     difficulties, weather conditions, insufficient inventories, \n     refinery capacity, transportation, and competitive structures \n     in the markets, causes that are often unforeseeable to, and \n     beyond the control of, those who own and operate small \n     business concerns.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 606\n\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``the CDC'') found that at \n     the end of 2003, between 1,039,000 and 1,185,000 individuals \n     in the United States were HIV positive, an increase from the \n     estimated 850,000 to 950,000 such individuals at the end of \n     2002;\n       Whereas the CDC estimated that at the end of 2006, African-\n     Americans represented 49 percent of all individuals living \n     with HIV/AIDS, Whites represented 30 percent, and Hispanics \n     represented 18 percent;\n       Whereas the CDC further found that at the end of 2006, men \n     accounted for nearly 73 percent of all individuals living \n     with HIV/AIDS and women represented more than 26 percent;\n       Whereas the CDC estimated that from the beginning of the \n     epidemic through 2006, 565,927 individuals in the United \n     States have died of AIDS;\n       Whereas the CDC has determined that the leading cause of \n     HIV infection is male-to-male sexual contact, followed by \n     heterosexual contact and injection drug use;\n       Whereas the CDC has estimated that during the 10-year \n     period beginning in 1998, the rate of new infections in the \n     United States has remained at approximately 40,000 annually, \n     with no decline;\n       Whereas individuals at high risk of acquiring HIV are also \n     often at high risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted \n     infections;\n       Whereas a 2008 report from the CDC estimated that in the \n     United States, 1 in 4 young women and nearly 1 in 2 young \n     African-American women between the ages of 14 and 19 have a \n     sexually transmitted infection;\n       Whereas the CDC estimates that about 25 percent of all HIV-\n     positive individuals are unaware of their status;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that when infected individuals knew \n     their status, they were more likely to practice HIV risk-\n     reduction behaviors;\n       Whereas the CDC reported that in 2005, 40 percent of those \n     individuals diagnosed as HIV-positive were later diagnosed \n     with AIDS within 1 year of their HIV test;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that early knowledge of HIV status \n     is important for connecting HIV-positive individuals with \n     medical care and services that can reduce mortality and \n     prevent the onset of AIDS;\n       Whereas a 2004 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found \n     that many individuals in the United States wanted more \n     information about HIV, including the different types of HIV \n     tests available, testing costs, test result confidentiality, \n     and testing locations;\n       Whereas African-Americans and Latinos are much more likely \n     than Whites to say they need more information about HIV \n     testing;\n       Whereas anxieties, misconceptions, and stigma have been \n     traditionally associated with HIV/AIDS and HIV testing;\n       Whereas the most commonly used HIV tests require a 2 week \n     waiting period for a diagnosis, and such a waiting period \n     contributes to the anxiety surrounding HIV testing that \n     discourages individuals from receiving their diagnosis;\n       Whereas the CDC estimated that in 2004, among those who \n     took an HIV test at sites funded by the CDC, 22 percent did \n     not return for their test results;\n       Whereas rapid test kits approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration have made HIV testing easier, more accessible, \n     and less invasive, while delivering results within a single \n     day;\n       Whereas prevention counseling is an essential part of HIV \n     testing, and when conducted according to established CDC \n     guidelines, has been shown to be effective at producing \n     individual behavioral change;\n       Whereas the National Association of People with AIDS, \n     founded in 1983, is the oldest coalition of people living \n     with HIV/AIDS, and advocates on behalf of all people living \n     with HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas National HIV Testing Day is an annual campaign \n     introduced in 1995 and produced by the National Association \n     of People with AIDS to encourage individuals to seek out and \n     receive voluntary HIV counseling and testing;\n       Whereas the theme of National HIV Testing Day 2008 is, \n     ``Take the test, take control'';\n       Whereas the Advancing HIV Prevention Initiative of the CDC \n     emphasizes the importance of HIV testing;\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\n       Whereas as part of its overall public health mission, the \n     CDC annually supports the National HIV Prevention Conference \n     and National HIV Testing Day; and\n       Whereas June 27 of each year is now recognized as National \n     HIV Testing Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 27, 2008, as National HIV Testing Day;\n       (2) encourages State and local governments, including their \n     public health agencies, to recognize such a day, to publicize \n     its importance among their communities, to encourage \n     individuals to undergo counseling and testing for HIV and \n     other sexually transmitted infections, and to establish and \n     maintain effective linkages to care and treatment services \n     for individuals testing positive;\n       (3) encourages the appropriate use of rapid test kits \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a fast and \n     efficient method of HIV testing;\n       (4) encourages National, State, and local media \n     organizations to carry messages in support of National HIV \n     Testing Day;\n       (5) encourages the President to emphasize the importance of \n     addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic among all individuals in the \n     United States, but especially among minority communities; and\n       (6) supports the development of a National AIDS strategy \n     with clear goals and objectives to reduce new HIV infections, \n     especially among minorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6331-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5065.

Mr. President, today we confirmed three nominations for \nhigh level positions in the Department of Justice. The Senate is moving \nforward to confirm the nomination of Gregory Katsas to be Assistant \nAttorney General for the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. \nThis is a nomination that was set to be confirmed before the Easter \nrecess until it was blocked by a last-minute, anonymous Republican hold \nand additional complications in our relationship with the Department of \nJustice arose. We have made sufficient progress to move forward today.\n  We also confirmed today two additional nominations, Kelly H. Rankin \nto be U.S. Attorney for the District of Wyoming and Clyde R. Cook to be \nU.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Those are \namong the many presidential nominations that we have expedited through \nthe Judiciary Committee. They were considered and reported by the \nCommittee yesterday and being confirmed today.\n  With the confirmations today, we will have confirmed 35 executive \nnominations so far this Congress, including the confirmations of 12 \nU.S. attorneys, 7 U.S. marshals, and the top 3 positions at the Justice \nDepartment. When the President and Senate Republicans play to rightwing \nspecial interests with constant complaints about judicial nominations, \nthey ignore the progress we have made to restock the leadership ranks \nat the Department of Justice that were decimated by the scandals of the \nGonzales era.\n  Of course, the grumblings on judicial nominations from the other side \nof the aisle are nothing more than partisan, election-year rhetoric \nthat rings particularly hollow in light of the progress we have made. \nWith the 5 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench \nconfirmed this week by the Senate, including 2 for circuit court \nvacancies, the Senate under Democratic leadership has already, before \nthe Fourth of July recess, matched the total of 54 judicial \nconfirmations reached in 2 full years of the last Congress. That was a \nCongress with a Republican chairman and Republican majority working to \nconfirm the nominees of a Republican President. And we have already \nmatched their total.\n  The 14 judicial confirmations so far this year compare to the zero \nregistered by a Republican led Senate by\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nthis juncture during the 1996 session, another presidential election \nyear.\n  The fact that Senate Democrats have moved more of President Bush's \nnominees more quickly when we have been in the majority than the \nRepublicans did working with a President of their own party have is \nnothing new, just unacknowledged. We confirmed 100 nominations in only \n17 months in 2001 and 2002, while working with a most uncooperative \nWhite House, reducing the judicial vacancies I confronted when I became \nJudiciary Committee chairman in the summer of 2001 by 45 percent by the \nend of 2002. The 40 additional judicial nominations we confirmed when I \nbecame chairman, again, last year was more than in any of the previous \n3 years with a Republican majority and Republican chairman.\n  It is ironic that the Senate's Republican minority is so focused on \nthe number of judges, because the reduction in judicial vacancies is \nthe one number that has improved during the Bush administration in an \nera of skyrocketing gas prices, unemployment, health care costs and \ndeficits and plummeting consumer confidence and home values.\n  On July 1, 2000, when a Republican Senate majority was considering \nthe judicial nominees of a Democratic President in a presidential \nelection year, there were 60 judicial vacancies. Twenty-one were \ncircuit court vacancies. Those vacancies were the result of years of \nRepublican pocket filibusters of judicial nominations. In stark \ncontrast, after the 2 nominations we confirmed yesterday and the \ncircuit court judges we confirmed on Tuesday, there are just 40 total \njudicial vacancies throughout the country, with only 9 circuit court \nvacancies. By confirming Judge Helene White and Ray Kethledge to the \nlast two vacancies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, we reduced \ncircuit court vacancies to single digits for the first time in \ndecades--nine vacancies on our Nation's 13 circuit courts.\n  The Judiciary Committee and the Senate have continued to make \nprogress filling judicial vacancies even while having to devote \nextensive time and attention to rebuilding the Department of Justice. \nAt the beginning of this Congress, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts. Over the next 9 months, our efforts revealed a \nDepartment of Justice gone awry. The leadership crisis came more and \nmore into view as Senator Specter and I led a bipartisan group of \nconcerned Senators to consider the U.S. attorney firing scandal, a \nconfrontation over the legality of the administration's warrantless \nwiretapping program, the untoward political influence of the White \nHouse at the Department of Justice, and the secret legal memos excusing \nall manner of excess and subverting the rule of law.\n  What our efforts exposed was a crisis of leadership that took a heavy \ntoll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the Justice \nDepartment and provided it with safe harbor from political \ninterference. It shook the confidence of the American people. Through \nbipartisan efforts among those from both sides of the aisle who care \nabout Federal law enforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined \ntogether to press for accountability. That resulted in a change in \nleadership at the Department, with the resignations of the Attorney \nGeneral and many high-ranking Department officials.\n  This week's troubling report from the Department's inspector general \nconfirms what our oversight efforts in this Congress have uncovered \nabout the politicization of hiring practices at the Department. It \nconfirms our findings and our fears that the same senior Department \nofficials involved with the firing of U.S. attorneys were injecting \nimproper political motives into the process of hiring young attorneys. \nI suspect further reports from the inspector general will continue to \nshed light on the extent to which the Bush administration has allowed \npolitics to affect--and infect--the Department's priorities, from law \nenforcement to the operation of the crucial Civil Rights Division to \nthe Department's hiring practices.\n  This report and those to follow will serve as a reminder to future \nPresidents that never again should blatant partisanship be made the \ncrux of the Justice Department's hiring practices. The Department of \nJustice is not the President's legal defense team. It houses our \nNation's top law enforcement officers, and it has been crippled in the \nlast 7 years. By beginning the first real oversight efforts of this \nadministration, we have uncovered troubling truths about this \nadministration's efforts to infuse partisan politics into our Nation's \ntop law enforcement agency.\n  The oversight efforts did not complete our work. Asy result of the \nmass resignations at the Justice Department in the wake of the \nscandals, the committee held seven hearings on highranking replacements \nto restock and restore the leadership of the Department of Justice \nbetween September of last year up through the spring, including \nconfirmation hearings for the new Attorney General, the new Deputy \nAttorney General, the new Associate Attorney General, and so many \nothers. I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearings on the \nKatsas nomination. Today we continue that progress by confirming \nanother nominee for an important leadership position at the Department.\n  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent \nJustice Department, and that we ensure that this sad era in the history \nof the Department is not repeated. We have seen what happens when the \nrule of law plays second fiddle to a President's agenda and the \npartisan desires of political operatives and it is a disaster for the \nAmerican people. Both the President and the Nation are best served by a \nJustice Department that provides sound advice and takes responsible \naction, without regard to political considerations--not one that \ndevelops legalistic loopholes and ideological litmus tests to serve the \nends of a particular administration.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/27/senate-section/article/S6336-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
