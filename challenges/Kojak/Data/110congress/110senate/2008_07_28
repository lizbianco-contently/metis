Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nconsiders S. 3268, the bill be considered in the following manner: \nthere be 3 hours of general debate on the bill, equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; that the only first-\ndegree amendments in order be those listed in this agreement and that \nsecond-degree amendments which are relevant to the first degree to \nwhich offered be in order; provided further that if the managers and \nleaders acting jointly determine that a side-by-side amendment strategy \nis the appropriate manner to address the amendments in order, then in \nlieu of a second degree a side-by-side amendment would be in order, \nwith the majority side getting the first vote if that were the case; \nthat debate time on any amendment, first or second degree, in this \nagreement be limited to 2 hours equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that each amendment, first and second-degree, be subject to \nan affirmative 60-vote threshold; that if it achieves that threshold, \nthen it be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, but if it does not achieve the affirmative 60 votes, then the \namendment be withdrawn; the Republican amendments would be offshore \ndrilling, an oil shale amendment, nuclear energy, and then there is a \npackage of--I think there are 42 cosponsors in a package they have \nrelating to energy; the Democratic amendments: We would have four \namendments on the subject of energy; that upon disposition of all \namendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  Mr. President, before the distinguished Republican leader decides \nwhat to do on this, basically this is on the energy package to set this \nup where there would be, as indicated here, four amendments on each \nside. Ours could either be second degrees or, if we wanted a side by \nside, we could do that. There would be, as has been the standard around \nhere on issues such as this, a 60-vote threshold. This would take care \nof issues that we understand are important to the minority: offshore \ndrilling, oil shale exploration, nuclear energy, and the omnibus \npackage that they put together.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsay to my good friend, the majority leader, I think we are getting very \nclose to being able to reach an agreement to go forward. This is a \nsignificant step in the direction I had hoped we might take.\n  I ask my good friend, I have a leadership meeting in an hour or so. I \nwish to consult with my leadership team about the proposal he has \noffered. But I think----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw the consent request and will \nrenew it at a later time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say, I am very encouraged by \nthis\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\ndevelopment. I thank my good friend for his offer, and I should be able \nto get back to him within a couple of hours or less, after having a \nchance to talk about it with my team. I thank him very much.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the other consent I was going to ask is \nconsent that S. 3268--that is the Energy bill that is before us now, \nthe speculation bill--remain the pending business, notwithstanding the \nadoption of a motion to proceed to a nonprivileged item; namely, it \nwould be the Coburn package. The reason that is important is, if we do \nthat now--we have a vote at 4 o'clock or 4:20, whatever the case might \nbe--I wanted to make sure that one of the arguments used against that \ngoing forward, which is that energy would not remain as the pending \nbusiness, that this agreement would take care of that. So if people \nwant to object to proceeding on the matter we now have before us, that \nwe are going to be voting on in a short period of time, if they want to \nuse the excuse it is going to take us off energy, this consent \nagreement would not do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I \nunderstand it, this consent, if entered, would have the effect of \nmoving us off of energy, and it is my view, and I think close to the \nunanimous view of my conference, that we ought to stay on this energy \nspeculation bill, as it might be amended, and proceed to amendments \nsuch as we have in good faith discussed here a few moments ago. So I at \nthis time would object to this.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this does not take us off energy. But \nanyway, the objection has been heard. So I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7542-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7542-S7544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a woman who lives in Sparks, NV. \nHer name is Kathie Barrett. She is married and has two children. Sparks \nis a suburb of Reno, NV. When you are there, you cannot tell whether \nyou are in Sparks or Reno. The demarcation between the two over the \nyears has become insignificant. You cannot tell most of the time \nwhether you are in Reno or Sparks.\n  Kathie, after taking several years off to raise her children, went \nback to work as a librarian's assistant. Six years ago, Kathie was \ndiagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. Of course, she was declared \nunable to continue to work.\n  Her breathing capacity is extremely limited and getting worse every \nday, but in spite of tremendous muscle loss and coordination in her \nneck and back, she and her husband Martin traveled to Washington, DC, \nfrom Sparks to ask Congress to pass the ALS Registry Act.\n  She is one of 5,600 Americans who are newly diagnosed every year with \nthis fatal disease, Lou Gehrig's disease. There is no cure for the \ndisease, and the one FDA-approved drug works for only 20 percent of the \npatients, and even then it merely extends life for a few months.\n  Lou Gehrig's disease has proven particularly hard for scientists and \ndoctors to research, much less cure. One reason is that there is a \nproblem: There is no centralized place where the data on this disease \nis collected. Researchers have only a patchwork of information to work \nwith.\n  I introduced the ALS Registry Act last year to create a database at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to centralize research \nand information on Lou Gehrig's disease. This legislation would not \nguarantee a cure for Kathie and thousands of other Americans who \nsuffer, but for the first time it would give them hope for new \ntreatment and the prospect of a cure.\n  I was happy to see the House of Representatives embrace my \nlegislation by an overwhelming vote of 411 to 3--411 to 3. When the ALS \nRegistry Act reached the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee here in the Senate, it passed unanimously. It seemed at the \ntime this worthy initiative was headed toward swift passage. Yet one \nRepublican Senator prevented it from passing. Kathie Barrett continues \nto wait for Congress to act. Tens of thousands of others continue to \nsuffer, as doctors and scientists are unable to gather and access the \ninformation that could help them.\n  The same Republican Senator who continued to hold up passage of the \nALS Registry Act has, unfortunately, done the same for dozens of other \nworthy and overwhelmingly bipartisan bills. A few of these bills \ninclude, in this package alone, the Emmitt Till Unsolved Crimes bill. \nEmmitt Till's brother was here testifying about the importance of this \nlegislation within the past week or so. This bill would help heal old \nwounds and provide the Department of Justice and the FBI tools needed \nto effectively investigate and prosecute unsolved civil rights era \nmurders, and there are lots of them.\n  Another one of the bills is the runaway and homeless youth bill, \nwhich would provide grants for health care, education, and workforce \nprograms, and housing programs for runaways and homeless youth, which \nis essential. We need that passed.\n  Another one of the bills is the combating child exploitation bill, \nwhich would provide grants to train law enforcement to use technology \nto track individuals who trade in child pornography and establish an \nInternet Crimes Against Children Task Force.\n  Another one of the bills is the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis \nAct, which would enhance cooperation in research, rehabilitation, and \nquality of life for people who suffer from paralysis.\n  We tried to pass each of these bills separately, but we have had to \nface approximately 90 filibusters in the last 18 months. Each one of \nthese filibusters takes about--if you put them together, it takes over \na week. So we have been unable to do these one at a time.\n  Our efforts to pass these bills separately have been stalled by the \nobjection of one Senator. All Senators should refuse to let that \nsenseless objection be the last word on these important measures.\n  We have packaged these and other bills in the Advancing America's \nPriorities Act, to give the Senate the chance to overcome this \nsenseless obstructing of our Nation's business.\n  Not a single one of the 35 bills in this package that has been \npackaged into one are partisan, nor are they controversial.\n  These bills have been passed by the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly and their respective Senate committees with overwhelming \nsupport from Democrats and from Republicans.\n  The prime Republican obstructor to these bills asserts that he \nopposes them because they cost too much. That argument reflects an \nintentional mischaracterization of the legislative process. This is an \nauthorization bill, not an appropriations bill. For those uninitiated \nin the ways of Congress, an authorization bill does not create 1 penny \nof spending. The Senator preventing this legislation from passing knows \nthis, but he continues this facade. Spending decisions are made through \nan entirely separate budget and appropriations process. The \nappropriations process is when our limited Federal resources are \ndivided. If Republicans or this Senator want to argue against any of \nthese programs during the appropriations process, they have every right \nto do that.\n  In fact, the appropriations process affords them three separate \nopportunities: in the subcommittee, the full committee, and the Senate \nfloor.\n  All these authorization bills do is move these initiatives forward in \nthe legislative process. It allows them to be considered for the \nappropriations process. If we do not authorize them now, they will not \nbe eligible for consideration during the appropriations process. Voting \nagainst them now would deny Congress the opportunity to fund any of \nthem.\n  So do I hope that most, if not all, of these initiatives will be \nfunded during the appropriations process? Absolutely.\n  I no longer am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I had been \nfor 25 years or so, but I am not now because of my other \nresponsibilities. So I hope they are all funded, but that is a \ndifferent arm. I don't make that decision.\n  Congress must always be watchful and prudent with the taxpayers' \ndollars, and the person objecting to these is no more prudent than any \nof the other 99 Senators regarding the taxpayers' dollar.\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\n  I am as alarmed as anyone that President Bush and his Republican \nallies in Congress have allowed the national debt to increase by over \n$3 trillion over the last 7\\1/2\\ years. I am as alarmed as anyone that \nwe continue to spend $5,000 a second in Iraq, funding a $12 billion war \nevery month with borrowed money, putting it on credit--a big credit \ncard--and sending the bill to our children and our grandchildren. I am \nas alarmed as anyone to hear this morning that there will be a record \nbudget deficit in 2009 of about half a trillion dollars. The fiscal \nirresponsibility of this administration will be President Bush's \nlegacy.\n  However, this package of bills, including the ALS registry I have \ntalked about, helping runaways and homeless children, providing the \nJustice Department with tools to fight unresolved crimes, and cracking \ndown on child pornography--these are all priorities, and priorities of \nall of us, Democrats and Republicans. We should all embrace these \npriorities. They will not add a single penny to the Bush budget \ndeficit.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. The independent Congressional \nBudget Office, which is not partisan, has reviewed the Advancing \nAmerica's Priorities Act and reports this:\n\n       Those authorizations do not cause changes in Federal \n     spending or revenues.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement--in fact, it is a letter \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office, signed by Peter Orszag, who is \nthe Director, copies of which were sent to two members of the \ncommittee, one to Chairman Conrad and one to Judd Gregg. I ask \nunanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed S. 3297, a bill to advance America's priorities, as \n     introduced on July 22, 2008. The bill includes numerous \n     provisions that would affect health care, criminal statutes, \n     laws to protect wildlife and the environment, international \n     aid programs, efforts to promote commerce, ocean research, \n     and other government programs.\n       Most of the bill's provisions would specifically or \n     implicitly authorize increased appropriations for purposes \n     specified in the bill. By themselves--that is, in the absence \n     of subsequent legislation--those authorizations do not cause \n     changes in federal spending or revenues.\n       Although CBO has not completed a comprehensive review of S. \n     3297, we have previously prepared cost estimates for numerous \n     pieces of legislation that are similar or identical to most \n     of the major provisions in this bill. Based on those previous \n     estimates and on a preliminary review of S. 3297, CBO \n     estimates that, in total, the bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of approximately $10 billion over the 2009-2013 \n     period. CBO estimates that, if those sums are appropriated in \n     future legislation, implementing the bill would cost about $8 \n     billion over the 2009-2013 period.\n       Some provisions of S. 3297 would establish new federal \n     crimes. Because those prosecuted and convicted under S. 3297 \n     could be subject to criminal fines, the Federal Government \n     might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. \n     Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, then deposited in \n     the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. CBO expects that any \n     additional revenues and direct spending would not be \n     significant because of the relatively small number of cases \n     affected.\n       S. 3297 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would \n     impose a private-sector mandate on certain entities that \n     handle nonhuman primates, but CBO expects that the cost of \n     the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold \n     established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($136 million \n     in 2008, adjusted for inflation).\n       If you wish any further details, we will be pleased to \n     provide them. The CBO staff contact is Kim Cawley.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an indisputable fact. Any efforts to \nportray this legislation as a spending bill--much less a reckless \nspending bill--are indisputably false.\n  We have been down this road before. Earlier this year, the same \nRepublican Senator who is the leading obstructor of these bills did the \nsame thing for a package of lands bills. We acted in good faith and \nnegotiated a set of amendments with him so that his concerns would \nreceive full and fair consideration on the Senate floor. Those familiar \nwith our negotiations would surely agree that we offered him a far more \ngenerous arrangement for amendments than many Democrats or Republicans \nwould have thought his objections merited. But after spending \nconsiderable time negotiating in good faith, it became clear this \nSenator was not serious about reaching an agreement. Then, like now, we \ntried to pass the more than 60 initiatives in the lands package as \nstand-alone legislation. Those efforts were obstructed by the \nRepublican side. After months of delay, we finally voted on the lands \npackage. This package passed the Senate by a vote of 91 to 4. Every one \nof them is now law. The American people are benefiting from each one of \nthem.\n  Some Republican Senators take another approach to explain their \nobstruction to this legislation. They say it is an effort to preserve \nminority rights.\n  Democrats have been more than willing to open debate on amendments, \neven on legislation such as this where we are baffled by Republican \nopposition. If the Republican Senator or Senators who are blocking this \nlegislation are serious about having concerns heard on the floor, they \nshould offer an opportunity to do that--they are certainly entitled to \nit--but it is clear that the ultimate goal is to make political points \nat the expense of millions of Americans who would be assisted by these \nvery important pieces of legislation. Republican Senators have acted \nwithin their rights to block and delay action, but simply being within \ntheir rights does not make it right.\n  Some Republicans make one final spurious argument for opposing this \nlegislation: that it takes us off the energy legislation.\n  As we learned a few minutes ago, I offered unanimous consent that we \nwould stay on the Energy bill and that this would not set it aside. If \nwe worked on this, we would be right back on Energy. Democrats have \ntried again and again to legislate on energy prices. We have introduced \nproposals that would lower gas prices in the short term while \naddressing the root cause of the problem in the long term. We have even \noffered Republicans exactly what they claim to want: votes on drilling, \noil shale, nuclear energy, and their entire package.\n  In Congressional Daily today, this appeared on the back page. It \nsays:\n\n       Cheaper, faster, safer options exist to solve the oil \n     crisis. Don't buy Big Oil's lie.\n\n  Then it has a picture of a big oil rig out in the middle of the \nocean. It says:\n\n       Drilling for oil in America's precious natural areas will \n     NOT lower gas prices. But Big Oil's profits will skyrocket \n     even higher.\n       The U.S. Department of Energy's truth: The Energy \n     Information Administration says offshore or Arctic Refuge oil \n     won't flow for ten years and prices won't be affected until \n     at least 2027.\n\n  This is from President's Bush's Department of Energy.\n\n       The impact on price? ``Insignificant.''\n       The U.S. Department of the Interior's truth: The number of \n     drilling permits on federal lands doubled in the last five \n     years while the price of gas almost tripled. More drilling \n     does not lower prices.\n       The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources's truth: Oil \n     and gas companies hold leases to millions of acres of Federal \n     land and waters. These leases are producing no oil.\n       Legendary oil man T. Boone Pickens's truth--\n\n  And this is a direct quote--\n\n       I've been an oil man all my life, but this is one emergency \n     we can't drill our way out of.\n\n  He said that about a month ago.\n\n       The plain truth: While the American public struggles to pay \n     record-breaking gas prices, big oil companies rake in record-\n     breaking profits.\n       The U.S. holds 2 percent of all the oil reserves, but \n     consumes 25 percent of the world's oil. We can't drill our \n     way to energy independence. Energy efficiency, renewables, \n     and technological advances are the cheaper, faster, safer way \n     to meet America's energy needs, while reducing the threat of \n     global warming.\n       Tell them you don't buy Big Oil's lie and they shouldn't \n     either.\n\n  This has been paid for by a number of organizations. Some are \nstrictly environmental. Some of them are concerned about other things. \nOcean Conservancy helped pay for this. League of Conservation Voters, \nFriends of the Earth, National Audubon Society, Sierra Club, Defenders \nof Wildlife, Pacific\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\nEnvironment, Waterkeeper Alliance, Gulf Coast Environmental Defense, \nOcean Protection Coalition.\n  So we have even offered the Republicans exactly what they claim to \nwant--votes on drilling, oil shale, and nuclear power--and they have \nsaid no to this point. Hopefully, they will say yes. They have said no. \nSo if the American people are wondering why Congress has not passed \nlegislation on gas prices, it is because Republicans refuse to take yes \nfor an answer.\n  Democrats will continue to propose ideas to address the energy \ncrisis. Unlike our Republican colleagues, we are offering solutions. \nDemocrats await the day that Republicans tire of endlessly talking \nabout the energy crisis and decide it is time to join us in actually \ngetting something done. Any Republican effort to confuse the debate on \nthis package of bills with the debate over energy is disingenuous.\n  So I hope we will see this unfortunate obstruction end the way the \nlands package ended in April: After a delay and Republican political \ngamesmanship and unnecessary headaches, the legislation passed 91 to 4.\n  Everyone should understand our legislative days are very limited. \nLast week, the Republicans killed for the year LIHEAP legislation. I \ndon't know what we are going to do to help those senior citizens, \ndisabled, and low-income people come these cold winter months. We also \nhave these 34 bills packaged together today that we will not be able to \npass. We will have to wait until we get a new Congress and a new \nPresident. It would be wrong and unconscionable to defer the hope of \nmany people--the hope of Kathie Barrett from Sparks, NV, and all of \nthose who suffer from Lou Gehrig's disease--any longer. For them--for \nthe victims of unresolved civil rights-era crimes, for homeless \nchildren, for victims of child pornography, and for the 30 other \nmeritorious bills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans--it is time to \nput aside the delay, put aside the politics, put aside the obstruction, \nand pass the Advancing America's Priorities Act into law.\n  I say again, those Senators who walk down here and vote no on these \nproposals, they are going to have to answer to their constituents, to \nvoters. How do you justify voting against these measures?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7544-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am heartened by the consent agreement \nthe majority leader was about to offer a while ago, and I think it \nindicates that we are finally getting serious here about doing \nsomething significant about the price of gas at the pump. I appreciate \nthe spirit in which that was offered. As I indicated, I will be getting \nback to him later this afternoon.\n  But make no mistake about what has been going on. The press has \nunderstood it. There has been a lot of bobbing and weaving, \ncancellations of Appropriations Committee meetings in order to avoid \nvotes on offshore drilling or getting rid of the oil shale moratorium \nwhich was put in place just last year by the new majority. Great \nefforts have been underway, to the point where even the Washington Post \na few days ago was calling on the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives--the Washington Post was calling on the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives--to allow votes on drilling.\n  There is no denying there has been a great effort to try to kick this \ncan down the road and not deal with it. For example, the senior Senator \nfrom New York, who is the campaign chairman, if you will, for the \nDemocratic Senate candidates, was quoted in the Post just this weekend \nas saying we should just wait until there is a new President before \ndealing with this issue; in other words, we should put it off for 6 \nmonths. In the meantime, consumers continue to pay these \nextraordinarily high prices at the pump while the chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee recommends we just wait to \ndeal with it until, he hopes, he has a better political lineup with \nwhich to deal. Look, we don't need to wait 6 months. We need to do it \nthis week--this week.\n  The New York Times--I rarely cite the New York Times--in an editorial \njust this morning indicated that even though they don't share my view \nand the view of the majority of my Members who think increased domestic \nproduction will have a positive impact on the price of gas at the \npump--while they don't share that view, this is what they had to say \nabout the speculation bill which our good friends on the other side \nwould like to pass essentially with nothing added to it--in other \nwords, a speculation-only bill. The New York Times this morning on the \nspeculation-only bill:\n\n       Democrats' misbegotten plan to curb speculation and oil \n     futures.\n\n  This is the New York Times, not the Wall Street Journal.\n  They go on:\n\n       Democrats should know that financial speculation is not \n     what's driving oil prices, and that curbing futures trading \n     could hamper the ability of companies like airlines and oil \n     refineries to manage their risks by locking in the price of \n     oil. Putting them together is compounding one bad idea with \n     another.\n\n  Again, this is the New York Times, not the Wall Street Journal.\n  The Times goes on:\n\n       A report by government agencies--including the CFTC, the \n     Federal Reserve, the Treasury and Energy Departments--found \n     that speculative trades in oil contracts had little to no \n     effect on the rise of prices over the last five years.\n\n  Again, this is not the Wall Street Journal and not Investors Business \nDaily. This is the New York Times about the underlying bill which our \ngood friends on the other side of the aisle had been hoping to pass \nwithout any additional amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 28, 2008]\n\n                           Gas Price Follies\n\n       Add high energy prices to a sagging economy in an election \n     year and politicians will inevitably come up with bad \n     policies, like converting the corn crop into ethanol or John \n     McCain's proposal to suspend the federal gas tax--neither \n     will provide real relief at the pump while both are \n     guaranteed to create other problems.\n       The good news is that Congress failed last week to cut a \n     deal on two more bad ideas: Republicans' misguided push for \n     offshore drilling and Democrats' misbegotten plan to curb \n     speculation in oil futures.\n       Republicans should know that allowing more offshore \n     drilling might marginally trim oil prices--in about a \n     decade--while sacrificing important environmental \n     protections. Democrats should know that financial speculation \n     is not what's driving oil prices, and that curbing futures \n     trading could hamper the ability of companies like airlines \n     and oil refineries to manage their risks by locking in the \n     price of oil. Putting them together is compounding one bad \n     idea with another.\n       Of course, there is plenty of evidence that markets can be \n     manipulated by fraudulent speculation--recall the Enron mess. \n     Yet all evidence suggests that speculation has little to do \n     with the rising price of crude. From rice to iron, commodity \n     prices are all rising, even without much financial \n     speculation, due to a variety of factors including a weak \n     dollar and growing demand from China and India.\n       A report by government agencies--including the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the \n     Treasury and Energy Departments--found that speculative \n     trades in oil contracts had little to no effect on the rise \n     in prices over the last five years.\n       Oil futures are financial contracts for future delivery of \n     oil. Their price has been responding to the same factors: \n     growing world demand in the face of stagnant supply and the \n     expectation that this dynamic will continue.\n       Like some of the other ``cures,'' offering to solve \n     Americans' energy woes by drilling or slapping Wall Street \n     around merely feeds the myth that there is a quick and easy \n     solution out there. There isn't. Expensive oil is likely here \n     to stay. Americans must burn less oil and find alternative \n     sources of energy that do far less damage to the environment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Hopefully, Mr. President, we will be able to construct \nlater this afternoon a process by which we can go forward and consider \namendments that would really have an impact on the problem. I look \nforward to getting back to the majority leader later in the afternoon \non the prospects of entering into a consent agreement that will allow \nus to consider all of these important items--not 6 months from now but \nthis week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I wish to just ask a question.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. While my leader, the Republican leader, is here on the \nfloor, I had thought that I was going to speak for 5 minutes following \nyou, but I understand that our side will only have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from New Mexico, I have \nspoken, so whatever time remains on this side----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You want him to have? That is fine with me. I will \nspeak afterward.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the time on our side will be used by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand the time is divided between \nmyself and Senator Durbin. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Boxer, we go to Senator Coburn and then to Senator Durbin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, if the majority leader \nwould agree, I wish us to have a back and forth debate. I would let \nSenator Durbin have the last word, if that is OK with the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. I don't understand that. We don't have that much time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest that the last 2 minutes of debate be controlled \nby Senator Durbin, and the rest be divided equally among us, as we have \nit divided now.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine with me, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to spend the 7 minutes talking \nabout four bills that are in this package from the Environment and \nPublic Words Committee, all of which have broad bipartisan support, and \nI want to correct the Record on some of the things Senator Coburn \nstated about one of the bills.\n  The bills are the Captive Primate Safety Act, the Beach Protection \nAct, the Chesapeake Bay Gateway Act continuing authorization, and the \nAppalachian Regional Development Act amendment. These bills are all \nbipartisan and they represent a diverse background of support in the \ncountry and in the Senate.\n  The Appalachian Regional Development Act amendment reauthorizes and \nimproves the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965. The ARDA is \na Federal-State partnership that works with the people of Appalachia \ntoward self-sustaining economic development and to improve the quality \nof life in all, or portions, of 13 States--Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, \nMaryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The \ncommission's primary function is to support economic development in the \nAppalachian area, critical infrastructure to provide a climate for \nbusiness, growth, and industry that will create jobs in the regions \nthat need that help. The bill strengthens existing law and provides \nbetter assistance to counties in the region that are most at risk of \nbecoming economically distressed. The bipartisan support for this bill \nis very strong. It includes Senators Voinovich, Alexander, Brown, Burr, \nByrd, Cardin, Clinton, Cochran, Dole, Graham, McConnell, Mikulski, \nRockefeller, Schumer, Sessions, Shelby, Specter, and Warner. We \ncertainly hope this package passes because this area of the Nation \nrequires this commission to continue its work.\n  Next, the Beach Protection Act. We spent a lot of time talking about \noffshore oil drilling. Let the Record show that everyone in the Senate \nsupports offshore oil drilling. The difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans is that they want to open pristine areas off the coast, \nwhere we protect a $70 billion coastal economy, while the oil companies \nhold leases to 68 million acres and they are not drilling. So we all \nsay drill now to these oil companies. But as far as opening our \npristine coast and jeopardizing the coastal economy, that doesn't make \nmuch sense. What will happen is you will give the oil companies more \nassets on their balance sheet, and they are still not drilling the \nacres they have, the 68 million acres, plus they have access to another \n28 million acres in the Alaska Naval Reserve. I believe they have \ndeveloped 3 million of those acres. It has about three times as much \noil as ANWR. This is so much bluster and there is nothing to it--except \nthe oil companies' power to be shown on the floor of the Senate by my \nfriends, the Republicans.\n  Regardless of those differences, we want to protect our beaches. We \ndon't want to have our kids swimming in polluted water. They want to \nenjoy the clean, safe, healthy, pristine beaches. The Beach Act will do \nthat. Essentially, there are improvements that are greatly needed so \nthat the waters are tested and people know it is safe to swim. The \nbipartisan support for this bill includes Senators Lautenberg, \nVoinovich, Warner, Brown, Cardin, Clinton, Durbin, Kerry, Klobuchar, \nMenendez, Schumer, and Stabenow.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Gateway Act will help to connect the public with \nthe Chesapeake Bay and its rivers to 150 exceptional parks, wildlife \nrefuges, and historic trails. It is one of America's and the world's \nmost important estuaries. The American people put a great amount of \nresources into protecting and restoring this great water body, and now \nthis bill will help the public understand, visit, and enjoy this \nspectacular bay. I applaud the bipartisan work that went into this \nbill. The work was done by Senators Specter, Biden, Carper, and Casey, \nand the lead on this was taken by the Senators from Maryland and the \nSenators from Virginia.\n  The last one I will talk about is Captive Primate Safety Act, and why \nthis bill will help address a serious issue. More than 132 people, \nincluding 29 children, have been injured by nonhuman primates, and the \nfact is they should not be pets. One of the statements I read that \nSenator Coburn made is that this is going to stop the ability of \nscientists to use these nonhuman primates in science. That is false. \nThat is exempted from this. He also made reference to the fact that we \nought to ban them from coming into the country. The fact is that, since \n1975, they have been banned from coming into the country. But they are \nin the country and the fact is there is interstate trade here. It is a \nreal problem.\n\n  The CDC has said they have serious concerns about the transmission of \ncommunicable diseases here, and they stated:\n\n       These animal species have been linked to transmission of \n     certain diseases to humans, and individuals involved in \n     transporting animals are especially at risk for infection.\n\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n\n  So even though we have had these concerns and we passed legislation \nbanning their importation, the CDC is still greatly concerned that \nthere is a nonhuman primate pet trade in this country. So, clearly, the \nstatements that have been made on this have been incorrect. Trade or \ntransportation of these animals for zoos is exempt. Scientific research \nfacilities are exempt and certain other regulated entities. Groups like \nHelping Hands, which provides highly trained and carefully controlled \nnonhuman primates as helping animals to severely disabled people\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 30 more seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Last week, I received a letter from the Humane Society \nhighlighting the need for this legislation, and another letter of \nsupport from over 25 groups, including Defenders of Wildlife.\n  I will close with this. When Senator Vitter comes together with me, \nthat is unusual. But we came together on this bill. Senator Lieberman \nis on board, as are Senators Lautenberg, Menendez, and Ensign. So you \nare looking at a bill that has been carefully thought out. I urge \nstrong support for this package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Chair advise me when I have used 7 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, the Chair will do so.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened to the majority leader and the \ndistinguished colleague from California. I anticipate what I will hear \nfrom the Senator from Illinois.\n  One of the first observations I had is that we have shut down debate \non the Senate today because we came in at 3 o'clock. We have 30 minutes \nto debate whether on a motion to proceed, we will proceed to spend $11 \nbillion. We can dispute, if we are going to authorize it, whether we \nintend to spend it. That is what your press release says, Senator \nDurbin; that is what Senator Boxer's says. You intend to spend it. If \nyou don't intend to spend it, then offset it and the authorizations \nwon't make any difference. It is $10 billion-plus in new spending. It \ncreates 36 new Federal programs, some of which I am for. It puts a ban \non the sale of nonhuman primates across State lines. That is probably \nnot a big deal.\n  We could be spending time on true American energy independence, which \nhas to do with national security. We could spend time on lowering gas \nprices. We could spend time on eliminating wasteful Washington \nspending. The statement by the minority leader was that he will offer \nus a chance to come back to this, but we are going to spend 60 hours on \nthis, 30 hours postcloture and 30 hours on the other, so we won't ever \nget back to energy, and he knows that. We will not get back to energy \nif we take up this bill.\n  So the question that is before us is--today, the President announced, \nwith our help--and the President cannot spend any money without \nCongress's help--we will have the highest budget deficit on record in \nthis country--highest ever. It is $2,900 per man, woman, and child in \nthis country--money we are going to spend that we don't have and that \nwe are charging to your children and grandchildren.\n  This is a debate about priorities. Nine of the bills in this package \nI have no objection to. They could have gone through. The majority \nleader knows that. There are about five of the bills I adamantly \noppose. We have 46,800 dog bites a year. That is not business we should \nbe working on now. That is local. So is subhuman primates. If you count \nthe money we are going to steal from Social Security, that is another \n$100 billion. We are going to take it and put an IOU in for Social \nSecurity.\n  What is this bill about? This bill is about trying to bust the \nprocess here, where we start thinking about the future. We are going to \nsay it doesn't spend any money, that it doesn't have any effect on the \nbudget. We are going to say there is no real cost until it gets \nappropriated. But the fact is if we authorize another $10 billion in \nspending--and I note also in the letter that the majority leader asked \nto be submitted into the Record, if authorized and appropriated, it \nwould spend $11 billion.\n  Well, it is unconscionable to me that someone would support a bill \nthat did not work hard to make sure it is appropriated. If you are not \ngoing to do that, then you are not true to the very people you are \nsaying you want this bill to take action for. The people supporting \nthis bill have every intention of having the money spent. Let's not kid \nourselves. So if the intention is to spend the money, the money is \ngoing to get spent. That is how we got to a national debt--that is how \nwe have an $85 trillion unfunded liability in front of us. It is not \nwrong to want to try to fix that. It is not wrong to try to address \nissues. The ALS Registry is something the CDC can already do. As a \nmatter of fact, their own quote on it was that they spend only $29 \nmillion a year on ALS. We are going to spend $75 million on a registry \nthat doesn't cure anybody. Why don't we spend $75 million additional on \nresearch for ALS? Why don't we spend this $10 billion at NIH so we \ncover all of the diseases, where we can make a major impact? No, we \nwant to respond to interest groups and lobbyists, and we want to go \nhome and say we have done something, when we have not done anything \nexcept raise costs.\n  There is $300 billion worth of waste, without a doubt, every year \nthat occurs--waste, fraud, or duplication in this country. This body \ndoesn't want to offset it.\n  The majority leader, as well as many of the Members and authors of \nthese other bills, have been offered commonsense offsets to pay for \ntheir bills. Just like every family does, when you have something new \nyou want to do and you have a limited budget, what do you do? You make \na choice, you decide a priority, and then you decide what you would not \ndo so you can do what you want to do. We don't do that in the Senate. \nWe conveniently charge it to our grandkids. What nobody realizes is \nthis past Saturday, the Senate and the House increased the debt limit \nby $800 billion. Most Americans didn't even know that. It was tucked \nvery neatly into the housing bill. We increased the debt limit $800 \nbillion--$800 billion more we are going to borrow.\n  People will say: Senator Coburn, you are for the war, you supported \nthe war. But I did not vote for the appropriations bills for the war, \nand there is a reason for it. Because we should be paying for it. We \nshould be making the hard choices instead of charging the war to our \nkids.\n  This is a debate I am glad we are finally having. Part of me says I \nwould love to get on it, but the most important thing we need to do and \nthe most important thing the Senate needs to be doing is working on \nenergy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Advancing \nAmerica's Priorities Act, S. 3297, which contains a provision that \nwould provide much needed funding for the Washington Metropolitan \nTransit Authority, WMATA.\n  This provision mirrors the National Capital Transportation Amendments \nAct of 2007, S. 1446, which I proudly cosponsored with Senators Cardin, \nMikulski, and Warner.\n  In short, the Metro funding provision would authorize $1.5 billion \nover 10 years for Metro to finance capital and preventive maintenance \nprojects for the Metrorail system. The Federal funding would share the \nfunding burden with the States because the money would be contingent on \nthe District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia jointly matching the \nFederal contribution towards Washington Metro's capital projects.\n  Appropriate funding for the Metro system is critically important to \nour federal workforce, millions of tourists who visit our Nation's \nCapital area, as well as the millions of people who live around \nWashington, DC. I have worked diligently with my Senate and House \ncolleagues for the past 2 years to pass this legislation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to help secure passage of this provision this week.\n  Metrorail and Metrobus ridership continue to grow as more than 1 \nmillion riders on average per weekday choose Metro as their preferred \nmode of transit for traveling around the National Capital Region. As \nthe price of gasoline has soared, more people are turning to Metro as \ntheir primary\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nmode of transportation. I would note that in fiscal year 2008, 215 \nmillion customers rode Metrorail. That is 7 million more customers than \nin 2007. In fact, 22 out of 25 of Metrorail top ridership days have \noccurred since April of this year. And 133 million customers rode \nMetrobus in fiscal year 08, which is the highest yearly total ever, an \nincrease of 1.4 million relative to 2007. New funding authorized in \nthis legislation would provide the necessary resources to increase bus \nand rail capacity and meet forecasted ridership demands, before the \nsystem and region become totally mired in congestion.\n  The federal role in supporting Metro is clear, with a long track \nrecord to draw upon. Washington Metro began building the rail system in \n1969 with Federal funding authorized under the National Capital \nTransportation Act of 1969. On two separate occasions, Congress has \nauthorized additional funding for Metro construction and capital \nimprovements. According to a 2006 Government Accountability Office \nreport:\n\n       WMATA provides transportation to and from work for a \n     substantial portion of the federal workforce, and federal \n     employees' use of WMATA's services is encouraged by General \n     Services Administration guidelines that instruct federal \n     agencies to locate their facilities near mass transit stops \n     whenever possible. WMATA also accommodated increased \n     passenger loads and extends its operating hours during events \n     related to the federal government's presence in Washington, \n     DC, such as presidential inaugurations and funerals, and \n     celebrations and demonstrations on the National Mall.\n\n  In fact, during rush hour, Federal employees account for over 40 \npercent of Metro ridership. The Metro system was also critical to the \nevacuation of Washington, DC, following the 2001 terrorist attacks. \nMetro was deemed a ``national security asset'' in a Federal security \nassessment conducted after 9/11. In short, the operation of the Federal \nGovernment would be nearly impossible without the Metro system and the \nFederal Government's emergency evacuation and recovery plans rely \nheavily on Metro.\n  The future of Metro and its continued success relies upon consistent \nsupport from the Federal Government and the regional localities it \nserves. Now is the time for the Federal Government to commit itself to \nproviding more long-term Federal funding for the Washington Metro \nsystem. Together, along with our jurisdictional partners, we must \ncontinue to invest in the transit system that has brought so many \nbenefits not only to the region, but also to the Federal Government and \nthe entire nation. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nbill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletters be printed in the Record relating to S. 3297, the Advancing \nAmerica's Priorities Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The undersigned members of the ocean and coastal research, \n     education, and conservation community would like to thank you \n     for your strong support of ocean and coastal science and \n     conservation in the U.S. Senate. We strongly support S. 3297 \n     because it includes a number of important ocean and coastal \n     related bills--Hydrographic Services, Ocean Exploration and \n     Mapping, Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System, \n     Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act, and the Sea \n     Grant Reauthorization. Because of the inclusion of these \n     bills, we collectively urge the Senate to pass this important \n     legislation at the earliest available opportunity.\n       These bills will increase our understanding of coastal, \n     ocean and Great Lake ecosystems and promote both conservation \n     and sustainable use. All of the bills have passed the House \n     of Representatives and have been reported out of the Senate \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee with \n     bipartisan support.\n       With more than 50 percent of the U.S. population living in \n     coastal counties, these regions are vital contributors to our \n     economy, quality of life and national security. With an ever-\n     changing climate, increasing natural hazards, and declining \n     fisheries, we need the tools to protect and manage our ocean \n     assets and better understand how ocean and coastal ecosystems \n     respond to natural and human-related hazards.\n       We hope you will demonstrate your continued commitment to \n     strengthening our Nation's understanding and conservation of \n     the oceans through Senate consideration of these measures.\n       Sincerely,\n         National Association of Marine Laboratories, Sea Grant \n           Association, National Federation of Regional \n           Associations for Coastal and Ocean Observing, \n           Reinsurance Association of America, Campaign for \n           Environmental Literacy, League of Conservation Voters, \n           Association of Zoos and Aquariums, University \n           Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Woods Hole \n           Oceanographic Institution, Coastal States Organization, \n           National Association of State Universities and Land \n           Grant Colleges, Maryland Sea Grant.\n         University of Southern Mississippi, MK & CO, University \n           of Washington, Ocean Initiative, Natural Resources \n           Defense Council, Oceana, Marine Conservation Biology \n           Institute, School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, \n           Stony Brook University, North Carolina Sea Grant \n           Program, Florida Sea Grant College Program, USC Sea \n           Grant, New York Sea Grant.\n         Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, Georgia, Savannah \n           State University, Delaware Sea Grant, Baruch Institute, \n           University of South Carolina, Chesapeake Biological \n           Laboratory, University of Maryland Center for \n           Environmental Science, New Hampshire Sea Grant, \n           University of New Hampshire Marine Program, Annis Water \n           Resources Institute, Grand Valley State University, \n           Michigan, Alaska SeaLife Center, Center for Coastal \n           Studies, Texas A University-Corpus Christi, Harte \n           Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies, Texas, Maine Sea \n           Grant.\n         Pennsylvania Sea Grant, National Institute for Undersea \n           Science and Technology, University of Mississippi, \n           Hawaii Sea Grant, Romberg Tiburon Center, San Francisco \n           State University, Michigan Sea Grant, Louisiana Sea \n           Grant, Rhode Island Sea Grant, Woods Hole Sea Grant, \n           Center for Marine and Coastal Sciences, California \n           Polytechnic State University, University of Wisconsin \n           Sea Grant Institute and Water Resources Institute, \n           South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Federation of Regional Associations for Coastal \n           and Ocean Observing,\n                                                    July 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chair, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell and Inouye: We write to \n     express our strong support for S. 3297, ``Advancing America's \n     Priorities Act'' and urge its quick adoption. The bill \n     contains several ocean and coastal provisions that are needed \n     to provide the nation with the understanding and tools \n     necessary to address issues now facing our oceans and Great \n     Lakes. These include:\n       Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of \n     2008, Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 2008, NOAA \n     Undersea Research Program Act of 2008, Ocean and Coastal \n     Mapping Integration Act, National Sea Grant College Program \n     Amendments of 2008, and Federal Ocean Acidification Research \n     and Monitoring Act of 2008.\n       Together, these legislative acts create a foundation for \n     improving our understanding of our nation's oceans and coasts \n     and how they will respond to changing conditions and for \n     providing information to the variety of citizens who depend \n     on them. As evidenced by the impacts of El Nino events, our \n     oceans affect all citizens. The oceans are inextricably \n     linked to weather and climate and in order to respond to \n     current and future climate change impacts, we must increase \n     our knowledge in this realm.\n       The National Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is a \n     vital tool for tracking, predicting, managing, and adapting \n     to changes in our nation's waters. The Senate has passed IOOS \n     legislation twice since 2002 in recognition of the nation's \n     need to provide predictions and forecasts necessary for safe \n     maritime operations, minimize losses from extreme storms, \n     optimize ocean resources and sustain healthy ecosystems.\n       We thank you for your continued support of ocean and Great \n     Lakes issues and for passage of this important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Molly McCammon,\n       Chair, National Federation of Regional Associations for \n     Coastal and Ocean Observing, Alaska Ocean Observing System.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     July 28, 2008\n      Hon. Harry Reid,\n      Senate Majority Leader\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     On behalf of the 95\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n     members of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, the Joint \n     Ocean Commission Initiative, the 125 members of the National \n     Association of Marine Laboratories and the 31 states that \n     make up the Sea Grant Association, we would like to thank you \n     for your strong support of ocean science and conservation in \n     the U.S. Senate and urge prompt passage of S 3297--Advancing \n     America's Priorities Act. Title V, Subpart B--Oceans of S \n     3297 contains six vital ocean research, conservation, and \n     education bills:\n        Part I--Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments \n     of 2008.\n        Part II--Ocean Exploration.\n        Part III--Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act.\n        Part IV--National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act \n     of 2008.\n        Part V--Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System \n     Act of 2008.\n        Part VI--Federal Ocean Acidification Research and \n     Monitoring Act of 2008.\n       These bills are consistent with the extensive analyses and \n     recommendations of the Pew Oceans Commission, the U.S. \n     Commission on Ocean Policy, the President's Ocean Action \n     Plan, and the Administration's Ocean Research Priorities \n     Plan. Collectively these bills will significantly advance our \n     understanding of coastal, ocean and Great Lake ecosystems, \n     climate change, and promote both conservation and sustainable \n     use of our ocean resources. All of the bills have passed the \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House \n     of Representatives with bipartisan support.\n       With more than 50 percent of the U.S. population living in \n     coastal counties, these regions are essential contributors to \n     our economy, quality of life, maritime safety, national \n     competitiveness, and national security. With an ever-changing \n     climate, increasing natural hazards, and declining fisheries \n     and reduced water quality, we need the tools to conserve and \n     manage our ocean assets and better understand how ocean and \n     coastal ecosystems respond to natural and human-related \n     hazards.\n       These provisions would: (1) fuel exploration and inspire \n     future generations of ocean explorers, scientists, marine, \n     and industry leaders; (2) foster the development and \n     integration of ocean observational systems to protect public \n     health through the identification of marine toxins and \n     pollutants in coastal areas; (3) improve prediction of and \n     warnings of tsunamis, hurricanes, El Nino events and other \n     natural hazards; (4) enhance homeland security, support \n     maritime operations and collect important information needed \n     to address global warming, improve ocean health and provide \n     for the protection, sustainable use and enjoyment of ocean \n     resources.\n       We hope you will demonstrate your continued commitment to \n     strengthening our Nation's understanding and conservation of \n     the oceans through quick passage of S 3297.\n       Sincerely,\n     Robert B. Gagosian,\n       President, Consortium for Ocean Leadership.\n     James D. Watkins,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy (Retired), Chairman, U.S. Commission on \n     Ocean Policy, Co-Chair, Joint Ocean Commission Initiative.\n     James Sanders,\n       President, National Association of Marine Laboratories.\n     Leon E. Panetta,\n       Chair, Pew Oceans Commission, Co-Chair, Joint Ocean \n     Commission Initiative.\n     Paul Anderson,\n       President, Sea Grant Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Nature Conservancy,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 28, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: I \n     write to thank you for including the Oceans subtitle in S. \n     3297, the Advancing America's Priorities Act. The Nature \n     Conservancy supports the six pieces of oceans legislation \n     included in the Oceans subtitle--Hydrographic Services \n     Improvement Act Amendments of 2008, Ocean Exploration, Ocean \n     and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, Integrated Coastal and \n     Ocean Observation System Act of 2008, National Sea Grant \n     College Program Amendments Act of 2008, and Federal Ocean \n     Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2008.\n       These bills will increase our understanding of and ability \n     to effectively conserve and manage ocean and coastal \n     ecosystems. All have passed the House of Representatives and \n     have been reported out of the Senate Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation Committee with bipartisan support.\n       Covering more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface, \n     oceans are some of the most productive yet threatened natural \n     systems in the world. Once considered a limitless and \n     inexhaustible resource, the demands of a growing population \n     are damaging marine ecosystems and depleting ocean and \n     coastal resources. New and innovative approaches are needed \n     to maintain and restore these systems in order to sustain the \n     communities that depend upon them. The bills in the Oceans \n     subtitle of S. 3297 would provide valuable science and \n     information to enable these efforts.\n       I commend the work of the Senate and the Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation Committee to pass legislation to improve \n     ocean and coastal science and data. The Nature Conservancy \n     looks forward to continuing to work with the Senate to pass \n     three additional pieces of important ocean and coastal \n     conservation legislation before the end of this session--the \n     Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2007, the Coastal \n     and Estuarine Land Protection Act, and the Ballast Water \n     Treatment Act of 2007.\n       I urge you to continue to support ocean and coastal science \n     and conservation and thank you for your consideration of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lynne Zeitlin Hale,\n                                     Director, Global Marine Team.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presient, last week, I joined the majority leader in \nintroducing S. 3297, the Advancing America's Priorities Act. The \nmajority leader selected three dozen legislative items from the \njurisdiction of seven Senate committees, including eight Judiciary \nCommittee bills, for this effort. These are all measures with \nbipartisan support and, we believe, the support of a strong bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate. I have moved several such bills through the \nJudiciary Committee only to be stymied by objection once on the Senate \ncalendar. All of the Judiciary bills have already passed the House with \noverwhelming support. Each of these bills has the support of all \nDemocratic Senators. Each has been stalled on the Senate floor by \nRepublican objection. I hope that all Senators will now join us to \nsupport this important effort and finally pass legislation helpful to \nthe American people that should have passed long ago by unanimous \nconsent.\n  After more than 7 years of failed policies from the Bush \nadministration, the American people are suffering. Americans are \nfeeling the effects of a very real recession which has left them with \nfewer jobs and record high prices. People are rightly worried about \nkeeping their communities and their children safe from crime as well as \nterrorism.\n  Americans are looking to us in Congress to work to solve these vexing \nproblems. We had an opportunity in this Congress to come together \nacross party lines to do the work of the American people. Instead, \nregrettably some have chosen to obstruct our progress and stand in the \nway of legislation designed to help hard working Americans.\n  The Judiciary Committee has worked throughout this Congress to \nadvance the priorities of Americans. We have reported legislation to \nsupport local law enforcement to make our cities and towns safe from \ncrime that has now gone back up after consistent declines, to protect \nour children from exploitation and poverty, to ensure the civil rights \nand voting rights of Americans, to combat fraud and corruption, and to \nkeep us secure without sacrificing our values.\n  Many pieces of legislation with broad bipartisan support that we have \nmanaged to move through the Judiciary Committee have then stalled on \nthe Senate floor due to obstruction. The majority leader has been \nforced to resort to extraordinary measures to try to pass these bills, \nwhich should have sailed through without opposition. Some of these \nbills, including several important pieces of legislation that have been \nreported from the Judiciary Committee this Congress, have been \nincorporated by the majority leader into the Advancing America's \nPriorities Act. Congress should promptly pass this important \nlegislation, which will help the American people.\n  One key bill in this package is the reauthorization of the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth Act. It is astonishing that in the richest country \nin the world, millions of our young people face homelessness and the \nmany dangers of life on the streets.\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue in \nApril, we heard from Mark Redmond and Michael Hutchins of Spectrum \nYouth and Family Services in Burlington, VT. They told us how much the \nact is needed to help young people in Vermont and around the country. \nMr. Hutchins had been homeless himself as a young person and saw first \nhand how the programs this act funds\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\ncan help children turn their lives around and give back to their \ncommunities.\n  I also held a hearing in Rutland, VT, this winter on crime in small \ncities and towns, which emphasized the need for programs to help young \npeople in difficult circumstances. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act \nreauthorization will double the funding states like Vermont are \nguaranteed to receive for programs to benefit runaway and homeless \nyoung people. This bill will help our young people, and we should pass \nit right away.\n  Another important piece of legislation included in this package is \nthe Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, which I have been \nworking with Senator Dodd, Congressman Lewis, and others to pass for \nyears. In 1955, the brutal murder of a 14-year-old African-American \nteenager named Emmett Till stirred the conscience of our country. \nUnfortunately, no one has ever been punished for this tragic and brutal \nmurder. Last week, I met Simeon Wright, Emmett Till's cousin, who was \nwith Mr. Till on the horrible night he was kidnapped. We must share Mr. \nWright's commitment to fighting for justice after so many years.\n  The Till bill would help law enforcement to finally track down those \nwhose violent acts during a period of national turmoil remain \nunpunished. Fifty-three years after Emmett Till's murder, his family \nand the families of hundreds of other Americans who lost their lives in \nthe fight for equal rights still await justice.\n  This legislation provides necessary tools for our Federal Government, \nin cooperation with state and local officials, to vigorously \ninvestigate and prosecute these cases. By passing this legislation, we \nhonor Emmett Till and all those who sacrificed their lives advancing \ncivil rights. It is disgraceful that it has taken us so long to take \nthis basic step to honor their memories and pursue justice too long \ndelayed. It is incredible that some continue to obstruct these efforts.\n  The Advancing America's Priorities Act also includes legislation to \nhelp law enforcement cope with mentally ill offenders, and to protect \nour children from the scourges of drugs, child pornography, and child \nexploitation.\n  It seems particularly perverse that legislation meant to protect our \nchildren and grandchildren from the dangers of the modern world has \nbecome the subject of partisan obstructionism. This legislative package \nincludes the PROTECT Our Children Act, which Senator Biden has \nchampioned and which would streamline the government's efforts to \ninvestigate and prevent the exploitation of children. It also includes \ntwo separate measures that strengthen the laws against the despicable \npractice of child pornography. I have worked hard with many of my \ncolleagues to pass these and other child protection bills, and we \nshould delay no longer passing them into law. The Effective Child \nPornography Prosecution Act passed the House 409-0 last November. The \nEnhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child Pornography provision \npassed the House 416-0 last November. The PROTECT Our Children Act \npassed the House 415-2 last November. The Drug Endangered Children Act \npassed the House last September 389-4. All of these bills have been \ncleared by all Democratic Senators, and all are included in the bill \nbeing brought before the Senate by the majority leader.\n\n  Senator Coburn has now introduced a new bill, S. 3344, which combines \nseveral of the pieces of child protection legislation contained in the \nAdvancing America's Priorities Act package and other preexisting \nlegislation. Senator Coburn has prevented many of these same bills from \npassing for many months. He has chosen not to work with the majority \nleader on the Advancing America's Priorities Act to secure passage of \nthe many important bills contained within it. He has also chosen not to \nwork with the sponsors, Democratic and Republican, House and Senate, of \nthe child protection bills he has co-opted, and he did not bother to \nattend a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing which squarely addressed \none of those bills.\n  Instead, he has taken these bills, drafted and introduced by other \nSenators and House members, and without their input or permission, \ncombined them and introduced them as his own legislation. Moreover, he \nhas combined them in a way that appears calculated to attract \nopposition, and he has included provisions that have not been carefully \nvetted or considered. Where the majority leader has worked with many \nothers in the Senate and House to collect important bills with \nbipartisan, bicameral support that can pass into law and increase \nprotection for our children, Senator Coburn instead has appropriated \nthe work of others in Congress in a way that is unfair and bound to \nfail. That is not legislating. It is more showboating and obstruction. \nWe have had too much of those tactics already.\n  Sadly, obstruction through Republican holds is just one example of \nthe ways some have chosen to hamper progress on so many issues in this \nCongress. They have also boycotted meetings to consider legislation, \nused Senate rules to prevent hearings or cut them short, and \nfilibustered more than 80 times.\n  Republicans boycotted the most recent business meeting of the \nJudiciary Committee thereby blocking the committee from obtaining a \nquorum and considering important legislation. At that meeting, the \ncommittee was to consider a bipartisan juvenile justice bill, which \nreauthorized key programs aimed at making our communities safer and \nkeeping our children out of the criminal justice system; bipartisan \nlegislation to reauthorize the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act, which would strengthen our efforts to stop the \nabhorrent practice of human trafficking around the world; and other \nmatters.\n  They have threatened to boycott again this week. That would prevent \naction on the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission, a resolution to \nhonor national historically Black colleges and universities, and other \nimportant bipartisan measures.\n  We have seen all manners of obstructionism since the beginning of \nthis Congress, with a minority of Republican members using filibuster \nafter filibuster to thwart the will of the majority of the Senate from \ndoing the business of the American people. Republican filibusters \nprevented Senate majorities from passing the climate change bill; the \nEmployee Free Choice Act; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; the DC \nVoting Rights Act; the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy \nEfficiency Act of 2007; the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of \n2008; the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008; \nthe Consumer-First Energy Act; and the Warm in Winter and Cool in \nSummer Act, to bring much needed relief to poor families who struggle \nto heat and cool their homes in a time of soaring gas prices.\n  These are critical pieces of legislation to address urgent priorities \nlike the energy crisis, the environment, voting rights, health care, \nand fair wages for working men and women. All of them had a support of \nthe majority of the Senate. And all were blocked by a minority of \nRepublican Senators bent on preventing us from making progress. \nRepublicans have now filibustered more than 80 pieces of legislation in \nthis Congress. More than 80. We can only imagine what we could have \naccomplished in this Congress with cooperation rather than obstruction.\n  The list goes on. Republican objection has blocked legislation to \nensure that law enforcement officers can obtain bulletproof vests, to \nstrengthen efforts to investigate and prosecute public corruption, to \ngive much needed resources to state and local law enforcement, to break \nthe grip of a cartel on oil prices, to prohibit war profiteering, to \ntrain prosecutors, and to teach children to use the internet safely, \njust to name some of the examples. And those are just examples of \nlegislation reported by the Judiciary Committee that has been \nobstructed. Last week I made statements delineating a dozen and a half \nbills in addition to those included by the majority leader in S.3297, \nthe Advancing America's Priorities Act. Other committees have similar \nlists.\n  This long list of priorities unaddressed is even longer if we include \nthe many important bills President Bush has vetoed since the beginning \nof this Congress. This list includes legislation to fund stem cell \nresearch\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\nto fight debilitating and deadly diseases, to extend and expand the \nsuccessful State Children's Health Insurance Program that would have \nprovided health insurance to more of the millions of American children \nwithout it, to set a timetable for bringing American troops home from \nthe disastrous war in Iraq, and to ban waterboarding and help restore \nAmerica as a beacon for the rule of law.\n  This is not about partisan posturing. The American people are \nsuffering, and it is time for Congress to start working to make their \nlives better. Time is running short in this Congress. It is past time \nto end the partisan gamesmanship and idiosyncratic objections and make \nprogress on behalf of the American people. It is time for us to get to \nwork and do what we can to improve the lives of Americans. That is what \nI have been trying to do throughout this Congress. The majority leader, \nwith the Advancing America's Priorities Act, has given us a chance to \ntake a small but significant step in the right direction. I hope, after \n18 months of unnecessary obstruction, all Senators are finally ready to \njoin us in doing the work of the American people.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while I do not believe that the provisions \nof title VI, subtitle A of S. 3297, corresponding to the National \nCapital Transportation Amendments Act, constitute a congressionally \ndirected spending item, I certify, out of caution, that neither I nor \nmy immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the aforementioned \nprovisions, consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of rule \nXLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much remains on the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 54 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is time for this debate. No, this \ndebate is overdue. It is about time the American people understand the \nchoices we are making on the floor of the Senate. Every month this \nPresident asks us for $12 billion to $15 billion to wage the war. Is it \npaid for? No. It is added to the deficit. We are told we have to do it; \nwe have to do it, not just for the troops--no one wants to see the \ntroops go without--but because it is our moral responsibility, \naccording to the Bush administration, to rebuild Iraq. We liberated \nthem. We removed their dictator. We have lost over 4,000 of our best \nand bravest lives and thousands injured. But month after month, the \nadministration tells us we need to spend $10 billion to $15 billion on \nthe war in Iraq. The protests from the other side of the aisle are few, \nif any, to this President's plan to spend $12 billion to $15 billion a \nmonth in Iraq.\n  Now comes this bill. This bill suggests spending money in America. \nWhat do we hear? A chorus of complaints from the other side of the \naisle that it is wasteful--wasteful--to be spending money in America, \nprojects that are new Federal programs, questioning whether there is \nwisdom behind them, whether taxpayers' dollars should be spent.\n  The American people should be the judge. Should we be spending \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars to establish a national registry for those \nsuffering from Lou Gehrig's disease in the hopes we might learn \nsomething that leads to a cure? Obviously, the House of Representatives \nfelt it was. That rollcall was 411 to 3. But there is objection on the \nRepublican side of the aisle: a new program.\n  Then there is the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, calling \non the National Institutes of Health for paralysis research and rehab \nactivities, a new program, I will admit it. But if it was a member of \nmy family stuck in a wheelchair, quadriplegic, you can bet I would be \nbegging for this bill. How did it do in the House of Representatives? \nIt passed unanimously, but it is held up on the Republican side of the \naisle because it is money spent in America for a new program.\n  Here is another. Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, a \nbipartisan bill. Senator Kennedy, fighting brain cancer in \nMassachusetts, cannot be here to stand and speak for it. I will speak \nfor it. He and Senator Cochran, a Republican from Mississippi, believe \nthis is money well spent on stroke treatment in America. It is another \nnew program, and it is here for America. It is opposed by the \nRepublican side of the aisle.\n  Why? Why do they want to stop these programs that help us here at \nhome? The list goes on and on. Postpartum depression. I joined \nCongressman Bobby Rush in pushing this one when a lady, a few days \nafter giving birth in Chicago, dove out a hospital window, killing \nherself--suicide. We don't want that to happen. This bill tries to help \nmothers struggle through postpartum depression.\n  Vision care for kids--more money to be spent in the United States. It \nis opposed by those who are putting a hold on these bills.\n  All these bills overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives \nwithout any bipartisan rancor, until they got over here. Many of the \nsame Senators who have voted for a blank check to send money to Iraq \nmonth after month do not want to spend money in America. I think a \nstrong America begins at home. It begins with good health care. It \nbegins when we care about our own people first.\n  Then there are the Judiciary Committee bills. The Senator from \nOklahoma is a member of the Judiciary Committee. Every one of these \nbills he had a chance to amend in the committee. Every one of these \nbills came out of committee by unanimous vote, which would include his \nvote. Now he is objecting to moving forward on the floor.\n  He does not want us to pass the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act to \nauthorize an increase in authorization levels for runaway kids or the \nEmmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act to try to finally bring to \njustice those guilty of killing a lot of the great people in America \nwho have been victims of civil rights crimes.\n  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Mental \nillness is such an integral part of many criminal acts. We want to do \nsomething about it. It passed unanimously out of the committee, but it \nis money spent in America, and they object to it. They object to this \nmoney being spent. Why?\n  Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act. Who favors that? No one \nfavors that. Why won't we spend a few dollars to stop it? You know what \nis going on in the Internet. How did that bill do? It passed the House \nof Representatives 409 to 0. There were no breakdowns. Democrats and \nRepublicans all agreed we have to stop this scourge, until it came over \nhere and was stopped by the Senator from Oklahoma. I don't understand \nhis thinking on all this. Let me make one thing clear. These are \nauthorization bills. They do not spend money. They authorize us to \nspend money, but that authorization has to be followed up with actual \nspending, and we are limited in the total amount we can spend. If we \nwant to put money into these programs, it has to be taken from other \nprograms.\n  Many of the same Senators who vote month after month to send money to \nIraq, many of the same Senators who voted for tax breaks for the \nwealthiest people in America in the midst of a war, are saying we \ncannot afford this money for medical research and money to make America \nsafer. That is what this vote is all about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator DeMint, \nSenator Sessions, and Senator Burr, in that order.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I wish \nto publicly thank him for taking the time to read so many bills and to \nlook at spending and to see if we can do something to curb wasteful \nspending.\n  I am disturbed that the Senator from Illinois thinks because we have \nto spend money in the battle against terror around the world that means \nwe have to spend more at home without looking at real priorities, such \nas gas prices and dealing with those issues.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Oklahoma a question because he has \nalready mentioned it. I saw today that\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\nunder the Democratic leadership, even though in their last campaign \nthey were going to be fiscally responsible, I saw in USA Today that we \nwill have the largest deficit in our history next year, and that \ndoesn't even include the $100 billion we are borrowing from Social \nSecurity.\n  Yet in the middle of this energy debate and how to get gas prices \ndown, I was amazed we were coming back today on bills that were just \ngathered together----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for 30 more seconds to finish the \nquestion--15 more seconds.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Oklahoma, is it not true that all \nthese bills were attempted to pass without any debate and without any \nvote and that the Senator from Oklahoma was asking questions and asking \nfor some kind of openness on the floor? Instead of giving the Senator \nthat, they balled them all up together?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the answer to that question is everyone \nwho has a bill in this, outside the nine that have never been hotlined \nor approved in the past, every one has been offered amendments to \noffset spending out of the duplication of waste that is already going \non.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in Senator Coburn, we have one of the \nsmartest Members of this Senate and I believe the hardest working. \nThere is no one more principled. It is perfectly all right in this body \nto object to a bill if it has some impact on your special interest in \nyour State, but when a Senator such as Senator Coburn stands and \nobjects to a piece of legislation because it is bad policy or impacts \nour national debt, that is not considered appropriate around here.\n  He has the quaint idea that you should actually read the bill. He and \nhis staff read hundreds of bills. They let them go if they think they \nare OK. They object to the particular parts they think are bad. They \nask for amendments to improve those bills. And then when asked, if they \ndo not accept Senator Coburn's suggestion, he simply says bring up the \nbill and let me offer my amendment. That is not good enough. They want \nunanimous consent to run hundreds of bills through in the dead of \nnight, without anybody looking at them, and I am glad one person has \nthe courage and the integrity and the spine to stand and object. He is \nthe one who is for good Government, in my view, and not the crowd who \nwants to run things through without full debate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me, in full disclosure, say I am \nsupportive of some of these bills. I am actually a cosponsor of some of \nthese bills. But let me tell my colleagues what we are asked to do \ntoday.\n  A vote for this cloture motion would be a vote to stop consideration \nof energy legislation. A vote for this initiative would be a vote to \nstop considering lower gas prices. A vote for this cloture motion would \nbe a vote to muzzle--muzzle--a Member of the Senate. If that happened, \nit would also be a vote to muzzle the American people.\n  It is absolutely essential that this body get back on the debate on \nenergy, where real solutions are presented in the form of amendments \nand we can address the most important issue to the American people and \nthat is the price of gasoline and an energy policy that is desperately \nneeded in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. And for Senator Durbin?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has 31 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me ask that again. The time remaining for me is 31 \nseconds?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma now has 2 \nminutes 45 seconds. The Senator from Illinois has 31 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will finish and end. First of all, the \nactual facts are that we are spending in Iraq $8 billion a month. It is \nnot $10 billion to $15 billion; it is $8 billion.\n  No. 2, I am not holding four of the eight Judiciary bills in this \nbill. As a matter of fact, I already agreed to three of them by \nunanimous consent, and they have gone through this body already. We can \nplay with the facts all we want. The fact is, what is the priority for \nthe American people? I wish to help people who are paralyzed. I have \nbeen a supporter of the Emmett Till bill. I think we ought to pay for \nit. We spent $396 million for conferences in the Justice Department for \nthe last 5 years. Why would we not take some of that money and pay for \nit? No, that is hard work. We would not do the oversight. We would not \nget rid of the wasteful spending. What we will do is pass new spending. \nThat is what has to change.\n  What my colleagues want to do I am not necessarily objecting to. What \nI am objecting to is how they want to do it. I am objecting to doing \nsomething in the name of good today that undermines the name of good \ntomorrow, which is the future availability and potential for the \nchildren who come our way.\n  We can have disputes about the war. I have not voted to fund the war, \nnot once. What I have voted for is transparency and elimination of \nwaste, and I brought up amendments. The sponsors of this bill, every \none of them voted for the bridge to nowhere; every one of them voted \nfor the Hippy Museum in New York instead of the Child Health Program. \nEvery one of them voted to, in fact, vote for sidewalk and bike trails \ninstead of fixing the falling down bridges in this country.\n  The question is, When will we have people who will vote for the \nfuture? It is easy to spend money up here. It is very easy to do. And \nbecause we are on different sides of the debate doesn't mean those who \nwant to do this are wrong. What is wrong is, in fact, creating a \nsituation where we are going to charge it to our children.\n\n  There are options. Senator Reid was offered a list of amendments to \noffset at the Justice Department for the Emmett Till bill, and so was \nSenator Dodd. They refused to even consider offsetting any wasteful \nspending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are not leaving the Energy bill. \nSenator Reid, the Democratic leader, offered the Republicans to return \nto that bill immediately. This isn't going to take 60 hours, unless the \nRepublican side decides to drag it out forever. It doesn't have to. It \ncan take a much shorter period of time.\n  The bottom line is still this: Are we ready to spend money here in \nAmerica to solve some of our own problems or are we going to keep \nshipping this money overseas to rebuild an Iraqi economy that already \nhas more oil than most nations on Earth? Why don't we spend money here \nfor medical research, making it safer for our kids to go on the \nInternet, or trying to find runaway children?\n  I think investments in America make us stronger, and that is what \nthis vote will be all about. Those who make the argument to vote \nagainst it are voting against investment in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have offered a consent request to keep the \nEnergy bill pending regardless if the Senate adopted a motion to \nproceed to S. 3297, the so-called Coburn package. I made this request \nso the speculation bill would not be displaced by the Senate acting on \nS. 3297, the Energy bill.\n  To clarify for those listening, an objection was raised to my request \nto keep the Energy bill as the pending business. Anyone voting against \nthis because of not being able to stay on Energy is mistaken or--well, \nI won't use the word. That is good enough.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n     Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close \n     debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 894, S. 3297, \n     the Advancing America's Priorities Act.\n         Harry Reid, Jon Tester, Carl Levin, Christopher J. Dodd, \n           Maria Cantwell, Benjamin L. Cardin, Daniel K. Inouye, \n           Hillary Rodham Clinton, Kent Conrad, Bernard Sanders, \n           Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, Ron Wyden, Patrick J. \n           Leahy, Max Baucus, Dianne Feinstein, Richard Durbin, \n           Robert Menendez, Sherrod Brown.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if my friends on the \nother side would waive the live quorum so we could save the Senate 20 \nminutes of time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am told by the staff that we cannot waive that.\n  Mr. REID. You mean you don't want to. So let's go at it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll, and the following Senators \nentered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                          [Quorum No. 3 Leg.]\n\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cardin\n     Coburn\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Gregg\n     Kyl\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Webb\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move that the Sergeant at Arms be directed \nto request the attendance of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Allard), the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nDole), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Sununu), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 3, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 188 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--3\n\n     Bennett\n     Specter\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--10\n\n     Allard\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Hagel\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Sununu\n     Voinovich\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  The next matter is the Coburn package. It does not cost a penny. It \nis all authorization, dealing with some of the most sensitive issues in \nthis country; for example, the Lou Gehrig's disease. It establishes a \nregistry. Scientists say we cannot make any progress on that dread \ndisease until a registry is established so scientists can take a look \nat what is going on in Oregon, Florida, Connecticut, and have a \nregistry to go to work on this. That is only one.\n  It deals with child pornography. It deals with paralysis. It deals \nwith strokes. This is an important piece of legislation. I say to all \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle, I have offered a consent \nagreement that this will not take us off oil, off energy. That was \nobjected to this morning.\n  You cannot vote against this legislation because it would take us off \nenergy. You cannot vote against it because it will run up the debt \nbecause that is simply untrue.\n  I hope people will vote for this package. I say to everyone over \nhere, this is it. Everyone knows how little time we have left to \naccomplish everything we need to do. You can all go home and explain to \nyour constituents, if you vote against this legislation, how you \nrefused to move forward on some of the most sensitive issues that are \nin our legislative portfolio in Congress today. We will not be able to \ntake these matters up at a later time, and we will have to wait until a \nnew Congress. In the meantime there will be much suffering and mental \ndistress as a result of not moving forward on these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to take a minute or so of my \nleader time.\n  The issue before us, I say to my colleagues, is whether we are going \nto stay on the Energy bill. I have some optimism based on a \nconversation I had with the majority leader on the Senate floor earlier \nthis afternoon that we might be able to come up with an agreement to go \nforward. This is not the time to go off of the No. 1 issue in this \ncountry. On every poll you have seen the American people expect us to \ndeal with the energy problem and to deal with it now.\n  With all due respect to any other matters that might be pending that \nall of us have an interest in, the question is, what is the most \nimportant thing to do in the Senate this week, right now, and it is to \nstay on energy.\n  I would urge my friends on this side to oppose cloture. We will get \nback to this issue later. Let's stay on energy, finish the job, and \ndeal with the No. 1 issue before the American people.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said earlier, folks, there will not be \nanother time. This is it.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3268\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. 3268, the speculation energy bill, \nthat they all want to stay on, remain the pending business \nnotwithstanding the adoption of the motion to proceed to a \nnonprivileged item, namely the Coburn package.\n  How much more clear could we be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will be constrained to object \nbecause, as a practical matter, if we move to that issue, we will be \noff of the subject indefinitely because of concerns over here about \nthis particular measure. We will be on it indefinitely. We will \nprobably never get back to the No. 1 issue that is before us. So under \nthese particular circumstances, I am constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. We would be off this as long as it would take to adopt the \nmotion to proceed, which would take 15 minutes for the vote. Then we \ncould move immediately to the bill. We could do that immediately. We \ncould finish it quickly. The only effort that my friend, the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Oklahoma, wants is to throw a monkey \nwrench into proceedings around here. That is what this is all about.\n  I do not know why people on the other side of the aisle would join in \nthis. You go home and explain to your constituents about Lou Gehrig's \ndisease. You go home and explain about the stroke legislation. You go \nhome and explain to your folks about the Emmitt Till legislation. You \ngo home and explain to everyone there about the paralysis bill.\n  Next time you see someone in a wheelchair at home, explain to them \nhow you voted against moving forward on something that may get them out \nof that wheelchair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am confident--I see my friend from \nOklahoma on the Senate floor. Maybe he would like to ask me a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I might through the Chair, under the rules of the \nSenate, I\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nwould be entitled to 30 hours of debate postcloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. COBURN. Should we go past that to a cloture motion, I would be \nentitled to 30 hours of debate. If you add these, 60 hours of debate, \nunless we debate all night long every night, would that, in fact, take \nus past the time, the expected time of adjournment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reclaiming my time, I think the answer to my friend's \nquestion is, that is where we would be. Thus my observation that if we \nwant to deal with the No. 1 issue in the country in the last week we \nare expected to be here, the appropriate thing to do is to stay on the \nsubject.\n  Obviously, my friend from Oklahoma feels very strongly about this \nmatter. He and the majority leader are likely to have this exchange \nagain sometime down the road. The question for all of us is, what is \nthe most essential thing to do for America right now?\n  The American people are asking us to do something about the price of \ngas at the pump. The way to do that is to stay on that subject at this \nparticular moment, and the way to do that is to vote against cloture on \ngetting off the subject and going to something else.\n  Mr. REID. With all due respect to my doctor friend from Oklahoma, his \nmath is not very good. The 30 hours, if he would want to take the 30 \nhours, which appears to be a little outlandish--but that would not be \nthe first go-round we have had with outlandish stuff around here--that \nwould run out sometime tomorrow. The cloture vote would be sometime on \nThursday.\n  No one says we have to leave on Friday. No one says we have to leave \nuntil we complete our work. So I would say to my friends, do not take \nthe bait.\n  First of all, we would be on energy. The Senator from Oklahoma can \nstall this out, and we know he is entitled to 30 hours after today and \n30 hours when we invoke cloture on the bill itself because cloture \nwould be invoked on it if people had a right to vote on that.\n  But do not take that bait. I say to everyone here, you go home and \nexplain to someone, like I did, like I am going to have to do--Cathy \nBarrett from Sparks, NV, has Lou Gehrig's disease. She is going to die. \nThe average time from finding out you have the disease until you die is \n18 months. Go home and explain to her and her family. And there are \n6,000 new cases every year. Lou Gehrig's disease, that is what it is \nall about.\n  As I said before, you go and see someone in a wheelchair, and you \ntell them: I had the chance to do something about that, but I decided \nwe would wait until next year. A year is not so important. You are only \nin a wheelchair for a limited period of time--perhaps your life.\n  I think you should also go home and explain to every parent who is \nconcerned about Internet pornography--people who thrive on doing things \non the Internet to be in the position to abuse children, that is in \nthis bill too.\n  I think we should be concerned about an issue that every time you go \nhome--and most everyplace in America has an African-American community. \nYou see someone in that African-American community, you tell them: I \ndid not vote for the Emmitt Till legislation. It was not important \nenough because I had other things I wanted to do.\n  So every time you go back to your constituents, African-American \nconstituents, wherever it may be in this country, you tell them: I \nwanted to get out of Washington; I did not have time to do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader just made a very \nstrong argument for why this issue he is talking about should not be \nput off until next year. But the issue before us now is what to do \nimmediately. We have been on the issue of energy for a week. It is time \nto stay on it and finish the job.\n  The majority leader, not the minority, determines what the schedule \nis. If the so-called Coburn bill is so important, I am sure the \nmajority leader will turn back to it soon. But the issue is staying on \nthe No. 1 concern in the country now and finishing the job. The \nmajority leader, who controls the schedule, has it perfectly within his \npower not to delay this bill until later. In fact, this bill could have \nbeen done sooner than now--sooner than now. The issue today is whether \nwe stay on the No. 1 issue in the country and finish the job. I \nrecommend that we do that.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the Record does not show a grin on my \nface because there is not one. But I think the statement just made by \nthe Republican leader: I could have gone to this earlier had I wanted \nto--we have had 90 filibusters, breaking all previous records, breaking \nall previous records of a Congress from the time we were a country \nuntil today. I could have moved to it earlier?\n  For the last 18 months since we have been in the majority, which I \nknow has caused the Republicans to be in a snit, we have had to file \ncloture on virtually everything to work around procedural hurdles. So \nthis is all part of the game. And I am disappointed that my Republican \ncolleagues are buying the line of big oil.\n  We have offered, on many occasions, a vote on their drilling \namendment. We did it again earlier today. I hope we can work something \nout on it. But please do not use that as an excuse to vote against \nthese packages.\n  I say, and I repeat again, for the 34 different reasons--the 34 \ndifferent bills in this package being held up for no good reason--it \ndoes not affect the debt at all. We have in the Record a letter from \nthe head of the Congressional Budget Office that says it has no bearing \non the deficit.\n  I would hope that because of our African-American communities, people \nwho have Lou Gehrig's disease, people who are paralyzed, people who are \nconcerned about pornography, you will vote for this.\n  Now, my friend casually says: Well, the Democratic leader will move \nto this some other time.\n  There are very few other times left in this Congress. We are going to \nget out of here in the next week or 10 days, I hope. We then come back \nin September where we have a few--literally, a few days. There is very \nlittle time. So as it happened with LIHEAP, you folks walked right off \nthe cliff last week. You are going to have to go home and explain to \nthe poor, the disabled, and the old people why you voted against LIHEAP \nbecause I do not know when we are going to be able to move to it again. \nI would like to, but I do not know when we can do that again.\n  I ask for a vote now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say briefly, my good friend is making a \ncampaign speech about who is going to pay a price for this or that or \nthe other. I do not think the American people are particularly \ninterested in that.\n  What we know they are interested in, all the surveys indicate what \nthey are interested in, is seeing the Congress work together to do \nsomething important about the No. 1 issue in the country, and that is \nthe price of gas at the pump.\n  We have a chance, if we stay on the subject--I am optimistic that we \nare going to have some amendments that are agreeable to both sides. We \ncan move forward. The majority leader, who is in charge of the \nschedule, can get us back on any subject he chooses at any time of his \nchoosing. So I would hope our colleagues would vote to stay on the \nsubject of lowering the price of gas at the pump for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. REID. Every Senator, all 100 of us, are experienced politicians. \nAnd for the Republican leader to say there is no price to be paid for \nwhat they have been doing: not allowing LIHEAP to go forward, and now, \nin effect, killing 34 different bills that should have passed like that \nyou do not think there is a price to be paid for it come November 4? \nThe American people will decide that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate to proceed to S. 3297, a bill to Advance America's \nPriorities, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Allard), the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. \nDole), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel), the Senator from Arizona (Mr.\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nMcCain), and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to everyone for the quorum \nlasting for so long, but there are certain things I have trouble \ngetting to. Sometimes I need a little downtime to meet with staff, and \nthere are a number of times I don't have an opportunity to do that, and \nmeet with a number of Senators. So I apologize to everyone for not \nallowing the quorum to be called off. I do that very rarely, but I \nthought it was appropriate today.\n  I have a number of things I want to do and I will do that now.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed to S. 3297.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Oklahoma has a \nmatter he wishes to bring before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the majority leader for the time.\n  Mr. President, in the bills we did not agree to go to, I have worked \nwith Senator Biden on the child exploitation alternative bill, which \nwould protect our children from pornography and Internet exploitation. \nThat bill is at the desk and has been filed.\n  After working with Senator Biden, adding the SAFE Act, which is an \nact that would decrease the amount of graphic and vile images of child \npornography currently available on the Internet and help root out \npeople selling, trading, and displaying images, and by expanding the \nrequirements for the Internet service providers to report on online \nchild pornography, which is a bipartisan bill as well, as were two of \nthese components I never held in the bill, I ask unanimous consent that \nwe call up and pass that bill, as amended, with the concurrence of the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have here is one of the most blatant \nattempts to get a cover for a vote the Republicans can't justify. The \nRepublicans just voted against the bill that had these child \npornography and child exploitation provisions in it. A few minutes ago, \nwe had a cloture vote on the motion to begin debate on that bill. The \nRepublicans overwhelmingly voted against it. We got three Republicans \nto vote for it, each of those running for reelection.\n  Because they feel bad about siding with big oil over important \nAmerican priorities, they now want to have it both ways. Here is who \nthey voted against: They voted against Americans with Lou Gehrig \ndisease, they voted against American mothers who suffer from postpartum \ndepression, they voted against justice for people murdered during the \ncivil rights struggle, they voted against expanding programs to keep \nkids off drugs, they voted against Americans who want to be sure kids \nare safe when they visit America's beaches and swim in the oceans, and \na bill including numerous other important provisions--dealing with \nstrokes, with paralysis. If a Member of my party, a Member of my caucus \nforced me to vote against so many important priorities based on \nspecious and misleading arguments, I would want a way out too.\n  So what we have here is a consent agreement, a consent request, I \nshould say, that is about providing cover, not about trying to enact \nthis legislation. To bring up Senator Biden's name is, at the very \nleast, unfair, disingenuous. Senator Coburn didn't even bother to talk \nto the offices whose bills are cobbled together in his unanimous \nconsent request. And in fact he didn't even bother to attend a hearing \non this issue the Judiciary Committee held in April.\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nAnd because this is about cover and not trying to enact legislation, \nthe bills in this unanimous consent request are not identical to the \nprovisions in the bill they voted against.\n  So keep in mind what my friend from Oklahoma has tried to do. First, \nhe got his Republican Senators to walk over the cliff, and they are \nalready down there fumbling around trying to find some way to breathe, \nbecause it is the water down there, and deep. Now he is saying this \npackage of 34 bills we have--he is taking parts of that out and \nchanging those, not accepting what is in the bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is it my understanding there is an objection to the \nunanimous consent?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. When we complied with the provisions in S. 3297, we cleared \nthe language with the House. We wanted to be sure that once we passed \nthat bill, the Coburn package, the House would pass a bill \ninstantaneously. But this unanimous consent uses different language, as \nI have explained to the Chair and those within the sound of my voice.\n  It is ironic. Last week, my friend from Oklahoma held a press \nconference railing against passing bills that no one has seen or had a \nchance to vet. This is what he is trying to do now--what he held a \npress conference against last week. So I must object, as I have done, \nto this consent request.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3297\n\n  Mr. REID. I do, however, offer a unanimous consent request that, if \naccepted, I know would lead to enactment of this important legislation. \nNot only that, it would deal with child pornography, and it would deal \nwith 33 other issues, all of which are extremely vital and important.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to S. 3297, the \nAdvancing America's Priorities Act; that the bill be considered read a \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Objection.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I again say that Republicans should be \ngrateful, because we certainly agree, but they should all be very \ngrateful that Senator Kennedy got out of his sickbed, flew down here \nagainst doctors' instructions, came onto the Senate floor against \ndoctors' instructions--because his immune system is very low and he \nshouldn't have been here--to save Medicare, and a number of \nRepublicans, because they were at the cliff on that one also. But for \nSenator Kennedy, they would have voted against that and destroyed \nMedicare.\n  Mr. COBURN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. So Republicans refused to allow us to debate and vote on \nspeculation, on----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, was I not recognized to offer two \nunanimous consent requests, and that the floor was actually mine, other \nthan the objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator was recognized to offer a \nunanimous consent request. I objected to that and I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma was recognized in \nhis own right and does maintain the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the Chair and to Senator Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would make the point--I understand the \nmajority leader's concern with my actions. My actions are not of impure \nmotives, nor are my attempts to embarrass anyone. But the fact is, we \ncould pass these bills if we weren't struggling with politics. The fact \nis, if we wanted to do something about it--and I believe many of the \nMembers of this body do--we can continue the game of reducing minority \nrights or we can truly work to try to work out the problems on the \nbills. That is what the attempt was. I will not go any further with \nthat.\n\n  I will take this time to ask unanimous consent for another \nagreement--the Emmett Till bill, which I offered multiple times; \nmultiple potential amendments to solve this problem. I met with Mr. \nSykes, who is leading this effort. I agree with the purposes of the \nbill. I have always agreed with the purposes of the bill, and I \nobjected because the Justice Department spent over $400 million in the \nlast 7 years on conferences, and the Justice Department says they can \ndo what we want done for about a third of the amount of the money. So I \nam willing to offer a way to pass the Emmett Till bill tonight on the \nfloor, a way that allows the Justice Department to take funds from \nwithin their other funds and pay for the costs of this bill, which will \nbe about a third less than what we would have authorized, and that will \nhappen in spite of the fact that we do not plan to offer any \nappropriations bills this year.\n  The Emmett Till bill could become law and be in effect at the level \nat which we would all want it by agreeing to the following unanimous \nconsent request, the bill I filed, and I ask unanimous consent it be \nadopted and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are at the \nsame place we were just a few minutes ago. This, of course, is not a \ngenuine effort to resolve the issues. This is a genuine effort to \nobfuscate what we are trying to do here on the floor.\n  The Emmett Till bill here--in fact, one of the people who were with \nhim the night he was murdered was up in the gallery today. We worked \nvery hard to get this legislation passed. Now my friend from Oklahoma \nwants to change what the agreement was, that was reported--what passed \nthe House almost unanimously and was reported out of the committee \nalmost unanimously.\n  This again is a blatant attempt to get a cover vote for a vote the \nRepublicans cannot justify. They just voted against a bill that had the \nEmmett Till language in it. It had the child pornography language in \nit. I repeat, because they feel bad about siding with big oil over \nimportant American priorities, they now want to have it both ways.\n  As I said a little while ago, they voted against Americans with Lou \nGehrig's disease, they voted against American mothers who suffer \npostpartum depression. My friend from the State of Illinois--\n  Mr. COBURN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I make the note that what we have is the majority leader \nsaying I want cover. I don't cover for anything, I say to the majority \nleader. I have been out front opposing these bills from the start \nbecause they were not paid for or they were not good policy. To claim \nthat my effort to pass this legislation now in a way that both saves \nmoney for the next few generations and also will accomplish the very \ngoal that he says he wants to accomplish--that has nothing to do with \nfeeling guilty. I think it is a great victory for the American people \ntoday that we did not spend $11 billion and get on a bill that would \nspend it.\n  I understand there is a permanent disagreement, both on how we have \ndone this and also on the policy questions, but the fact is, if we want \nto solve unsolved civil rights violations, the way to do it is this. \nThe way not to do it is to say: We are not going to do it, we are not \ngoing to work with you, we are not going to change it.\n  The whole purpose of not agreeing to the unanimous consent request on \nthe bill in the first place was there is so much waste in the Justice \nDepartment. It would be my recommendation that maybe after a few days \nwe take another look at that, and I will work with the authors of the \nbill in a good-faith effort to try to make both those bills capable of \nbeing passed. I know many on your side would like to get the \nlegislation done no matter what.\n  This is no attempt to cover for anybody. I have too many holds to try \nto cover for anything.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Coburn, with regard to the Emmett Till bill, \nyou have been open about your objection. This is not a secret hold, is \nit?\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You worked on it. You spent a lot of your time. You \ntalked to the Department of Justice, you studied the bill, you studied \nthe language in it. You have a sincere concern about the way it was \noriginally written; is that right?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have a concern with the money authorized in this bill \nthat will be wasted and appropriated when we have not taken care of a \nlarge amount of the waste in the Justice Department.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In fact, you talked to the Justice Department about it, \nI believe; is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. I have.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You spent a lot of hours of your personal time trying \nto make this legislation better. Have they told you they needed as much \nmoney as the bill originally authorized?\n  Mr. COBURN. They said they needed one-third of what the bill \nauthorized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Department of Justice said they can meet the goal \nwith one-third less money than the bill has in it?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And you are willing to accept that amount?\n  Mr. COBURN. And have it paid for out of wasted funds at the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think that is an unreasonable position, I would \nsay to my friend the majority leader. I think that is good work, what a \ngood Senator should do. They should ask questions.\n  You served on the Judiciary Committee, so you were engaged with that \ndiscussion when it first came up?\n  Mr. COBURN. I first raised reservations on this bill when it first \ncame up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On the Child Protection Act, the goal of that was--I \nserved on that subcommittee--the goal of that was to create task forces \naround the country to exploit computer technology to identify \npedophiles and child molesters, a goal which I support and I think you \nsupport. But the amount of money just seemed to be drawn out of thin \nair, one-point-something billion dollars; is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct. The bill as offered brought that number \ndown to $360-some million, which was never offered to me but was in the \nbill as it came to the floor.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. OK. When it came out of the subcommittee, as I recall--\nand I talked to the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Biden, at \nlength, and our staff talked, and we asked him to bring the amount \ndown.\n  I served 15 years in the Department of Justice. I know the Presiding \nOfficer was a U.S. attorney also. I know something about how task \nforces work. We didn't need $1.2 billion. I tried to get that down.\n  I was placed in an uncomfortable position to either vote for a bill \nthat I supported in general or insist that the number, the amount of \nfunding, be reduced to a reasonable level. Sometimes you wonder, maybe \nthey want to put you in that position. I voted against the bill in \ncommittee.\n  After you raised an objection and placed a hold on it or made clear \nyour objection, the bill has been reduced in amount?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, it has, by three-quarters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield to me?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have waited more than an hour to speak while the \nquorum call was on, and we couldn't get the quorum call taken off.\n  With all due respect, the real issue, which is on the floor now, is \nnot the amounts of these dollars or the virtue of all of the bills you \nare blocking, but the real issue is whether----\n  Mr. REID. Is there a question the Senator has for the Senator from \nOklahoma?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Alabama spoke at some length without \nany objection being offered.\n  I will pose a question to you, Senator Coburn, since the majority \nleader wants to find some way to stop me from speaking. He didn't stop \nSenator Sessions from speaking. My question to you, Senator----\n  Mr. REID. Is there a question the Senator from Pennsylvania has?\n  Mr. SPECTER. My question to you, Senator Coburn----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania use his \nmicrophone.\n  Senators may yield the floor for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The question to the Senator from Oklahoma: Isn't the \nreal issue behind the cloture vote an effort to dislodge the pending \nlegislation on the oil speculation bill? Is it the substance of the \nlegislation which you have opposed and blocked, most of which if not \nall of which I agree with. But isn't the real point as to what the \nSenator from Nevada is seeking to do here is to find some way to get \noff the oil speculators bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his question. I \nthink you accurately assessed it. The fact is, this country has an \nenergy crisis. We have chosen not to address American resources for \nthat. We have chosen to do anything but that, and that is why we have \nseen bill after bill forcing political votes rather than solving the \nreal problem Americans want the Senate to address, which is how do we \nstop sending $700 billion of our treasure out of this country every \nyear, knowing we are going to be on carbon-based energy for at least \nthe next 20 to 30 years, and how do we use American resources.\n  You are absolutely right. That is the real question. That is what we \nshould be about. That is why Republicans stood and said the thing the \nAmerican people are interested in is us addressing the issues that are \nimpacting them directly today, the $2,400 per family, trying to get to \nwork or get to school.\n  The question the Senator asked is absolutely right. The real question \nis energy and trying to take us off energy and run out the clock and \nnot deal with this before we go on summer break.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My next question to the Senator from Oklahoma is, when \nthe Senator from Nevada rejects the traditional standing of Senators to \noffer an amendment to any bill at any time--until the past 15 years, \nmajority leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, have adopted this \nfilling the tree to preclude amendments, and the Senator from Nevada \nsays there is insufficient time to take up the amendments. Isn't it \ntrue that if the Senate and the House stayed in session during the \nmonth of August and did not take the recess, we could take up any \nnumber of amendments to give Senators the traditional rights, which had \nbeen enjoyed until 1993, when both Democratic and Republican majority \nleaders have stymied the process by this process of filling the tree?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think the Senator makes a good point. The answer to \nthat is yes. As a matter of fact, we would have been halfway through \nthis bill had cloture not been filed when it was introduced at the same \ntime, as we just saw on the bills this evening. A bill is introduced, \ncloture is filed at the moment of introduction, as it was with the \nAdvancing America's Priorities or, as I call it, the Grow Government \nand Spend More of Your Grandkids' Money bill, the point being we could \nhave already accomplished half of what this country needs had we had an \nopen amendment process that was germane to the energy needs of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My next question to the Senator from Oklahoma is whether \nSenator Reid was correct when he spoke, on February 28, 2006, as noted \nin the Congressional Record on the Patriot Act Reauthorization:\n\n       I am disappointed that he--\n\n  Referring to a Senator who wanted to offer an amendment--\n\n     has been denied that opportunity by a procedural maneuver \n     known as ``filling the tree.'' This is a very bad practice. \n     It runs against the basic rule of the Senate. The hallmark of \n     the Senate is free speech and open debate.\n\n  Was the Senator from Nevada correct when he decried and criticized \nthis business of filling the tree to preclude the offering of \namendments?\n  Mr. COBURN. I answer the Senator from Pennsylvania by saying yes, he \nwas. No majority leader should fill the tree, Republican or Democrat. \nIt goes against the best traditions of the Senate. It goes against the \ntradition of full debate and full amendment.\n  Our energy problems could be solved tomorrow as far as this bill. We \ncould ask a unanimous consent to withdraw the amendments filling the \ntree. If we had unanimous consent to do that, we could have open \namendments with the provision there would only be germane amendments to \nthe energy needs of\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nthis country. We could do that, but we have moved from debate about \nwhat is in the best interests of this country to what is in the best \ninterests of the next political election. That is what this debate is \nabout. It is not about energy. It is not about what is in the best \ninterests of the next two generations. It is not what is in the best \ninterests of the Nation from a national security standpoint or energy \nsecurity standpoint. It is about what is best for the next election.\n  We need to get away from that. Regrettably, Republican leaders have \nused it but never to the extent of 15 times has it ever--it has not \nbeen used 15 times in total until the present leader has exercised it \n15 times. He has cut off debate and all amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware that I have stated \nfor the record my reason for opposing cloture on the oil speculators \nbill was not that I did not agree with the underlying approach of \nlegislation to deal with the high prices of oil and the high prices of \ngas at the pump, but I voted against cloture on that bill, opposed \nputting the majority leader in a position to move for final passage \nbecause I had amendments I wished to offer.\n  Was the Senator from Oklahoma aware that I have been pressing to get \nan amendment, along with Senator Kohl, a bipartisan amendment, to bring \nOPEC nations under the antitrust laws so they could not meet in a room, \nlower production, lower supply, and thereby raise the price of oil in \nthe international market?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was not aware of that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware that I am the \nprincipal author of the legislation to provide for the reporter shield, \nalong with Senator Schumer and Senator Lugar?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware that if that issue \ngoes through the process of the tree filling and cloture is invoked, \nthat legislation will displace the oil speculators bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware of the detailed \neffort I made on the legislation involving global warming coming to the \nfloor several times during the week of June 2, listing a number of \namendments which I sought to offer, essentially from the Bingaman-\nSpecter bill, and that I was precluded from offering those amendments \nbecause the Senator from Nevada filled the tree?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Was the Senator from Oklahoma aware of the fact that I \nvoted against cloture on the global warming bill, notwithstanding the \nfact that I think that is an issue that has to be addressed and worked \nfor more than a year with Senator Bingaman, producing the Bingaman-\nSpecter bill, but voted against cloture to advance the bill because I \nand others wanted to offer amendments to the global warming bill?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Was the Senator from Oklahoma aware of that when the \nSenator from Nevada thwarted the proceedings under the FAA bill, that \nthere were key issues to be decided, such as modernizing air control to \nmove to satellite, to provide for greater safety, and the processing of \nthat bill was thwarted because the tree was filled and, again, a motion \nfor cloture was denied because Senators were not given an opportunity \nto offer amendments?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was aware of that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Was the Senator from Oklahoma aware that I had two \nimportant amendments relating to air control over my State, \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania, actually over Delaware, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania, that I had an amendment which dealt with the scheduling, \nwhere there were enormous delays on takeoffs and landings because they \nwere overbooked, and that the efforts to change the law on that were \nthwarted by the procedures adopted by the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was aware.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Was the Senator from Oklahoma aware that a number of \nSenators were on the floor for about an hour today and could not get \nrecognition and had to wait because a quorum call was on and that the \nSenator from Nevada saw to it that the unanimous consent to take off \nthe quorum was denied?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was aware of that. I had actually offered unanimous \nconsent to waive the cloture and was denied.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware that there is a \ndetermination by this Senator, and I think by more than 40 other \nSenators on this side of the aisle, to fight these procedural moves \ncome hell or high water, and no matter what legislation the Senator \nfrom Nevada offers, if it is legislation similar to the shield bill \nthat I have worked on for a long time, I think it is very necessary, \nthat we are going to rebel against the tyranny of what has been \nestablished by the majority leader in following a procedure to fill the \ntree and then blame Republicans who refuse cloture and exercise finger-\npointing backward and forward?\n  Is the Senator from Oklahoma aware that I and others are determined \nto do everything we can to stop this procedure, which has undercut the \nbasic purpose of the Senate?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am. I am very pleased in your effort.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will not take but a moment longer. I think it is fair \nto allow the majority leader to regain the floor.\n  The Senate I know and the Senate I studied was not about limiting \ndebate. It was not about having a Rules Committee of one, it was about \nunlimited debate, germane but unlimited. It was about amendments. It \nwas about using the parliamentary rules we have in a fair and \nstraightforward way to advance what you thought was best for this \ncountry.\n  The majority leader has the toughest position in this body. It is a \nhard job. There is no question. I defer to his judgment. I am not \ncritical of his judgment. I am sorry for the Senate that we are to the \npoint now where we can only move legislation when it is approved and \nthe amendments are approved by the majority leader and his leadership.\n  I think that fails the test of our Founders' version of the Senate. I \nthink we will rue the day that we have gone down this path. But I will \ncontinue to use every parliamentary maneuver I know to lessen \nWashington's wasteful spending, to pass good bills and make them better \nand not to say that just because you do not approve of a unanimous \nconsent request that you do not have something to offer.\n  The fact is, we have passed 855 bills by unanimous consent. I may \nhave let too many go. But the fact is we negotiated with a lot of \npeople and got a lot of bills through. The frustration factor is part \nof the Senate. Working together we solve problems, working against each \nother what we do is we lower the rate of acceptability and confidence \nin this body to the 9 percent it has today.\n  My hat is off to Harry Reid for the amount of time he has put in, the \namount of effort he puts in it. I would hope he would choose to go a \ndifferent way, reaching across the aisle, working across the aisle. \nEverybody's ideas have value. Everybody's input should be offered and \nthere should be real negotiation.\n  One last comment. This omnibus package of bills had 34 bills in it. \nThere were only three bills that I absolutely opposed, nine bills I \nnever objected to at all. And every other bill in that I made an offer \nto reach out, offer amendments, offer suggestions. Most of the time it \nwas flatly rejected: We are going to roll over you. You cannot have \ninput.\n  If that is the way the Senate operates, then we are going to be back \nhere a lot of times in the future. I know, pretty heady times, thinking \nthat we may not have the power to do that. But that power, if it goes \naway, will not last for very long being in absence. It will be back. \nThe American people get it.\n  This country is on a crashing course, financially. Fiscally, we \ncannot handle what is happening to us. Until we start handling the \nproblems now that are going to be the crisis in the future, we will \nfail the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to be very patient and try to run \nthrough the accusations and statements made by my friend from Oklahoma \nand my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  The Emmett Till bill was introduced in February of 2007. It is now \nJuly of\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\n2008. How much more patient can Senator Biden, members of that \ncommittee and, frankly, how much more patient can I be?\n  I revere the work done by John Lewis and others; civil rights leaders \nin those early days. I have listened to him talk at great length in a \nprivate, personal basis about what he went through. We had here at a \nDPC luncheon within the last few months a woman who proceeded to go \ndown there with John Lewis and others, a White woman from here, in \nVirginia.\n  She believed what she had heard, that this was a country that was \nopen to everyone. She, too, was beaten, thrown into prison, as were \nhundreds of other people. But, sadly, Emmett Till was murdered, as were \nlots of others. Most of those civil rights murders have been unsolved. \nThat is what this is all about. Let's get to the bottom of it.\n  Make all the excuses you want, but we have had lots of time to deal \nwith the legislation. No matter how many times my friend from Oklahoma \ntalks about the huge cost of this package of bills, he can say it once, \nhe can say it 1,000 times, it does not matter. The bill costs nothing. \nIt is in the Congressional Record. I introduced it today. The head of \nthe Congressional Budget Office said it costs nothing.\n  So any talk about saving huge amounts of money is nothing but \nwasteful talk because it does not. To have other Senators come here and \nsay: Well, what we want to do with this Emmett Till bill you could do \nit for one-third of the amount.\n  That is what the legislative process is all about. There are three \nother opportunities for us to do that. All we are doing is authorizing \nthat so the legislation can move forward. You can do it at the \nsubcommittee level in appropriations, the full committee level of \nappropriations, and then when the bill gets to the Senate floor.\n  For Republicans to come and cry crocodile tears about my tyranny on \nthe Senate floor is laughable. I have had to file almost 90 cloture \nmotions to try to stop the filibusters they filed. We have had to file \ncloture on things they agree with because they are stalling for time. \nThey want to maintain the status quo.\n  I would say to anyone, including my friend from Pennsylvania who \ncomes to the floor and says we are going to do this no matter what \nbecause we want to stay on the Energy bill, I offered a unanimous \nconsent not once but twice, saying we would stay on the Energy bill. We \ncould finish this package of bills just like that and move to energy. \nWe would never get off that. That was the consent I offered. So these \nare all excuses, real excuses.\n  The question is, The Republicans have decided to stick with big oil, \nthe oil companies that last year made $250 billion. That is what they \nhave decided to do. It is a decision they made. It was calculated. They \ndecided to do that.\n  There is not a Democrat over here who does not say we should do more \nwith the domestic production. We have said that time and time again. \nNow, I can be threatened with a lot of things, but do not ever consider \nthat anyone here is going to outwork me. I do not care if we are here \nduring the August recess. If you want to talk politics, we do not have \na single Democratic Senator who has an election contest that is at all \ntroubling. There are 11 of them over there.\n  If they want to stay here during the August recess, that is fine with \nme. The only thing I have planned would take me about 20 minutes to get \nout of. I have a trip to Afghanistan. It is something I feel I need to \ndo. I can do it some other time. I am taking five or six other Senators \nwith me. They can do it some other time. So do not come to the floor \nand say we are going to stay here in the August recess. Who suffers \nmore for doing that, Democrats or Republicans? They do, I would think.\n  If they have any common sense--I know they do--those Senators who \nhave election contests would rather be home than here. So do not \nsuggest that somehow I am afraid to be here. We may not be doing energy \nlegislation during that time, but we have so much to do.\n  We have the Defense authorization bill. If we don't get the media \nshield, we have that too. We have a number of other important issues we \nhave to do. Consumer product safety, we have to do that conference \nreport. So there are plenty of things we can do during the August \nrecess, if the Republicans would rather be here. So don't say: We are \ngoing to really get you. We are going to ask you to stay here during \nthe August recess.\n  Also, understand this: We have had a difficult problem with the \nPresident now for some time. We don't let him have recess appointments \nbecause they are mischievous, and unless we have an agreement before \nthe recess, there will be no recess. We will meet every third day pro \nforma, as we have done during the last series of breaks. We don't need \na vote to recess. We will just be in pro forma session. We will tell \nthe House to do the same thing. So let's not be threatening about \nstaying in during the August recess.\n  People ask: Why do the Democrats think Republicans may be somewhat \nmischievous in amendments they offer? Let's look at recent history. We \nhave tried in good faith to legislate on bills, one of them we thought \nwould be a good idea. Let's have an open amendment process. The first \namendment they came here and offered was something that has been panned \nby every editorial writer in America, an 18-cent tax holiday. Remember, \nin Nevada we paid about $3.30 for a gallon of gas. Everyone knew the \nMcCain issue to deal with the energy crisis was laughable. But that was \nthe amendment they offered.\n  Then we decided, well, there is another piece, maybe they will not do \nit this time. But, bango, one of the first things they did was offer \ntheir own GI bill of rights because John McCain said the bill that is \nnow law is too generous. So, again, we got off track on that.\n  All of my friends lamenting what the present status of the Senate is, \nall they have to do is look back at recent history. Presidential \nelections have consequences. Presidential elections always cause \nproblems on the Senate floor. It is difficult to legislate when one \nSenator can do so much damage.\n  I would say to my friend from Pennsylvania, he read from the \nCongressional Record something I said in 2006. I said that. But if he \nwere logical--and I think he is--he should have read the rest of that \nbecause, if you understand, he voted to go with Senator Frist that \nfilling the tree was just fine. Suddenly, he has found religion. Back \nthen, he didn't have it. Senator Specter voted with Senator Frist to \nfill the tree.\n  NOPEC--he talks about that. I know a little bit about that piece of \nlegislation. I believed strongly, with Senator Kohl and Senator \nSpecter, that OPEC should be subject to the antitrust laws of this \ncountry. I have said so publicly, and I tried here to bring that matter \nto the floor. I asked consent that we would be able to do that. Who \nobjected to it? The Republicans objected to it. We didn't. We wanted to \nlegislate on that. They wouldn't let us.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania has joined the throng to vote against \nMedicare, speculation, the energy package of tax extenders, LIHEAP, \nglobal warming--all these issues, and this package today.\n  I say that people who voted today against this package decided they \nwanted to have a vote to satisfy big oil. And to use the lame excuse \nthat Harry Reid was a tyrannical guy and was stopping them from \nlegislating. They have stopped themselves from legislating because they \nwant to maintain the status quo. That is what this is all about. \nPresident Bush is for the status quo, and his people in the Senate are \nmarching along behind him.\n  Again, I repeat, you go home and explain, I say to my Republican \nfriends, you go home and explain to your constituents, the next person \nyou see in a wheelchair, go up to them and say: You know, I voted \nagainst you because Harry Reid was being a tyrannical guy in the \nSenate.\n  You go home to someone whose family is bereaved because their mother, \nsister, or friend had a baby, and they were so depressed that they are \nnow in a mental ward of some hospital or they committed suicide. You go \nhome and explain to that family that is the case.\n  You go home and explain to someone who is a stroke victim or a family \nwho has a stroke victim: I decided to vote against you because Harry \nReid didn't give me an amendment to vote on whether OPEC should be \nsubject to the antitrust laws.\n  You go home and tell people--there is going to be 5,600 new people \nthis year\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\nwho will be diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. From the time they are \ndiagnosed to the time they die is an average of 18 months. You go home \nand tell them and their families, their friends: I voted that way \nbecause Harry Reid wasn't handling the Senate right. I had a chance to \nvote on it, but I didn't like the way he was doing it. So you \nunderstand, Harry Reid was the bad guy. I am a good guy, even though I \nvoted against your best interests.\n  You go home and tell people who are struggling every day raising \nchildren, trying to keep them away from evil people who do things that \nare very horrible with pornography with children, they exploit \nchildren--we have legislation here that would stop that. You go home, \ngo to a PTA meeting and tell them: Well, we had something that would \nhelp this pornography with children, but Reid, I just don't like the \nway he runs the Senate.\n  You can go home and talk about the 34 pieces of legislation. You go \nhome, you Republicans, go home and explain to your constituents how you \ndid that. It is pretty hard to do, but you can go ahead and do it.\n  If any Member of my party suggested to me or the members of my caucus \nto vote against so many priorities based on specious and misleading \narguments, I would want a way out too. I understand the rights of my \nfriend from Oklahoma. He has a right to do what he has done. I think he \nis wrong. But I do say this: His Republican colleagues know him as well \nas I do, and what he has done is no surprise. But I am just saying they \nshould join together, as they did earlier this year, when there were \nover 90 pieces of legislation he had held up for the same baseless \nreasons he is holding this stuff up.\n  They voted because they said: Enough is enough. Well, enough is \nenough. They have decided they want to go along with the crowd. Eric \nHoffer, somebody I thought was a great author, just had a birthday. He \nis dead, but they announced it was his birthday, a longshoreman, \nphilosopher. He wrote a lot about what happens in crowds; people go \nalong with the crowd. He wrote about it. He was President Kennedy's \nfavorite author.\n  These folks over here are going along with the crowd, just like Eric \nHoffer said people do on certain occasions. They will regret having \ndone so.\n  I do the very best I can, trying to be fair, fair to everyone in my \ncaucus and fair to everyone in the Republican caucus. I have never been \na bully. I have been involved in a few fights in my life, but I very \nrarely ever picked a fight. I certainly haven't picked a fight here. I \nwant to get along. That is my personality. So I am not upset at anyone, \nother than to say: How foolish what is going on here in the Senate. I \nsay, with a clear conscience, I am not the cause of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, without prolonging this discussion \nendlessly, I want to take a moment to congratulate my friend from \nOklahoma for his courage in making an extraordinarily important point \nto our colleagues, which is the way you pass legislation on a \nconsultative basis. I would say to my friend from Oklahoma, I remember \nwhen we were in the majority and I was the second ranking member of our \nconference, having to tell our Members frequently that the only way we \ncould get anything accomplished was to take tough votes, and that was \nthe challenge of being in the majority. If you want to move something \nalong, you have to give the minority an opportunity to have their \nvotes.\n  There was always grumbling about it: Can't you do anything? \nInvariably people would say: I am up this cycle; I can't possibly do \nthis.\n  In order to make a law rather than just check the box, the process in \nthe Senate means the minority gets to offer amendments. What is going \non here is a fundamental shifting of the way the Senate has \nhistorically acted. I know the majority leader is under a lot of \npressure from his Members frequently to avoid tough votes. I have been \nthere. I have heard those demands. But if your operating mode is to \navoid all tough votes, you never accomplish much.\n  We haven't given up on this side. Our hope is that this Congress \ncould actually be remembered for having done at least a few things that \nwere important to the country. So I want to shift now to the issue that \nwe have been sort of sparring back and forth on over the last week or \nso, and that is the energy issue. I owe the majority leader a report on \na leadership meeting I had just a few hours ago. We had a good \ndiscussion. I think my membership and my leadership team believed that \nthe consent agreement he offered earlier today went a long way toward \nmeeting the requirements that many of us on this side of the aisle had \nbelieved were sort of a bare minimum threshold of credibility to \nactually have a chance of making a law rather than checking a box. When \nwe finally end our public discussion tonight, I just want to say to my \nfriend the majority leader publicly, I would like to have a discussion \nprivately about how we might go forward. It sounds to me like we are \nvery close to having a consent agreement that would give us a chance to \noperate on a major issue in the way the Senate has historically dealt \nwith significant issues.\n  I want to end my comments tonight on a note of optimism, that we \nmight be close to doing something important for the country on a very \nlarge issue. Again, on the question of the way the Senate functions, I \ncongratulate not only the Senator from Oklahoma but the Senator from \nPennsylvania for their strong insistence that they be allowed and that \nall Senators, really, be allowed to be part of the legislative process. \nIt is really the only way we can actually pass laws, rather than just \nscore points with each other. I think the American people would like to \nsee us do something significant about the No. 1 issue in the country.\n  I end the evening publicly--and I will continue conversations with \nthe majority leader privately--on a note of optimism that we might well \nbe on the verge of getting an agreement that would be acceptable to \nboth sides and give us a chance to go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania if he is seeking the floor to speak. Perhaps we can reach \na time agreement and he can speak and I could speak as well. I would \nlike to ask him, does he have a period of time for which he is seeking \nrecognition?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like 10 to 15 minutes tops.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania and ask unanimous consent that I be recognized immediately \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Illinois. \nI had sought recognition to try to speak about an hour ago, 5 past 6, \nbut we were in a quorum call. If there is somebody watching on C-SPAN, \nthey probably don't understand what is going on on the Senate floor. \nBut a quorum call can't be taken off if one Senator objects. As I said \nearlier, the majority leader objected until he got to the floor and \ntook off the quorum call. Then I made a number of comments in a \ndiscussion with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n  For those who do not know the Senate procedures, I could only ask him \na question, could not make any statements. Although the Senator from \nAlabama engaged in a considerable amount of comments without questions, \nthe majority leader objected when I sought recognition. So I now want \nto address a few basic points in what is going on.\n  The institutions of the Senate are very important to this country. \nThat is because this body has been called the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, because under the precedents, any Senator can offer \nany amendment to any bill at any time, virtually. There are some \nlimitations, but that is the valid generalization. If you combine that \nwith unlimited debate, this forum has been a place where ideas can be \nexpressed, the public can hear them, the public can understand them, \nand momentous matters of public policy are decided by the Senate \nbecause of our ability to bring up these issues. Nobody can limit it. \nThat has made America great. The Senate is a very important \ninstitution.\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\n  Now, regrettably, in the past 15 years--and it has been the fault of \nboth Democrats and Republicans; and I have not hesitated, as the record \nshows, to criticize the Republican caucus. I did so in some detail \nduring the judicial battles during the Clinton administration, where I \nthought the Republican caucus was wrong in denying confirmation. I have \nvoted in an independent way and have disagreed with Presidents of my \nown party and the majority of my own party.\n  In noting what has happened on this procedure of filling the tree--\nthat is an arcane expression, but let me take a moment to explain it.\n  When a bill is filed, called up by the majority leader, the majority \nleader then has what is called primacy of recognition. If two Senators \nseek recognition, and the majority leader is one of them, he has the \nright to recognition first. So he then offers an amendment to the \npending bill. Then he offers another amendment in the second degree. I \nwon't go on to detail the kinds of amendments, but the consequence is \nthat no other Senator can offer any amendment. That is called filling \nthe tree.\n  Then, when the majority leader has done that, he moves for cloture. \nThat is to cut off debate. Senator Reid did not invent this process. It \nhad been used very sparingly until 1993, only 15 years ago.\n  In one Congress, for example, the 101st Congress, 1989 to 1990, the \nDemocratic majority leader, George Mitchell, did not use it at all. \nThen, in the session from 1993 to 1994, Senator Mitchell used it nine \ntimes. Then it got to be in vogue. Senator Lott used it nine times in \nthe session from 1999 to 2000. Senator Frist then used it nine times in \n2005 and 2006. Senator Reid has now used it 15 times, and it has had \nthe consequence of precluding Senators from offering amendments.\n  Let me be very specific. The global warming bill came to the floor on \nJune 2 of this year. I had a whole series of amendments I wanted to \noffer, and came to the floor and talked about: No. 1, emission caps; \nNo. 2, cost containment safety valve; No. 3, the energy-intensive \nmanufacturing competitiveness amendment; and No. 4, the steel process \ngas emissions amendment.\n  But what happened? Senator Reid filled the tree on June 4. I could \nnot offer those amendments. Then, on June 6, he moved for cloture to \ncut off debate. Cloture was defeated 48 to 36. Then the bill was taken \ndown.\n  A similar thing happened on the FAA bill. It was called up on April \n28--a very important bill because it was going to change air control \npractices using a satellite system to provide for greater safety. There \nwere important amendments I wanted to offer on scheduling. We have \noverscheduling at the Philadelphia International Airport. People wait a \nlong time for takeoffs and circle a long time on landings. I could not \noffer that amendment. There were also significant problems on flight \npatterns, and I could not offer that amendment.\n  Now, regrettably, this has gone on on many bills for a very long \ntime.\n  Then, we have the oil speculators bill. It is important the Congress \ndeal with the escalating prices of oil and gasoline at the pump--\nheating oil. What has happened on the bill? There was a motion to \nproceed filed on July 17. On July 23, the tree was filled. Then the \nmotion for cloture on the bill was defeated on July 25.\n  So here we have no action. The only action is a lot of finger \npointing. Senator Reid points at the Republicans, and the Republicans \npoint back. Senator Reid says the Republicans killed the bill because \nthey would not invoke cloture, and Republicans say that was caused by \nSenator Reid's filling the tree and not allowing us to offer \namendments.\n  Well, I am sorry Senator Reid is not on the floor at the moment. But \nhe made a speech about explaining this to our constituents, and I do \nagree with him on that one point that it is going to be very hard to \nexplain to our constituents why we have done what we have done.\n  We had a vote on LIHEAP, low-income heat and energy assistance, last \nweek. Senator Reid called that bill to the floor to put Senators such \nas Arlen Specter on the spot. I have been a proponent of funding for \nthat second to none. As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee \nhaving jurisdiction over that subject, enormous sums were added. But \nhad that bill gone forward, the oil speculators bill would have been \ndisplaced.\n  Now, it is very important in the long run that oil prices be dealt \nwith for those people who need LIHEAP, who need heat in the winter in \nPennsylvania and Maine and other States, or air-conditioning in the \nsummer. It is going to be a job to explain it, there is no doubt about \nthat. But I am willing to undertake that risk, that difficulty. I have \ntown meetings all over Pennsylvania every year and will have a chance \nto talk to my constituents about it, and I am prepared to deal with it.\n\n  Senator Reid said on the issue of suffering, if we are in in August, \nthe Republicans will suffer more than the Democrats because there are \nmore Republicans who are up for election. Well, I submit that the \nquestion of suffering by the American people is more important than \nwhether there is more suffering by Democrats or Republicans in the \nSenate.\n  I do believe it would be salutary and appropriate for the Congress to \nstay in session during the month of August providing we deal with real \nissues and providing we do not have weeks, as the Senate has had, where \nthere are only one or two votes. We have plenty of time to deal with \nthese issues if we allow Senators to offer amendments and if we then \nproceed to consider them, so that I call upon the majority leader to \nkeep the Senate in session providing we take up the issues of oil \nprices and gasoline prices and providing we do not engage in the same \ncircular, dilatory finger-pointing practices which have characterized \nthe Senate for months now during the time when Senator Reid has offered \n15 instances where the so-called tree has been filled and no other \namendment can be offered by any Senator.\n  When I quoted Senator Reid about his denouncing the filling of the \ntree, his comment was that I had supported Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, and it is not true. I did not support him on that. I think \nSenator Reid was exactly right when he objected to the procedure to \nforeclose amendments by saying that the filling of the tree ``is a very \nbad practice.'' These are Senator Reid's words:\n\n       It runs against the basic nature of the Senate. The \n     hallmark of the Senate is free speech and open debate.\n\n  Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, had this to say on \nthe subject on May 11 of 2006:\n\n     . . . to basically lock out any amendments that might be \n     offered to this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of \n     this body. . . . when the amendment tree has been entirely \n     filled, then obviously we are dealing with a process that \n     ought not to be. . . . the Senate ought to be a place where \n     we can offer amendments, have healthy debate over a \n     reasonable time, and then come to closure on the subject \n     matter.\n\n  This is not a new position I have taken. More than 18 months ago, on \nFebruary 15, 2007, I introduced S. Res. 63 to change the standing rules \nof the Senate to bar the majority leader from filling the tree.\n  So, in conclusion, I do believe the rules of the Senate and the way \nwe have functioned to allow any Senator the opportunity, virtually, to \noffer any amendment at any time on any bill is a very precious \nprocedure in our democracy and it is worth fighting for. It is worth \nfighting for even if it is going to be misunderstood on the litany of \nitems which Senator Reid talks about. Illustratively, the people who \nhave LIHEAP will be better served in the long run by a Senate where \nSenators can offer amendments and deal with the problems of the high \nprice of oil in the long run by amendments such as the one Senator Kohl \nand I have offered to bring OPEC under the U.S. antitrust laws.\n\n  When we talk about where the suffering exists, we ought to focus a \nlittle more on the American people who don't have the money to go on \nvacation in August with the high gasoline prices or with the high \nprices generally to take vacations at all. I am not anxious to come \nback in August, but I am prepared to do so, and I think it would be in \nthe national and public interest to do so if we tackle the issue. The \nAugust session ought to be for oil and gas prices, and that would be \nworth our while.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for agreeing to this time.\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am trying to visualize somewhere in \nAmerica where a father walks into his living room and says to his son: \nWhat are you watching?\n  The son says: Well, I was watching C-SPAN. I was watching the Senate.\n  The father says to the son: What were they talking about?\n  The son says: Filling the tree.\n  The father says: What is that?\n  The son says: I don't have any idea.\n  The father says: You would think they would talk about things that \nwere important to us. Turn off the television. Watch the cartoons.\n  I listened to this debate and wondered how we can get tied into \nknots, just as we have today. I will tell you that we had 34 bills \nbefore us today. They were in a package. These are 34 bills that were \nconsidered noncontroversial bills--bills that had passed the House of \nRepresentatives without dissenting votes, in many cases, or \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. These are bills reported out of \nour committees--including the Judiciary Committee Senator Specter and I \nserve on--unanimously. These are bills which, in the ordinary course of \nbusiness in the ordinary history of the Senate, wouldn't have caused a \nripple because they had been agreed to and written and both sides said: \nThis is a good idea; let's do it.\n  However, under the rules of the Senate--and it is a unique \ninstitution--any Senator can object to any bill. They can stop the \ntrain and say: Don't go forward, don't consider the bill, if one \nSenator--just one Senator--should object. Well, in this case, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, objected.\n  Senator Coburn is a friend of mine. We use that term a lot around \nhere, but this is for real. He is a friend of mine. He is the ranking \nRepublican on a subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Human \nRights and the Law of the Judiciary Committee, and we have done a lot \nof work together. In fact, he has been the cosponsor of some bills that \nhave been enacted and signed by the President which I initiated and he \njoined me, so we truly do have a good working relationship.\n  I think he has a peculiar fiscal philosophy, and here is what it is. \nThere are two kinds of bills that we consider. One is an authorization \nbill, and the other is an appropriations bill. Let me use an example.\n  That same father I mentioned earlier says to his son one day: Why \ndon't you go out and buy a bicycle.\n  The kid says: You mean I can buy a bicycle? Great, he says.\n  At that point, the son says: Can I have some money?\n  The father says: No, we don't have the money, but you can buy one if \nyou want to.\n  The kid says: I don't have the money.\n  That turns out to be the important question--not whether you have the \npermission to buy the bicycle but whether you have the money to buy the \nbicycle. Permission--authorization. The money to make it work: \nappropriation. So the 34 bills here are all permissions to spend money. \nThat is it. They don't provide any money. That is another part of the \nprocess.\n  I think that is the critical difference which Senator Coburn does not \nacknowledge. We are authorizing these. We are permitting these things \nto occur, but we are not spending the money for them. That comes later. \nWe have a finite, limited amount of money to spend in our Federal \nbudget and we will decide: Will this be the priority or will it be \nsomething else? Senator Coburn believes that if you give permission, \nall the money is going to be spent. Historically, that never happens, \nbut that is his philosophy, that is his point of view. So he objected \nto some 34 bills.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3297\n\n  Now, it is my understanding that there is a consent script available \nwhich I would like to propound before Senator Specter leaves the floor.\n  Of the 34 bills which were included in S. 3297 which was considered \ntoday, Senator Coburn has come to the floor and asked that 1 or 2 of \nthe bills be modified, changed, and passed. I wish to make sure it is \nclear for the record that we are asking consent on our side, unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to S. 3297, the bill in its entirety, \nthat the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record as if read.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Coburn, who could \nnot be present, on his behalf, I am objecting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bills I just asked to be passed and \nthe ones which were not passed earlier today, some 34 bills, were \npermission bills, authorization bills. I think they were meritorious \nand valuable and very important--for some families in America, more \nimportant than maybe anything else we would consider.\n\n  What kind of issues do they take up? You have heard it here on the \nfloor: Lou Gehrig's disease. Just down the block from where I live in \nSpringfield, a fellow I practiced law with had a son who contracted Lou \nGehrig's disease. He didn't last long. His wife would come to me \nbegging that we do more in medical research so that her son would be \nspared. When it became obvious he couldn't survive, she still pushed \nfor more research, saying no family should ever have to go through this \nagain. Well, we understand that, all of us do--anyone who has had an \nillness in the family--and that is what the bill did. The bill would \nestablish a registry of Lou Gehrig patients around the United States to \ntrack them, to gather information, to try to find out a way to find a \ncure.\n  Now, who is going to object to that bill? Well, it turns out that in \nthe House of Representatives, the bill was passed 411 to 3--\noverwhelmingly passed. It came to the Senate in May of last year, over \na year ago, and was reported by one of our committees, the HELP \nCommittee, on December 4 of last year, and that is when Senator Coburn \nobjected to it and put a hold on the bill. He didn't want it to go \nforward. I think this is a good bill. I don't know who would argue \nagainst it, but one Senator did, so it became the top bill on our list \nof 34.\n  Most people remember Christopher Reeve, who played Superman in the \nmovie and then got involved in an equestrian accident and was paralyzed \nand spent the rest of his life pushing for more research and more work \nto deal with paralysis. Well, there was a bill introduced that pushed \nfor paralysis research and rehab at the National Institutes of Health. \nIt was so overwhelmingly popular that it passed the House with a \nunanimous vote, by voice vote. No one dissented. It came over here, and \nSenator Coburn said: No, I am stopping that bill--a bill that Senator \nCochran of Mississippi and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts offered \ninvolving stroke victims for comprehensive systems to treat these \nstroke victims to save their lives and to save their faculties. It \npassed by a voice vote in the House of Representatives with not a \nsingle dissenting vote. When it came over here, despite support by our \nSenate committee, Senator Coburn objected.\n  The Melanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS Act, this is one I am familiar \nwith. It deals with women suffering from postpartum depression. Sadly, \nmany of these women are not only sad but resort to suicide. This bill \nwas trying to work out a way so that new mothers would have someone to \nspeak to.\n  I met with some of those mothers in my State who have been through \npostpartum depression. It turns out everybody is focusing on the new \nbaby and how beautiful it is, and mom is over there as blue as can be, \nnot going to see another doctor for some time. Well, she will see a \npediatrician with the baby, and we were trying to find a way for \npediatricians to be sensitive to this and try to help deal with \ndepression before it got more serious. That is what the bill is all \nabout. It passed the House 382 to 3 on October 15 of last year. Senator \nCoburn held it up. He said he didn't want this bill to go forward.\n  The Vision Care For Kids Act, this one establishes a State grant for \nthe Centers for Disease Control to help kids be tested to make sure \ntheir vision is good and to help them get glasses if they need it. You \nwould think there is enough there, but there isn't. A lot of kids \nfailing in the classroom just can't see the blackboard or read\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nthe computer in front of them. This is why this is necessary. It passed \nin the House by a voice vote unanimously in October of last year. The \nlead sponsor, incidentally, is a Republican--Senator Bond of Missouri--\nand Senator Coburn held up the bill.\n  The list goes on and on. In the Judiciary Committee, efforts to \nestablish and reauthorize programs for runaway kids; the Emmitt Till \nUnsolved Civil Rights Act to try to bring to justice those who killed \ncivil rights workers so many years ago; an effort for funding mental \nhealth courts to deal with mental illnesses, one of the important \nelements when it comes to crime in this country; the Child Pornography \nProsecution Act--all of those bills, incidentally, passed out of the \ncommittee, which Senator Coburn serves on, and then he held up the bill \nafter it passed out. It is a long list of bills. Drug Endangerment of \nChildren. All of these bills are designed to deal with real-life \nproblems and issues, and Senator Coburn objected to every single one of \nthem. It was his right to do it.\n  So we brought these bills together with many others and said: \nCertainly the Senate, understanding these are bipartisan measures with \nstrong bipartisan support, would want to bring these to the floor and \nvote on them. Senator Coburn could have voted no. If that is what he \nwants to do, it is his right to vote no, but that isn't what he wanted \nto do. He wanted to preclude the opportunity for anyone else to vote on \nthis bill; he put a hold on the bill.\n  We had a test rollcall on this earlier today, and if you followed the \ndebate earlier, you would know that only three Republicans joined us on \nthe Democratic side. We didn't get the 60 votes we needed. This package \nof bills, all the things we mentioned, and many other items, \nunfortunately, are not going to go forward.\n  Now, it is not right that bills that are so important, that have \nstrong bipartisan support, that have been carefully worked on, won't \neven get the chance to pass. I think it is unfortunate. It is \nunfortunate that a number of Republican Senators, even those who \ncosponsor these bills, would not come forward and join us in this \neffort. I don't know that we will have the time to get back to this, \nbut I hope we will at some point. Senator Reid has said, and rightly \nso, we are running out the time. We just can't keep doing this over and \nover.\n  The last point I wish to make is there has been a lot of talk about \nsuffering here. Most of the people who are suffering here are staff who \nhave to weather these storms of oratory on the floor of the Senate. \nSenator Reid brought up that issue because some people are threatening \nwe are going to stay in session all the way through August to deal with \nenergy. Senator Reid made the point that it is no hardship for him, nor \nfor our side of the aisle if that happens, if that is what we end up \ndoing, and that, in fact, there are many others on the other side of \nthe aisle who are anxious to get home for political reasons in a pretty \ntough election year. That was the point he made. He didn't diminish the \nsuffering the American people are feeling all across this country, of \nfamilies who are trying to pay gasoline bills. I hope tomorrow will see \na better day and a more reasonable approach.\n  We have tried repeatedly to bring up an energy bill and offer the \nRepublicans a chance to bring up their amendments, we would bring up \nour amendments, subject them to a 60-vote margin, and let the better \namendment win. They rejected that last week. I hope they will \nreconsider. I hope they will understand, as we do, that it is much more \nimportant for us to take up bills such as the ones that were objected \nto today so that some families across America with genuine concerns can \nhave their concerns addressed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to add to the \nlegitimate complaints my colleague from Illinois, the majority whip, \nraised. Currently, in this country, we spend $29 billion researching \nALS and other motor neurological diseases. The CDC says we don't need \nan additional registry. Their quote:\n\n       The CDC already has the authority to create a registry \n     under the Public Health Service Act--S. 1382 is not necessary \n     to achieve the purpose of the bill. The goal of a registry is \n     to create lists of patients with ALS so that government has \n     records of the incidence and prevalence and researchers have \n     lists to find patients for research.\n       The goals of a registry can be achieved without a registry. \n     The National Institutes of Health already reports on the \n     prevalence of ALS, ``As many as 20,000 Americans have ALS, \n     and an estimated 5,000 people in the United States are \n     diagnosed with the disease each year. . . .''\n\n  Scientific experts think a registry for ALS is a misguided use of \nresources. According to the CDC, ``Putting patients in contact with \nmedical researchers is a worthwhile goal, but a registry is not a means \nto accomplish it.'' There are better ways of putting patients in \ncontact with researchers. For example, a quick search on \nwww.clinicaltrials.gov reveals many ongoing clinical trials related to \nALS and a new recruitment effort called ``ALS Connection.''\n  We increased funding last year for www.clinicaltrials.gov. So it is \nnot about not wanting to help people. The question is, are we going to \nspend $75 million on another bureaucracy for ALS or spend $75 million \nto increase the pure research associated with that disease?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I wish to finish my statement first. But I will play fair \nand yield to the Senator when I am finished. So I will be here.\n  A large amount of resources is associated with the registry. We have \nregistries, but they are not comprehensive. I identify with the \nfamilies and the people who have ALS. I have had patients and some in \nmy family who have had it. The hope is we would find a cure or a \ntreatment to slow the progress of it. If we spend $75 million on a \nregistry, which the CDC and NIH both say we don't need, that is $75 \nmillion we are not going to spend on research.\n  One of the things that didn't come up in the debate today is let's \ntake this $10 billion and get rid of $10 billion worth of waste, and \nincrease NIH from $29 billion to $39 billion a year. It would make a \nbig difference in lots of diseases.\n  Let me talk about the Christopher and Dana Reeve bill. To want to \nhelp people who have suddenly become, or were for a long period of \ntime, a paraplegic or a quadriplegic is a noble cause. According to HHS \nand CBO, the only thing this bill will do that is not already being \ndone--the only thing it will do--is allow us to name some buildings and \nfacilities after Christopher and Dana Reeve. I am not against \nadditional research in those areas. But if we are going to do it, we \nought to get rid of wasteful spending somewhere else. It is the same \nwith ALS. If we are going to spend an additional $75 million, let's \ntake it from some of the waste. I understand the difference in \nagreement I have with my colleague from Illinois in terms of \nauthorization versus appropriations. But it is that very difference in \nagreement that got this country $10 trillion in debt, that helps \naccount for the fact we are going to have the highest deficit in our \nhistory this year.\n  Common sense has to come back to Congress. We cannot keep authorizing \nbills and turn a blind eye to deauthorizing things that aren't working. \nWe use a quaint little argument that it doesn't spend any money. No, it \ndoesn't, until you appropriate it; but if you appropriate it for a new \nbill and you are still appropriating for the old--which we do--all you \nhave done is grown the size of the Federal Government and made it less \nefficient and more imprudent.\n  I believe there is a case to be made that we ought to operate the \nGovernment finances the way families operate theirs. We ought to have \nto make hard choices. I know from the 109th Congress that this body \ndoesn't like to do oversight. It doesn't like it. We don't like to do \nthe job of making sure the money is spent well, that it has metrics on \nit. By the way, neither of these two bills has any metrics on it to\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\nmeasure whether they are successful or accomplish anything. There is no \nway for us to know that we have made an actual improvement for the \npeople under these two disease categories.\n  I think it is fair game for us to talk truthfully and very clearly \nabout what the differences are, in terms of what the Senator from \nIllinois said. It is not about not wanting to help people; it is about \nwanting to help more people. Do you know what. We can do more research \non ALS and more to help paraplegic and quadriplegic people, and more to \nhelp our kids and grandkids. The way we can do that is being very wise \nand frugal with the money that comes to Washington. Quite frankly, we \nare not doing that. So the debate isn't about setting up somebody who \nis injured and should have our care and attention. The debate isn't \nthat somebody doesn't care or does care. The debate is how best to \nsolve the problem: the status quo in Washington that doesn't solve the \nproblem, continuing to do what we have always done--authorizing new \nspending and never getting rid of the old, never looking at it or \nfixing it.\n\n  I also put forward one other argument: If authorizations don't matter \nin terms of spending, then there should be no objections to my offering \na deauthorization to other programs that don't matter. If \nauthorizations don't matter, then if I deauthorize something else, that \nwon't matter either.\n  So we have this wonderfully circular argument that says spending is \nonly spending when we spend it, but if you want to decrease spending in \nan authorization bill by offsetting other authorizations, that is \nspending and you are cutting. You cannot have it both ways. It is about \nhow do we live within our means? How do we, in fact, guarantee these \ngreat opportunities--and we still haven't spotted all the problems in \nfront of us as a nation--how do we guarantee that they go on to the \nnext couple of generations?\n  This isn't about paralyzed people or ALS; it is about changing the \nculture of the Senate and the Congress to start meeting the \nexpectations of the American people. The expectations are that we will \nstart thinking long term and start thinking about their kids. We need \nto get rid of the waste and be much more efficient in the programs we \nhave. To do less than that is dishonest with those very people who we \nsay we care about in this bill.\n  This bill is a $5 million museum in Poland. How many people in \nAmerica think today, with a $600 billion deficit, and them struggling \nto buy gasoline and food, and milk at $4 a gallon--the same price as \ngas--that we ought to spend $5 million across the seas? I agree there \nis a good argument about our foreign policy in terms of our involvement \nwith Iraq. That is fair game--building museums, forgiving debt, sending \nanother $24 million to the U.N., which won't tell us a penny of \nanything they spent, or where they spend it, because we cannot see it, \nand we are already spending $5.6 billion there a year.\n  This is a real debate. I hope the debate stays at the level that \ndoesn't accuse anybody of not supporting what is in the best interests \nof every American. The question is, how do we do that? What we have \nheard on the floor today is that if you voted against this bill, you \ndon't care about women with depression. I have delivered 4,000 babies. \nI have treated postpartum depression. The flippant way we talk about \nthat--this is a serious disease that is being treated. There are \nmultiple programs out there.\n  I will also make a final point, and then I will yield to my friend \nfrom Illinois. Under the Health, Education, Labor, Pension parts in \nthis bill, on only two out of six bills I had a hold on. There was the \nMelanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS Act. I didn't have a hold. It has never \nbeen offered. The Vision Care For Kids Act; I didn't have a hold on \nthat. It has never been offered. On prenatal and postnatally diagnosed \nconditions, I am a sponsor of that. The Stroke Treatment and Ongoing \nPrevention Act, I never held that bill, not once. Under the judiciary \nbills, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment Crime Reduction Act, I never \nheld it. The Drug Endangered Kids Act, I never held it. The Effective \nChild Pornography Prosecution Act, I never held it. Enhancing Effective \nProsecution of Child Pornography Act, I never held it, not once. \nNational Sea Grant College Program Amendments I never held. Federal \nOcean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act, I never held it.\n  So what is it about wanting to work to meet the needs of everybody \nhaving input? The question is, can we do things better or do we have to \nkeep doing them the old way? Does it have to be that if you read the \nbill and if you have concerns, do you let them go and say it doesn't \nmatter? That is how we got into the energy crisis we are in, and the \nhousing crisis.\n  I don't believe we can let things go anymore. We have to look at \nthem, and if we think they ought to be fixed, we ought to have the \ncourage to say they ought to be fixed or paid for.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I apologize publicly on the record if I \nsaid at some point that Senator Coburn was holding a bill that he \nwasn't. I certainly don't question his statements in the Record about \nwhich bills he held. I will tell you that there is a small group--and \nhe is the most visible member of that group on his side--that is now in \nthe practice of routinely holding routine bills. If he is not the \nreason why some of these were held, I hope the Record will be clear. \nBut it won't, because they are secret holds--except for you, and I \nacknowledge that you are very open when you hold a bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. If the Senator will yield for a second.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I write a letter the day I hold it to the committee and \nthe majority leader and minority leader and the sponsors. They know \nwhat I am holding. I will make one point to you. Most of the bills we \nhold at first are held so we can read them. It is a strange thing. We \nought to read the bills before we say let them go.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I acknowledge that. As I tried to make clear, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma does this differently and more honorably than some. Some \nsneak around and don't want people to know. I have the same attitude. \nIf I am going to put on a hold, I want them to know why. Maybe they \nwill change or withdraw a nomination. But it is very open and clear. I \ntry to do it that way.\n  Having said that, let me say, if you object to the Lou Gehrig \nregistry, it passed through the committee you serve on, it was reported \nto calendar in December of last year with an amendment. It must have \nbeen debated in committee to some extent. You had a chance then to \namend it, to vote against it, and from what I hear you say on the floor \ntoday, you would vote against it today. That should be your right. I \nwould defend your right to do that.\n  But I think it reaches a different level where you say I don't have a \nright to vote for it if you are opposed to it, and that you are going \nto put a hold on it and won't let the measure come to the floor for a \nvote.\n  If the measure came to the floor for a vote and the Senator from \nOklahoma had spoken against it and voted against, he would have done \nthe right thing. But to deny me a chance to vote for this bill, I think \nthat goes too far. I do.\n  Whether we go through one or the other, I can discuss each one the \nSenator brought up, but that is the underlying issue. Should I have the \nright to deny him even a chance to vote on this bill? That is the \nposition he has taken on some of these bills. That, to me, is \ntroubling.\n  I will say in terms of fiscal sanity, I do wish to make a statement \nfor the Record. The current administration inherited a surplus. The \ncurrent administration inherited a budget surplus. It was the first \ntime in 30 years that the Federal Government had a surplus.\n  Bill Clinton, for whatever his faults might have been, put America's \neconomic house in order. We started generating a surplus in the Federal \nTreasury. Why? Some taxes were raised, some spending was cut, but it \nwas done in such a way that it worked. The economy grew dramatically. \nJobs, new businesses, housing grew dramatically, and we reduced the \ndeficit of this country by generating a surplus.\n  This President inherited that situation and brought to it his own \nGeorge W. Bush economic philosophy. I would\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nnot attribute it to the Senator from Oklahoma unless he wants to say \nthat was his philosophy, too, but it was a philosophy that, best said, \nthe best way to give this economy more is to give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in this country, cut taxes for the wealthiest people \nand a thousand flowers will flourish.\n  Unfortunately, September 11, 2001, occurred. We found ourselves \nspending a lot of money for the security of this Nation and then found \nourselves in two wars. This President continued to call for tax cuts in \nthe midst of a war. He became unique in American history. No President \nhas ever done that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, the fiscal conservative that he is, must \nacknowledge it is mindless to have tax breaks in the midst of a war. \nYou know the war is an add-on cost to your overall economy and budget, \nand then to cut revenue--that is what he did. As a result of that \naction by the President and his decision to initiate a war in Iraq that \nhas gone unpaid for now into its sixth year, we have now piled up the \nbiggest deficit in the history of the United States of America.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is vigilant on bills that come that may \ncost us money in the future, but his party and his President have led \nus into the deepest deficit in our history. Having inherited a surplus, \nPresident Bush drove us into a fiscal mess, where we are borrowing \nmoney from all over the world. The last thing I will say is this, and I \nknow the Senator from Oklahoma is never going to agree with me, but I \nwant to make a point. If every one of these 34 measures that he and his \nside objected to today had passed, it would not add a penny to the \ndeficit tomorrow, not a penny, and not next year either. We have to \npass the spending bill. These bills give permission for a museum. These \nbills don't spend a penny for a museum, not one.\n  I am on the Appropriations Committee. We sit there, and they give us \na finite pot of money and say: Take your pick. You want some new \nprograms? Go ahead, fund them, but you cannot fund the old programs if \nyou fund the new ones. You have a finite pot of money. Make your \nchoices.\n  That is what happens in appropriations and on the floor of the \nSenate. That is a point which the Senator and I have debated repeatedly \nand probably will never resolve between us. But we have a genuine \ndifference of opinion, and the only thing I have supporting me is a \nstatement in the Record from the Office of Management and Budget saying \nI am right, he is wrong. Don't take it personally, but it was put in \nthe Record.\n  I say to the Senator, I don't think it was right what happened today, \nthat we stopped consideration of 34 bills. If he wanted to have his \nrecorded vote as no on any one of those bills, it was his right to do \nit. But to stop me from trying to promote treatment of people with Lou \nGehrig's disease and paralysis, because I think these are good bills, I \ndo not think that is appropriate.\n  Today, we tried to get the Senate to rule the other way, and they did \nnot. The Senator's side prevailed. But only three Republicans would \njoin us, and now these bills are not likely to be passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I thank \nhim for his debating skills and his heartfelt positions.\n  I guess the first thing I would say is the Appropriations Committee \nspends $875 billion every year that is not authorized. The Senator from \nIllinois knows that.\n  The second thing I would say is there is no ability to amend any of \nthese bills in the appropriations process, unless you are on the \nAppropriations Committee. So if you are not on the subcommittee, you \ncan't amend it. If you are not on the main committee, you can't amend \nit.\n  Last year, we couldn't amend anything because the omnibus bill came \nto the floor without any ability to amend it. So we haven't had any \nopportunity to amend it. It is whatever the appropriators say goes. \nThere is no amendment with that.\n  I am not going to get into the debate. I am as disgusted with \nRepublican spending priorities as the Senator from Illinois is. I will \ncorrect the record on real accounting principles. We had 1 year, and 1 \nyear only, of a true surplus, 1999. The rest of the years we didn't \nhave a surplus, if you count what we borrowed from Social Security.\n  I would not defend any of the spending of this President or this \nCongress, but I will make it known the President cannot spend the first \npenny until Congress passes the bills. I note that over the last 18 \nmonths, his party has not been in charge. A different party has been in \ncharge. The bills that have gone to him have been controlled by the \nmajority party.\n  Look, both of us admit that our children are in tall weeds right now \nif we don't start doing something about our fiscal situation.\n  The final point I will make is most of these bills would take less \nthan an hour. Every one of them I have communicated on and I am happy \nto see on the floor. Give me the right to offer one significant \namendment and one amendment for every billion dollars. I will debate it \nfor 15 minutes, have two votes, and we will be done with the bills.\n  Nobody is withholding anybody's right to vote for a bill. The \nmajority leader can put any bill he wants on the floor at any time, \nwith my agreement to never try to dilatate, never try to spread it out, \nto only bring pertinent amendments that are germane and do that in a \nvery short period of time. He knows that. The Senator from Illinois has \nknown that. That has been the way I work. I don't play the games of \npolitical position to spin something.\n  My hope is--and I have a great relationship with the Senator from \nIllinois. I value his friendship. He is not ``just my friend,'' he is a \nfriend. It is not the collegial statement of the body, it is Dick \nDurbin is my friend. My hope is that when Dick Durbin and I can pass \nthree significant bills out of our subcommittee that make a real \ndifference in the world of human rights, that if we can do that, then \ncertainly the Senate can come together on energy and all these other \nbills. My hope is we will do that.\n  I do not want to delay our staff or the Presiding Officer any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7564-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

FARRI\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to commend Mr. Vincent P. Farri on \nhis promotion to Lieutenant with the United States Capitol Police. Mr. \nFarri, a native of Maryland, joined the Capitol Police on January 31, \n1989. After initial training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter he worked with the Capitol Division Building Patrol, and \nperformed general duties until 1993. In 1993, Mr. Farri was assigned to \nthe uniform protective detail for the President pro tempore of the \nSenate. I came to know Mr. Farri during this time and observed that on \na daily basis he executed his duties in a highly professional, diligent \nand courteous manner.\n  In 1998, Mr. Farri served as a senior patrol officer in the Capitol \nBuilding, and occasionally worked as an acting sergeant, making rounds \nand supporting officers at their posts. While performing in this \ncapacity, Vincent Farri distinguished himself on July 24, 1998. On that \nfateful day, an armed assailant entered the Capitol and suddenly took \nthe lives of two Capitol Policemen. Officer Farri, hearing shots from \nthe floor above, immediately ran to the scene where he came upon the \nfallen officers, and assisted in apprehending the gunman. All those who \nwork in and visit the Capitol owe deep gratitude to the police men and \nwomen who serve and protect us, and we are especially grateful for the \nservice rendered by Vincent and the sacrifice of his fellow officers on \nthat day.\n  In September, 1998, Mr. Farri was promoted to the rank of Sergeant \nand worked with the First Responder Unit of the Capitol Division for \napproximately 10 years. His collateral duties\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nincluded training junior officers and serving with the Capitol Police \nAlert Team. In connection with his promotion to Lieutenant, Mr. Farri \nhas been assigned to the Capitol Police Command Center. In this \nposition, he provides guidance to officers in the field and serves as a \nliaison between the offices of the Chief of the Capitol Police and the \nSergeants at Arms of the House and the Senate.\n  In 1946, during a lecture at the University of Chicago, Senator J. \nWilliam Fulbright stated, ``The legislator is an indispensable guardian \nof our freedom.'' I believe all Senators will agree that the U.S. \nCapitol Police are indispensable guardians of all who serve in and work \nfor the United States Congress. Mr. Farri's 19 years of service have \nbeen an important part of that protection. I sincerely congratulate \nLieutenant Vincent Farri on his promotion and assignment, and further \nextend my congratulations and warm wishes to Christina, his wife of 15 \nyears, his two sons, Richard, age 11, and Paul, age 7, as well as to \nall of Vincent's family, including his dear mother, Mrs. Dorothy Farri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7565-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS CATHEDRAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral in Reno.\n  Construction on Saint Thomas Aquinas began in 1906, after Reno's sole \nCatholic church was destroyed by fire. Father Thomas Tubman led the \neffort to build a new church for Reno Catholics. He planned to \nconstruct a larger, more centrally located church, explaining that \n``The time has come for making the structures in Reno attractive as \nwell as useful. The Cathedral will be one of the finest buildings in \nthe State.''\n  On June 21, 1908, Saint Thomas Aquinas opened its doors to \nparishioners with a remarkable dedication ceremony. Over 3,000 people \nwaited outside the new church long before the ceremony was set to \nbegin. At 10:30, dozens of priests and bishops, 120 Knights of \nColumbus, 2 bands and hundreds of parishioners were led by the chief of \npolice and 16 patrolmen in a march from the convent of the Sisters of \nMary to Saint Thomas Aquinas Church. Upon arriving, the Knights of \nColumbus encircled the new church as Bishop Grace blessed the buildings \nexterior. A high mass was then celebrated with the church filled to \ncapacity. About one hundred worshipers were unable to enter, and \ninstead waited outside the building, listening to the beautiful music \nfrom the choir and organist.\n  To celebrate its centennial anniversary, Reno Catholics reenacted \nthis special ceremony last month. They joined in procession once again \nand marched together to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral, where a \ncelebratory mass was held. As they marched, they rejoiced in 100 years \nof memories at their place of worship.\n  Today, Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral prominently stands in the heart \nof downtown Reno and will forever remain in the hearts of Catholics who \nhave worshiped here in the last 100 years. I am pleased to honor Saint \nThomas Aquinas Cathedral today. I know that it will continue to serve \nNevadans as an outstanding religious institution for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7565-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING ELIZABETH ANN ``BETSY'' RIEKE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Betsy Rieke, a \nwoman who has served my State and the West for nearly three decades. \nLike many of us in this body, Ms. Rieke is an attorney. Her specialty \nhas been water issues, and, as many of my colleagues know well, being a \nwater lawyer in the West is not a job for the faint of heart.\n  Ms. Rieke's experience in water law began in Arizona, where she \nserved as Chief Legal Counsel and Director for the Department of Water \nResources under former Gov. Bruce Babbit. Ms. Rieke then served as an \nAssistant Secretary of the Interior for Water and Science in the \nClinton administration. During her tenure, she helped negotiate the \n1994 CALFED Bay-Delta Accord in California. This landmark agreement \nbrought together numerous Federal, State, and local agencies and \nenvironmental enthusiasts to resolve a looming environmental and \neconomic crisis. Honored several times for her important role in \nsecuring this accord, she did so in her trademark fashion--by bringing \npeople together, leading difficult discussions, and helping parties \nfind solutions to meet the community's diverse interests and goals.\n  In 1998, Ms. Rieke brought her expertise to Northern Nevada where she \nserves as the area manager for the Lahontan Area Office of the Bureau \nof Reclamation. In such an arid place, she's been responsible for \nirrigation, wetland restoration, wildlife protection, and maintaining \ndrinking water for one of the fastest growing regions in the country. \nLike she did in Arizona and California, Ms. Rieke showed great \nleadership as she brought many Federal, State, municipal, tribal, \npublic and private interests together to reach the historic Truckee \nRiver Operating Agreement to be signed next month--an issue close to me \nand important to many Nevadans.\n  I also appreciate her work with others to preserve and restore \nNevada's desert terminal lakes, their wildlife, and habitats. She has \nfostered relationships and cobbled together agreements that have \nimproved Pyramid Lake, and she has advised me on ways to restore Walker \nLake. While many people have been working very hard, for many years, to \nrestore Nevada's unique natural resources, Ms. Rieke's determination, \nfocus, and tireless efforts provided leadership for these efforts.\n  I extend my most sincere gratitude to Betsy. Nevadans are certainly \nfortunate to have had such a talented, skilled, and committed \nindividual working on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7565-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to mark the anniversary of a great \ntradition, one that ties my home State of Illinois with the nation of \nGreece. The Special Olympics, which brings people with intellectual \ndisabilities together for athletic competition, began 40 years ago this \nmonth.\n  In fact, the first Special Olympics were held on Soldier Field in \nChicago. It all started when a young woman named Anne McGlone had an \nidea. She was a physical education instructor at West Pullman park on \nthe southeast side. The Chicago Park district came to her to ask if she \nhad any ideas to help kids with special needs.\n  Anne McGlone ran with it. She asked the Kennedy Foundation for a one-\ntime donation of $25,000 to put on the first Special Olympics. On July \n20, 1968, about 1,000 athletes from 26 American States, and Canada, got \ntogether and ran, swam and played hockey.\n  Anne McGlone, now Anne Burke, went on to law school. She is now on \nthe supreme court of the State of Illinois. But she kept working on the \nSpecial Olympics along the way.\n  With the continued support of Eunice and Sargent Shriver and the \nKennedy foundation, the Special Olympics grew. Today, the Special \nOlympics is a huge international movement that has brought together \nmillions of people with intellectual disabilities in 175 countries \naround the world. I congratulate the Special Olympics for 40 years of \nempowering people with intellectual disabilities.\n  Last summer, the Special Olympics summer games were held in Shanghai, \nChina. Next time around, in 2011, they will be held in Athens, Greece. \nIt is fitting for Greece, with its proud Olympic tradition, to host the \nSpecial Olympics, and I wish the Greek Government every success as it \nprepares to host the games.\n  Closer to home, the next Special Olympics winter games will be held \nin 2009 in Boise, ID. And even closer to home, just as Chicago hopes to \nhost the next Olympic games in 2016, I hope that one day the Special \nOlympics will come back to Chicago, where it started 40 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7565-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7565-S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANK VAN BUER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a selfless \npublic servant from my great State of Illinois, Mayor Frank Van Buer, \nof DeKalb, who passed away July 23, 2008, after a battle with \npancreatic cancer.\n  Mayor Van Buer was born in Savanna, IL, on the banks of the \nMississippi River. While in high school, Frank worked as a union \nlaborer and\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\ntruck driver. He joined the U.S. Air Force and spent 4 years in Germany \nand Libya. When he returned to the United States in 1957, Van Buer \nmoved to DeKalb to attend Northern Illinois University, NIU. He earned \na B.S. in social science in 1960 and completed a master's degree in \neconomics in 1964. In 1968, Mayor Van Buer earned a Ph.D. in economics \nfrom the University of Illinois. He was tenured on the faculty of the \nDepartment of Economics at NIU in 1970, and taught there until 1995.\n  While on the NIU faculty, Mayor Van Buer gave generously of his \nskills in administration and budgeting. He directed NIU's Office of \nBudget and Planning, responsible for the administration of annual \noperating budgets in excess of $100 million. And he traveled around the \nworld, working in developing nations in Africa and Asia to provide \ntechnical assistance in planning and budgeting.\n  Mayor Van Buer was a man of integrity who strongly believed in open \ngovernment. Mayor Van Buer was first elected by his community to the \nDeKalb County Board in 2002, and he was re-elected in 2004. He was \nelected mayor of DeKalb in 2005. During his tenure as mayor, he made it \na priority to revitalize DeKalb's urban core.\n  In addition to his service at NIU and with the city of DeKalb, Mayor \nVan Buer was active in leadership with the Ben Gordon Mental Health \nCenter and the Kishwaukee Symphony Orchestra.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the mayor's family and friends, \nespecially his wife of over 50 years, Mary Beth, their three children, \nand five grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7566-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I am aware of and sympathize with families \nand individuals in Utah and around the country who, through no willful \nneglect or bad intentions of their own, are in very difficult \ncircumstances as a result of turbulence in the housing market. Others \nin the housing industry who have also acted with prudence and good \nfaith have also been caught up in the difficulty. We have had many \nvotes on housing legislation over the past several months, and I have \nsupported measures that I thought would help improve the current \nsituation.\n  I also understand that housing is a significant sector that affects \nthe broader economy. A stable housing market would go a long way to \ninstilling confidence. My expectation is that the housing sector will \nstabilize and I hope that it does so with as little exposure as \npossible to taxpayers.\n  Our last vote on the substance of the Foreclosure Prevention Act took \nplace on July 11. The bill then went to the House of Representatives, \nand the House made a few changes and one major addition to the bill. It \nadded what some have called a bailout for the government sponsored \nenterprises, GSEs.\n  Before the addition of the GSE provisions, we had a comprehensive \nbill that was the product of lengthy, bipartisan negotiations. It had \nprovisions aimed at correcting some of the current problems, avoiding \nfuture problems, and providing incentive for positive activity in the \nhousing market. Given the bipartisan nature of the bill, it contained \nmany provisions that I support, including tax deductions and \nincentives.\n  However, this last addition to the housing bill, which we voted on \nfor the first time today, combined with my other reservations, was more \nthan I was willing to support. The CBO estimates that there is ``a \ngreater than 50 percent chance that the government would provide no \nfinancial assistance to the GSEs over the next 17 months.'' I hope the \nchances are greater than that, but this section of the bill accounts \nfor well over half the cost of the bill. It has the potential, perhaps \nslight, of costing well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  To touch on a couple other points of concern, this bill will delay \nthe allocation of worldwide interest expensing rules that I championed \nin 2004. The delay was included to ``pay'' for other provisions of the \nbill. I am not sure that the tradeoff is static, and the same can be \nsaid of so many other efforts to offset spending by delaying or \nsuspending tax incentives.\n  Finally, this bill will help some people who deserve it, but it will \nlikely also help many irresponsible lenders, brokers, borrowers that do \nnot. The bill now appears to be headed to the President, and he appears \nto be ready to sign the bill, in spite of his own reservations.\n  The housing market will recover. Again, I hope that it does so sooner \nthan later and at the least cost possible to taxpayers. I expect that \nwe will come away from the current situation better able to avoid \nsimilar problems in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7566-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate has voted on a motion to proceed \nto a vote on S. 3186, a bill to provide funding for the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. I have a long history of \nsupporting the LIHEAP program and have voted for almost every increase \nin the program that has been proposed in Congress.\n  This vote was different. It was not a vote about making sure our low \nincome citizens have the heating and cooling assistance they need \nbecause they already do under the existing program. There is $100 \nmillion still left in the program, and most of that money was for \nheating last winter. So what's the emergency here? On top of the \nexisting surplus in the program, the program will also be fully funded \nfor the coming winter when we pass a continuing resolution which will \nkeep all the government programs running at the level they were funded \nlast year. So let's not pretend that LIHEAP is not in place or that it \nwon't be funded for the coming year.\n  Each year the Congress appropriates the Government funding needs \nthrough 13 appropriations bills. Each bill is handled by separate \nsubcommittees of the full Senate Committee on Appropriations. I applaud \nthe Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees, because they have \ndone a good job of preparing and marking up their various \nappropriations bills.\n  But there's just one problem. Our majority leader has announced that \nwe will not be passing any of those bills this year, and instead will \nbe passing the continuing resolution I just referred to. Why this \nannouncement? Why can't we pass any appropriations bills this year? \nWell, I can tell you Mr. President that the Republicans have many \namendments prepared for those bills that would allow our Nation to \nproduce more domestic oil, but the anti-oil extremists calling the \nshots in the Democrat Party cannot allow votes on finding more oil \nbecause they know such votes would succeed.\n  Unfortunately for the Democrat Party, the poor are beginning to wake \nup that the liberals they have always looked to are behind the war on \nthe poor. By war on the poor I refer to the movement by the anti-oil \nextremists to close off every good domestic oil resource, which is a \ndirect cause of the high energy prices Americans face.\n  Democrats in Congress have been forced to choose between the very \nwell funded extreme anti-oil interests and the poor because on energy \nprices there is no compromise between the two. The Democrats have begun \nto recognize the position they are in, and were trying to have it both \nways with this vote.\n  Let's be honest about why the Senate brought up this amendment. It is \nbecause the Democrats are trying to please the anti-oil extremists by \nnot allowing any votes on oil drilling or on appropriations bills. At \nthe same time the Democrats must pretend that they haven't really sold \nout the poor by their policies that force high gas prices.\n  I am not inclined to play their political game and support their \neffort to shift the debate away from unlocking our nation's energy \npotential. And I particularly was not inclined to support this vote, \nbecause the proposal busted the budget without providing any additional \nbenefit to LIHEAP.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7567-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n                           NAZI WAR CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Dr. Ephraim Zuroff \nand the Simon Wiesenthal Center for their efforts to track down the \nlast Nazi war criminals from World War II. Their work is enormously \nimportant, both in bringing the guilty to justice and preventing future \nacts of genocide. The statute of limitations does not--must not--expire \non crimes against humanity. Earlier this year, I introduced the World \nWar II War Crimes Accountability Act with Sen. Nelson, which I hope \nwill help Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in their noble \neffort.\n  The barbarity of those crimes still echoes today, more than 63 years \nafter the end of the war. June 28 of this year, for example, marked the \n94th birthday of Dr. Aribert Heim, the second-most wanted Nazi war \ncriminal still believed to be at large. Dr. Heim, a former SS \nconcentration camp doctor, was nicknamed ``Dr. Death'' for his brutal \nand sadistic experiments on camp inmates. At Mauthausen, the camp where \nhe committed his worst crimes, Dr. Heim was known for murdering inmates \nby injecting toxins directly into their hearts.\n  Unfortunately, despite the particularly heinous nature of Dr. Heim's \ncrimes, investigators into Heim's whereabouts can still face official \nobstructionism. Germany, for example, is one of the few countries that \nstill have an active Nazi-hunting unit. However, this team's efforts \nhave been impeded by the repeated refusals of the presiding German \njudge to allow the police task force sufficient investigative latitude. \nSuch procedures, like wiretaps on suspected Heim associates, are \ngranted in murder cases in Germany--just not, apparently, in mass-\nmurder cases like Dr. Heim. This is this not the only instance of \nGerman bureaucratic obstructionism, which have been carefully monitored \nby the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Correspondingly, in the center's 2007 \nAnnual Report on Worldwide Investigation and Prosecution of Nazi War \nCriminals, Germany received a failing grade--its only failing grade \nsince the report was first published in 2001. The German government \nshould do its utmost to reverse this pattern before it becomes a trend.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation: Last Chance in 2002, \nto identify and assist in the prosecution of the remaining Nazi war \ncriminals still at large. Dr. Zuroff, who has been leading this effort, \nshould be highly commended for his outstanding efforts in bringing the \nmost guilty Nazis to justice.\n  Even today, the crimes of Heim and the Nazi regime strain our \nunderstanding of hate. Hitler's Germany today is remembered only for \nits brutality, its mantra of genocide, and its culture of racism. And \nthose last Nazis, who are waiting out their last days under the coming \ntwilight, must not be allowed to go quietly into the night, as did too \nmany of their victims. For the souls that were lost, and even more for \nthose that remain, there must be justice. I commend Dr. Zuroff and the \nSimon Wiesenthal Center in the highest possible terms, and urge the \nUnited States Government to do all it can to help them in their cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7567-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  MR. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor on \nmany occasions to highlight a separate violent, hate-motivated crime \nthat has occurred in our country.\n  In the early morning of July 13, 2008, three gay men were dining at a \nlate-night pizza restaurant in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of \nWashington, DC, when they were verbally assaulted by five men. The two \ngroups allegedly exchanged heated words at the restaurant before the \nthree gay men left and began to walk home, But the five men followed \nthem in pursuit. According to the police report, the assailants \ncontinued to hurl anti-gay epithets and later physically attacked the \nthree men, hospitalizing two of them. Police have not yet apprehended \nthe suspects, but the investigation continues. Advisory neighborhood \ncommissioner Jack Jacobsen, a friend of one of the victims, says the \nthree men were shaken by the incident and have decided not to disclose \ntheir identities to news sources.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7567-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING RAIDER 21 CREW MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I stand to recognize the six Air \nForce B-52 crew members of Raider 21 who made the ultimate sacrifice in \nservice to their country. I would like take a few moments to honor \ntheir courage and heroism.\n  The crew was based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana and was \ndeployed to Guam with the 20th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron as part of \nthe U.S. military's continuous bomber presence mission in the Pacific. \nThe unarmed bomber crashed Monday, July 21, during a swing around the \nisland as part of Guam Liberation Day celebrations, marking the day \nwhen the U.S. military arrived to retake control of the island from \nJapan during World War II. The B-52 had been scheduled to conduct a \nflyover in a parade. The six crew members assigned to the 2nd Bomb Wing \nincluded MAJ Christopher M. Cooper, 33, aircraft commander; MAJ Brent \nD. Williams, 37, navigator; CPT Michael K. Dodson, 31, copilot; 1LT. \nJoshua D. Shepherd, 25, navigator; 1LT. Robert D. Gerren, 32, \nelectronic warfare officer; and COL George Martin, 51, flight surgeon, \nwho also was the deputy commander of 36th Medical Group at Anderson Air \nForce Base.\n  B-52s have been the backbone of the U.S. military's manned strategic \nbomber force for more than four decades, used for missions from attacks \nto ocean surveillance. They are capable of dropping or launching the \nwidest array of weapons in the U.S. inventory, including cluster bombs \nand precision guided missiles. B-52s were first placed into service in \n1955, and 93 remain in the Air Force's fleet. The Air Force has been \nrotating B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers through Guam since 2004 to boost the \nU.S. security presence in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Search operations continue in the Pacific Ocean sadly, they are \nprimarily for the recovery of debris that may aid in the investigation \nof the crash. The 8th Air Force Museum in Shreveport, LA, has created a \nmemorial to the crew members that will be at the museum for 30 days. \nThose wishing to express condolences and pay tribute to the crew are \nwelcome to sign a remembrance book. The book will be shared with the \nfamilies and eventually presented to the 20th Bomb Squadron. In \naddition to the book, the memorial consists of framed photographs of \neach of the crew members, six pairs of flight boots and six flight \nhelmets as well as other items from the 2nd Bomb Wing.\n  There is no doubt July 21 was a tragic day, not only for the families \nof the fallen crew members but for the B-52 family, the community, and \nthis Nation. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families \nof these airmen and our hearts grieve for their loss.\n  Thus, today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these great \nAmericans and thanking them for their devotion and service to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7567-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7567-S7568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JIM MAGAGNA\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \naccomplishments of Jim Magagna, 2008 inductee into the Wyoming \nAgricultural Hall of Fame.\n  Jim Magagna has spent much of his life fighting for Wyoming \nagriculture interests at the local, regional and national level. A \nthird generation sheep rancher from southwest Wyoming, Jim is the \npresident and manager of Magagna Bros, Inc.\n  Jim has a long history of service to Wyoming's ranchers and farmers. \nHe has served as president for agricultural groups including the \nWyoming Wool Growers Association and the National\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nPublic Lands Council. He now serves as the executive vice president of \nthe 135-year-old Wyoming Stock Growers Association.\n  One of many noteworthy efforts, Jim directed the implementation of \nthe Wyoming Stock Growers Agricultural Land Trust. The trust provides \nfarmers and ranchers with conservation opportunities to remain \nproductive and independent. Jim's dedication to the interests of \nWyoming agriculture has created a legacy that will serve Wyoming well \nfor decades to come.\n  It gives me great pleasure to honor Jim Magagna, a true Wyoming \ncowboy.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a widow with a disabled child. Our family lives on \n     social security payments and what I make as a substitute \n     teacher. My son's condition requires frequent trips to the \n     doctor both in Idaho Falls and to Salt Lake City. The rising \n     cost of gas has significantly impacted our ability to travel.\n       The cost of electricity is another issue that affects us \n     each month. As electricity costs rise our discretionary \n     income, already limited, becomes less.\n       These problems, in combination with the rising cost of \n     other services dependent on transportation, have put our \n     family in an increasingly desperate situation. The future \n     does not look good from where we sit!\n     Kary.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are 70 years old and active seniors on a fixed income. \n     Energy costs are becoming a burden for us and we will begin \n     to go into our reserves for future years. Gas prices are \n     obviously a problem but the cost of groceries is also a big \n     item. We have one car and my husband rides a bicycle as much \n     as possible. I walk to places when destinations are close \n     enough. We are concerned about being good stewards of our \n     environment and do what we can, e.g., recycling, using less \n     gas, using fans instead of an air conditioner when practical, \n     raising some of our own food, planting trees on our property, \n     and conserving water.\n       We are disgusted that we are the victims of bogus global \n     warming fanatics, environmentalists, and opportunists. \n     Ethanol, which has not been proven to be efficient or good \n     for engines, is using up corn that was used for food and \n     livestock feed thus raising food costs.\n       There are reserves in our own soil that could be used. \n     Other countries are drilling off our shores so why can't we \n     drill since this would not create any more risk than is \n     already present? Nuclear energy is a good, clean option and \n     there are some plants already built but not in use.\n     Allen and Jane, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       What is there to say? Energy costs simply make it harder to \n     get by. There is less money for the extra things we enjoy \n     doing and with a new baby on the way there will be less money \n     to set aside to take care of him. As a student of economics, \n     I realize there are many factors that are contributing to the \n     increase gas prices. The recent reckless policies of the \n     Federal Reserve have caused incredible inflation and a \n     weakening dollar. There needs to be more competition in the \n     energy sector, massive deregulation as well as ending \n     government subsidies for the alternative energy sources the \n     government, not scientists or businesses, deem best--[these \n     are] drawing resources away from other potential alternate \n     energy sources.\n       Expanding domestic oil production and other clean energy \n     sources like nuclear power would also help, as increased \n     competition helps drive down prices.\n     Verl.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for allowing me to share a few of my views on the \n     current energy and fuel challenges facing the United States \n     and the entire world population, and how my family is coping.\n       First, and most importantly, the solution cannot be found \n     in building more nuclear plants. Nuclear facilities that use \n     old technology, construction methods, placed in areas of \n     social or natural upheaval, and that generate radioactive \n     refuse that cannot be safely managed, must never be \n     considered. The recent earthquakes world-wide, coupled with \n     terrorist use of ``dirty'' bombs are two very real \n     considerations when contemplating nuclear energy.\n       However, I would consider the research and development of \n     Thorium nuclear energy (creates and uses all of its \n     radioactive byproduct).\n       Second, and equally important, should be the emphasis on \n     solar for almost every power/energy application. There should \n     be a requirement that all new construction utilize solar \n     heating and cooling, hot-water tanks; southern facing \n     buildings and homes; and the retro-fitting of homes for the \n     elderly and low-income with solar energy products should be \n     part all social service projects. Automobiles should \n     certainly be manufactured utilizing some form of solar power.\n       Third, conservation. Conservation can take many avenues \n     from lowering the speed limit to 55 mph again, to cutting \n     back to the shorter work week and longer work day (schools \n     can also be conducted on a four day basis saving heating/\n     cooling, electricity, busing, commuting, etc.) After reading \n     about the impact rising fuel costs are having on the U.S. \n     Postal Service, perhaps it is time to curtail Saturday mail \n     delivery to homes and businesses. Special delivery on a \n     Saturday can be done, for an additional fee, by such \n     companies as UPS or Fed-Ex.\n       My husband and I are baby-boomers and will soon be feeling \n     the reality of a fixed income. He is retired and on Social \n     Security (just received his Medicare card), and I am working \n     for the school district (low wage as a paraprofessional \n     working with Title I reading students). Rising prices at the \n     grocery stores are certainly having an effect on our ability \n     to eat healthy foods, and the rising cost of our co-pay for \n     drugs and medical services is outrageous. We have just \n     refurbished our old bicycles (one is a 1965 Schwinn) as a way \n     to get around and exercise too. We practice the wise counsel \n     of our parents for living simply, and we continue to keep \n     informed/educated in matters of material and spiritual \n     importance.\n       ``Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live \n     in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and \n     requirements.''--The Tabernacle of Unity, by Baha'u'llah.\n       Thank you for your time.\n     Carol, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is lovely to be hearing your solicitation for stories \n     regarding our current energy market. I live in Boise, and \n     have a 7 to 8 mile commute to work. To date, the higher gas \n     prices aren't directly affecting me too badly, because I do \n     use public transportation. I am disappointed that you are \n     willing to throw your hands up and say ``there is not public \n     transportation.'' There is. And if you do not work to \n     encourage people to use it, it will continue to be a mediocre \n     service. As prices are rising there is a huge new interest in \n     the bus in Boise--ridership on my route to work is easily up \n     50 percent this year compared to last.\n       You are right, the bus is limited, there are far too few \n     routes, and the schedules are very sparse--I work a salaried \n     job and occasionally need to work late--the last bus to come \n     by my work place is at 6:30, and then with that, I will miss \n     the last bus to go from downtown the rest of the way home, \n     and have to walk a mile and a half home.\n       However, I am excited at the current situation, because as \n     more people ride the bus, there's more chance for routes and \n     schedules to expand to make it even more useful. It would be \n     valuable to have your support to help scale our public \n     transit system to a level where people do not have the \n     excuses of ``it does not come close to my house,'' or ``but I \n     have to wait an hour for the next bus after buying my \n     groceries.''\n     Michael, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are on a very limited budget, and so are \n     very careful to watch where our money goes. I am a graduate \n     student at Idaho State University, and have a 25 mile commute \n     to campus. If I do not have to be working in my lab, or \n     taking/teaching a class, I telecommute. With high-speed \n     internet and a cell phone, I can work at least as efficiently \n     from home, thus saving miles driven. I drive a 1995 Ford \n     Escort wagon with nearly 200,000 miles on her. I get over 40 \n     miles to the gallon, and the recent increase in gas prices \n     has meant that it costs me approximately $30 to fill my tank \n     instead of $20. I combine shopping trips to reduce extra \n     mileage, and purchase many items online, since it is nearly \n     impossible for me to find what I need in Pocatello anyhow.\n       In all, I am not concerned with the increased gas prices. I \n     have known for decades that it was inevitable, and believe \n     strongly in conservation for ethical reasons as well as \n     environmental reasons. I am very disappointed to see our \n     country continue to thwart the implementation of much-needed \n     conservation legislation, instead hiding behind talk of \n     exploring options at home. There is only one way to fix this \n     problem, to reduce demand. We have become a fat, bloated \n     nation unwilling to engage in the ideals of thriftiness and \n     invention that once made us [leaders], and now have us \n     falling behind the European and Asian nations like a spoiled \n     child.\n       I urge you to embrace conservation legislation now, before \n     it becomes more painful for our nation.\n                                         Pamela, Lava Hot Springs.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Reserve natural gas for just home use. Do not allow it to \n     be used to fire generators or any other plants. Reserve it \n     for our future for our homes.

Most of the \n     inhabitants of the area are on a fixed income and the gas \n     prices are crippling to the budget of many. I personally \n     drive to town only once a week now to teach piano lessons and \n     get groceries . . . I used to go more often and attend social \n     events as well. My husband works outside of the area as there \n     are few ways to make a living in this area. He drives 2 hours \n     to the nearest airport in Missoula, Montana and then flies to \n     his job, returning home every two weeks for 10 days. We know \n     of many others who travel to work outside of this area for \n     the same reason . . . no industry around here. My husband is \n     considering only coming home once every six weeks now, a \n     family hardship--or perhaps I will move away from the area \n     and join him. The increased cost of traveling has shrunk his \n     take home pay significantly. Obviously the huge increase in \n     the cost of gas is a hardship to any one in this type of \n     situation--and there are many, many people who travel to \n     support their families.\n       Thanks for the chance to (hopefully) make a difference.\n     Christine, Gibbonsville.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is time that all in the United States Senate and \n     Congress got on board of the Drill Here, Drill Now Program.

We \n     usually take a few trips a year to Utah to visit family, but \n     have limited ourselves to one this year. We will be sticking \n     close to home. Things like driving a half-hour to Rexburg we \n     used to not think anything about, but now we have to evaluate \n     all of our activities to see if it is worth the gas money to \n     participate. Raising young kids, it has been a priority for \n     me to stay home with them, but we are wondering if it will \n     always be possible with the rising cost of living.

We are 35 miles from the \n     nearest department stores. My husband is an insurance agent \n     and has to travel to inspect the homes he insures and to \n     service all of his clients. We also build one or two homes a \n     year in a family partnership to help our children earn money \n     for college. Our children go to a university that is 250 \n     miles away. Our married children live 150-200 miles away. \n     Driving long distances is a necessity and public \n     transportation is not an option. We would not use it if we \n     had it. We have to have our vehicles for our work. The ``city \n     dwellers'' in Congress apparently have no idea how much we \n     depend on and need our trucks and cars. We need our lawmakers \n     and the environmentalists to get out of the way and let the \n     big oil companies do what they do best, drill for and refine \n     oil. In the midst of the presidential debates of the recent \n     months, we hear a lot of empty rhetoric coming from \n     Washington and elsewhere. I want to hear from the realists \n     who believe in the phrase I have been hearing on Talk Radio: \n     ``Drill here, drill now, pay less.'' I want my $2 a gallon \n     (or less) gasoline back and I do not want to hear that it is \n     not possible.

Not that it will do any \n     good, but I had to try.\n     Deby, Gooding.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are just your ``average'' Idaho family. Mom and Dad both \n     work and we have four children. We used to have a few dollars \n     left after bills every month to just barely take care of the \n     extra things that pop up--scout camp, new shoes for the kids, \n     medical bills, a birthday gift . . . That is not the case \n     anymore. Not only do we spend more a month on gasoline, we \n     are also spending more on groceries and household items \n     because prices on those have also increased due to energy \n     cost increases. I used to be able to feed my family on a \n     certain budget amount every month. Now, we are dipping into \n     other budgets just to put enough food on the table. The \n     ``other budgets'' are monies we used to use to pay medical \n     bills and other expenses. One can imagine what is happening \n     to those items and obligations now.\n       We have planted a huge garden in hopes of using it to help \n     take the edge off some of our grocery expenses but that won't \n     take care of everything. Children need shoes. Medical bills \n     have to get paid. You cannot buy shoes or pay bills with \n     veggies from your garden. We live too far away from our jobs \n     to ride bikes and one of us works until midnight, making it \n     unsafe to ride a bike home anyway.\n       We just keep hoping that our government will see that the \n     ``average'' family is suffering and that they will do \n     something about it. Perhaps nothing will get done until it \n     hits their homes as hard as it has hit the ``average'' \n     family. Sad commentary on the state of things in America \n     though, because there are more ``average'' families out there \n     than there are wealthy families and/or those who are \n     benefiting from the high oil prices. So, more people are \n     suffering than are not and it does not feel like our \n     government cares. Something can and must be done.\n       When it is said that families are suffering, that means \n     children are suffering--and children should not be made to \n     suffer because of someone else's greed.\n     Gayle, Ammon.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are fearful of how rising oil prices will \n     affect our family and all those around us. If it was just an \n     increase in our personal gasoline usage we might be able to \n     get by. However, it goes so far beyond that, affecting the \n     cost of everything else used in our lives. We already see \n     food prices going up, and expect to see everything else \n     follow suit. Most families like ours are on a tight budget \n     and have started to look at what to give up to continue to \n     pay all the bills. We now wonder if prices continue to climb \n     much further if it will cost us the eventual loss of our home \n     to foreclosure.\n       We see the domino effect on how oil prices touch most \n     aspects of our lives. When everyone starts cutting back, so \n     will the need for as many employees. Thus, will high prices \n     and high unemployment lead us into another depression? Is the \n     United States of America, as the world leader in strength and \n     independence, a thing of the past? Will our children grow up, \n     like so many in other countries, longing to leave and seek \n     residence elsewhere? We fear the feeling of hopelessness and \n     it is spread throughout our nation. Is it too late?\n       We will continue to pray for our government and the \n     decisions it makes. Thank you for your time.\n     Barbara, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       As you know the price of everything has risen because of \n     the tremendous cost of transportation. Those of us on a \n     ``fixed'' income are really suffering. Let us utilize our own \n     oil fields. Bring our troops home; this will decrease our \n     need for oil . . . Our tax money is needed at home!

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a \nman we recently lost--a remarkable individual full of warmth and \ngenerous of spirit.\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n  My wife Jackie and I came to know Frank Stroud as a doctor at the \nSpring Valley Pediatrics practice to which we take our daughters. But \nbefore Frank was one of our daughter's doctors, he was a friend.\n  My father said at the end of his life that he hadn't regretted a \nmoment of his career in public life because no other calling gave him \nthe opportunity to impact the lives of so many people.\n  He might have said otherwise had he met Frank Stroud.\n  Frank had a remarkable capacity for remembering every detail about \nyou. His ability to make casual acquaintances feel like old childhood \nfriends would have made Members of the Senate green with envy.\n  But public office wasn't his vocation. Nor was the seminary, which he \ncontemplated entering. As his children say, Frank found a higher \ncalling:\n  Helping children--which Frank did for nearly four decades, \nspecializing in helping children struggling with learning disabilities \nsuch as attention-deficit disorder.\n  But politics was certainly never far from his mind--or his work. His \nwife Kandy, whom he loved dearly, worked for the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  As Terry McAuliffe once said, Frank became ``the pediatrician for the \nDemocrats,'' having treated Al Gore's children and Smith Bagley's, \namong others. And 40 years ago this year, Frank became medical director \nat the Office of Economic Opportunity which was, of course, at the very \ncenter of President Johnson's War on Poverty.\n  We all have unique experiences in our lives that shape the person we \nbecome. In Frank's case, one of those experiences was that he was \nraised by a single mother. One of his children said in his eulogy of \nhis father words that are so poignant today:\n  ``At a big party, he would make sure to dance with all the single \nladies as though he knew what it felt like for his mother to sit along \nthe edges of the dance floor.''\n  Frank passed away a little over a month ago. At the time, he was \ndoing what he always does: caring for someone other than himself--in \nthis case, his beloved mother Lila, from whom his strength of character \nwas surely handed down.\n  And so today, I wish to extend our thoughts and prayers to Kandy, \ntheir three children and the entire Stroud family, and quote the words \nin his obituary, which read:\n\n     The innocence of a child,\n     The elegance of a Prince,\n     And the generosity of a Saint,\n     Frank Stroud was a majestic human being.\n\n  Indeed, he was. Frank will be missed. His memory will remain, his \nlegacy will endure, for as long as the children he cared for grow into \nthe healthy adults Frank always believed they could. And because of \nFrank Stroud, they most certainly will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7570-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     25TH ANNIVERSARY OF KILI RADIO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of KILI Radio on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. For 25 \nyears, this radio station has served as the Voice of the Lakota Nation. \nIt serves as an important communications tool for members of the Oglala \nSioux Tribe, some western residents of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the \ngeneral listening public in a region that reaches as far as the sacred \nBlack Hills.\n  At times throughout its history, this radio station has served as an \nimportant part of the Emergency Broadcast System, getting word to \nlisteners of severe weather, fire, or other emergency situations on the \nhorizon. It also serves as a vital tool to inform people about \ncommunity meetings, educational opportunities, danger prevention \nactivities, and others. KILI Radio also plays a crucial role in \nmaintaining the Lakota language on the reservation, with its DJs and \nother programming hosts often speaking in Lakota or with Lakota-\nspeaking guests. The station's coverage of sporting events is \nexceptionally popular with KILI listeners and is one of the station's \ntop-ranked areas of programming.\n  Perched atop Porcupine Butte, KILI Radio plays an integral part of \nlife on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Without its existence, lives may \nhave been lost to emergency situations it reported over the airwaves. \nLakota language preservation efforts would also have languished. I \napplaud KILI Radio for working tirelessly to preserve the Lakota \nlanguage and culture while also promoting, educating, and entertaining \nlisteners with the good news of Lakota youth, elders, and \nentrepreneurs. Whether it is coverage of basketball tournaments, \nconferences on issues of importance to the Lakota people or holding \npoliticians' feet to the fire, KILI Radio is a way of life for the Pine \nRidge community. I wish to commend the efforts of all of KILI Radio's \nstaff and volunteers I especially want to congratulate Tom Casey on 23 \nyears of service to the radio station. He serves both as a radio voice, \nand a man behind the scenes to ensure KILI's survival.\n  I would also like to recognize the efforts of those who came together \nwith the vision for the wind turbine that was erected earlier this \nmonth. On a practical level, the turbine will generate energy to power \nthe radio station and its electrical needs. One cannot overlook the \nsymbolism however, to imagine KILI Radio again operating off the grid, \nand on its own terms. Congratulations, KILI Radio on your silver \nanniversary and thank you for all that you have done and all that you \ncontinue to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7570-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN W.

Peabody has served as \ncommander and division engineer for the Pacific Ocean Division, U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers since July, 2005.\n  I relied on General Peabody to help resolve the crisis of coastal \nerosion in my State of Alaska.\n  He was instrumental in developing a partnership between State, \nFederal and local agencies dedicated to helping our communities deal \nwith the effects of coastal erosion.\n  Under his leadership and commitment our Army Engineer District, Far \nEast, has begun the Korea relocation program, moving our forces and \ntheir families to new, state-of-the-art facilities south of Seoul.\n  In Japan, General Peabody directed the largest military construction \nprogram in the history of our Corps of Engineers. USAED, Japan \ncompleted over 500 projects, greatly enhancing our operational \nreadiness level and significantly improving the quality of life for our \nservice men and women and their families living in that country.\n  Brigadier General Peabody oversaw the construction of the Stryker \nBrigade stationing facilities at Schofield Barracks, HI. Those new \nfacilities allow our soldiers to train for contingencies throughout the \nPacific region and around the world.\n  Brigadier General Peabody's professionalism, caring leadership, and \ndevotion are in keeping with the proudest traditions of our military, \nand reflect great credit upon himself, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, and the U.S. Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7570-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7570-S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GRAHAM NEWELL\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the State of Vermont has lost one \nof its greatest teachers, Graham Newell. I wish to honor this \nremarkable man, an important figure in our State's history in \ngovernment as well as throughout its system of education.\n  A seventh generation Vermonter who grew up in the Northeast Kingdom \nof Vermont, Newell returned to Vermont to teach after earning his \ndegree in classics from the University of Chicago. For eight decades he \nwas the quintessential educator, beginning and ending at his beloved \nSt. Johnsbury Academy and teaching history and social sciences to \ncollege students for many years as well, serving as a professor and \nchair of the Social Sciences Department at Lyndon State College.\n  Graham Newell was a man who so highly regarded the field of education \nthat he entered politics to be its champion in the State legislature. \nFirst elected to the Vermont House in 1953, and later elected to the \nVermont Senate, he served as the chairman of both the House and Senate \nEducation Committees. Throughout his tenure in the legislature in \nMontpelier, Graham Newell worked tirelessly to ensure educational \nopportunities for students with disabilities. Indeed, Vermont's special \neducation bill preceded comparable legislation on the Federal level\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\nby 20 years. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Vermont \nState College system and he authored a fair dismissal bill for \neducators.\n  Although Graham Newell was a Vermont delegate to the Republican \nNational Convention in 1956 and 1964, he was one of the great \npractitioners of a long Vermont tradition of nonpartisan politics. He \nbecame involved in government reform, serving on the Little Hoover \nCommission that reorganized Vermont's State agencies, and he was \nappointed by President Kennedy to the National Advisory Commission on \nInter-Governmental Relations. A founding member of the American Civil \nLiberties Union of Vermont, he championed a strict separation of church \nand State by opposing public busing for parochial schools.\n  As the resident Vermont historian at Lyndon State, he was responsible \nfor naming all of its buildings after notable Vermonters. And, in a \nwonderful instance of turnabout is fair play, St. Johnsbury Academy \nrecently honored him by renaming its foreign languages building Newell \nHall.\n  Above all he valued equality and equal opportunity, principles that \nno doubt derived from his Vermont upbringing, his long study and \nadmiration for Roman history and from his work in education.\n  Graham Newell taught Latin at St. Johnsbury Academy well into his \nnineties, long after he retired from his professorship at Lyndon State \nCollege. The indelible mark he made on the communities of St. Johnsbury \nand Lyndonville will not soon be forgotten. These communities need only \nlook to the countless students whose lives he touched to see the effect \nhe had on them.\n  Mr. Newell earned countless awards as an outstanding educator, \nhistorian and model citizen, including being named the Vermont Chamber \nof Commerce's Man of the Year in 2005.\n  It is exemplary citizens such as Graham Newell who have earned \nVermont its reputation for civic leadership and principled politics, \nfor sound reasoning in government, and for rising above partisan \nlabels. Today, we honor his memory by recognizing his great \ncommitments: to responsible citizenship, to superior education for all, \nto teaching, and to public service, and to shaping a future that will \nbe worthy of our past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7571-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF GENERAL RICHARD CODY\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after 36 years of service to our \nNation, GEN Dick Cody will conclude his military career on August 1. I \nsalute his leadership and honor his lovely wife Vicki, for her \ninvaluable support of her husband and our soldiers.\n  Dick Cody began his service more than 40 years ago, leaving his \nfamily's car dealership in Vermont and reporting to West Point.\n  He has served our Nation on battlefields and bases around the world, \ncommanding our soldiers, including the famed Screaming Eagles of our \n101st Airborne Division.\n  General Cody's service as operations officer and later vice chief of \nstaff, reminds me of GEN George C. Marshall's service as our Army's \nChief of Staff during World War II. Marshall noted that before the war, \nhe had ``time'' to prepare the Army, but ``no money.''\n  After France fell to the Nazis, Marshall said he had ``money, but no \ntime.'' Dick Cody faced similar circumstances and deserves our \ngratitude for preparing our soldiers to fight the war against \nterrorism.\n  Our Army entered this war with significant equipment shortages. Our \nforces were organized to fight the Cold War rather than the vastly \ndifferent global war on terror.\n  Since September 11, 2001, with funds provided by Congress, Cody has \ndirected the fielding of 94 new Army equipment programs worth over $100 \nbillion. He orchestrated the Army's largest restationing and \nconstruction program in 70 years. He directed the most sweeping \ntransformation of our Army since the dawn of mechanized warfare.\n  He oversaw the conversion of our Reserve components to a critical \npart of our operational forces, and supervised the addition of 65,000 \nnew soldiers to our forces. He has also been instrumental in ensuring \nour wounded soldiers receive the treatment and care which they deserve.\n  Vicki Cody supported her husband, and his soldiers, throughout their \n33 years of marriage. She cared for our military families during \ntraining missions and deployments, often while her own husband was \nserving far from his family.\n  Dick and Vicki raised two sons, Clint and Tyler, both U.S. Army \ncaptains, with six combat deployments between them. When young Dick \nCody left Vermont, and Cody Chevrolet, he truly started a new ``family \nbusiness.''\n  Our Nation is grateful for his leadership, and we wish him and Vicki \nall the best as they begin a new chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7571-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 5:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \npro tempore (Mr. Hoyer) has signed the following enrolled joint \nresolution:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to increase energy assistance for low-income persons, \nto extend energy tax incentives, and for other purpose; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Energy \nAssistance Act of 2008, legislation which would assist people who want \nto invest in energy conservation and alternative energy technologies \nand help set us on a path toward energy independence.\n  As I visit communities around the State of Maine, I hear time and \nagain that the high cost of energy is causing a crisis for many of our \ncitizens. Rapidly increasing prices for home heating oil, gasoline and \ndiesel fuel are a huge burden for many families, truckers, and small \nbusinesses. High oil prices affect virtually every corner of the \neconomy, in Maine and throughout the country, and are a significant \ncause of the current economic downturn.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that in this difficult economy, \ninvestments in energy conservation and alternative energy improvements \nare simply too costly for many American families and small businesses. \nFor example, under the present code, taxpayers who install energy \nefficient windows receive a 10 percent tax credit, up to $200, and \ntaxpayers who install solar water heating systems receive a credit of \n30 percent, up to a total of $2000. In both instances, the investment \nwhich must be made by the taxpayer far exceeds the credit amount.\n  With oil prices as high as they are, most families and small \nbusinesses are already scrimping and saving to make ends meet, and they \ndo not have the money to finance the gap between the tax credit we \nprovide and the cost of the investment. Ironically, the higher oil \nprices climb, the harder it will be for taxpayers to bridge this gap.\n  The legislation I am introducing today calls for additional loan \nauthority to support current Federal programs that help families and \nsmall businesses finance energy efficiency improvements. It also would \nprovide much-needed grants for low-income individuals who cannot \nbenefit from either tax credits or low-interest loans. These proposals, \ntaken together, would go a long way toward achieving greater energy \nefficiency and reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil.\n  The loan authority I am proposing would expand existing Federal \nprograms that make low-interest loans to individuals and small \nbusinesses for energy efficiency improvements. This new loan authority \nwould be made available through a new energy assistance revolving loan \nfund within the Treasury Department. Individuals who make less than 115 \npercent of the median area income would be able to apply for low-\ninterest loans to cover the difference between the tax credits \navailable for energy efficiency improvements and up to 90 percent of \nthe cost of those improvements. The Federal agencies can make these \nloans directly, or through their lender networks.\n  USDA, HUD, and other Federal agencies already have programs that can \nmake loans of this kind to individuals. Small businesses can seek low-\ninterest loans for energy efficiency improvements under existing loan \nprograms such as the SBA's 7(a) program. The revolving loan fund called \nfor by my bill will enable these agencies to offer more loans to the \nindividuals and small businesses.\n  It is also important that we provide assistance to low-income \nindividuals who do not have the income to benefit from tax credits, or \nwho cannot afford to finance energy improvements even with low-interest \nloans. These individuals, especially, are still reeling from last \nwinter's high energy prices, and it is critically important that they \nreceive assistance before cold weather sets in again. To help those who \nare most in need, my bill would provide an additional $500 million in \nfunding this year for grants for energy efficiency, weatherization, and \nrenewable energy technology, and would double funding for the \nWeatherization Assistance Program. These grants will finance \ninvestments that will decrease energy prices for these citizens for \nyears to come and are a wise investment.\n  My legislation also includes several proposals I have long advocated. \nI have included these proposals so that this bill captures an overall \npicture of the energy challenges that our Nation faces. For example, \nthis bill extends important tax incentives for renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency that have expired, or are about to expire. These \nprovisions include the renewable energy production tax credit, Clean \nRenewable Energy Bonds, tax benefits for energy efficient buildings, \nproducts and power plants, the tax credit for Plug-In Hybrid vehicles, \nthe exemption from the heavy vehicles excise tax for idling reduction \nunits and advanced insulation, and energy efficiency tax credits for \nhomes.\n  My bill would also provide a $500 tax credit to help consumers \npurchase and install new clean burning stoves, as well as efficient, \nclean wood pellet stoves, similar to a bill I introduced\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nwith Senator Crapo earlier this year. This new tax credit reflects the \nreality that with oil prices soaring, wood is again the fuel of choice \nfor many families throughout the country, just as it was during the \nheight of the oil crisis in the 1970's.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way so that we \ncan help Americans overcome the challenge of high oil prices and \nrestore and strengthen our Nation's economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs, Feinstein):\n  S. 3351. A bill to enhance drug trafficking interdiction by creating \na Federal felony for operating or embarking in a submersible or semi-\nsubmersible vessel without nationality and on an international voyage; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Drug \nTrafficking Interdiction Assistance Act of 2008. The operation of \nunregistered, un-flagged, semi- and fully-submersible vessels to \ntraffic narcotics and other contraband through international waters \nposes a serious threat to the safety of our communities and the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  Self-propelled semi-submersible water-craft, or SPSSs, can operate \nwith a significant portion of their hull below the surface of the \nwater, making detection very difficult. Recently we've seen an increase \nin the production and use of SPSSs originating in Colombia and \nembarking north in the Pacific Ocean with up to 12 tons of cocaine \npacked on board. SPSSs are typically less than 100 feet long, carry 4-5 \ncrew, travel at speeds of up to 8 knots, and have a maximum range of \n3,500 miles.\n  These submarines are often equipped with valves that allow the \noperators to quickly flood and sink the SPSS in the event of \ninterception by law enforcement, sending the vessel and any drugs or \nother contraband on board to an unrecoverable depth. As the last part \nof the scuttling process, the operators eject from the SPSS, and law \nenforcement has no choice but to rescue them from the ocean in \naccordance with our obligations under international law. They avoid \nprosecution because no drugs are recovered. For the operators of these \nSPSSs, they are able to avoid prosecution--for now.\n  This bill turns the tables on the traffickers. It builds off of the \ngood work by my colleagues Senators Lautenberg, Smith, Cantwell, and \nSnowe, who have a bill that criminalizes the operation of an \nunregistered, stateless semi-submersible or submersible vessel. The \nlegislation that I have drafted would clarify that the defendant's \nintent in operating the SPSS was to evade detection, add a robust \naffirmative defense to protect legitimate researchers and explorers who \nmay happen to use a semi-submersible vessel, include a tough criminal \npenalty provision to prosecute SPSS operators, and direct the United \nStates Sentencing Commission to account for mitigating and aggravating \nfactors in the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  As Chair of the Caucus International Narcotics Control and Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I have worked to not only curb drug \ndemand and increase treatment options, but also to drug traffickers and \ndisrupt supply. This bill is an important step in curbing this emerging \nthreat and shutting down this new mode of trafficking.\n  Between 2001 and 2007, there were 23 identified SPSS drug smuggling \nevents. At the time, these vessels were largely seen by drug \ntraffickers as risky and impractical. But after increasingly successful \ninterdiction of go-fast boats and other means, drug traffickers began \nseeing SPSSs as a viable option. Between October 1, 2007 and February \n1, 2008, alone, there were a reported 27 SPSS events that successfully \ndelivered an estimated 111 tons of cocaine. At between $500,000 and $2 \nmillion per SPSS, they cost only a fraction of the profits these \ntraffickers reap.\n  These vessels have the capacity to deliver more than just illegal \ndrugs--an SPSSs could easily accommodate other contraband, like \nterrorist operatives and weapons of mass destruction in its cargo-\nholds. Their operation poses a significant danger to the United States \nand this legislation criminalizes their use while allowing for the \ncontinuation of legitimate research and exploring activities.\n  I want to recognize my friend Senator Lautenberg for his leadership \non this issue. I look forward to working with him to enact a tough and \nfair law that disrupts drug trafficking and other illegal smuggling \nactivities. I also thank Senators Grassley and Feinstein for their \nsupport, and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3352.

Cutler was reading his \n     father's wartime journal and found a reference to the tragic \n     B-17C airplane accident;\n       Whereas this discovery inspired Mr. Cutler to embark upon a \n     research project that would consume more than a decade and \n     take him to Australia;\n       Whereas retired United States Air Force Chief Master \n     Sergeant Teddy W. Hanks, of Wichita Falls, Texas, who lost \n     four of his World War II fellow service members in the crash, \n     compiled a list of the casualties from United States archives \n     in 1993 and began searching for their families;\n       Whereas the Bakers Creek Memorial Association, in \n     conjunction with the Washington Post and retired United \n     States Army genealogy experts Charles Gailey and Arvon \n     Staats, located 23 additional families of victims of the \n     accident during the past two years;\n       Whereas Joy Shingleton, Donnie Tenney, Wendy Andrus, and \n     Wilma Post, the family of Army Air Corps Corporal Edward J. \n     Tenney, of Buckhannon, West Virginia, helped to bring this \n     recently uncovered World War II tragedy to light; and\n       Whereas as of February 24, 2005, the commander of the \n     United States Fifth Air Force officially had notified the \n     relatives of 36 of the 40 victims: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that an \n     appropriate site to be selected by the Secretary of the Army \n     should be provided for a memorial marker to honor the memory \n     of the 40 members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     who lost their lives in the air crash at Bakers Creek, \n     Australia, on June 14, 1943, provided that the Secretary of \n     the Army have exclusive authority to approve the design and \n     site for the memorial marker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/28/senate-section/article/S7577-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5249.

OPEN FUEL STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Open \n     Fuel Standard Act of 2008'' or the ``OFS Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The status of oil as a strategic commodity, which \n     derives from its domination of the transportation sector, \n     presents a clear and present danger to the United States.\n       (2) in a prior era, when salt was a strategic commodity, \n     salt mines conferred national power and wars were fought over \n     the control of such mines;\n       (3) technology, in the form of electricity and \n     refrigeration, decisively ended salt's monopoly of meat \n     preservation and greatly reduced its strategic importance;\n       (4) fuel competition and consumer choice would similarly \n     serve to end oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and \n     strip oil of its strategic status;\n       (5) the current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of \n     petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices, \n     effectively imposing a harmful tax on the economy of the \n     United States of nearly $500,000,000,000 per year;\n       (6) much of the inflated petroleum revenues the oil cartel \n     earns at the expense of the people of the United States are \n     used for purposes antithetical to the interests of the United \n     States and its allies;\n       (7) alcohol fuels, including ethanol and methanol, could \n     potentially provide significant supplies of additional fuels \n     that could be produced in the United States and in many other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere that are friendly to the \n     United States;\n       (8) alcohol fuels can only play a major role in securing \n     the energy independence of the United States if a substantial \n     portion of vehicles in the United States are capable of \n     operating on such fuels;\n       (9) it is not in the best interest of United States \n     consumers or the United States Government to be constrained \n     to depend solely upon petroleum resources for vehicle fuels \n     if alcohol fuels are potentially available;\n       (10) existing technology, in the form of flexible fuel \n     vehicles, allows internal combustion engine cars and trucks \n     to be produced at little or no additional cost, which are \n     capable of operating on conventional gasoline, alcohol fuels, \n     or any combination of such fuels, as availability or cost \n     advantage dictates, providing a platform on which fuels can \n     compete;\n       (11) the necessary distribution system for such alcohol \n     fuels will not be developed in the United States until a \n     substantial fraction of the vehicles in the United States are \n     capable of operating on such fuels;\n       (12) the establishment of such a vehicle fleet and \n     distribution system would provide a large market that would \n     mobilize private resources to substantially advance the \n     technology and expand the production of alcohol fuels in the \n     United States and abroad;\n       (13) the United States has an urgent national security \n     interest to develop alcohol fuels technology, production, and \n     distribution systems as rapidly as possible;\n       (14) new cars sold in the United States that are equipped \n     with an internal combustion engine should allow for fuel \n     competition by being flexible fuel vehicles, and new diesel \n     cars should be capable of operating on biodiesel; and\n       (15) such an open fuel standard would help to protect the \n     United States economy from high and volatile oil prices and \n     from the threats caused by global instability, terrorism, and \n     natural disaster.\n       (c) Open Fuel Standard for Transportation.--Chapter 329 of \n     title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 32920. OPEN FUEL STANDARD FOR TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) E85.--The term `E85' means a fuel mixture containing \n     85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline by volume.\n       ``(2) Flexible fuel automobile.--The term `flexible fuel \n     automobile' means an automobile that has been warranted by \n     its manufacturer to operate on gasoline, E85, and M85.\n       ``(3) Fuel choice-enabling automobile.--The term `fuel \n     choice-enabling automobile' means--\n       ``(A) a flexible fuel automobile; or\n       ``(B) an automobile that has been warranted by its \n     manufacturer to operate on biodiesel.\n       ``(4) Light-duty automobile.--The term `light-duty \n     automobile' means--\n       ``(A) a passenger automobile; or\n       ``(B) a non-passenger automobile.\n       ``(5) Light-duty automobile manufacturer's annual \n     inventory.--The term `light-duty automobile manufacturer's \n     annual inventory' means the number of light-duty automobiles \n     that a manufacturer, during a given calendar year, \n     manufactures in the United States or imports from outside of \n     the United States for sale in the United States.\n       ``(6) M85.--The term `M85' means a fuel mixture containing \n     85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline by volume.\n       ``(b) Open Fuel Standard for Transportation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     each light-duty automobile manufacturer's annual inventory \n     shall be comprised of not less than 50 percent fuel choice-\n     enabling automobiles in 2012.\n       ``(2) Temporary exemption from requirements.--\n       ``(A) Application.--A manufacturer may request an exemption \n     from the requirement described in paragraph (1) by submitting \n     an application to the Secretary, at such time, in such \n     manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may \n     require by regulation.
