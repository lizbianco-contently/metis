Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nfor the transaction of morning business for 1 hour. The time will be \nequally divided and controlled. The majority controls the first portion \nand the Republicans control the last portion. Under an order entered \nlast night, we will resume the Military Construction appropriations \nbill after morning business. There are five amendments that are \nremaining that are in order that are going to be disposed of.\n  After the Senate completes action on the Military Construction bill, \nthe Senate will begin consideration of the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill. The managers of that will be Senator Leahy and \nSenator Gregg. This should be a busy day with votes throughout the day. \nIn addition, the education reconciliation conference report will be \navailable and, as I mentioned earlier this week, we will act on that \nmeasure this week.\n  I will talk in more detail with the Republican leader when we have a \nbetter picture of what is going on with the Foreign Operations bill and \nhow long it is going to take to dispose of the Military Construction-VA \nbill.\n  Democrats and Republicans worked well together yesterday. We have a \nlot to do. One of the things we have to do is look forward to somehow \nfunding the Government after October 1. There will be consultations \nbetween the Republican leader and me and the appropriations people on \nCapitol Hill. Also, we have the President to deal with on these issues. \nEven though there has been a lot made about the difference between what \nthe President wants and what Congress wants, it is not that much \ndifferent. I hope we can work out those issues.\n  Anyway, we have a picture ahead of us of what we need to do, and we \nwill proceed to do that business as quickly as we can today and \nhopefully finish everything today, tomorrow and hopefully not have to \nworry about tomorrow afternoon or even Saturday. I hope we need not do \nthat. We will keep everyone informed as soon as we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11129-7", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to speak \nabout an amendment we will be voting on in probably an hour and a half. \nIt is amendment No. 2662, which has to do with the expansion of a \ntraining facility in my State of Colorado called the Pinon Canyon \nManeuver Site. It is a training facility associated with Fort Carson.\n  In February of 2007, a few months ago, the U.S. Army made an \nannouncement it would move forward with an effort to acquire an \nadditional 400,000 acres-plus of land in my State to add to this \ntraining facility. What I am asking my colleagues to do today is to \njoin with me and a vast bipartisan majority of the House of \nRepresentatives in saying we need a timeout before we move forward. I \nask my Democratic and Republican colleagues to join us in supporting \namendment No. 2662.\n  I say to everyone in this Chamber and to those who are listening, if \nyou care about private property rights, you will support this \namendment. If you care about ranchers and farmers in America, including \nthose who make a living in southeastern Colorado, you will support this \namendment. If you care about being wise in terms of how we spend \ntaxpayers' dollars in expanding our military facilities, you will \nsupport this amendment.\n  I wish to make a few remarks about its history, to put this into \nperspective.\n  First, the Army in 1982 acquired 235,000 acres for the training \nfacility now known as Pinon Canyon. That facility has been used since \n1982. It is an integral component of the training capabilities for Fort \nCarson, CO.\n  In 2005, the BRAC Commission, in its recommendations which were \napproved in the Senate, recommendations which I supported, added \nadditional troops to Fort Carson. The findings of the Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission said that Fort Carson had sufficient training \nfacilities to provide all the training that is needed for our troops \nstationed at Fort Carson.\n  So the first question to be asked by all those who are going to be \nimpacted by this 400,000-acre expansion is whether that amount of land \nis sufficient to carry on the training purpose required at Fort Carson. \nThat question simply has not been answered.\n  If the Army moves forward with the expansion of the additional \n400,000-plus acres, we will have a Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in \nColorado that will have 1,235 square miles. That is an area that is \nbigger than the size of the State of Rhode Island. Yet what the Army \nhas proposed to do is acquire that land through condemnation or \nwhatever necessary means to move forward with an unjustified need for \nan expansion of Pinon Canyon.\n  I am not saying we ought not look at whether we need to have \nadditional training facilities at Fort Carson. We certainly should take \na look at that. But until we get the answers as to what has changed \nfrom January of 2005 until 2007 that requires the expansion of this \ntraining facility so we have a training facility the size of Rhode \nIsland-plus, it is important we ask questions of the Army.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in moving forward with a timeout, with \na 1-year moratorium on the EIS process which the Army has proposed, and \nduring that 1 year we can ask some very important questions that will \nbe important to those who will be most affected--the residents of \nsoutheastern Colorado. We need to ask those questions as well for the \nmen and women in uniform, whom we train at Fort Carson and around our \ncountry, to be sure we have appropriate and adequate training \nfacilities for them. Those are questions that do need to be asked.\n  The Department of Defense authorization and appropriations bills will \nbe coming up, and I have proposed and will introduce legislation that \nwill be cosponsored by my colleague, Senator Allard, where we get those \nquestions answered. When we have those questions answered, then we can \nmake a thoughtful decision about how best to move forward in a manner \nthat, first, enhances and protects the national security of the United \nStates; No. 2, make sure we are protecting the private property rights \nof the ranchers who have lived in this area for sometimes three and \nfour generations; and No. 3, the investments we make with respect to \nany expansion of Pinon Canyon are investments that make sense from a \nfiscal point of view.\n  I ask my colleagues, when we get to amendment No. 2662 in about an \nhour, that they vote in support of this amendment.\n  I conclude by saying there are two values that have driven me in my \ndiscussions on this issue of the expansion of Pinon Canyon over the \nlast several months. The first of those values is we need to make sure \nwe are providing the necessary training facilities for our soldiers at \nFort Carson and those who will train at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. \nWe need to make sure we are doing that, and we have a set of questions \nthat need to be answered in that regard.\n  Second, we need to be sure we are protecting private property rights. \nWhen one thinks about the fact that in these 400-plus acres, there are \nmany ranchers who have been there for three and four generations, \nranchers who have come to me with tears in their eyes, who talk about \nthe fact that their wife is buried on their ranch and that they took \nthe ranch from their father and their mother and from their \ngrandparents, it seems to me that if there is an opportunity for us to \nmake sure we are protecting private property rights, this is a time for \nus to say we are going to protect the private property rights of those \nranchers.\n  I say to my colleagues, I am not asking for the death knell to be put \non any proposed expansion by the Army. All I am asking is that we have \na 1-year timeout, a 1-year delay so we can get these fundamental \nquestions answered on how we move forward with Pinon Canyon.\n  I urge my colleagues to please support amendment No. 2662 when we \nvote on it in about an hour.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters in support of my amendment and the position on the Pinon Canyon \nissue from Otero County, a resolution from Huerfano County, Las Animas \nCounty, Colorado Counties, Inc., LaJunta, the Bent County \nCommissioners, Baca County Commissioners, the Club 20, Action 22, \nCrowley County, as well as Alamosa County.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Otero County,\n\n\n                                  Office of the Commissioners,\n\n                                    La Junia, CO, August 27, 2007.\n     Senator Ken Salazar,\n     129 West B Street,\n     Pueblo, CO.\n       Dear Senator Salazar: Through this letter, the Otero Board \n     of County Commissioners officially registers its adamant \n     opposition to the expansion of the current Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver Site and requests your support of the Musgrave-\n     Salazar amendment. Although this office and individual \n     commissioners have corresponded with you on this matter over \n     the past several months we feel compelled to address once \n     again the U.S. Army proposed expansion.\n       We appreciate your support in the disallowance of eminent \n     domain to acquire any\n\n[[Page S11131]]\n\n     land. However, simply halting condemnation will do nothing to \n     truly support those communities that are depending on your \n     representation to halt funding for the expansion entirely. A \n     majority of state lawmakers and Congressional \n     representatives, all 14 southern Colorado county commissions, \n     and the people of Colorado agree there should be no expansion \n     and no money spent on the expansion of the Pinon Canyon site. \n     As you know, opposition to the Pentagon's plan has been \n     overwhelming and bipartisan at every level--community, \n     county, state and national. We urge you to heed the will of \n     the people by ending any and all funding for any and all \n     aspects of the expansion.\n       Thus, we ask you to protect the integrity of the regional \n     and state agricultural economy by supporting the language \n     authored by Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-4th CD), supported by \n     Rep. John Salazar (D-3rd CD) and adopted overwhelmingly by \n     both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives in June.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Bauserman,\n       Chair.\n     Harold Klein, Jr.,\n     Kevin Karney.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Resolution No. 06-33\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army established the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver Site in Las Animas County in 1982, through its \n     acquisition of approximately two hundred and forty thousand \n     acres of private land to provide a training facility for Army \n     personnel stationed at Ft. Carson; and,\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army has initiated consideration of the \n     expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site to accommodate a \n     significantly enhanced training program in expectation of \n     additional Army personnel being stationed at Ft. Carson; and,\n       Whereas, the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site \n     could result in approximately four hundred thousand acres of \n     additional land being taken out of private ownership in \n     southeastern Colorado; and,\n       Whereas, since the establishment of the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver Site, Huerfano County has realized minimal or no \n     economic benefit from the operations of the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver Site; and,\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army has been forthcoming in providing \n     information to Huerfano County regarding its plans for \n     expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; and,\n       Whereas, the United States Army has not recognized the \n     serious destruction and loss of public access to the \n     historical artifacts located in the areas such as Vogal and \n     Picket Wire Canyons, including the Santa Fe Trail and other \n     closely situated sites which have scientific, historical, \n     paleontological and tourist-related interest. Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Huerfano County Board of County \n     Commissioners, That the Southern District Counties of \n     Colorado Counties, Inc. hereby take a position of opposition \n     to the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. that the U.S. Army has not provided sufficiently \n     detailed information to Huerfano County regarding its plans \n     for the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; and,\n       2. that the U. S. Army has not agreed to refrain from use \n     of eminent domain to acquire privately owned land for \n     expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; and,\n       3. that the U.S. Army has no committees to fund a thorough \n     and object socio-economic study of the impacts that will \n     result from the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; \n     and,\n       4. that the federal government has not committed to fully \n     compensate impacted counties in Southeastern Colorado with \n     Payments of In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) in conformance with \n     federal law and to provide compensation for all additional \n     land that may be acquired for the expansion of the Pinon \n     Canyon Maneuver Site; and,\n       5. that the federal government has not committed to provide \n     financial compensation to all local governmental entities \n     that will be economically impacted by the expansion of the \n     Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, including counties, cities and \n     towns, school districts, special districts, etc.; and,\n       6. that the U.S. Army has not committed to provide long \n     term employment opportunities for support jobs necessary to \n     operate the Maneuver Site nor afforded local business with \n     opportunities to provide goods and services to support the \n     Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Las Animas County,\n\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                                      Trinidad, CO, July 16, 2007.\n       Dear Commissioners: The Board of County Commissioners of \n     Las Animas County, wish to make you aware of its concerns \n     regarding the potential expansion of the U.S. Army's Pinon \n     Canyon Maneuver Site, located within this county.\n       The U.S. Army recently released its latest map iteration \n     reflecting the area of interest for expansion of the Maneuver \n     Site by more than four hundred thousand acres. The majority \n     of that land is located within Las Animas County. Should this \n     expansion be approved, the U.S. Army may seek further \n     expansion within Southeastern Colorado in the future.\n       In the early 1980s, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n     undertook the acquisition of privately owned land in Las \n     Animas County, to create the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, not \n     all land owners were willing sellers. While the Army Corps of \n     Engineers negotiated for acquisition of several properties, \n     it proceeded to utilize the federal government's power of \n     eminent domain to acquire land from those property owners \n     with whom it was not able to negotiate a purchase price or \n     who were unwilling to sell. In the end, it took the \n     properties and let the Court determine just compensation.\n       The acquisition of additional privately owned land will \n     further impact the agricultural community, displace \n     population, reducing the number of school-aged children in K-\n     12 rural schools and reduce the tax base depended upon by \n     this county and the schools districts and special districts \n     in the area of the Maneuver Site. Further, the federal \n     government has never fully funded the Payment In Lieu of Tax \n     (PILT) program to offset lost tax base revenues.\n       In June, the House of Representatives of the United States \n     Congress overwhelmingly, approved an amendment to the federal \n     military spending bill for 2008, prohibiting the U.S. Army \n     from proceeding forward with its plans for expansion of the \n     Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. Within the next several days, \n     that same amendment will be considered by the U.S. Senate. \n     You are respectfully requested to contact both of Colorado's \n     United States Senators, Kenneth Salazar and Wayne Allard, and \n     request that they support the Musgrave-Salazar Amendment to \n     the military funding bill to preclude the U.S. Army from \n     pursuing expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site.

Kenneth Salazar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Salazar: Although the Bent County \n     Commissioners have corresponded with you on this matter over \n     the past several months we feel compelled to address once \n     again the U.S. Army proposed expansion of the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver site located in our neighboring counties of Otero \n     and Las Animas.\n       We do recognize the necessity of our military troops to be \n     adequately and professionally trained in their mission of \n     defending the freedoms that all of us as United States \n     citizens wish to preserve, however, the potential expansion \n     of the Pinon Canyon site by more than four hundred thousand \n     acres is not a viable solution. Property owners in both Otero \n     and Las Animas Counties have already made considerable \n     sacrifice on this project. The acreage previously acquired \n     for the Pinon Canyon site was, for the most part, secured by \n     the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers utilizing the Federal \n     government's power of eminent domain. The compensation paid \n     to those sellers unwilling to sell was therefore determined \n     by the Court and in many cases was an unjust dollar figure.\n       The removal of lands in the affected counties will further \n     impact the agricultural communities of southeast Colorado \n     thereby displacing our already sparse population. Experience \n     from the previous purchase by the Federal government of the \n     Pinon Canyon lands has already shown a significant negative \n     impact on the tax base used to fund the counties, schools, \n     and special districts. The Federal government has never fully \n     funded the Payment in Lieu of Tax (PILT) to offset the loss \n     of tax base revenues.\n       We respectfully request that you support the Musgrave-\n     Salazar amendment to the military spending bill, as was \n     overwhelmingly approved in the House of Representatives in \n     June, which would prohibit the U.S. Army from proceeding \n     forward with its plans for the expansion of the Pinon Canyon \n     site.\n       On behalf of the Bent County Board of Commissioners\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                        Bill Long,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Baca County\n\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                                     Springfield, CO, May 8, 2006.\n       Dear Senator Salazar: The Baca County Commissioners wish to \n     express our opposition to the expansion of the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver site, more specifically in the use of condemnation \n     or eminent domain to secure property from unwilling sellers. \n     We also object to the expansion based on the negative \n     economic impact to our county because of the large amount of \n     goods and services provided by our constituents to the \n     residents of the expansion area.\n           Sincerely,\n     Troy Crane,\n       Chairman.\n     Bill Wright,\n       District 2.\n     Glen R.

While we are \n     quick to acknowledge that this particular issue is obviously \n     outside of the geographic scope of CLUB 20's Western Slope \n     constituency, the concerns that we have regarding this \n     proposal relate to matters that could establish dangerous \n     precedents for private landowners and local governments \n     everywhere.\n       CLUB 20 fully supports the need for our government to \n     maintain the best-equipped and most highly-trained fighting \n     force in the world. However, with respect to this need, we \n     would like to raise for your consideration the following two \n     concerns related to the proposed Pinon Canyon expansion:\n       (1) It is the policy of CLUB 20 that the federal government \n     should only acquire additional land when such proposals have \n     strong support from the local county and municipal \n     governments where the lands would be acquired. As concerns \n     the Army's proposed Pinon Canyon expansion, we are aware of a \n     significant amount of concern which has been raised by local \n     governments and private landowners in that area. Because of \n     the importance of securing local support for such projects, \n     we request that you urge the Army to make a more diligent \n     effort to engage these local governments in a collaborative \n     dialogue to effectively address the concerns of the local \n     community.\n       (2) As with all such proposals which transfer land from \n     private to public ownership, CLUB 20 is concerned about the \n     resulting reduction in property tax revenues and the historic \n     unwillingness of Congress to fully fund Payments-In-Lieu-of-\n     Taxes (PILT) to help offset this economic hardship to the \n     local community. While we recognize that related troop \n     increases at Fort Carson may yield additional economic \n     benefits for the larger Colorado Springs community, the \n     removal of these private lands from the tax rolls will likely \n     pose little economic benefit to more rural areas like Las \n     Animas County. We encourage you to fully explore the \n     potential adverse tax revenue impacts associated with the \n     conversion of such private lands and the removal of the \n     private agriculture enterprises currently dependent on those \n     lands.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these two concerns, and \n     thank you for your continued support of our military \n     institutions and the men and women who proudly serve our \n     country in uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Reeves Brown,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Resolution 07-08 AG 8\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army wishes to acquire additional needed \n     land to expand the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; and\n       Whereas, the expansion of troops into Ft. Carson, as \n     provided in the BRAC report, is not contingent upon the \n     expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver site, and\n       Whereas, the new technology permits smaller units to \n     operate in and control significantly greater battle space \n     than was previously possible,\n       Whereas, The expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site \n     could currently result in approximately four hundred thousand \n     acres of additional land being taken out of private ownership \n     in southeastern Colorado; and\n       Whereas, Since the establishment of the Pinon Canyon \n     Maneuver Site, counties in Southeastern Colorado have \n     realized minimal or no economic benefit from the operations \n     of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site;\n       Whereas, Homeland Security is of utmost importance to the \n     United States and the proper training of our soldiers is \n     needed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That ACTION 22 believes that the use of eminent \n     domain is not an acceptable means in the on-going discussion \n     in the expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That ACTION 22 stresses the need for timely, \n     positive discussions on the economic future of Southern \n     Colorado and the region as whole, and be it further\n       Resolved, That ACTION 22 will not consider supporting the \n     expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site until the U.S. \n     Army provides sufficient detailed information to Action 22 \n     counties** regarding its plans and needs for the expansion of \n     the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Crowley County\n\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                                        Ordway, CO, July 31, 2007.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, later on this morning, I will be offering \nan amendment which, frankly, in terms of dollars, is not one of the big \namendments as part of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nbill, which is over $100 billion. This amendment is only $20 million. \nBut while it is small in the amount of money it deals with, it is \nenormously significant to the millions of men and women who have served \nour country in war, and it is especially relevant to disabled veterans, \nthose people who have given as much as anyone can expect defending \ntheir country--the people without arms, the people without legs, the \npeople in wheelchairs. It is for them I am offering this amendment, and \nI am very pleased that this amendment has the support of the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS.\n  The amendment I am offering addresses an ongoing and an emotional \nconcern within the veterans community. It is the concern that we in the \nU.S. Government are nickel and diming veterans in an absolutely \nshameful way through the so-called rounding-down process in terms of \nthe checks that go to disabled veterans. Some years ago, as a temporary \nbudget Band-Aid, the Congress initiated the so-called rounding down of \nveterans disability benefits and a few other categories of benefits \nthat affect veterans, their spouses, and their children. Under this \nrounding-down process, every year when we calculate the new disability \nbenefits veterans will receive as a result of their COLAs, the \nresulting amount is rounded down to the whole dollar.\n  Let me give an example of what I mean. A veteran receives a check, or \nshould receive a check, every month for hypothetically $200.99. What we \nhave done is say to that veteran: We are taking away, every month, that \n99 cents, and you are going to get a check for $200.\n  Now, somebody here may say: Hey, 99 cents is not a lot of money. \nMultiplied by 12 months a year, you are talking about less than $12 a \nyear. What is the problem? Well, the problem is, if you are a low-\nincome veteran, it does matter. But I think even more significantly \nthan the dollars, what we are saying to that veteran who opens that \ncheck, sitting in a wheelchair, we are saving 99 cents a month on you. \nBut by the way, we are giving no-bid contracts out in Iraq which cost \nthe taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, or perhaps billions of \ndollars, and we are going to balance the budget on your 99 cents per \nmonth.\n  So the amount of money we are talking about here is not a whole lot, \nbut symbolically, to thousands of disabled veterans, it says something \nabout how we in the Congress feel about them. We are saving 99 cents a \nmonth. Well, I think we can afford to give that 99 cents to those guys \nin the wheelchairs, the people without one arm, the people who are \nblind, the people who can't hear, the people coming home from Iraq with \ntraumatic brain injury. I think we can afford to give them that 99 \ncents, and that is what this amendment is about. This amendment is \ngoing to cost all of $20 million--$20 million in a bill which is over \n$100 billion.\n  Let me quote from the Independent Budget. I think many Members of the \nSenate know that the Independent Budget is the budget brought together \nby all of the major veterans groups, and this is what they say when \nthey describe this process:\n\n       Disability compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation rates have historically been increased each year \n     to keep these benefits even with the cost of living. However, \n     as a temporary measure to reduce the budget deficit,--\n\n  A temporary measure.\n\n     Congress enacted legislation to require monthly payments, \n     after adjustment for increases in the cost of living, to be \n     rounded down to the nearest whole dollar amount.\n\n  And let's remind ourselves what kind of benefits we are talking \nabout. Disability compensation benefits are benefits that veterans \nreceive if they have a service-related disability and were discharged \nunder other than dishonorable conditions.\n\n  Furthermore, this rounding down applies to what is known as the \nclothing allowance. When veterans have prosthetics or orthopedic \nappliances such as a wheelchair, they understandably have a high chance \nof wearing down or tearing clothing at a faster rate than the average \nperson. In other words, you are in a wheelchair, it rubs, your clothing \ngets worn out. You get help with that. We are rounding down those \nchecks.\n  This is not a complicated piece of legislation. This is legislation \nthat says to people who have done as much as a human being can do for \nthis country that we are no longer going to continue to nickel-and-dime \nyou. I hope very much the Members of the Senate will join me and the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, the Disabled American Veterans, and AMVETS in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  I yield my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, are we in morning business now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, an interesting economic trend is sweeping \nthrough countries around the globe. It is one that started right here \nin the United States, and it would be wise for us to consider some of \nthe amazing results that are being documented internationally.\n  More than 25 years ago, Ronald Reagan took the helm of an economy \nthat was tanking quickly and bringing American families down with it. \nThe economy was shrinking; inflation was in double digits; more than 7 \nmillion Americans were unemployed; and the prime interest rate was \nthrough the roof.\n  Ronald Reagan fought for an aggressive plan to rein in non-defense \ngovernment spending, provide tax relief, and eliminate unnecessary \ngovernment regulation. There were many critics who argued that Reagan's \nplan would create greater inflation. They cried that tax relief would \nbe paid for out of entitlements and leave the elderly and needy worse \noff. However, John F. Kennedy's assertion that a rising tide lifts all \nboats was true.\n  As Reagan prepared to leave the presidency, spending was down, as \nwere tax rates and inflation. Employment had climbed to record \nheights--there more jobs and better, higher paying jobs. Family income \nhad been on the rise for 4 straight years. America's poor were able to \nclimb out of poverty at the fastest rate in 10 years. It marked the \nlongest economic peacetime expansion in history.\n  In his farewell address to the nation in 1989, Reagan stated: Common \nsense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will \nproduce less of it. So, we cut the people's tax rates, and the people \nproduced more than ever before. The economy bloomed like a plant that \nhad been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger.\n  Among the loudest critics of Reagan's philosophy of lower taxes and \nless government regulation were European countries that taxed high to \noffer more social services to their citizens.\n  The tide has changed all right. Countries around the world, including \nthose in Europe, are racing to cut their taxes. France, Spain, Italy, \nSweden,\n\n[[Page S11134]]\n\nRussia, Germany, Poland, Ireland, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Malaysia, \nNew Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.\n  They are cutting business taxes or capital gains taxes or turning to \na flat tax in the name of economic growth. A study of 86 countries last \nyear by KPMG International showed that tax cuts attracted business \ninvestment with minimal loss of old revenue. And that loss was offset \nby new revenue from increased hiring and spending.\n  Does that sound familiar? It is the economic plan that in the 1980s \nhelped raise our Nation out of one of our worst economic situations and \nreach new, undiscovered heights. But instead of maintaining a tried and \ntrue economic path, the party in power is proposing to do just the \nopposite and raise taxes. The rest of the world is competing to lower \ntheir tax rates the fastest in order to attract businesses, jobs, \ninvestment, and wealth. But here, in the United States, Democrats want \nto spend more than $1 billion of the Social Security surplus, increase \nthe national debt by $2 trillion, and raise taxes by an estimated $900 \nbillion--the largest tax hike ever. And their plans contain no \nproposals to cut or eliminate wasteful spending.\n\n  In a Nation where we have always thrived when given the opportunity \nto grow, the Democrats' plan just doesn't make sense. We need to return \nto the principles of Ronald Reagan--we need to trust the American \npeople with their hard-earned money. Let them keep more of it so that \nthey can provide for their families, save and invest for their futures, \nand maybe even take a chance on a business they have been dreaming \nabout.\n  We also need to give businesses the tools to compete in this very \nglobal economy. When countries around the world are lowering their tax \nrates to attract businesses, it puts us in a difficult position. \nCompanies flock to the best environment, so higher tax rates clearly \nput American businesses that want to grow here at a disadvantage. It \nalso puts our workers at a disadvantage when competing against workers \nall over the world.\n  Taxing, spending and stifling opportunity have never been the answers \nto our economic woes. Presently, our economy is healthy and strong \nbecause of tax relief that the Republican Congress provided.\n  But that is the past. The question now becomes, what are we going to \ndo today? The corporate income tax rate in America is the second \nhighest in the industrialized world. Instead of looking at ways to \nraise taxes, I believe this Congress should be looking at ways to make \nus more competitive by lowering taxes. That is the big challenge that \nis before us today: to keep the economy strong, to provide better-\npaying jobs to America. Do we raise taxes, or do we keep taxes low? Do \nwe try to lower those taxes that are too high?\n  I believe the answer is simple. It has been proven by history. It has \nbeen proven by John F. Kennedy and has been proven by Ronald Reagan and \nhas been proven by George W. Bush. We need to take those lessons of \nhistory, learn from them, and expand our economic opportunities, the \nopportunities for jobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we approach the sixth anniversary of \nSeptember 11, 2001, we are reminded of the consequences of ignoring the \nthreat al-Qaida and other ``mufsidoon'' terrorists pose to our Nation. \nAl-Qaida and radical extremists declared war, or ``Hirabah,'' on this \nNation in the early 1990s, and not until 2001 did we finally take that \nthreat seriously. While some in our own country refuse to believe this \nreality, that terrorists--Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri--agree \nthat Iraq is the central front in the war on terror, our entire \nintelligence community testified in open session before the Senate \nIntelligence Committee last January that to retreat from Iraq \nprematurely on a political timetable would invite disaster. They \ntestified that a precipitous withdrawal of American forces would lead \nto chaos, regional sectarian conflict, Shias and Sunnis killing each \nother. It would create a safe haven from which al-Qaida could launch \nfurther and much more robust attacks on America, and it could lead to \nthe possible deployment of troops, this time not to a fledgling \ndemocracy but to prevent the spread of a radical Islamic Caliphate, \nwith a capital in Baghdad and borders reaching from Spain to Indonesia. \nA precipitous withdrawal would also send a message to the enemies of \nfreedom all over the world that the American people lack the resolve to \nwin; that while our brave military cannot be defeated, politicians in \nWashington can; that when the going gets tough, America gets going--\nhome.\n  Next week, General Petraeus will deliver a progress report on the new \nstrategy in Iraq. I expect this report to show that finally we are \nseeing real progress in the security situation in several key areas. \nThis issue should not be a political one, but unfortunately there are \nthose who are politicizing our fight there. This battle is too \nimportant to be used by those who want to declare defeat in Iraq for \ntheir own short-term political gains in 2008, claims such as, ``the war \nis lost,'' and claims that the success of the surge ``misses the \npoint'' are troubling at best and dangerous at the worst.\n  Sadly, there are some in this body who are vested politically in \ndefeat. I find it disappointing that some in Congress would now say \nthey will refuse even to believe General Petraeus, despite the fact \nDemocrats and Republicans unanimously approved his appointment in \nFebruary.\n  General Petraeus takes his responsibility for our troops on the front \nline seriously. He is highly respected, has an outstanding military \ncareer, and should be listened to. I am confident he will deliver a \nreport based on facts on the ground and not political conditions at \nhome.\n  I hope more of my colleagues will listen to our military leaders when \nthey deliver Iraq's progress report. The worst case scenario would be \nfor a majority in Congress to ignore our military leaders and continue \nto demand timetables, withdrawal dates, and attempts to control troop \nmovements. Military decisions must be made by our military commanders \non the ground, not micromanaged by Congress in our wonderful air-\nconditioned hall, thousands of miles away.\n  We have seen what has happened in the past when politicians have \ntried to run a war--from Vietnam to the Iranian hostage crisis.\n  On the political front, I agree that Prime Minister Maliki is not \ngetting the job done, at least not getting the job done on the \ntimetable that we have artificially set, but that much more work needs \nto be done. However, as we have seen for months now, progress is \noccurring from the bottom up at the local level. Our military, our \nleaders, and our troops in the field tell us that they are being \nsuccessful. They are making progress. This is no time to quit.\n  The Al Anbar Province, where I and several Intelligence Committee \nmembers visited a few months ago, has been demonstrating tremendous \nsigns of progress, even back then. This was the area controlled by al-\nQaida just a year ago, where al-Qaida said they were going to establish \nthe headquarters of their evil empire, the Caliphate.\n  In fact, today, General Jim Jones will be releasing his report that \nreached the same conclusion I did after my visit. You saw different \nheadlines in the paper today about that report--not surprising. They \nwanted to focus on other sites. But today's Washington Post reported:\n\n       U.S. and Iraqi alliances with Sunni tribal forces in Anbar \n     province have produced ``real and encouraging'' military \n     progress and intelligence cooperation, and there are \n     promising signs they can be replicated elsewhere.\n\n  It is here, where local tribal leaders and sheiks are cooperating \nwith American and Iraqi Army commanders to take their neighborhoods \nback from al-Qaida. As a result, we have seen a decrease in sectarian \nviolence, an increase in weapons cache discoveries, and some relative \nstability.\n  This is a classic example of how General Petraeus's counterinsurgency \nstrategy, or COIN strategy, is working.\n  We should have had this policy 2 or 3 years ago. But General Petraeus \nhas written a book, the Army and Marine field manual. When he talks \nabout dealing with the counterinsurgency, you go in, you clear, you \nhold, you work with local forces, and you help\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\nthem rebuild. Show them that there is progress that can come when they \ncooperate with those of us who are trying to prevent violence and \nterrorism from taking over their country.\n  When we were there, the marines in Ramadi had just finished \nrebuilding the Blue Mosque, the sacred point for Sunnis in Al Anbar, \nand they are using that. We are working with them.\n  Our military is beginning to replicate these successful lessons in \nother parts of Iraq. Sure progress is slow, but progress is real. With \na new counterinsurgency strategy in place, our military shows the \nmomentum going our way, and with this momentum it is clearly the wrong \ntime to cut the legs out from under them with a new strategy. We are \nwitnessing the increasing likelihood that our troops can find success \nand return home victorious. Even previous critics such as the Brookings \nInstitution's O'Hanlon and Pollack, writing in the New York Times, said \nthis is ``a war we just might win.'' But let me be very clear about one \nthing.\n  Our U.S. national security interest is seeing relative peace and \nstability established and maintained in Iraq for the short and \nintermediate term because only by assuring that stability, and our \ncoalition forces working with Iraqi security forces, can we ensure we \nwill avoid the genocide among Shias and Sunni, the opening of Iraq to a \nsafe haven for al-Qaida and its related terrorist elements, and the \nlikelihood of a regionwide sectarian war, bringing in other countries \nin the region, creating havoc, chaos, threatening Israel, cutting off \noil supplies, and having an international crisis.\n  Long term, we have an interest in seeing real reconciliation and \npolitical accommodation accomplished by the elected officials of the \nIraqi Government. Iraqis are going to have to make those decisions for \nthemselves--who does it and how they do it--but we have to realize that \nbefore you can have political compromise and success, you have to have \nstability.\n  Secondly, political reconciliation takes time. It took a long time to \nput the United States of America together. If you read, as I hope you \nhave, the book about Lincoln's Presidency, ``A Team of Rivals,'' you \nsee even in 1860-1864, we were still fighting those battles in a war at \nthe same time, but Abraham Lincoln persevered and we came through.\n  So not only as a policymaker but as a father concerned about our \nfuture generations, I understand the tremendous sacrifice our troops \nhave made in support of a policy in Iraq. Our troops on the ground have \ntold me, in many different ways, they understand they are making \nprogress. They understand they are making these sacrifices; they are \nwilling to do this for the good of our country. One particular quote \nsticks in my mind when they were first told about the possibility that \nCongress would set arbitrary time limits for withdrawal. Their response \nwas: We have made far too many contributions and too many sacrifices to \nsee it all be for naught.\n  This coming from troops on the ground who have seen their colleagues \nshot up and sent the belongings of lost comrades back home. They made a \ncontribution to the peace and security of the United States, and they \ndo not want us pulling the rug out from under them.\n  Let's remain committed to seeing the job done to protect this country \nfrom the radical and extremist attacks of al-Qaida and others. Our \nNation's security, our credibility in the world, the freedom of \nmillions of Iraqis and many other people threatened by this kind of \nterrorist attempt to establish a caliphate are depending upon us.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen carefully and accept the \nrecommendations of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, two men of \nunquestioned integrity who will be presenting the situation on the \nground, not as we view it on TV, not as some mischaracterize it but \nfrom the people who have the responsibility for our missions, our \nvitally important missions, important not only for Iraq and the Middle \nEast but to our own national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to follow on my distinguished \ncolleague's remarks regarding the situation in Iraq.\n  I had the opportunity to visit there a week ago today. I went to Iraq \nbecause I wanted to see for myself, on the ground, the conditions there \nin advance of General Petraeus's and Ambassador Crocker's report. I am \nhappy to report I believe what I saw was significant military progress.\n  My first stop on the visit was in Tikrit. I got a full briefing there \nof the conditions in this area, which was Saddam Hussein's birthplace, \na place that was well known as a place of a lot of al-Qaida and Sunni \ninsurgent activity.\n  This area was under control. This area was moving in the right \ndirection. Significant progress has been made in pacifying and bringing \nTikrit to a better situation.\n  I had a very interesting visit then to Patrol Base Murray. Patrol \nBase Murray is about 12 to 14 kilometers south of Baghdad by the Tigris \nRiver. It is an area that was totally controlled by al-Qaida a few \nweeks ago. Our brave men and women in uniform moved in as the last \nbrigade of the surge. See, the surge began in the middle of February, I \nguess, but it did not conclude until the last brigade reported for \nduty, and that was in early June, late May. This brigade, the Stryker \nforce, moved into this area under very difficult circumstances, and \nthey have had a battle on their hands. But their commanders reported to \nus that under the most difficult of circumstances, they have made \nincredible progress, and that area is beginning to turn and turn \ndramatically. They are working with the locals. I spoke with an Iraqi \ngentleman who is cooperating and working with our forces there in \ntrying to bring a normalcy of life to people who live in this part of \nIraq and is making progress. It is working not without some losses, not \nwithout the grief of losing one of our valued soldiers and many \ncasualties, but at the same time progress has been made.\n  Under the most difficult of circumstances and intense heat, their \nmorale is incredibly high. The fact is that by all measures, this is a \nsuccessful outcome to this particular aspect of our surge. The surge is \ndoing precisely what it was intended to do, to clear and sustain and \nwork with the locals as partners. All of those things seem to be \nworking as intended, as General Petraeus laid out.\n  I had the opportunity to spend some time with General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker to hear their assessment of the situation and hear \nsome indication of what their report might yield. While we certainly \nneed to allow them to speak for themselves when they come, I did get \nthe definitive impression that the metric they utilized to sense and \nsee whether, in fact, progress is being made, all seem to be moving in \nthe right direction--not evenly, not without setbacks, but certainly \nsignificant progress is being made.\n  The strategy has shifted dramatically. It so happened that as we were \nshifting our strategy, al-Qaida and their excesses had been more than \nthe local Iraqi communities could stand, and so we have had a \nconfluence of interests, as many Iraqi leaders and tribal leaders and \nprovincial leaders have turned against al-Qaida, understanding the way \nof al-Qaida is not the way that would be best for the Iraqi people. So \nthis is a good confluence. This confluence has brought about the kind \nof incredible results the Senator from Missouri was speaking of in Al \nAnbar Province. So I believe a political reconciliation is ultimately \nthe only way in which this will be a successful outcome. But the \nconditions on the ground are beginning to be such so as to allow the \nkind of a peaceful country to then begin the difficult process of \npolitical reconciliation.\n\n  There is no question that the Maliki Government has not delivered as \nhoped, but at the same time, some hopeful signs are beginning to \nemerge. There is no question the political progress lags behind the \nmilitary progress. But I would expect it always would be so. The reason \nthe military surge went ahead is so there could be the conditions for \npolitical progress.\n  Over the last several weeks, there have been meetings that have \nresulted in the beginnings of what I believe to be the political \naccommodations that need to take place. I think particularly important \nare the debaathification law and also the law that would allow for \nlocal and provincial elections. These\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\nwill go a long way toward setting the stage for the kind of political \nreconciliation that ultimately will make Iraq a peaceful country.\n  I wish to touch a moment on the report by General Jones on the \nconditions of the Iraqi military. I got a very positive assessment from \nGeneral Petraeus. Their casualty rate is 3 to 1 to ours. They are \ntaking the fight to the enemy, and they apparently are conducting \nthemselves in stellar fashion.\n  However, they do need our help and will continue to need our help. I \nthink it is important we note, as General Jones reports, that while he \nsees progress by the Iraqi military, surely they are going to be \nneeding our help in logistics and air cover and things such as that for \nsome time to come.\n  There is a big difference between them taking the brunt of the fight, \nwhich I think they are poised to do in the months to come, and still \ncontinuing to need the kind of backup and support that undoubtedly will \ntake longer for them to build. It is a big difference for our military \nto be assisting in logistics than it is to be at the front of the \nbattlefield. I think the Iraqis might be in a position to do so. I do \nnot think there is any question that our goal is a successful Iraq, an \nIraq that will not be a safe haven for al-Qaida, nor will it give Iran \nthe kind of political control over this country that would be \ncataclysmic to the security and stability of the region. That is our \ngoal.\n  As a result of that goal being achieved, then we will be able to \nwithdraw our troops. But the goal ought to not be troop withdrawal at \nall costs. That would be a mistake for our country. It would be a \nmistake for the region. I believe that while progress is difficult and \nthe sacrifices are great, that enough progress is being made for us to \nunderstand the way forward is a way of continuing involvement there \nuntil such time as Iraq has reached the point of stability that they \ncan govern themselves and also provide for their own security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11136-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11136-S11137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2622\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 2622, \nwhich the Senate will be voting on later today offered by Senator \nSalazar.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I must rise to oppose this amendment \nfrom my friend and colleague from Colorado. But this issue is of too \ngreat importance to the men and women who are fighting for our freedoms \naround the world.\n  My colleague has characterized this as an Army versus the ranchers \nand farmers issue. I do not think this is our fighting men in the \nmilitary versus farmers and ranchers, and here is why. Because I \nbelieve there are willing sellers and willing buyers in this particular \ninstance. Private property owners, I have been told, approached the \nArmy and said: Look, we have some land available we want you to \nconsider in your plans to expand a needed training area, for the Army \nto consider looking at dealing with us and selling that land.\n  So I think this particular proposal does not need to be an Army \nversus farmers and ranchers. I think this can be worked out with \ndeliberation and thought during this process. Two years ago, the entire \nColorado congressional delegation made a successful argument to the \nBRAC Commission to keep Fort Carson Army Base in Colorado Springs open. \nWe made a commitment that if the Army kept Fort Carson open and even \nadded soldiers, we would make sure our soldiers stationed there would \nbe provided with adequate training to do their job.\n  The Army kept Fort Carson open and restationed two new brigades, \ntotalling more than 10,000 new soldiers, to the mountain post due to \nthe commitment made by the entire Colorado delegation.\n  It would be hypocritical for us as a delegation to now tell the Army: \nWe want those new soldiers, and we want the economic benefit from those \nnew soldiers, but we are unwilling to do what is required of us as a \nState to ensure that our men and women stationed at Fort Carson are \nprovided with adequate training.\n  This amendment is a horrible precedent that will impact more than \nFort Carson. It is a national security issue at a time when our Nation \nis engaged in armed conflict. Currently, the Army has a backlog of 2 \nmillion acres needed for training. The shortfall is expected to \nincrease to 5 million acres by 2011, according to the Department of the \nArmy's response to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, \nwhich is available for perusal by my colleagues.\n  This issue could be reaching your State. Congress should be working \nwith the Pentagon to address this serious backlog that is hindering the \nArmy's ability to provide adequate training our soldiers need and \ndeserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nopposition to the Salazar amendment from the Secretary of Army, Pete \nGeren.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. According to the Army, the Salazar amendment is too \nrestrictive. It prevents them from doing anything on Pinon Canyon to \nresolve even their differences with the farmers and ranchers, including \nphotocopying handouts or maps to the citizens with questions, holding \ncommunity meetings to find common ground, and even doing a required \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  Senator Salazar and I have offered amendments to last year's and this \nyear's Defense authorization bill to address many of the valid issues \nraised by concerned citizens and elected officials whose communities \nare affected by the proposed expansion of Pinon Canyon, the need for \nany expansion of Pinon Canyon by the Army, and the economic and \nenvironmental impact to southeastern Colorado. I agree with my \ncolleague that the Army needs to answer questions. I agree we need to \nensure the residents and communities impacted by any expansion are part \nof the process and their concerns are addressed. I believe this \namendment would not accomplish those goals but, rather, actually keep \nus from getting needed answers to which they are entitled. Where we \ndisagree is on the approach. This amendment will have long-term \nunintended consequences we could regret. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider those consequences before they vote.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote no on the Salazar amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                        Secretary of the Army,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 6, 2007.\n     Senator Jack Reed,\n     Acting Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Subcommittee on Military Construction, and Veterans' \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Subcommittee on Military Construction, and Veteran's \n         Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Hutchison: I am writing to \n     express the Army's views regarding the Pinon Canyon Maneuver \n     Site (PCMS) in Colorado. The Army wishes to expand the PCMS \n     in order to provide our Soldiers with the best, most \n     realistic, and doctrinally sound training possible.\n       The Army's need for U.S.-based training and maneuver space \n     will increase significantly as a result of the planned return \n     of approximately 70,000 troops from overseas bases. These \n     Soldiers previously conducted much of their training and \n     achieved their readiness standards by using overseas training \n     and maneuver space; the same requirements are now being \n     shifted onto an existing U.S. installation footprint. Adding \n     an increased requirement to a finite amount of training space \n     can be partially managed with work-arounds, but there are \n     limits. At some point, training can become degraded in \n     quality and unrealistic. Moreover, the land itself must also \n     recover from intense training exercises. Adding more training \n     exercises to the same plot of land can pose environmental \n     risks.\n       In addition, changes to technology and the organization of \n     our units requires each Brigade Combat Team (BCT) to be more \n     agile, be more readily deployable, and be able to secure \n     significantly more territory than their Cold-War era \n     counterparts. To properly train our BCTs, they need to meet \n     higher home-station readiness levels than ever before. To \n     attain this readiness, they need adequate space to maneuver \n     under realistic conditions. Shipping units elsewhere is not \n     an acceptable substitute for home-station training because it \n     would take valuable time from Soldiers away from their \n     Families--Soldiers and Families are already bearing tough \n     sacrifices on behalf of the nation.\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\n       The Army has a growing training land shortfall that will \n     reach 5 million acres across the entire country by 2011. Fort \n     Carson is not the only base with projected training land \n     shortfalls, but not all bases have an opportunity to expand \n     to remedy to the problem. The Army has the ability to address \n     some of the overall training land shortfall by acquiring land \n     at PCMS. If the Army is legislatively prevented from \n     expanding PCMS, it will harm the Army's ability to provide \n     necessary and realistic training to units stationed at Fort \n     Carson, as well as Active, Reserve, and Guard units training \n     there.\n       The Army firmly opposes legislation to limit the Army's \n     proposed expansion of PCMS. Indeed, the Army may need to \n     expand other installations around the country, and such \n     legislation could create a dangerous precedent that the Army \n     will forever be locked into its current training and maneuver \n     space footprint regardless of any future changes to \n     organization, technology, doctrine, or threats.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the Army's views as you \n     complete your work on S. 1645.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Pete Geren.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. What is the pending business and the amount of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is still in a period of morning \nbusiness, and the majority controls 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 2 \nminutes of that time, followed by Senator Brown for the remainder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to make sure we don't have \nRepublican colleagues who have a need to speak further in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 40 seconds remaining \nin their allotted time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Very good. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado for his \nviews on this amendment. I also thank him for the work we do together \nin support of our military installations which we consider to be part \nof the crown jewel of the Nation's defense and homeland security, and \nwe often work on those matters together.\n  I will take exception with respect to a characterization concerning \nmy amendment in that there is some inconsistency between what we did in \nthe 2005 BRAC recommendations, which we all supported, and this \nparticular amendment.\n  The fact is, the BRAC, in its findings, said we would move the \nadditional brigades into Fort Carson, that there was sufficient \ncapacity to provide all the training that was required there at Fort \nCarson, and that is because Fort Carson has over 100,000 acres on its \nown site and 235,000 acres of additional land. Now the Army wants to \nacquire land that is going to make the Army's holdings at Pinon Canyon \ngreater than the size of the entire State of Rhode Island. My question \nis, What has changed from January of 2005 until today? What has changed \nis that all of a sudden the Army has decided that it needs all this \nadditional land.\n  I go back to my initial argument, which is, if we care about private \nproperty rights, if we care about the ranchers in southeast Colorado, \nif we care about national security and making sure we are investing \ntaxpayer dollars wisely, then it is important we do a timeout, which is \nall that my amendment does.\n  I urge my Republican and Democratic colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

While the Department of \nDefense has its own set of rules, every other Federal agency, including \nthe Veterans' Administration, is required to take the same \nstraightforward steps to ensure that when outsourcing occurs, which \nsometimes it needs to, it actually improves upon the status quo, not \noutsourcing for the sake of outsourcing or to feed private contractors \nbut outsourcing to serve taxpayers and, in the case of the VA, veterans \nbetter. If any Federal agency should be required to show a good reason \nbefore displacing Government workers, it should be the Veterans' \nAdministration. That is because so many VA employees are actually \nveterans themselves. Arbitrarily firing veterans is not only wrong, it \nis shortsighted. The obstacles to employment are steep enough for \nveterans in too many cases without throwing unjustifiable outsourcing \ninto the mix.\n  Even if we put that aside, taxpayers are not well served when \nGovernment contracts are handed out without regard to the costs or \nbenefits that result. That is one of the many lessons we should have \nlearned from Katrina. It is a lesson we are learning over and over from \nIraq. These lessons don't seem to be sinking in with the \nadministration. The VA is firing many of its blue-collar workers and \nreplacing them with private contractors without going through the \ncompetition process that Congress has called for again and again. It is \nbad enough that the VA is moving forward without actually figuring out \nwhat is in the best interest of taxpayers. Sometimes outsourcing jobs \nmakes sense. More often than not, as we have found, it doesn't. But \nthat question should be asked before any outsourcing is done in every \nsingle case.\n  Making matters worse, four-fifths of the blue-color jobs targeted for \noutsourcing were held by veterans. So the Veterans' Administration is \noutsourcing Government jobs held by veterans to go to private \ncontractors without proving that it is actually saving money. This is \nmore than a paycheck or a path to independence. Sidestepping the rules \nto eliminate their jobs is bad business and bad policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11137-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2642, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2642) making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2687\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe Coleman amendment No. 2687. The amendment requires the use of \nemergency Federal funds paid by taxpayers from every State for security \nat the 2008 Presidential political party conventions in Minneapolis and \nDenver. If the amendment passes, both the Republican and Democratic \npolitical party conventions will each receive $50 million additional in \nFederal taxpayer dollars for State and local law enforcement costs \nassociated with hosting the conventions. The $50 million for the \nMinneapolis convention is on top of the $12.5 million in Federal funds \nthe State also will receive in the current version of the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill. This is all on top of $70 million \neach party receives to host their conventions and run their political \ncampaigns.\n  Spending an additional $100 million in taxpayer funds for political \nconventions in Minneapolis and Denver is pretty outrageous to me. \nStates that bid to host political conventions know that winning the bid \nalso means a high cost for security comes with it. Sure, the cost of \nsecurity after September 11 has gone up, but States and cities that bid \non the 2008 conventions knew that burden at the get-go.\n  Plus, the States will receive an enormous benefit from hosting the \nconventions. I have not heard one person say that the States or cities \nhosting the\n\n[[Page S11138]]\n\nconventions will go bankrupt from holding them. One estimate shows that \nMinneapolis will receive more than $150 million in benefits from \nhosting the convention. Denver will likely receive a similar financial \nbenefit. The millions of dollars in benefits is the main reason cities \nbid to host conventions in the first place. That is why every 4 years \nmany cities bid to host each of the conventions. This windfall comes \nfrom thousands of people staying at the hotels, eating at the \nrestaurants, and shopping in the stores in Denver and Minneapolis. That \nwill result in a lot of sales tax revenue and hotel tax revenue that \nwill stay in each of those cities and States.\n  Paying for security definitely should not put States in the red. It \nis definitely not an unfunded mandate on the States or cities by the \nFederal Government. So if the States are receiving this huge benefit, \nwhy are taxpayers footing over $100 million additional in Federal \nfunding for these political conventions? And how did we determine that \nfigure of $50 million that was needed for each of these cities and \nStates? Was this thoroughly researched? By whom? And what will the \nactual need be for Minneapolis? What will it be for Denver? Why has no \nMember of this body made this case?\n  At the 2004 convention in New York City that I attended, they spent \nabout $58 million in security. Will Minneapolis and Denver, which are \nnot as big as New York and not a major port city, need the same amount \nof funding? It seems we are just throwing taxpayer money needlessly \naround without seriously looking at the situation.\n  The legislation before us today provides over $109 billion for \nveterans and military construction projects all across the Nation. This \nlegislation is supposed to help support our troops who are risking \ntheir lives overseas and to help the veteran men and women who so \nbravely fought for our country. With this in mind, I ask, why are we \nfunding political conventions in this VA-Military Construction \nappropriations bill? What do political conventions have to do with the \nmilitary? This is a combination of oil and water, and the Coleman \namendment is trying to put them together. It doesn't mix.\n  I also have extreme concerns with the use of emergency Federal \nspending to pay for political party conventions--emergency Federal \nspending. This is just a budget gimmick to get around the need to \noffset the funds. I keep saying this over and over, but emergency \nspending should only be for just that--emergencies. Usually emergency \nfunding goes to things such as the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, or \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina, and other major disasters that occur in \nthe United States. It should not go toward nonemergency funding such as \nthe conventions. Come on. Everybody knew, once the winning conventions \ncity and State bids were announced, that security would have to be \nsomehow funded. Holding conventions takes advance planning from States \nand cities and their political parties. All this does not add up to an \nemergency situation requiring emergency Federal funding.\n  The fiscal year 2008 budget resolution allows for a point of order \nagainst amendments such as this that are not true emergency spending. \nIt sets criteria for emergency spending which I do not think this \namendment meets. Emergency spending must be only used for essential, \nsudden, and urgent matters that are unforeseen and not permanent. By my \ncalculations, this amendment meets only one of those requirements, and \nnone of the four other requirements. Because I think the overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate will vote for this amendment, I will not raise \nthe point of order against it.\n  I have been to every Republican convention since 1980. I want to make \nit clear I think security is as important for the Republican and \nDemocratic conventions, but my objections to this amendment concern who \nshould foot the bill for the security. I believe those States and \ncities hosting the conventions should provide that funding. That means \nthose planning the conventions and those benefiting from the \nconventions in Denver and Minneapolis should pick up the security tab, \nnot Federal taxpayers across the country.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose the Coleman amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. This amendment will pass, but we need to \nreevaluate how we finance political conventions in the future. When \ncities make bids to host these conventions, they should also make \npreparations to pay for security and include this information in their \nbids.\n  This emergency funding method, using Federal taxpayers' dollars for \npolitical conventions, is not in the best interest or the best way to \nproceed, and that is why I oppose this amendment. If we think about \nthis, this is the way the old Soviet Union used to fund their \nconventions, which were phony. But the state paid for the whole thing. \nI do not think we should have the same thing happening here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Will the Chair state how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Eighteen minutes. Mr. President, I will allow the \nSenator from Minnesota to use 5 of those minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, my friend from \nKentucky.\n  I want to respond to a couple of concerns he raised.\n  First, I am in total accord with my friend that we need to reevaluate \nhow we fund conventions in the future. There is absolutely no question \nabout that. In a post-9/11 world, these conventions are targets for \nterrorism. These conventions, by the way, are designated as national \nspecial security events, which means the Federal Government actually \nhas overall responsibility for the security, through the Department of \nHomeland Security, Secret Service. They then direct the folks at the \nlocal level. But we need to figure out, in the future when these \nconventions are bid for: How are we going to pay for security?\n  In this case, there are three things that should be responded to. \nFirst, there are appropriations in some other bills, but the total \nsought here is $100 million, and that anything else in any other bill \nwill not be pursued, will be dropped. So the figure--and I think we \nshould be in agreement on that--is $100 million, which is what it was \nin New York and Boston; but we are 4 years later, $50 million for each \nof the cities.\n  I should also note all funds will be audited. That has not been the \ncase in the past. All funds will be audited. We will find out. I think \nwe need to do that for the future to know what are the security needs, \nand, again, to make sure--I have been very insistent to ensure--we have \nan auditing mechanism which we have not had in place before.\n  Third, it is an emergency because the planning for security has to \nbegin now. We have not dealt with it up to this point in time. I would \nnote that the city of St. Paul--and I was the mayor of St. Paul--I \nbelieve their entire budget is $500 million. Their overall budget for \npolice in the course of a year--law enforcement--I think is about $68 \nmillion.\n  Cities do not have the capacity to meet the security needs that are \nbeing imposed on them by the Federal Government, by the Federal \nauthorities. Where I disagree with my friend is, I see this as an \nunfunded mandate. The Department of Homeland Security or the Secret \nService tell local law enforcement: You have to do A, B, C, or D, and \nthat is the Federal Government telling folks at the local level to do \nsomething without giving them the resources. Those are unfunded \nmandates.\n  We live in a world where conventions are natural targets for those \nwho wish to do us harm. As we saw in Germany, the threats are very \nreal. We have a situation where security is the first responsibility of \nGovernment. That is what this is about. It is about security. It is the \nprimary responsibility of Government. National conventions are events \nthat if we are going to continue to have them--and I think we should \nhave them; we could do away with them, if that is what some are \nsuggesting, and I don't think they are--but if we are, we have to have \nsecurity at a level that ensures those who are there--the President \nwill be there, elected officials, citizens, and they are targets.\n  They have been designated national special security events and, \ntherefore,\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\nwe have to fund them. This will fund the conventions. I will work with \nmy friend from Kentucky as we work forward in the future to make sure \nwe address up front the cost of security. But it is not reasonable to \nargue the city of Denver or the cities of St. Paul-Minneapolis would \nhave the capacity to institute the security they are required to do. So \nwe stepped forward at the first post-9/11 convention in New York. We \nhad security there. The Federal Government played a role. We will \ncontinue to play a role in the future. It is the right thing to do. I \nthink it is the responsibility of Government.\n  Again, as a former local elected official, were I sitting in the \nmayor's office, there is no doubt I would be saying, yes, we have this \nopportunity, but we need to make sure, in the end, it can be funded. \nThis is clearly a Federal responsibility. The States and cities will do \ntheir part, but we have a part to play also.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my friend from \nMinnesota.\n  First of all, it was only $25 million put in the New York security \nbill for the 2004 convention in New York, which I attended. My concern \nand my wonder is: Why did Minneapolis-St. Paul in Minnesota, bid at all \nfor the convention, or Denver, CO? Why did they bid? Did they bid to \nlose money? Did they bid to attract people into their States so they \ncould make money on the conventions?\n  I was on the Republican National Committee for 8 years and was \ninvolved in three national conventions. We went to Detroit, Dallas, and \nNew Orleans. All of those cities were pre-9/11, but all of those cities \nwere responsible for the security.\n  Now, after 9/11, the people who are bidding--and there were more than \njust those two cities bidding. In fact, there were five that were \nnarrowed down to three, and, finally, Minneapolis-St. Paul was chosen \nby the Republicans. The same thing occurred on the Democratic side, \nwhere there were five, and then down to three, and then down to one in \nDenver, CO.\n  Now, they knew there was going to be a cost for security after 9/11. \nThey had to build that security cost into their bid for the convention. \nIf they did not do that, they were poor planners. The mandates that \ncome from the Federal Government were known prior to the bids being \nmade because we had already experienced a New York convention which was \nheld in a much bigger city with many more ports and many more people \nand many more police than there are now in Minneapolis-St. Paul or \nDenver, CO.\n  So it does not wash, the fact that this is an unfunded mandate from \nthe Federal Government, because all of these cities that bid knew there \nwere going to be additional costs for security if they were successful \nin hosting the convention.\n  The way it is done with emergency spending is a farce. We do this \nwhen we cannot pay for it in the normal budgeted manner. It is a \ngimmick used in budgeting when you do not want to pay for something in \nthe year that you spend the money. I am shocked this is going to pass \nby the margin it will pass. I sincerely believe we need our conventions \nand we need to nominate whomever we nominate for President and Vice \nPresident on both the Democratic and Republican side, but I almost am \nat a loss for words we would use emergency spending for the conventions \nand for something that should have been planned for by the cities and \nStates that are going to host the current conventions in 2008.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and seeing no \none seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2687\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I call up my amendment No. 2687. It should be at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Coleman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2687.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for security associated with the national \n                           party conventions)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n       Sec. __.  For an addtional amount $100,000,000, with \n     $50,000,000 each to the Cities of Denver, Colorado, and St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, shall be available to the Department of \n     Homeland Security for State and local law enforcement \n     entities for security and related costs, including overtime, \n     associated with the Democratic National Convention and \n     Republican National Convention in 2008. The Department of \n     Homeland Security shall provide for an audit of all amounts \n     made available under this section, including expenditures by \n     State and local law enforcement entities. Amounts provided by \n     this section are designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me suggest the absence of a quorum before I do \nthat, just to inform the other side, and then we can proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 2666 by Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not actually been proposed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The amendment was on the unanimous consent request \nlist last night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the order will be so \nmodified.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I do want to say in regard to amendment No. 2666, the \nMcConnell amendment, which if it has not been formally proposed, I want \nto say it is regarding the Chemical Demilitarization Program that is in \nthe Department of Defense. I just want to assure the Senator from \nKentucky that this committee will work with the Armed Services \nCommittee to ensure that the program stays on schedule. It is a very \nimportant program. The Department of Defense does want to continue the \nprogram, and we will work with the Armed Services Committee to assure \nthat.\n  I would certainly ask the chairman of the committee if that is his \nwish as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator McConnell is proposing additional \nresources for the Bluegrass chemical demilitarization facility. It is a \nvery important project. It is one we funded already in the bill. I can \nassure the Senator from Texas that I will work with my colleagues on \nthe House Armed Services Committee to allow additional resources going \nforward, perhaps through reprogramming, so that we can achieve Senator \nMcConnell's goal, which is to as quickly as possible put this facility \ninto operation to begin to eliminate some of these chemical weapons we \nhave had in our inventory for many years.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, and I \nappreciate very much his cooperation. I agree with him completely and \nwith the Senator from Kentucky that we need to continue this program, \nand we will all work together to assure that the funding is there.\n  Mr. President, let me just ask a parliamentary inquiry now. We had \ntold our colleagues we would start voting at 11 o'clock, and I was just \ngoing to ask the status of that information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Coleman and Senator Bunning will \ndivide 2 minutes on the Coleman amendment prior to the vote. We then \nwill begin the first vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. And have the yeas and nays been called for?\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on \namendment No. 2687.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote to be taken in relation to amendment \nNo. 2687 offered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The senior Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry before my time \nbegins: Has the amendment been called up and read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been called up, and it has \nbeen read. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, two points of clarification.\n  Both New York and Boston received $50 million each. There were \napparently two separate appropriations, but they each received $50 \nmillion, and that is what Denver and St. Paul-Minneapolis are seeking \nhere.\n  The second point I wish to tell my colleagues is that all funds in \nhere will be ordered. There is a specific ordering provision in this \namendment that has not been in previous amendments or previous funding \nof conventions.\n  Third, the Department of Homeland Security has designated these \nconventions as national special security events. As such, the Secret \nService will be directing the local units of government regarding \nsecurity needs. Without Federal assistance, the security costs \nassociated with these events are essentially unfunded mandates.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask themselves what are the consequences of \nnot providing this critical emergency funding. The planning has to \nstart now. We all know security risks are real. Look at what happened \nin Germany yesterday. It is our responsibility as Senators to make sure \nlocal law enforcement offices that will be working tirelessly to \nprotect these events have the resources they need. Security is the \nfirst responsibility of Government. This funding is for security. \nFrankly, I wouldn't want to be standing on the Senate floor a year from \nnow saying I wish we had done more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is as though we didn't know 9/11 \noccurred, that the security risk for a convention in 2004 and 2008 \nwould not be planned for in the bid by the hosting cities. Then for the \nFederal Government to step in and use emergency funding as a tool, a \nbudget gimmick tool to fund this $50 million extra because Minneapolis-\nSt. Paul and Denver didn't plan well for their conventions--I don't \nthink it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to budget this \nas an emergency spending bill, so I urge the defeat of the Coleman \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), and the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) is \nabsent attending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used during fiscal year 2008 to \n     round down dollar amounts to the next lower whole dollar for \n     payments of the following:\n       (1) Disability compensation under section 1114 of 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (2) Additional compensation for dependents under section \n     1115(1) of such title.\n       (3) Clothing allowance under section 1162 of such title.\n       (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving \n     spouse under subsections (a) through (d) of section 1311 of \n     such title.\n       (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children under \n     sections 1313(a) and 1314 of such title.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to the \nvote in relation to the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering has the \nsupport of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nDisabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and \nAMVETS, and it is cosponsored by Senator Menendez.\n  In a $109 billion piece of legislation, this $20 million amendment is \nnot significant from a monetary perspective. It is, however, very \nsignificant in terms of the message we send to veterans throughout our \ncountry, especially disabled veterans, the men and women who have lost \narms and legs defending us, who move around in wheelchairs, who are \nblind and/or deaf.\n  In the 1990s, as a temporary measure, Congress initiated the so-\ncalled rounding down of veterans' disability benefits. Under this \nrounding-down process, a disabled veteran who is supposed to receive, \nfor example, a check for $200.99 has that 99 cents taken away from him \nand only gets the $200.\n  A veteran in a wheelchair opens his envelope check every month and is \nreminded that the United States Government is saving 99 cents a month. \nWhat a message that sends to the veterans.\n  This is an important amendment. It should be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2664.\n  The amendment (No. 2664) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REED. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2662\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis the Salazar amendment. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to the amendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in this Chamber, on \nthe Republican side and the Democratic side, to vote yes on this \namendment. In February of this year, the Army announced that it wanted \nto acquire an area the size of Rhode Island in the southeastern part of \nmy State. I am not opposed to the possibility of expanding the Pinon \nCanyon Maneuver Site, but what we are asking for in our amendment is \nthat we have a 1-year timeout for us to study the training capacity \nneeds of the Army.\n  If my colleagues care about private property rights, vote for this \namendment. If they care about the ranchers of America and the ranchers \nof southeastern Colorado, I ask for a ``yes'' vote. And if they care \nabout national security and making sure we are fiscally responsible in \nhow we invest our money, vote yes on this amendment. I ask for a \n``yes'' vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this issue boils down to just a few \nimportant points. First and foremost, denying the Army the opportunity \nto explore expansion efforts at a time when the Army is facing a \ntraining land shortfall is not in our national security interests.\n  Second, this amendment will tie the hands of the Army. The language \nis so restrictive that it will prevent them from providing information, \nhandouts, or holding community meetings to find common ground for \nconducting an environmental impact statement which will be important to \nthe decisionmaking process.\n  Last, we do need to remember that property rights should be \nprotected, and we are doing that through other amendments which the \nArmy supports.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Secretary of the Army called me \nthis morning and said if they cannot continue to plan for the expansion \nworking with the community that it will hamper their efforts in \ntraining. It will require them to go to other places for training. It \nwill cause the troops to have to train longer periods.\n  They absolutely are against this amendment, and they are against the \nprecedent of having Congress say: You cannot continue with expansion \nplans that are on the books.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I point out that a similar measure passed \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 383 to 35 on a bipartisan \nbasis, strongly supported in the House.\n  Also, during the BRAC process, the Army determined the capacity of \nFort Carson was adequate for the brigades stationed there.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Salazar amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2662.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to expand the boundaries or size \n              of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, Colorado)\n\n       On page 50, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 408.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used for any action that is \n     related to or promotes the expansion of the boundaries or \n     size of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, Colorado.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2662.

None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act or any other Act for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs may be used in a manner that is inconsistent \n     with--\n       (1) section 842 of the Transportation, Treasury, Housing \n     and Urban Development, the Judiciary, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-115; 119 \n     Stat. 2506); or\n       (2) section 8110(a)(5) of title 38, United States Code.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are now 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the vote in relationship to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Congress again and again has called on \nFederal agencies to ensure that before work is contracted out we first \nsee if Federal employees can perform their jobs as well as their \nprivate-sector counterparts. That is only fair to taxpayers as well as \nto employees. The VA is trying to contract out the work of its blue-\ncollar employees, some four-fifths of whom are veterans themselves, \nwithout bothering to see if they can perform as well as their private \ncompetition.\n  This amendment, cosponsored with Senator Webb, simply reiterates the \nlanguage we have adopted before that there must be a public-private \ncompetition before work is contracted out. I hope we can adopt the \namendment overwhelmingly to send a message to the VA that this isn't a \nDemocratic-Republican issue, this is simply good government. It is the \nright thing for American taxpayers and the right thing for veterans--\nthose being given care and those workers who are veterans who support \nthat mission.\n  I yield back my remaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that would tie \nthe hands of the Veterans' Administration in trying to make the most \nand the best use of taxpayer dollars. It would prohibit contracting out \nif 10 Federal employees are doing a job.\n  We ought to be trying to promote the Veterans' Administration for \nbeing efficient. We should be promoting using taxpayer dollars wisely, \nnot a protectionist amendment, where Congress would tie the hands of \nthe Veterans Affairs Department. I hope we will defeat this amendment.\n  We already have the capability to affirm that it is in the best \ninterest of the VA to contract out. The VA is required to come to \nCongress to say it is in the interest of the VA that the contracting \nout be done. But to say no contracting out if there are 10 Federal \nemployees doing a job is absolutely wrong, and it is going in the wrong \ndirection for efficiency of our taxpayer dollars.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 2642, the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill. This is an important bill, one that makes \nthe necessary investments in caring for our veterans, in improving the \nquality of life for our military families, and in building and \nimproving the facilities integral to our military's current and future \nmission and our national security. The legislation provides $64.7 \nbillion in discretionary funding, which is $4 billion above the \nPresident's budget request. Frankly, the President's request was \ninsufficient, so I support the Appropriations Committee's \nrecommendation.\n  The bill offers substantial new investments in health care for \nAmerica's veterans and takes into consideration the unique needs of our \nservice men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. By \nincreasing critical investments in medical services, which include \ntreatment of traumatic brain injury, TBI, and post traumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD, for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, providing the \nfunding necessary to hire new claims processors to address the VA's \nbacklog, and investing in VA repair and maintenance necessary to \nprevent another Walter Reed-type situation, the bill addresses key \nshortcomings in our veterans health care system.\n  The bill also addresses key quality-of-life and mission-related needs \nfor all U.S. troops and their families. I am grateful it includes $265 \nmillion for construction of facilities at Aberdeen Proving Ground, \nPatuxent River, Suitland, Fort Detrick, and Fort Meade in recognition \nof the growing and critical role these Maryland installations play in \nour national defense.\n  As stated in the Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, Commission \nReport, the primary goal for the 2005 BRAC process was military \ntransformation. While acknowledging the need to save money, the \nCommission went beyond a business model analysis, giving military value \ncriteria priority consideration. Of critical importance to communities \nin Maryland and to citizens across the Nation, the bill provides $8.17 \nbillion for BRAC 2005 to implement the base closures and realignments \nthat the Commission determined are critical to our military's current \nand future mission. This includes over $700 million for the \nconstruction of crucial facilities at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Indian \nHead, Andrews Air Force Base, Fort Meade, and the Bethesda National \nNaval Medical Center.\n  Given the critical nature of these appropriations, you can imagine my \nconcern when I read the Statement of Administration Policy on this \nbill. President Bush, it seems, thinks that such investments in our \nveterans and our military infrastructure are ``excessive.'' While he \nhas indicated that he will not veto H.R. 2642, he has threatened to \nveto other appropriations bills unless we find ways to cut spending in \nthose measures equal to the spending--$4 billion--in this bill that \nexceeds his request.\n  This administration, which has consistently underestimated the \nresources it would take to fund our military and care for our veterans, \npromises that it is ``closely tracking the ongoing cost of providing \nfor our veterans.'' When it comes to bases, troops, and veterans, we \nshouldn't be cutting corners or scrambling later to make up for earlier \nmistakes. It is our duty to pass this bill and fully fund the veterans \ninitiatives and military construction projects it contains.\n  I applaud Senators Byrd, Cochran, Johnson, Hutchison, and Reed and my \nother colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their excellent \nwork and look forward to quick passage of this critical legislation.\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I helped craft the 2008 Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill and I am proud of the \npriorities we set for our military.\n  There is no more important time than now to show our support for our \ntroops. Nearly 200,000 American service men and women are fighting in \nIraq and Afghanistan. More than 1.5 million have served valiantly since \nthese wars began. Of these, more than 33,000 servicemembers have come \nfrom New Jersey.\n  This legislation will provide critical funding to ensure that those \nin our military who sacrifice in defense of our country now and those \nwho did so in the past are given the best care.\n  Overall veterans funding will increase 18 percent over last year's \nlevels, supporting physical and mental care, the administration of the \nVeterans' Administration, VA, health system, and VA medical facilities.\n  The Veterans Health Administration will receive an increase of $4.6 \nbillion to help care for our wounded warriors, to treat both their \nphysical injuries and increasingly common mental trauma, including \npost-traumatic stress disorder.\n  This appropriations bill also aims to strengthen our military bases, \nproviding $21 billion for military construction efforts and \ninfrastructure improvements at bases, including those in New Jersey, \nand to support projects related to the Defense Base Realignment and \nClosure Act, BRAC, of 2005.\n  We are all proud of the work being done at military bases in our home \nStates and nationwide, and it is vital that we support their missions \nnow and in the future.\n  But I must take a moment to alert my colleagues to troubling \ninformation that has come to light since the Appropriations Committee \ncompleted work on this bill.\n  Fort Monmouth, based in New Jersey, is the Army's primary \nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance facility. The Army's work \nat Fort Monmouth is critical to the safety of America's military men \nand women and to the success of their missions. The intelligence \nsupport it provides goes directly to our troops in the field, making \nthem more effective fighters and protecting their lives and the lives \nof those around them.\n  Over the next 5 years, researchers at Fort Monmouth are slated to \ndevelop significant innovations for our Armed Forces, such as Warlock \nJammers, which emit radio frequencies that interfere with the signals \nthat set off improvised explosive devices--infamously known as IEDs.\n  The Jammer was engineered at Fort Monmouth and modified for use in \nIraq. The military was able to deploy them within 60 days of their \ndevelopment, and they save American lives.\n  But despite the critical value of this and other innovations at the \nFort, the BRAC Commission in 2005 voted to close Fort Monmouth.\n  It goes without saying that no Senator wants to see a base close in \nhis or her State. And it is not only New Jersey that will suffer a loss \nof jobs and economic activity because of the 2005 BRAC process.\n  But the situation with Fort Monmouth is unique and casts a shadow on \nthe entire base closure process.\n  As we learn more information about the closure of Fort Monmouth, it \nbecomes increasingly clear that this was a flawed process based on \nfaulty estimates that must be thoroughly investigated.\n  The first and most pressing question is how this closure will affect \nour troops in the field, given the crucial work Fort Monmouth does for \nongoing missions overseas.\n  Simply put, Fort Monmouth is strategically vital to our military and \nto the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Anticipating this alarming problem, the BRAC Commission specifically \nincluded a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to prove that \nclosing Fort Monmouth will not harm troops in the field.\n  The caveat required the Pentagon to submit a report to Congress \nensuring ``that movement of organizations, functions, or activities \nfrom Fort Monmouth to Aberdeen Proving Ground will be accomplished \nwithout disruption of their support to the Global War on Terrorism.'' \nThe GAO is then expected to review and audit the report.\n  Yet more than 2 years after the BRAC Commission vote, the \nadministration has failed to produce this report.\n  Even worse, the Army is trying to move personnel out of Fort Monmouth \nbefore it has even considered the effect on our military.\n  This is unacceptable. No personnel should leave Fort Monmouth and be \ntransferred to Aberdeen, MD, before the Department of Defense reports \nto Congress that the closure of Fort Monmouth will not hurt our troops \nin the field.\n  But that is only one of the reasons why the BRAC decision to close \nFort Monmouth is so controversial and so flawed.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that only about 20 percent of the \nhighly trained and highly skilled workforce who work at the Fort--from \nengineers to scientists--appear willing to move to Maryland.\n  This is far fewer than the rosy forecast of 75 percent that was \nprovided to the BRAC Commission in 2005.\n  Again, we must ask how this shortage of expertise will affect the \ncritical operations and technology that Fort Monmouth currently \nprovides to our military.\n  Furthermore, the costs of closing Fort Monmouth are skyrocketing and \ncall into question the very cost-savings rationale upon which BRAC \ndecisions are made.\n  This argument was made by many in 2005, but the warnings were \nignored. And as more facts come to light, it becomes apparent that the \nBRAC Commission was not given all of the information that it should \nhave had to make its decision.\n  The original cost estimate for closing the fort was $780 million.\n  But according to the Army's own budget request for the fiscal year \n2008, that cost has now nearly doubled to $1.5 billion.\n  We all know that the cost overruns are not limited to the closure of \nFort Monmouth.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service has calculated that \noverall BRAC costs have increased from initial estimates of $17 billion \nto a current projection of $32 billion.\n  There are also signs that the true costs of closing Fort Monmouth may \nhave been ignored in 2005. There is mounting evidence that the Pentagon \nknew, or should have known, that the cost estimates it gave the BRAC \nCommission related to the closure of Fort Monmouth were not correct. A \nJuly 2005 memo from Fort Monmouth officials detailed significant cost \nerrors in the Pentagon's estimates, but the information in that memo \nwas never received by the BRAC Commission.\n  For these reasons I, joined by Senator Menendez and our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives, have asked both the Government \nAccountability Office and Defense Department's inspector general to \ninvestigate the decision to close Fort Monmouth.\n  There is over $200 million in this bill for military construction at \nAberdeen, MD.\n  While I understand this committee's desire to continue funding \npursuant to the 2005 BRAC Commission decisions, I must caution that the \nclosure of Fort Monmouth and the transfer of its critical operations \nneeds to be reexamined in light of these facts and the investigations \nand reports that are underway.\n  I would also note that Senator Menendez and I have introduced \nlegislation to change the BRAC process by calling for a review of major \nbase closures that result in excessive cost overruns of over 25 \npercent.\n  I hope my colleagues will see the wisdom of this legislation and \nsupport it in the coming months.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues for moving so \nrapidly through the Military Construction legislation. It brings us to \nthe State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which Senator Gregg, \nmy friend and neighbor from New Hampshire, and I will be handling. I \nwant to make a couple comments.\n  If there are Senators who have amendments, I urge that they bring \nthem to the floor. I understand because of the policy luncheons, it \nwill probably be about an hour before we get to an amendment. But if \nthere aren't any amendments pending, it would be my intent, if the \nSenator from New Hampshire has none, to go to final passage. We would \nlike to wrap up this bill, if we can, today. I thank both Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell for calling up this bill. I also thank Chairman \nByrd and Ranking Member Cochran for the allocation we have.\n  I do want to say, at the risk of causing political problems for him \nback in my neighboring State of New Hampshire, how appreciative I am to \nSenator Gregg and his staff for the bipartisan way they worked with me \nand my staff. Senator McConnell and I had established this way of doing \nthings for a number of years, when he was chairman and I was chairman. \nWe realized that, almost like the Vandenberg rule, bipartisanship has \nto begin at the water's edge. We have tried to do that with this bill.\n  We have a balanced bill. When it was reported out of the \nAppropriations Committee, 28 of the 29 members of the committee voted \nfor it.\n  As a housekeeping matter, I remind Senators that on August 2, 2007, \nby a vote of 83 to 14, the Senate approved S. 1, the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act, clearing the measure for the President. This \nact will significantly improve transparency and accountability in the \nlegislative process.\n  The President has not yet signed it, but I want to inform Senators \nthat we intend to abide by the requirements of that legislation during \nthe consideration of this bill. The legislation requires that the \nchairman of the committee of jurisdiction certify that certain \ninformation related to congressionally directed spending be identified \nand that the required information be available on a publicly accessible \ncongressional Web site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before \na vote. The information required includes the identification of the \ncongressionally directed spending and the name of the Senator who \nrequested it.\n  With regard to this legislation, I notify my colleagues that the \ncommittee bill and report do not include any congressionally directed \nspending as defined by S. 1. A description of how the committee \naddresses this issue is contained in the committee report numbered 110-\n128, dated July 10 of this year. It has been on the Internet for a \ncouple months.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the certification by \nthe chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator BYRD: I certify that the information that will be \n     required by S. 1, when it becomes law, related to \n     congressionally directed spending, has been identified in the \n     Committee report numbered 110-128, filed on July 10, 2007, \n     and that the required information has been available on a \n     publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable \n     format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator Gregg and I did, of course, do our best to address \nthe many requests we received. We have made some difficult choices. The \nbill contains a total of $34.4 billion in budget authority. The \nPresident has threatened to veto all appropriations bills that are \nabove his budget request. This bill is $700 million below the \nPresident's budget request. In case anybody did not hear that, it is \n$700 million below the President's budget request.\n  We have a significant increase for State Department and U.S. Embassy \noperations and security costs. We provide $1.35 billion for assessed \ncontributions to international peacekeeping missions. These are \npeacekeeping missions the U.S. Government has voted for in Sudan, \nLiberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Lebanon, and other \nnations.\n  We provide $5.09 billion to combat HIV/AIDS. That is $940 million \nabove the President's request but within the overall budget limits. \nThis includes $590 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria. Added to the $300 million in the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services bill, it is a total of $890 million for the \nGlobal Fund, an increase of $166 above last year's budget.\n  The bill contains $476.5 million for Child Survival and Maternal \nHealth. These programs address the most basic public health needs in \nthe world's poorest countries.\n  In our country, we are blessed with so many riches. For a child born \nhere, almost always maternal health care and child health care is \navailable. They\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\ncan believe the water they are going to drink will be clean water. They \ncan be given a schedule where the child will be given certain shots, \ninoculations, and so on, at certain times. In all likelihood--barring \nan accident or rare disease--that child is going to grow up.\n  In so many of these other countries, they do not even list a child's \nbirth until they are 2 years old because of the enormous number who die \neither in childbirth, where the mother can die also, or die of diseases \neasily controlled--dysentery, malaria, things such as that--before the \nchild is even old enough to walk.\n  I would say it is not an economic issue with us. We are blessed with \nthe wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth. We are so blessed. I \nthink it is a moral responsibility for us to help in these areas.\n  We provide $509 million for educational and cultural exchange \nprograms, particularly to build bridges with predominantly Muslim \ncountries. We should have these exchanges. We should have as many \nstudents coming to America as possible, and as many of our students \ngoing over to these other countries as possible. Maybe they will learn \nsome languages. Maybe they will learn different cultures. Maybe our own \nstudents will come back having learned there is a world outside our \nborders, but those who come here will learn something about the United \nStates.\n  We provide lifesaving programs for millions of destitute refugees and \ndisplaced persons in Darfur, Iraq, the Middle East, and Colombia. More \nthan 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes. Many of these people have \nworked for the U.S. Government or U.S. contractors or the U.S. news \nmedia and are being targeted because of those affiliations. They cannot \neven get help in getting out of there. They supported us. Now--whether \none was for or opposed to the war in Iraq, these people helped us--it \nis time for us to help them. Other Iraqis are being killed simply \nbecause they are academic scholars or officials of Iraq's Ministry of \nEducation. We have a moral responsibility to help these people.\n  There is up to $1 billion in the bill for humanitarian and \nreconstruction programs in Afghanistan to help counter the resurgence \nof the Taliban and al-Qaida.\n  The bill provides $1.2 billion for the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation. We support the Millennium Challenge Corporation, but they \nhave had $6 billion appropriated since 2004, and they have only \ndisbursed about $100 million. I felt they ought to use some of the \nundisbursed money they already have, to give us some of the other money \nfor much greater needs.\n  There are provisions in the bill considering international family \nplanning the President said he would veto. That is no surprise. We have \nhad these provisions in past bills. These are the same provisions that \nhave been in the State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill year \nafter year. Every year, the President says he will veto it because of \nit. We will have time for that debate later on.\n  But I recall what Senator Mark Hatfield, the then-chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, said. Mark Hatfield--a strong right-\nto-lifer, as strongly opposed to abortion as anybody else I have ever \nmet--pointed out those family planning moneys actually cut down on \nabortions around the world. When they have been cut off, abortions have \ngone up. Sometimes we should get beyond the sloganeering.\n  President Reagan, God rest his soul, used to give some speeches about \nhow we needed a Constitutional amendment to ban abortions. Of course, \nhe never supported one here and never asked to have one introduced. But \nit was a great speech. Many objected to President Clinton because he \nwas pro-choice. Now we are back to somebody who is a right-to-lifer. \nBut do you know what. As a matter of curiosity, abortions went up under \nPresident Reagan. They went down under President Clinton. Now they are \ngoing back up again. I wish we would never have abortions, but let us \ngive alternatives to abortion in family planning. Sometimes the reality \nshames the rhetoric. The fact is, abortions went up during President \nReagan's time, and they went down during President Clinton's time, and \nthey are going back up now.\n  The same thing can happen here. Give people family planning money and \nabortions will go down. We saw this in Russia. We have seen it \ncategorically in other parts of the world. But that will be a debate \nfor later on.\n  My main point coming here was to say we would not have gotten the \nbill out with this kind of huge bipartisan support without the strong \nhelp of the former Governor, now Senator, Judd Gregg.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me join and participate in expressing \nmy appreciation to Senator Leahy and his staff for bringing forward a \nbill that is a reasonable bill. It is within the budget requested by \nthe President. In fact, it is a little bit underneath it. It has a very \nstrong commitment to the right priorities, and Senator Leahy deserves \ngreat credit. He has been instrumental on the issue of how we proceed \nin foreign policy for many years. Prior to my assuming this ranking \nposition, Senator McConnell and he worked together hand in hand to \naddress these issues, which cover the globe, are complicated but have a \nhuge impact on an awful lot of lives.\n  I appreciate his exceptional work in this area, and I appreciate the \nfact he has brought forward a piece of legislation which I am happy to \nsupport with enthusiasm. There are some issues, obviously, on policy \nwhich hopefully will be straightened out and which have been alluded \nto. They are primarily the issues of Mexico City and the Kemp-Kasten \nlanguage. But the bill itself is basically a very strong bill, and it \nis within the budget as requested by the President. Therefore, \nhopefully, we can get the Mexico City language straightened out and \nmove on to passing the bill.\n  His staff--Tim Rieser and the Democratic staff--have been \nextraordinarily fair to our staff--Paul Grove and our people on this \nside--and we appreciate their courtesy. When we raised issues, they \ntried to address them and resolve them.\n  I wish to point out a few highlights in this bill. The chairman has \nmentioned a number of them. I think it is important to recognize we are \na compassionate Nation, committed to trying to help people who we see \nin need. This bill reflects that innate quality of the American people. \nIt is one of our great characteristics as Americans that we as a nation \nand as a people try to reach out to those who have not been dealt quite \nas good a hand as we have been dealt and try to help them across the \nglobe.\n  We use a lot of American taxpayers' dollars to do that. People work \nhard for those dollars. When we spend them in other countries, people \nwant to be sure, of course, they are spent well, and they want to be \nsure they are getting results. They expect them to be spent to benefit \nregions of the world that have not been quite as lucky as we have been.\n  That is why the commitment in this bill to AIDS, which is huge--$5 \nbillion--is important. It is something that has been bipartisan. The \nPresident has clearly taken the lead on this issue. This committee has \nstrongly supported those initiatives.\n  We also have made a very significant effort in the area of \nhumanitarian aid dealing with migration and refugee assistance and with \ninternational disaster assistance. That is what these dollars are used \nfor. When you go out and you meet folks, as all of us do--that is one \nof the fun parts of doing this job, representing our constituents and \nhearing from them--sometimes--actually, not that often in New Hampshire \nand I suspect not that often in Vermont, but sometimes you hear people \nsay: What are we sending all this money overseas for? Those are dollars \nwe worked hard for and could spend here in America.\n  Well, we spend them overseas, first, because we are a nation which is \nblessed--and we understand others are not--and when we see things we \ncan try to help with, such as the AIDS epidemic in Africa. We also send \nthese dollars overseas because, quite honestly, it benefits us. It is \nthat simple: It benefits us. It benefits us on two levels.\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\n  First, it benefits us on a national security level. Most or many of \nthese dollars which we spend under this bill essentially go to \ncountries which undertake actions which assist us in our national \nsecurity and pick up burdens which we might otherwise have to pick up, \nnot only with dollars but also with American troops being at risk. So \nit is a good investment from that standpoint.\n  Also, we basically are a trading nation. Our great success as an \neconomy is the fact we are engaged, we are the international economy. \nParticipating in that economy is critical to creating jobs and economic \nbenefit here. Thus, we use these dollars, to a significant degree, to \nstabilize regions and give them economic viability. Quite simply, we \ncan then participate in that economic viability by selling them goods--\nproducts or services--which we manufacture or make in the United \nStates.\n  Again, it benefits us. So these dollars which we spend--and they are \nsignificant; $34 billion is a lot of money--are dollars which we spend \nwell, I believe, on behalf of the American people in most instances.\n  In this bill, for example, we significantly assist the military \nefforts of the nations of Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other \nallies around the globe. We have increased the funding, for example, \nrather significantly to the country of Jordan. Let's take that as an \nexample.\n  Here is a country right in the middle of the Middle East, which is a \nlinchpin in the Middle East which represents stability, represents a \nforward-thinking Government, that cares for its people and wants its \npeople to succeed but does not have the resources of many of those \nnations in the Middle East that have the good fortune to have oil or \ngas. Yet they take on responsibility that we would have to otherwise \ntake on. They take on massive numbers of refugees from Iraq, which has \nstrained significantly their infrastructure and their educational \nsystem and the culture.\n  We have some obligation, I believe, to support a country which is \nwilling to take these types of steps to assist its neighbors but also \nhas duress to some degree because of our efforts in that region. So \nthat is why I think increasing the funding for Jordan is very \nappropriate. I certainly hope we will be able to maintain that as we \nmove through the entire process.\n  There are no earmarks in this bill. We obviously have had quite a \nbattle in this Congress over how many earmarks people should have, what \ntypes of earmarks people should have. This bill is pretty much earmark \nfree. In fact, unless you consider funds going to a foreign government \nrequested by the President as an earmark, there are virtually no \nearmarks in this bill, for which, again, I congratulate the chairman \nfor that sort of leadership. As he said, he is complying with S. 1, \nwhich passed this body back in July. It has not been signed yet, but we \npresume it will be, or at least the language relative to how earmarks \nin appropriations bills are handled will certainly go into force. So I \ncongratulate the chairman for pulling this bill together in that form.\n  I wish to speak briefly, though, about one area which I am concerned \nabout and which I find to be a bit of an affront--more than a bit--a \nreal affront, and that is dollars which we are allocating to certain \nactivities in this international arena which are being wasted, they are \nbeing fraudulently handled, they are being used for patronage or there \nis simple corruption, which is stealing. We have three examples of that \nwhich are rather severe. We are missing $8 billion, minimum--remember, \nthe number, I suspect, is significantly higher--in Iraq in \nreconstruction. A lot of the reconstruction money which we are supposed \nto be spending in Iraq doesn't appear to be getting out into the field, \nthe rubber doesn't seem to be hitting the road. The money seems to be \nsomewhere; we are not sure where. We hear representations that it may \nbe buying buildings in Switzerland rather than building buildings in \nIraq, but we know, because the money is not moving out, that the \ndollars are not there and not doing what they are supposed to be doing.\n\n  This concerns many of us on both sides of the aisle. The GAO has been \ngiving us report after report. The special Inspector General has been \ngiving us report after report highlighting this concern, which is that \nthere is and appears to be significant corruption, and that corruption \nis misallocating funds--American tax dollars--in Iraq.\n  In addition, another example of concern is the World Bank. The World \nBank has just taken on a new leader, Secretary Zoellick, Ambassador \nZoellick, who is one of the strongest individuals I have met in my \nexperience in public life. I think he is one of the best public \nservants I have come across. He is totally committed to doing things \nthe right way and has no problem making a decision and shaking a place \nup, that is for sure. I think he is going to be good for the World \nBank. But he comes into a situation which has very big issues relative \nto the dollars that are being spent there. Reports are coming out that \nliterally hundreds of millions--if not billions--of dollars are being \nsiphoned off from these grants, that there is inadequate oversight, \nthat there is a lack of transparency, that there is shoddy accounting, \nand that there is just plain theft going on of some of these dollars. \nWe have examples of corruption which appear to be fairly significant in \nKenya, in Guyana, in India, in Bolivia, and in various other regions. \nThe biggest concern, independent of the loss of dollars and the dollars \nnot being used to benefit these nations which need the assistance, is \nthe fact that there seems to be a real resistance within the structured \nbureaucracy of the World Bank to telling anybody what is going on, and \nthere appears to be more of a commitment to hiding the facts than to \ndisclosing the facts when it comes to corruption, mismanagement, poor \naccounting, and that is not right.\n  These are American tax dollars. We are going to put $1.1 billion into \nthe World Bank with this bill, and the American taxpayer, at least the \npeople from New Hampshire and, I am sure, the people from Vermont, \ndon't expect those dollars to be spent to line the pockets of some \ncorrupt official in one of these nations. They expect them to be spent \nto assist the people in those nations who haven't been as fortunate as \nwe have. The World Bank has to get its act cleaned up, and that begins \nwith transparency.\n  So in this bill we have put in significant language--I believe it is \nsignificant--which will essentially fence 20 percent of the \nappropriations until we hear from the World Bank that they have made \npublic the available financial disclosure forms, that the bank has \nestablished a plan and a schedule for conducting regular independent \naudits, that the bank is adequately staffing and sufficiently funding \nthe Department of Institutional Integrity, and that the bank has made \npublicly available the bulk of the panel report which we wish to see. \nWe may add another thing to that. We want to make it unalterably clear \nthat we are tired of the obfuscation that is coming out of the World \nBank and that the World Bank makes public the Department of \nInstitutional Integrity November 23 report relative to the India issue, \nwhich has received a fair amount of attention recently.\n  So we are fencing these funds. They are not going to get this money \nuntil we get some accounting rules that work over there. I think with \nSecretary Zoellick now in charge, he will be equally aggressive in \nmaking sure that this sort of action occurs.\n  In addition, of course, there is the United Nations. I have always \nsupported funding the United Nations. I strongly support the United \nNations as an institution, as a concept, and as a key player in world \nevents in order to try to give the world a place where it can come \ntogether and resolve disputes, especially.\n  But once again, we have a track record of mismanagement and shoddy \naccounting, and sometimes no accounting, and patronage and misuse of \ntax dollars that are rather staggering. Article after article has been \nreported in this area. It is--the U.S. taxpayer picks up about a \nquarter of the cost of the United Nations--a disproportionate amount \nquite honestly, in my opinion--but we do it because we believe in that \ninstitution. But it is very hard to tell an American taxpayer that the \ndollars they are sending to the United Nations, if it goes into certain \naccounts is going to disappear, or it is going to be used to give a job \nto somebody's cousin\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\nwho is coming in from some country where they couldn't get him a job.\n  So again, I say this is an issue we are going to focus on in order to \ntry to get some fair and honest accounting, transparency, and a system \nthat uses at least American tax dollars efficiently to benefit the \nworld rather than uses them to benefit individuals who happen to be in \nhigh places or have found themselves in positions to take advantage of \nthe situation.\n\n  So those are issues I think are critical. The corruption issue is \nvery high, at least on my agenda, as to how we handle these dollars. \nBut that doesn't undercut the basic need here, which is to have a \nstrong and vibrant commitment to foreign aid assistance and to \ninternational assistance which addresses priorities that we have as a \nnation in dealing with other countries and also addresses the needs of \nother people around this globe where we see we can make a difference, \nsuch as in the AIDS area.\n  Again I congratulate the chairman who has done a good job on this \nbill, his staff has done a good job on this bill, our staff has done a \ngood job on this bill, and I hope we can pass it promptly.\n  There are a number of amendments from our side. I have been made \naware of a number of amendments, and we are ready to start the \namendment process, and whenever people want to start offering \namendments--I see the Senator from Florida is here and I know he has \ntwo very good amendments that I will certainly be supportive of, I \nsuspect, and I will be happy to proceed if he wants to offer them, and \nI will be happy to hear them. I presume there will be no votes until \nabout 2:30.\n  Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  Madam President, I would like to reserve that request and I ask \nunanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to, that the \nbill as thus amended be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment, and that no points of order be waived by virtue of \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Are we not in a posture where amendments would be \nappropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2694\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wish to offer an amendment to H.R. 2764 and send it \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida Mr. [Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2694.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: To promote democracy in Cuba)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                   CUBA DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n       Sec. 699B.  (a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title III under the subheading ``economic \n     support fund'' under the heading ``Other Bilateral Economic \n     Assistance'' is hereby increased by $30,700,000 and such \n     amount shall be available for the Cuba democracy assistance \n     program to assist the pro-democracy movement in Cuba and \n     shall be in addition to any other amounts appropriated or \n     made available for such purposes.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title I for the Department of State and Related Agency under \n     the subheading ``diplomatic and consular programs'' under the \n     heading ``Administration of Foreign Affairs'' for expenses of \n     general administration is hereby decreased by $30,700,000.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. This amendment essentially restores $30.7 million for \nthe Cuba Democracy Assistance Program by offsetting it from the \nDepartment of State's $3.8 billion in the general administrative \nbudget. In conjunction with the committee's recommendation, $15 million \nfunding for the Cuban Democracy Assistance, this amendment would now \nequal the administration's request. These funds are used to provide \nneeded humanitarian assistance to Cuban civil society and pro-democracy \nmovement.\n  Let me say that Cuba at the current time is living through a \ntransitional moment, an historic moment. After the dictatorship of \nFidel Castro of almost half a century, it appears that he no longer is \nin a position to govern. His brother Raul Castro has assumed power in \nCuba in a way frankly that belies legitimacy or anything close to \nDemocratic rule. It is my hope, it is the hope of those of us who \nsupport this amendment, that by restoring these funds to the amounts \nnecessary, we will be able to help the Cuban people create the \nconditions within the country similar to those that were created in \nEastern Europe through our assistance to the forces of democracy and \nfreedom. We now see the flourish in democracies of Eastern Europe and \nwe relish the opportunity that they have brought to those people. We \nwant to see the same take place in Cuba.\n  A few days ago, I had the unusual opportunity and privilege to talk \non a teleconference with members of the Civil Society--the opposition \nin Cuba--who hope and dream of a day when they will have the \nopportunity to freely speak, where human rights will be observed, and \nwhere they will have the opportunity to elect their own leaders. These \nfolks pleaded with us to please assist them, not with high tech, if \nthat would come, but with even the simple things such as pencils, \npaper, ballpoint pens, so that they can communicate with each other and \nso they can create the atmosphere and the condition of a civil society \nthat would permit the flourishing of a democracy in Cuba at this \ncritical time and at this juncture.\n  I think it would be a good idea to not reduce the funding that is \ngoing to the civil society and democracy movement in Cuba. It is \nhumanitarian assistance. It is civil society assistance. This isn't \nmilitary. This is about creating peaceful conditions of change and by \nallowing the Cuban people those opportunities that they otherwise would \nnot have through the current totalitarian system that currently rules \nin Cuba.\n  I could talk on and on about this, but I hope that with this bill we \nwould restore the funding to the administration recommended levels, \nwhich are not in keeping even with what was done for Eastern Europe, \nwhich are essential and which will make a big difference to the people \nof Cuba.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2695\n\n  Madam President, I have another amendment I wish to offer at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2695.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the funding for broadcasts to Cuba and to provide \n                               an offset)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n             INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS TO CUBA\n\n       Sec. 699B.  (a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title I under the subheading ``international \n     broadcasting operations'' under the heading ``Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors'' is hereby increased by $5,019,000 and \n     such amount shall be available for the international \n     broadcasting operations to Cuba and is in addition to any \n     other amounts available for broadcasting operations to Cuba \n     under title I.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title I for the Department of State and Related Agency under \n     the subheading ``diplomatic and consular programs'' under the \n     heading ``Administration of Foreign Affairs'' for expenses of \n     general administration is hereby decreased by $5,019,000.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, this amendment again deals with the \nbudding hopes of democracy in Cuba and it deals with Radio and TV \nMarti. Radio and TV Marti for years has been the source of information \nand the source of hope, much like Radio Free Europe was for the \nenslaved people of Europe.\n  The people of Cuba today have no opportunity for anything close to a \nfree press. All they get handed daily are the diatribes of the \nCommunist regime as\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\nthey control every source of media available to the Cuban people. This \namendment would restore funding to Radio and TV Marti by increasing the \nfunding by $5 million to allow the continuation of this very important \ntool of democracy, which is information to the Cuban people.\n  Again, I would point out this is a critical time in the history of \nthis country. We are only 90 miles from the shores of Cuba. What \nhappens in Cuba is important to the United States. It is important to \nour national security. At a time when we fear the potential for mass \nmigration, at a time when we see the opportunity perhaps for political \nchange, this would be the wrong time to cut back and to diminish our \ncommitment to the voice of democracy, the voice of freedom, and, \nfrankly, simply to the voice of unfettered information.\n  If there was a condition in Cuba that created unrest or a \ngovernmental change, our defense forces, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is greatly concerned that there would be a mass migration. It \nhas happened in the past. Radio and TV Marti would be the tools that \npeople such as myself, speaking in Spanish to the Cuban people, could \nuse to urge them not to go to the high seas, not to seek to migrate but \nsimply remain calm in Cuba. That is why TV and Radio Marti, at this \ncritical juncture, ought not to be cut in funding. The amendment \ndoesn't restore it to current funding; it increases it by $5 million, \nwhich I think would be a great step in the right direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand all of the Senator's amendments are paid for, \nis that correct?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. That is correct. And the Senator is correct that there \nwere going to be two amendments--it is actually four, dealing with two \nsubjects, two in Cuba and two in Colombia. They are the same \nfundamental issues and they are offset within the State Department \nbudget.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2696\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I call up the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Martinez) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2696.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the conditions on the availability of funds for the \n aerial eradication of coca in Colombia to address circumstances where \n    manual eradication is too impractical or risky and to limit the \n  requirement to implement programs to provide alternative sources of \n   income to areas where conditions exist for successful alternative \n                              development)\n\n       Beginning on page 266, line 13, strike ``manual \n     eradication'' and all that follows through ``municipalities \n     where security permits'' on page 267, line 12, and insert the \n     following: ``manual eradication in such areas is not \n     practical or poses an unacceptable risk to government \n     security forces, as determined based on consultations with \n     appropriate authorities of the Government of Colombia: \n     Provided, That not more than 20 percent of such funds may be \n     made available unless the Secretary of State certifies to the \n     Committees on Appropriations that: (1) the herbicide is being \n     used in accordance with EPA label requirements for comparable \n     use in the United States and with Colombian laws; and (2) the \n     herbicide, in the manner it is being used, does not pose \n     unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the \n     environment including endemic species: Provided further, That \n     such funds may not be made available unless the Secretary of \n     State certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that \n     complaints of harm to health or licit crops caused by such \n     aerial eradication are thoroughly evaluated and fair \n     compensation is being paid in a timely manner for meritorious \n     claims, and the Secretary submits a report to the Committees \n     on Appropriations detailing all claims, evaluations, and \n     compensation paid during the twelve month period prior to the \n     date of enactment of this Act: Provided further, That such \n     funds may not be made available for such purposes unless \n     programs are being implemented by the United States Agency \n     for International Development, the Government of Colombia, or \n     other organizations, in consultation and coordination with \n     local communities, to provide alternative sources of income \n     in areas where conditions exist for successful alternative \n     development and security permits''.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, this amendment deals with the \nsituation in Colombia. This was a congressional effort started in the \nClinton administration, which has been a dramatic help--and it has been \ncontinued by the Bush administration--to the people of Colombia as they \nfight the narcotraffickers who essentially took over that country for \nmore than a decade.\n  The number of deaths and the destruction due to the drug trafficking \nout of Colombia that has occurred on our streets and in our \nneighborhoods and schools has been known for decades now. Under the \npresidency of President Uribe, whom the Colombian people elected in an \nunprecedented fashion a year ago, the Colombian Government, in \npartnership with us in Plan Colombia, has made a turnaround in that \ncountry relating to drug interdiction and eradication, and in the fight \nagainst these narcoterrorists who have threatened life in Colombia as \nwe know it. Today, life there is returning to normal. Business and \ntrade are increasing dramatically. They are becoming the kind of \nneighbor we want and need. There is no closer ally in Latin America \nthan Colombia today. Their successes have been undeniable.\n  My amendment seeks to change language in the current Foreign \nRelations appropriations bill that would dictate that air eradication \nnot take place. We seek to restore language that would allow for air \neradication of drugs to take place when it is reasonable to do so, and \nwhen to do otherwise would endanger the Colombian security forces. \nRather than hamstring and tie down the Colombian forces and eliminate \neradication, we are changing the language to permit it where necessary, \nwhen to do otherwise would endanger the life of Colombians.\n  Drug eradication is vitally important. To allow the current language \nin the bill would diminish these important efforts so that we can \neradicate drugs in the Colombian fields and not have to deal with them \nin our neighborhoods.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2697\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I call up amendment No. 2697.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Martinez) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2697.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase by $30,000,000 the amount appropriated or \n  otherwise made available for ``Andean Programs'' and available for \n   aerial eradication of coca in Colombia, and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                 AERIAL ERADICATION OF COCA IN COLOMBIA\n\n       Sec. 699B.  (a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title III under the heading ``andean programs'' \n     for the Department of State and available for aerial \n     eradication of coca in Colombia is hereby increased by \n     $30,000,000.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title I for the Department of State under the heading \n     ``diplomatic and consular programs'' and available for \n     expenses of general administration is hereby reduced by \n     $30,000,000.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, this amendment restores $30 million of \nthe amount requested by the administration to continue a drug \neradication program. It doesn't go as high as the administration \nrequested, but it is higher than what came out of committee. It is \nvitally important to continue our commitment to drug eradication in \nColombia not only by air but with other means as well. This would \npermit the continuation of this very important program, which we think \nis vital to our hemisphere's security and to our drug eradication and \ninterdiction efforts to keep our streets safe in America. It is also a \nvery important component of Plan Columbia, this partnership where we \nhave enjoyed such a positive and fruitful relationship during the \npresidency of President Uribe.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Florida \nfor his cooperation with the committee\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\nand for bringing these amendments forward so promptly so we can address \nthese important issues he raised.\n  The Senator from Florida obviously is the leading expert in this \nCongress on the issue of Cuba for a variety of reasons, not the least \nof which is that he was a refugee from Cuba. His success story is an \nAmerican success story since his arrival in the United States. I am \nsure the Cuban people take great pride in seeing him in the Senate as a \nperson who came to this country with nothing. We admire him for that \nfact. He has maintained, obviously, close ties to the issue of Cuba and \nhow we can best address it. His suggestions here are that we bring the \nfunding levels for supporting initiatives relative to democracy in Cuba \nup by $10 million and supporting Radio Marti so it is fully funded by \nadding $5 million. Those are reasonable suggestions that I support. I \nhope we can move them forward.\n  The Senator is also the leading expert in Congress on the issue of \nSouth America and how we deal with that. South America--the issues of \nColombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia--is a very important \nissue to us as a nation. This region of the world is very close to us. \nWhat happens there has a direct and immediate impact on us both in \nterms of people leaving those countries and illegally coming to the \nUnited States and in terms of drugs being exported to the United \nStates.\n  In the case of Venezuela, they have a government that has a clear \nantipathy toward the United States and is trying to undermine American \ninterests throughout the world, but especially in South America.\n  As the Senator pointed out, the government has had incredible \nsuccesses in Colombia, which was a basket case when it was controlled \nby the mob--the FARC, as it is known--for a number of years. It was the \ncenter of and remains, regrettably, a high-profile producer of cocaine, \nwhich ends up in the United States. Now they have a government that is \nfreely elected and which is making significant strides toward \nestablishing a functioning nondrug-based culture and economy in that \ncountry. We need to support this government. We need to support \nPresident Uribe as he moves forward.\n  I honestly haven't understood what seems to be an antipathy from the \nintelligentsia in the United States, especially the Northeast \nintelligentsia, toward President Uribe and his government. It has a lot \nof overtones, in my opinion, to what happened in Haiti, where the \nintelligentsia of the Northeast decided that Mr. Aristide was the \nperfect person for that nation, and it turned out he was a horrific \nevent for that nation, as he backtracked and continues to backtrack. \nWhy there should be antagonism toward a government that has been freely \nelected with overwhelming majorities, and which is moving aggressively \ntoward trying to control the criminals who export cocaine to this \ncountry, is hard to fathom. But that exists and I think it is \nunfortunate.\n  But I do think we, as a government, should recognize that the \nGovernment of Colombia, and specifically President Uribe's government, \nhas made some very significant strides toward trying to get control \nover the cocaine production and the FARC elements. They have done it at \nnot only a risk to their Government but at tremendous personal risk. \nThese folks are targeted for assassination by these criminal groups. \nThey have shown tremendous courage in moving forward and moving their \nnation forward. We should be supporting that courage. We hear from our \nown people--not from the Colombians but those who are fighting drugs in \nthis country, including General Walters, who believes firmly that he \nneeds the additional money being proposed here by the Senator from \nFlorida in order to adequately fund the effort with primarily \nhardware--helicopters specifically--in Colombia in order to continue \nthe successes we have begun to see under Plan Colombia.\n  I support the Senator's initiative, and I hope we can support these \namendments as we move forward. We are not going to have any votes until \nprobably later in the afternoon, but it is good to start with these \namendments. I congratulate the Senator from Florida for bringing them \nforward.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator for his kind comments and for \nallowing me to move forward with these amendments. I appreciate his \nsentiment about the Colombian situation. There is no question that they \nare an ally and friend. One of the things I think is often not talked \nabout, but is very important, is what President Uribe has done. He has \nhad an amnesty program where people would lay down their arms and \nsimply have to atone for what they have done; they may get a jail \nsentence, but they can then reincorporate themselves into that society. \nThey would have a job training program, have a way of getting out of \nthe armed forces, which they did legally or illegally, including the \nparamilitary, or whatever. So if the rebel groups that supported the \nFARC lay down their arms and come back into society, that helps heal \nthat country and bring it together.\n  We have a great opportunity here to see Plan Columbia in its next \nphase not only continue with eradication and interdiction and fighting \nthe guerrillas, but also with the reestablishment of economic \nopportunities, so we can also try to improve the lives of the Colombian \npeople.\n  On the Cuban amendments, I also appreciate his support very much. It \nmeans a great deal to me personally. I assure you that, at a moment \nwhen we are at the cusp of a democracy there, this is precisely the \ntime in which to encourage the forces of change, forces of democracy, \nand provide them with the meager tools they need to communicate with \neach other. I think the fruits from that can be manifold.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Schumer are printed in today's record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nForeign Operations bill, and I thank the managers of the bill for \nputting forward an excellent measure.\n  I have a couple of areas I wish to speak about at some length, but \nlet me give the framework in which I will talk about it. I come to the \nfloor a lot--I spoke this morning about military action, but I come to \nthe floor to talk about intelligence. We are, at least in my thesis, in \na worldwide war against those who have declared us to be their enemy. \nIt is an ideological war. I think, by any stretch of the imagination, \nmost people realize that a war against this kind of enemy is only 20 \npercent kinetic, it is 80 percent economic/educational.\n  What we are doing in this bill some people object to--spending money \non foreign operations--because they think, oh, it is do-gooderism; it \nis trying to make us feel good, helping people in the world. Well, \nclearly we are carrying out an important mission to help less developed \ncountries throughout the world. That is certainly one of the areas \nwhere America's generosity has always shown through. Our private \ncharities are even more robust than what we do through government.\n  I continue to hear people back home saying: If we just cut out \nforeign aid, we could do this and we could do that. But foreign aid is \nminuscule. I, frankly, think it ought to be more. If we are going to \nturn the tide against those who are committed to radical views, to \nmisusing and misinterpreting their religion to declare war on us, we \nhave to\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\ndeal with them not only kinetically when they pick up arms or when they \nthreaten to bomb us, but we have to help create the conditions in those \ncountries where people are not driven to earn a small amount of money \nfor planting a roadside bomb or an IED or even get a little more for \ntheir family by committing suicide in a terrorist attack.\n  There are some things we can do through this bill that I think are \nvery important to connect with those countries which view us with \nsuspicion. We can help change the attitude--not of everybody; not of \nthe committed mufsidoon. Those are people who, in the name of Islam, \nkill innocents, men and women, fellow Muslims. They are too often \ncalled jihadists. They are not for jihad. Jihad is a legitimate self-\nfulfillment and improvement by Muslims. They commit hirabah, which is \nthe terrible form of violence these Muslims commit. We need to show \npeople in the countries from which they come that America can be a \nforce for good.\n\n  There are a couple of things that are very important. No. 1 is \nestablishing and improving educational exchanges. No. 2 is economic \nassistance to help them build their economy. I will talk about that \nlater. No. 3 is getting Americans on the ground.\n  I have traveled to a lot of countries, and I have spent a lot of time \nin Southeast Asia. They keep telling me that the best emissaries the \nUnited States has are Peace Corps members, the Peace Corps members who \nhave been here, and those in other volunteer organizations--if they \ncome with a church, if they come with a charity or a nongovernmental \norganization, if they come with the volunteers in the financial \nservices program. When Americans come, even as tourists, they can make \na difference.\n  I wish to talk just a minute about the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps, \nas I said, is one of the important weapons we have, not only to help \nthem understand us but to help us understand them. At no other time in \nthis Nation's history has the work of the Peace Corps and its \nvolunteers been more vital or valued. Peace Corps volunteers are the \ngood face of America in the developing world. They provide practical, \nhands-on experience while spreading compassion and good will, which is \nvital in winning the hearts and minds of people all over the world. The \nUnited States is no longer the only game in town, and we can no longer \ntake for granted that countries will line up to want to support the \nUnited States.\n  China, for example, with over 1 trillion U.S. dollars, is \naggressively engaging in courting countries all over the world on \neconomic, diplomatic, and cultural fronts, frankly shutting us out, \nmoving us out of the game by establishing what the Chinese call their \nConfucius Institutes, thus promoting their language and culture through \ninternationally affiliated institutes. The Chinese Ministry of \nEducation estimates that by the year 2010 there will be approximately \n100 million people worldwide learning Chinese as a foreign language. \nAnd it plans to set up 100 more. They will be learning Chinese, not \nEnglish.\n  I ask, why are we reducing and not increasing our efforts to promote \nAmerican values, our culture, our way of life? As I said, to fight the \nwar on terror, our efforts are 20 percent kinetic, 80 percent public \ndiplomacy--international exchanges, education, aid, and community \ndevelopment. In other words, I believe that putting more sandals on the \nground will prevent having to put boots on the ground in the future to \nfight militarily what we could have won economically with education and \ndiplomacy beforehand.\n  Only about 20 percent of Peace Corps volunteers are serving in \npredominantly Muslim countries. There are far too few. In key areas, \nthere are just not enough. Why? We just do not have the money. The \nmoney stayed stable, and costs have gone up. We have been declining in \nPeace Corps participation. Why is it important to have them in Muslim \ncountries? Because they provide alternatives to the Wahabist view of \nlife, financed too often by our Saudi Arabian friends. They are too \noften promoting the Salafists' radical agenda--barbaric ideologies, \ntrying to reach impressionable Muslims.\n  Numerous accomplishments have been achieved over the past 6 years by \nour American volunteers, and the Peace Corps is poised to meet not only \nthe growing demands from interested countries but from thousands of \nAmericans who want to serve as well. I believe the Peace Corps should \nobtain its full request in 2008 in order to expand opportunities to \nenter these countries, vitally important countries in Southeast Asia \nand elsewhere, and I hope we will get a more robust request from the \nadministration next year. It should not be hindered in expanding the \nnumber of volunteers in countries where the Peace Corps already exists \nand is advancing American ideals and building good will. Budget \ntightening has already occurred at many posts, and program closures are \nlikely without additional funds.\n  Many of our diplomats and host country officials say that the Peace \nCorps is the most effective and cost-efficient U.S. agency in getting a \nbetter view of America.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the conference \ncommittee. I hope we will be able to restore the President's full \nrequest for the Peace Corps. It is an investment in an effort vitally \nimportant to improving the lives of those in the developing world.\n  I also wish to talk about another initiative. I have been on the \nfloor talking about it a long time; that is, effective grass roots \ndevelopment for agriculture in Afghanistan. Agriculture is the main \nbuilding block of the Afghan economy, but it has suffered from \ndisinvestment and neglect. Over 70 percent of Afghans live in rural \nareas and derive their income from agriculture. Yet the public and \nprivate support infrastructure for agriculture is yet to be rebuilt.\n\n  I talked to some Missouri farmers--I will discuss it more later--who \nwere over there with our National Guard. They tell us that they believe \nthe Afghans could move a tremendous leap forward if we got them 19th \ncentury, not 21st century, not 20th century, but 19th century tools and \nequipment because they are that far behind.\n  I thank the managers of the bill. They have used in this bill $20 \nmillion for USAID to set up and develop a nationwide agriculture \nextension system. It would establish and execute a strategy through a \nconsortium of U.S. land grant universities, integrating the program \ninto Afghanistan institutions, guided by local councils, comprising \ncommunity, private sector, and government education leaders. Our U.S. \neducation extension service transformed American agriculture over the \nlast hundred years, and it can do a lot to improve the livelihood of \nthe people in Afghanistan and counter the other influences, such as the \ncultivation of poppies for the drug trade.\n  Unfortunately, we have given money to USAID in the past, and it has \nbeen largely ineffective. USAID has refused to set up an extension \nsystem in Afghanistan. They continue to rely on large, DC-based \ncontractors who apparently have had no impact. They lack that expertise \nand capacity-building know-how and expertise which will create \nsustainable development.\n  Over 5 years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, after USAID \nhas been spinning its wheels, Afghanistan now accounts for 92 percent \nof the world's opium supply. I recognize USAID and the Department of \nState are large bureaucracies that cannot operate as effectively as the \nmilitary can in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the \ncommunity development efforts they are tasked with are paramount to \nestablish a strong economy that will allow the Afghan farmers and the \nAfghan people an alternative to opium production. When I was in Iraq, \nfor example, I observed our warfighters taking action and picking up \nthe mantle where State and USAID's hands were tied.\n  In Ramadi, we saw the marines, after they had pacified Ramadi, went \nin and rebuilt the Blue Mosque, the absolutely central Sunni mosque for \nthat entire region. There was a tremendous amount of goodwill created, \nshowing them we supported their religion.\n  In Afghanistan, a member of my staff, a month ago, returned from \nNangarhar Province with members of the Missouri National Guard. As a \nresult of my working with the Guard and what we saw on the ground and \nthe fact that the President, Hamid Karzai, had asked for extension \nservice assistance but USAID was not able to produce it,\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nI asked the National Guard to send an agricultural development team \nover to see what could be done. They came back with a very promising \nresponse.\n  The team and subsequent others we hope will be established by the \nDepartment of Defense through the National Guard will be composed of \ncitizen soldiers who come, in their civilian lives, from farming, \nagribusiness, and construction trades. Each AG team will have extension \nservice experts--whether it is in soil or meat technology or other \nthings that have been identified as pressing needs. They are going to \nfocus on more efficient use of irrigation, crop rotation, cold storage, \nharvesting, processing, and agribusiness. They will not just be giving \nfarmers seeds, they will be building real, long-term relationships and \ncapacity-building that will sustain agriculture in Afghanistan, to \nbring it into the 19th and even into the 20th century. They will be \ndoing so in a place where building trust with the populace is \nparamount.\n  From my time as Governor, I have always been impressed with not only \nthe capacity and the ability and dedication of our National Guard \nthroughout the United States but their flexibility. The National Guard \nstructure, capabilities, and the skill-set of the citizen soldiers in \nthe Army are uniquely positioned to execute a position that many others \nare incapable of fully executing. I hope the USAID and State Department \nwill follow the lead of its Department of Defense cohorts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. As I said, 80 percent of the war on terror is nonkinetic--\nagricultural development, education exchanges, Peace Corps volunteers, \nand public diplomacy. If USAID continues to rely on giving large chunks \nof money to cumbersome contractors in its foreign aid, it will fail, \nand I will see if I can convince my colleagues to choose another route.\n  Efforts in Afghanistan, like the land grant extension initiative and \nthe agricultural development teams, are models for how we should be \nconducting the nonkinetic war we must fight against those who vowed \ncontinuing war against us and the way of life we espouse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak to one of the amendments \npending before the Senate on Cuba democracy. But before I speak to that \nspecific amendment, I wish to start off by thanking Chairman Leahy for \nall of his hard work on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. His \nleadership on crucial issues around the world is critical. I also \nappreciate his support for human rights around the world--Latin America \nand other places--as well as his willingness to work with me and my \nstaff. So we appreciate his leadership on what I believe is overall an \nexceptional bill that has been brought to the Senate for its \nconsideration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2694\n\n  I didn't know my colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, was going \nto come to the floor earlier. I would have joined him at the time. But \nI certainly wish to join him in promoting this amendment and Cuban \ndemocracy. This amendment is simple and for a simple but powerful \npurpose: to support democracy inside of Cuba. I believe that no matter \nwhere we as Members of the Senate stand on the issue of U.S. policy \ntoward Cuba--and I recognize there are diverging views--every Member of \nthis body, however, I suspect, supports achieving democracy in Cuba and \ntherefore should support this particular amendment.\n  Right now, we are at a critical time for democracy in Cuba. Some \nwould ask: Why now? Why should we increase the funding for Cuban \ndemocracy right now in this legislation?\n  I would answer: Right now, we face a moment of hope for the Cuban \npeople. Right now, we face a moment of hope for the Cuban people who \nhave suffered under the only dictatorship in the entire hemisphere--a \ndictatorship of 48 years. Dictatorships, whether they be from the left \nor the right, are nonetheless dictatorships. They are an oppression of \npeople, and we should be against such oppression.\n  Sometimes I hear from some the romanticism of who Fidel Castro is.\n  They forget that he is, above all, a dictator and that he oppresses \nhis people on a daily basis. And even at the height of what was the \nformer Soviet Union giving billions of dollars in assistance to the \nCastro regime, what did he do? He still rationed, Cuban families having \nto wait in long lines, as they do today, because of a regime that seeks \nto put its money in security forces, to oppress its people, instead of \nfeeding its own people.\n  We should be against such repression. Right now we are faced with a \nmoment of hope for the Cuban people with Castro ailing. Right now we \nface a potential tipping point for the Cuban opposition leaders and \ndissidents who risk their lives and well-being and their security and \ntheir freedom every day to speak out for democracy.\n  Right now we have to seize this moment of hope and increase our \nsupport for democracy inside of Cuba. Now, as we look at the history of \ndemocratic movements around the world, we have learned it is at such \nmoments that internal democratic movements need external support.\n  Look at similar moments in Eastern Europe. Look at Poland's \nSolidarity movement; look at the former Czechoslovakia's Charter 77 \nmovement in 1989. In each case, these internal moments were also \nsupported from the outside. We must remember our responsibility when we \nhear those who formerly languished under Communist rule, when we hear \npeople such as the famous Polish human rights activist and former \nPresident of Poland Lech Walesa say:\n\n       The United States led the free world defending values of \n     democracy and humanism. Your determination and your \n     civilization bloomed with the hope of Poles.\n\n  That is why it is critical that we increase our funds to support \ndemocracy in Cuba right now. A few weeks ago I participated in a video \nconference at the State Department with Cuban human rights activists, \npolitical dissidents, independent journalists, who took great risk to \ntravel to the U.S. Interest Section in Havana from different parts of \nCuba to speak to a group of Members of Congress, of which I was one.\n  We heard one clear message: that they are facing increased pressure. \nThink about it. Already under a totalitarian dictatorship, even under \nthat oppression they are facing increased pressure from the regime, and \nU.S. funds are critical to their ability to continue speaking out \nagainst repression.\n  I would add that dissidents and opposition leaders were united. There \nwas well over a dozen of them in this video conference at the U.S. \nInterest Section, and they were united on this point, even though they \nare sometimes divided on other issues. On this point of receiving \nassistance in order to nurture the opportunity for civil society and \nthe opportunity for change to take place, they were united.\n  In fact, I received a letter from these same leaders which said their \nneeds were, among others:\n\n       Medicine to keep a political prisoner or dissident from \n     dying to food, water filters, medical equipment, clothing, \n     shoes, coats, toys for the children of political prisoners \n     who suffer doubly the loss of a loved one who is in prison \n     and social repression on the streets and in schools, \n     essential vitamins, office supplies and the tools of \n     democracy (computers, printers, phones, fax machines).\n\n  Because in a closed society in which only the dictatorship owns the \nairwaves, whether it be that of radio, or that of television, or the \nstate newspaper, when you cannot express your God-given right as an \nindividual to have a different view and to speak out, and you have no \nform of expressing that view to those of your fellow countrymen, to \nhave them seek to move in a different direction, what we do by \nproviding computers and printers and phones and fax machines is the \nvery essence of what we take for granted here at home but for them are \nthe very seeds, the tools they need to promote democracy.\n  This letter was signed by a diverse group of Cuban dissidents, \nincluding Julio Cecilia Delgado Gonzalez, Juan Gonzalez Febles, Laura \nPollan Toledo, Gidal Delgado Sablon, Candido J. Hidalgo-Gato, Vladimiro \nRoca Antunez, Guillermo Farinas Hernandez, Hector Palacio Ruiz, and \nElizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz.\n  This is a very diverse group of human rights activists, political \ndissidents, independent journalists. They do not all agree, just as \nsometimes we do not all agree here, but they all seek to have democracy \nand human rights. They may have come at it in different\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nways, but they all agree that they need help from the United States and \nfrom others throughout the world in order to achieve this.\n  This is why this amendment, increasing funding in the bill to $45.7 \nmillion, is important. This is the same level of funding the President \nrequested, the same level of funding that was included in the House \nversion of this bill that was passed by a strong bipartisan vote.\n  Let me be clear. We are asking for an increase in these funds. We are \nasking for an increase in these funds because this is exactly the \nmoment to increase funds for Cuban democracy. We do provide an offset \nfor these funds, so we are not increasing the overall total of the \nbill. The offset is exactly what was included in the House-passed \nversion of this bill. It is from the largest pot of money in the entire \nbill, for general expenses, for general administration.\n\n  I wish also to remind my friends that these programs I am talking \nabout for democracy inside of Cuba--health, helping the human rights \nactivists, political dissidents, journalists and activists--are carried \nout by organizations well known to my Senate colleagues: the National \nEndowment for Democracy, Freedom House, Pan American Development \nFoundation.\n  Our Cuba Democracy Program also works with well-known international \norganizations such as France's Reporters Without Borders, the \nNetherlands' Pax Christi, and the Czechs' People in Need Foundation.\n  I think we would all support the type of work the Cuba Democracy \nprograms carry out. U.S. funds support helping victims of repression. \nU.S. funds support advocating for human rights, including helping the \nwives of political prisoners advocate for their release from prison and \ndefending their rights in jail.\n  U.S. funds support pro-democracy activists, grantees of training \nCuban dissidents on information technology, leadership, civil society \nactivities, facilitating coordination among activists, and making small \ninstitutional developmental grants to strengthen the organizational \ncapacity of democracy groups.\n  U.S. funds give Cubans a voice and help disseminate activists' \nwriting and provide Internet coverage by independent Cuban journalists. \nThe work they do is powerful and meaningful. Between 2004 and 2005, \nthere was a 54 percent increase in civil resistance actions within \nCuba, 89 percent of which occurred outside of Havana in Cuba's \nprovinces.\n  A 2005 study by the Cuban Democratic Directorate found that actions \nof civil resistance have increased from 444 in the year 2000 to 3,322 \nin the year 2005. It is a positive trend of those who seek to create \ncivil society and peaceful change inside of their country, toward that \nwhich we promote around the world, human rights, democracy. Ignoring \nthis opportunity would only undermine this historic undertaking.\n  In conclusion, I believe this is a vote that should unite all of us \nwherever we stand on general U.S. policy toward Cuba. Let me remind my \nfriends, this is not a vote on the embargo, this is not a vote on basic \nU.S. policies toward Cuba; we may have that discussion on some other \nday. By voting for this amendment, you are voting to support those in \nCuba who continue to go out in the street every day, to ask for \npeaceful democratic change, who risk their lives, who risk their \nliberty. That is not an overdramatization of the reality of the \nchallenge those who seek to create change in the country of Cuba face.\n  I represent many in New Jersey who have languished in Castro's jails \nfor 10, 20, even 30 years. What was their crime? What was their crime \nthat they had languished for 10, 20, or 30 years in Castro's jails? \nSimply to suggest, simply to suggest, that there was a better way for \nthe Cuban people simply to speak out for those freedoms we enjoy here \nin this country, simply to be able to have the opportunity to worship \nat the altar that we choose, simply to be able to elect those who \nrepresent us in our Government as we are privileged to serve here, \nsimply to be able to come together and organize and demonstrate a \ndifferent view than that which the Government might have at any given \ntime, simply to speak your mind without the fear that the consequences \nof doing so will have you languishing 10, 20, or 30 years in Castro's \ngulags.\n  Anyone who doubts that is welcome to come to my home State of New \nJersey, I am sure to the home State of my colleague from Florida, and \nothers in the country who can visit with these human living examples of \nthat oppression, and in many cases of the torture that they receive \nunder the hand of this dictatorship.\n  By voting for this amendment, you are voting to support those in Cuba \nwho are seeking and trying to create peaceful democratic change. By \nvoting for this amendment you are voting to provide food and clothing \nto support political prisoners in Castro's jails who have been \nimprisoned for doing nothing more than reading the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights or other democratic documents.\n  I wrote, when I was in the House, what is still the law of the land, \ntitle II of the Helms-Burton legislation, which is the document of that \nlaw which talks about how the United States stands ready to assist a \nfuture government pledged to democracy and transition, and then a \nfuture democratic government. We put in, under President Clinton, the \nfirst plan that described the proactive nature, the first time we \nproactively prepared for the possibility of a transition in a country. \nThat document was sent to the U.S. Interest Section and reproduced, was \ngiven to Cubans who came to the section. Those who had the audacity to \nhave that simple document in their possession were often arrested and \nthrown into jail. The power of the thought, the liberating thought of \nthe freedoms and the real attitude the United States had with the Cuban \npeople as to where we wanted to help the people, not those who \noppressed them, was so powerful that the regime could not afford for \npeople to read it and would arrest them as they left the Interest \nSection.\n  By voting for this amendment, you give those who read that document \nor the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or other democratic \ndocuments the opportunity to be able to survive those jails. By voting \nfor this amendment you are voting to do what the international \ncommunity did in Poland, in Hungary, in Eastern Europe.\n  By voting for this amendment, you are voting to support democracy and \nhuman rights as we do in other programs in countries such as China, \nBurma, Cambodia, and many others. By voting for this amendment, you are \nmaking a simple statement--whether or not we disagree on how we achieve \nthe policy goals--we support democracy, freedom, and human rights of \nthe Cuban people. That is what this amendment does.\n  I hope we will have, as the House did, a strong bipartisan vote to \nsend a message to those who struggle every day inside Cuba to create \nfreedom, to promote the rights of individuals, as we are able to enjoy \nhere in this country, that 90 miles away from the shores of the United \nStates there can be the same opportunity as people aspire to throughout \nthe world.\n  This is the moment. This is the time. This is the opportunity. I hope \nthe Senate will avail itself of it and vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMenendez, Ensign, and Nelson of Florida be added as cosponsors of \namendment No. 2694.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson of \nFlorida and Senator Menendez be added as cosponsors of amendment No. \n2695.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Gregg for his opening \nstatement. I associate myself especially with his comments and concern \nrelated to corruption at the World Bank and the U.N. and in our \nassistance programs in Iraq. We have serious and nonpartisan concerns. \nThese go across the spectrum in this body. We intend to address them. I \ncommend the Senator from New Hampshire for raising them in his \nstatement.\n  We are trying very much to work out amendments. I hope we can go to \nthird reading.\n  Mr. GREGG. I see no objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In saying that, I am reminded of that wonderful part in \nHenry IV--I am sure the Chair remembers this very well--with Glendower \nand Hotspur, when Glendower says: I can call spirits from the frothy \ndepths, or something to that effect. And Hotspur says: Well, so can I, \nso can any man, but will they come when you call them.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I can call them from the depths, \nbut we would just like to have them come when we call them. Staffs are \nworking with a number of people. As soon as we have a finite list of \namendments, we are going to go through them. I would hope we can wrap \nup.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nand the distinguished Senator from Florida have been working together \non an amendment actually that is part of an overall package that the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire and I are working on with \nthem, and I think we are prepared to move forward on that part of the \nlegislation now. Both of the distinguished Senators are on the floor. \nOnce that is disposed of, we have a few other odds and ends, and I \nwould hope--I have heard there may be some other amendments, and I hope \nwe get to them right away so that maybe we can go to third reading \nwithin the next hour or so.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, as was pointed out by the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Menendez and I have worked together on \nthis effort which has been collaborative and bipartisan and has the \nsupport also, as cosponsors, of Senators Ensign and Nelson of Florida.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2694, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I have a modification to the amendment \nNo. 2694 that I would like to send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator indicate the number again for \nthe clerk?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Amendment No. 2694, which is the amendment we have been \ndiscussing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 255, line 5 before the period, insert the \n     following:\n       : Provided further, That of the funds appropriated under \n     this heading, $45,700,000 should be made available to promote \n     democracy in Cuba, and to assist the pro-democracy movement \n     in Cuba.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. At this time, I would simply speak on behalf of this \namendment, which is to provide $45,700,000 to the democracy movement \nand to assist the pro-democracy movement in Cuba and to promote \ndemocracy in Cuba. It is an essential part, as the Senator from New \nJersey very eloquently discussed, of support for the dissident movement \nso they can have the resources necessary for them to carry out their \nwork, so we can create a civil society in Cuba. So that, at this very \ncritical juncture in history--a very critical moment in history--the \nforces of democracy, the forces of freedom, the forces of a new way for \nCuba could be heard and have the resources necessary to carry their \nmessage to others within the Cuban population.\n  Senator Menendez and I both listened as we discussed with these \npeople their needs and their wants. They are not asking for things \nother than that which makes their work possible: The ability to have a \ncell phone so they can communicate with one another; pencils, paper, \nballpoint pens, things as simple as that--computers, of course; \nprinters, of course. All these things are the tools of democracy that, \nas we saw in Eastern Europe bring about the fruits of democracy, we can \nalso see that these seeds of democracy planted in Cuba, that these \nfunds can also bear the same kind of fruit at this very critical moment \nof transition, we hope, in the Cuban situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am happy to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida in offering this amendment. I \nappreciate what I understand I hope will be the acceptance of the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the amendment by voice. I \nappreciate the fact that even those who have different views as to how \nwe promote democracy in Cuba are willing to allow resources to have the \nability to nurture human rights activists, political dissidents, \nindependent journalists, those who struggle inside Cuba every day to \npromote civil society and peaceful change in their country which has \nlanguished for 48 years under a dictatorship--are willing to allow that \nto move forward.\n  This is about promoting the opportunities of nurturing those people \nwho risk their life and liberty every day to create change in their \ncountry, and in doing so the United States has always been a beacon of \nlight of democracy throughout the world and a strong advocate for human \nrights. The adoption of the amendment would continue in that fine \ntradition.\n  I urge our colleagues, when the distinguished Senator from Florida \nseeks to do so, with hopefully the distinguished acquiescence of the \nchairman of the committee and ranking Republican, to have the amendment \nadopted and take advantage of this most propitious and historic moment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 2695, 2696, and 2697 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, there are three amendments I wish to \nwithdraw at this time. They are amendments Nos. 2695, 2696, and 2697.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Those \namendments are withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am prepared to accept the amendment, as \nmodified, by the Senators from Florida and New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2694), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be recognized for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Senator Bingaman are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I have two amendments I will be \noffering to this Foreign Operations bill dealing with international \nfamily planning. I would like to call up both of them and discuss them \nas a way of being able to deal with this in a timely fashion for my \ncolleagues. I ask unanimous consent that these two amendments be called \nup and put in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not, the Senator from Kansas wishes to speak about the amendments \nnow, and there is going to be an amendment or two by Senator Boxer. I \nhope the Senator will work with us--and the Senator from California, \ntoo--to give their\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\nspeeches, have the amendments discussed, but before the votes start, we \ncan work out a sequence of votes in a relatively short period of time. \nIt is my understanding that comports with the thinking of the Senator \nfrom Kansas. He can speak as long as he wants because he has the floor. \nDoes that comport with his thinking?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, it does. There is a dispute on international \nfamily planning and the dollars. I was asking here--and I ask my \ncolleague from Vermont about this--would it be appropriate to bring the \ntwo amendments up on the floor at this time? I am willing to work on \nany sequencing that the Senator from California or anybody else would \nfeel appropriate. I want to get votes on these issues; they are \nimportant. They are matters of longstanding policy. Frankly, they are \npolicy issues that if either of them ends up in the bill, it will be \nvetoed. I think it is a significant issue for debate on the bill. If \nthe Senator from Vermont would like to sequence things in a different \nway----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if we might begin with the amendment that says:\n\n       On page 308, beginning line 18, strike ``health:'' And all \n     that follows through page 309, line 4, and insert ``health.''\n\n  Can we deal with that first and then go to the next one? If that was \nthe request, I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2708\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I call up amendment No. 2708.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2708.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent contributions to organizations that perform or \n            promote abortion as a method of family planning)\n\n       On page 308, beginning on line 18, strike ``health:'' and \n     all that follows through page 309, line 4, and insert \n     ``health.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I want to describe the overview of \nthis and go into the specifics. This amendment No. 2708 deals with the \nMexico City policy. The second one deals with the Kemp-Kasten \nlegislation. They are both policies the U.S. has in place. Kemp-Kasten \nhas been in place over 20 years. The Mexico City policy has been in \nplace since President Reagan. It was repealed under President Clinton \nand put back in place under President Bush. These are long, well-known \npolicy issues. They are significant policy issues. There is significant \npolicy debate about it.\n  The centerpiece of this debate is whether the U.S. should use \ntaxpayer funding to fund abortion overseas. That is at the centerpiece \nof the debate--whether the U.S. Government should use taxpayer dollars \nto fund abortions overseas. I submit that regardless of your position \non abortion, we should not be using taxpayer funds to fund abortions \nhere or overseas. A number of Americans would oppose on moral grounds \nthat their taxpayer dollars are being used to fund abortions here or \noverseas but particularly overseas. They would object to that. And a \nnumber of people would say why are we even doing something like this \noverseas.\n  People who are pro-choice might say: I am OK with abortion, but why \nare we using taxpayer dollars to do this overseas? Why not let those \ncountries and governments deal with their own problems rather than us \nfunding these issues?\n  There is a taxpayer angle on this issue and there is an overseas \nmeddling angle on this issue, and there is obviously a major moral \nissue of our day that is involved with this issue.\n  These amendments raise important issues. Should, as I mentioned, U.S. \ntaxpayers be forced to subsidize international groups involved in \nabortions? Should U.S. taxpayers support organizations involved with \ncoercive abortion policies? Some people support abortion but not \ncoercive abortion. And should U.S. taxpayers be involved with \norganizations that are connected to involuntary sterilizations?\n  I hope everybody in this body would be opposed to those last two \npoints.\n  As drafted, the Foreign Operations bill, unfortunately, answers yes \nto all three questions, and that is what this first amendment, the \nMexico City language amendment, seeks to turn around.\n  The bill is a radical departure from both current policy and common \nsense, and it should make us pause. Do we want to go down this road?\n  The first amendment I offer today addresses what is known as the \nMexico City policy. This policy originated with President Ronald \nReagan, as I stated previously, in 1984 and has been continued by the \ncurrent administration. The Mexico City policy prohibits Federal \ntaxpayer funds from going to organizations that perform or actively \npromote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations. The \nMexico City language is this: prohibits Federal taxpayer funds from \ngoing to organizations that ``perform or actively promote abortion as a \nmethod of family planning in other nations.'' However, the language in \nthe pending bill would gut this policy. In fact, the language in this \nappropriations bill implies that elective abortion is an acceptable \nmethod of family planning.\n  No matter how one feels about the taking of human life through \nsurgically induced abortions, surely we can reach some consensus that \nabortion is not a legitimate means of family planning.\n  Further, I hope we can agree that taxpayers should not be forced to \nsubsidize groups that provide abortion, many of whom object to abortion \nand find it morally wrong. The Mexico City policy is common sense and \naligns with the values of most Americans.\n  The bottom line is, U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize \nor support organizations that perform or promote abortions for overseas \nfamily planning programs.\n  In case my colleagues think, OK, that was the language in 1984, that \nwas the world situation in 1984, let me read from a newspaper article, \nan AP story that was filed on August 30, 2007. The article is ``Chinese \nvictims of forced late-term abortion fight back.''\n  The article is dated August 30, 2007. It reads as follows:\n\n       Yang Zhongchen, a small-town businessman, wined and dined \n     three government officials for permission to become a father.\n\n  Yes, permission to become a father. It didn't work. Even though he \nwined and dined, his wife was taken out of town and her baby was killed \nby injection while still inside her. This is her quote. I want to read \nthis for my colleagues:\n\n       ``Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside \n     and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach,'' says \n     Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. ``It was \n     very painful. . . . It was all very rough.''\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one \n     child per family, resentment still brews over the state's \n     regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family \n     matters. Not only are many second pregnancies aborted, but \n     even to have one's first child requires a license.\n\n  Why would we want to be associated with any sort of family planning \nthat is coercive of an abortion, regardless of where you are on the \nchoice issue? Whether you are pro-choice or not, you wouldn't want to \nbe associated with a government, with a group that does forced \nabortions, coercive abortions such as I am reading about in an AP story \nwritten at the end of August of this year. Why would we want to be a \npart of that?\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the article on ``Chinese victims of forced late-term abortion \nfight back.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, Aug. 30, 2007]\n\n        Chinese Victims of Forced Late-Term Abortion Fight Back\n\n       Qian'an, China.--Yang Zhongchen, a small-town businessman, \n     wined and dined three government officials for permission to \n     become a father.\n       But the Peking duck and liquor weren't enough. One night, a \n     couple of weeks before her date for giving birth, Yang's wife \n     was dragged from her bed in a north China town and taken to a \n     clinic, where, she says, her baby was killed by injection \n     while still inside her.\n       ``Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside \n     and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach,'' says \n     Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. ``It was \n     very painful. ... It was all very rough.''\n       Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one \n     child per family, resentment still brews over the state's \n     regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family \n     matters. Not only are many second\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\n     pregnancies aborted, but even to have one's first child \n     requires a license.\n       Seven years after the dead baby was pulled from her body \n     with forceps, Jin remains traumatized and, the couple and a \n     doctor say, unable to bear children. Yang and Jin have made \n     the rounds of government offices pleading for restitution--to \n     no avail.\n       This year, they took the unusual step of suing the family \n     planning agency. The judges ruled against them, saying Yang \n     and Jin conceived out of wedlock. Local family planning \n     officials said Jin consented to the abortion. The couple's \n     appeal to a higher court is pending.\n       The one-child policy applies to most families in this \n     nation of 1.3 billion people, and communist officials, often \n     under pressure to meet birth quotas set by the government, \n     can be coldly intolerant of violators.\n       But in the new China, economically powerful and more open \n     to outside influences, ordinary citizens such as Yang and Jin \n     increasingly are speaking out. Aiding them are social \n     campaigners and lawyers who have documented cases of forced \n     abortions in the seventh, eighth or ninth month.\n       Chen Guangcheng, a self-taught lawyer, prepared a lawsuit \n     cataloguing 20 cases of forced abortions and sterilizations \n     in rural parts of Shandong province in 2005, allegedly \n     carried out because local officials had failed to reach \n     population control targets.\n       Chen, who is blind, is serving a prison sentence of three \n     years and four months which his supporters say was meted out \n     in retaliation for his activism.\n       Many countries ban abortion after 12 or sometimes 24 weeks \n     of pregnancy unless the mother's life is at risk. While China \n     outlaws forced abortions, its laws do not expressly \n     prohibit or even define late-term termination.\n\n\n                           A family unplanned\n\n       Jin, an 18-year-old high school dropout from a broken home, \n     met 30-year-old Yang, a building materials supplier, in \n     September 1998. They moved in together. A year and a half \n     later, in January or February 2000, they discovered Jin was \n     pregnant but couldn't get married right away because she had \n     not reached 20, the marriage age.\n       After her birthday in April, Jin bought porcelain cups for \n     the wedding and posed for studio photos. On May 5, they were \n     married.\n       Now all that was missing was the piece of paper allowing \n     them to have a child. So about a month before Jin's due date, \n     her husband Yang set out to curry favor with Di Wenjun, head \n     of the neighborhood family planning office in Anshan, the \n     couple's home town about 190 miles east of Beijing.\n       He faced a fine of $660 to $1,330 for not having gotten a \n     family planning permit in advance, so he treated Di to the \n     Peking duck lunch on Aug. 15, 2000, hoping to escape with a \n     lower fine since this was his first child.\n       The next day he paid for another meal with Di and the \n     village's Communist Party secretary and accountant.\n       He said the mood was cordial and that the officials toasted \n     him for finding a young wife and starting a family.\n       ``They told me `We'll talk to our superiors. We'll do our \n     best. Wait for our news.' So I was put at ease,'' Yang said.\n       But three weeks later, on Sept. 7, when Yang was away \n     opening a new building supplies store, Jin was taken from her \n     mother-in-law's home and forced into having the abortion.\n       Why had the officials failed to make good on their \n     assurances? One of Yang's two lawyers, Wang Chen, says he \n     believes it was because no bribe was paid.\n       ``Dinner is not enough,'' Wang said. ``Nothing gets done \n     without a bribe. This is the situation in China. Yang was too \n     naive.''\n       Di, who has since been promoted to head of family planning \n     for all of Anshan township, could not be reached. Officials \n     who answered his office phone refused to take a message and \n     gave a cell phone number for him that was out of service.\n\n\n                      Late-term procedures decline\n\n       Zhai Zhenwu, a sociology professor at the People's \n     University Institute of Demographic Studies in Beijing, said \n     that while forced, late-term abortions do still occur \n     sporadically, they have fallen sharply.\n       In the late '80s and early '90s, he said, some family \n     planning officials ``were really radical and would do very \n     inappropriate things like take your house, levy huge fines, \n     force you into procedures.''\n       Things have improved since a propaganda campaign in 1993 to \n     make enforcement more humane and the enactment of the family \n     planning law in 2001, he said. Controls have been relaxed, \n     allowing couples in many rural areas to have two children \n     under certain conditions.\n       Still, Radio Free Asia reported this year that dozens of \n     women in Baise, a small city in the southern province of \n     Guangxi, were forced to have abortions because local \n     officials failed to meet their population targets.\n       In the province's Bobai county, thousands of farmers rioted \n     in May after family planners levied huge fines against people \n     with too many children. Those who didn't pay were told \n     their homes would be demolished and their belongings \n     seized.\n       Yang and Jin are suing the Family Planning Bureau in their \n     county of Changli for $38,000 in medical expenses and \n     $130,000 for psychological distress.\n       But it's not about the money, said Yang, a fast-talking \n     chain-smoker. No longer able to afford to run his business, \n     he now works as a day laborer in Qian'an, an iron mining town \n     east of Beijing.\n       ``What I want is my child and I want the court to \n     acknowledge our suffering,'' he said.\n       A family planning official in Changli justified Jin's \n     abortion on the grounds she lacked a birth permit. The woman, \n     who would only give her surname, Fu, said no one in the \n     clinic was punished for performing the procedure.\n\n\n                         Contradictory evidence\n\n       The National Population and Family Planning Commission, the \n     agency overseeing the one-child policy, says it is looking \n     into Jin and Yang's case. Meanwhile, the evidence appears \n     contradictory.\n       Jin's medical records include a doctor's certificate from \n     2001, the year after the abortion, confirming she could not \n     have children. Doctors in Changli county say they examined \n     her in 2001 and 2002 and found nothing wrong with her.\n       The court ruling says Jin agreed to have the operation. Jin \n     says the signature on the consent form is not hers but that \n     of Di, the official her husband courted.\n       Sun Maohang, another of the Yangs' lawyers, doubts the \n     court will rule for the couple lest it encourage further \n     lawsuits. But he hopes the case will stir debate and lead to \n     clearer guidelines on abortion.\n       As she waits for the next round in court, Jin says she is \n     too weak to work and has been celibate for years because sex \n     is too painful.\n       Her husband prods her to tell her story, but during an \n     interview she sits silent for a long time and finally says \n     she doesn't want to talk about the past because it's too sad.\n       Then she quietly insists the lawsuit is something she has \n     to do for Yang Ying, the baby girl she carried but never got \n     to see or hold.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, several years ago, when I was \nchairing the South Asia Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, we held a hearing on a lady who went undercover in China and \nfilmed and interviewed a number of women who had been forced into \nabortions. She talked about the brutality. She brought the interviews \nforward. This continues to go on to today.\n  There is no reason that we as an American Government should be \nassociated with it. Period. The Mexico City language has been a \nlongstanding policy of the United States. It makes sense. It is \nsomething we should continue. It is gutted in the bill.\n  I want to make another point on this issue. If this language remains \nin the bill, if the Mexico City language is not put back in the bill, \nor if the current language remains in the bill and it goes to the \nPresident, it will be vetoed. The President has issued a very clear \nstatement to the Congress to maintain the language of Mexico City and \nKemp-Kasten, saying very clearly, if this is in the bill, the bill will \nbe vetoed.\n  I don't know why we would want to overturn a policy that has been in \nplace for a number of years, a policy that makes common sense, to get a \nveto on a very important Foreign Operations bill.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont who chairs the committee and my \ncolleague from New Hampshire who is the ranking member for many good \nprovisions in this Foreign Operations bill. I know my colleague from \nVermont has a heart for foreign operations issues, for taking care of \npeople overseas and domestically, to do whatever he can in situations \nthat are difficult, that are dire. We have talked about it many times. \nI am very appreciative of his efforts in this field. This is not the \nway to go. This is something that will divide us. This is something \nthat is harmful. It is something that will be vetoed. It is something \nthat will bring this bill back in front of us. I believe we will have \nthe votes to sustain the President's veto. We should not go this route \non this particular bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Senator from Kansas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. I see the Senator from California is in the Chamber. I was \nwondering if we could enter a game plan. I understand the Senator from \nKansas has two amendments, one dealing with the Mexico City language \nand one dealing with Kemp-Kasten.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from California has an amendment that deals \nwith the language in this bill also in that general area. I was \nwondering if we can work out an agreement where the Senator from Kansas \ncan have the time he has already taken, plus an additional 30 minutes \non his two amendments, and the Senator from California can have 30 \nminutes on her amendment, and then maybe we can vote on all these \namendments.\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be agreeable to that request.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Kansas have 30 minutes and be allowed to offer his two amendments \nwithout second-degree amendments, and the Senator from California then \nfollow with 30 minutes and be allowed to offer her amendment without \nsecond-degree amendments, and those three amendments be voted on at the \nconclusion of that time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not sure I understand. Madam President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Kansas suggest the absence of a \nquorum without yielding the floor?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Without yielding the floor, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator will be recognized.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Kansas has \nthe floor, and I ask if he will yield to me to propose a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I propose, similar to what the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire said, that the Senator from Kansas has the time he \nalready used, plus 30 minutes, during which he will have offered and \nspoken on or yielded to others to speak on his two amendments, and then \nthe Senator from California have up to 30 minutes, either to speak or \nto yield to others and to offer her amendment. Then the amendments be \nset aside to be voted on prior to final passage at a time to be \ndetermined by the two managers.\n  Mr. GREGG. And in an order to be determined.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And in an order to be determined by the two managers?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nunderstand the point. We will have votes on all three amendments. I am \nassuming that the Senator from California----\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is right, there will have to be votes on these \namendments prior to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask that the Senator from Kansas yield \nfor an additional unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the amendments proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Vermont \nand New Hampshire for getting this play set. These are well-known \npolicy issues. They have been debated a long time in this country. My \nguess is that most people in this body know where they stand on these \nparticular issues. A lengthy debate is not necessary.\n  What I want to do is clarify what we are talking about, No. 1, and \nNo. 2, factually these conditions continue to exist in the world and \nthis is not something that is an old policy and not needed any longer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Corker as a cosponsor to my \namendment No. 2708.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for working on \nthis issue. It is a gut-check issue about where you stand on life, \nwhere you stand on the U.S. role around the world, where you stand on \nwhether we should be using taxpayers' funds for abortion, where you \nstand on whether we should be using taxpayers' dollars to promote \nabortion overseas. I think those are important and key issues. They are \nissues on which people know where they stand, and I hope we will be \nable to have a positive vote on all of these amendments.\n  I also say to my colleagues that if these particular provisions as \ncurrently exist in the bill, as I already stated, pass through this \nbody and are in the ultimate bill, I believe the bill will be vetoed \nand we will be right back talking about this bill which has a number of \nvery good provisions in it on foreign affairs, foreign operations that \nare very important, but this is certainly going to hold it up.\n  Continuing my comments, as we all know, many Americans are deeply \nopposed to abortion. If you poll the issue of taxpayer funding of \nabortion, a solid majority of Americans is opposed to taxpayer funding \nof abortion. They do not want a part of it. They may say: I am okay \nwith a woman's right to choose, but I don't want us to pay for that. I \ndon't see why the taxpayers should be paying for it, let alone \nabortions overseas. Many who support abortion question whether it \nshould be used for family planning purposes, which these funds are \ndesignated to be used for. We should not force American taxpayers to \nsubsidize organizations that perform or actively promote abortion. That \nis a position--if you polled that--that would be supported by 75 \npercent of the American public, probably. I don't have actual poll data \non it, but people don't support doing this, and there is no reason we \nshould do it.\n\n  If anything, they would like to see us cut foreign operations and \nforeign aid budgets, and here would be a prime spot. They would be \nhappy to see this cut taking place, and it would support their view of \nthe role of the United States in the world and the moral authority with \nwhich the United States leads.\n  These are very difficult moral issues, and then we go and insert \nourselves in a moral debate overseas--a moral debate about which we are \nvery divided here--and it doubles the negative view of the United \nStates meddling in a country's domestic issues and one of such key \nsignificance as life, human life; that we would meddle with U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  I would like to argue a few other points. First, some will argue \nincorrectly that Federal tax dollars would not have to be used for \nactual abortions but could still be used to support the organization's \nother activities. This is something you will hear a lot about: We are \nnot actually funding abortion, we are funding an organization that \nhappens to be associated with abortion, but it is not for abortions. \nWell, I think most people see through that figleaf. It fails to \nproperly understand the fungibility of money.\n  If I represent an organization, and I have money in this pocket and \nmoney in this pocket, but the budget all flows together--it supports \nstaff, it supports overhead--it is used to support the full \norganization, and that is U.S. taxpayer money. Again, we are talking \nabout overseas. It is used to support that organization. Sure, they \nwill show us that, yes, in our bookkeeping and recordkeeping we don't \nsupport abortions with U.S. taxpayer money, but it does support the \noverall organization, and the image of that organization overseas is \nthey support abortion. So you are funding abortion, even if the actual \ndollars themselves don't go for abortion. People get it.\n  I don't think we should fall for the figleaf they are going to keep a \nseparate set of books. It is one organization, and the money goes to \nsupport one organization that has one policy, and that policy is to \nsupport and promote abortion overseas. The organization receives funds, \nand they can simply reallocate private funds or other sources of \nfinancial support away from their nonabortion-related activities into \ntheir abortion activities. It frees up other money they have that they \ncan get from us and then use the money they have from private sources \nto fund abortions. So we are still helping out with abortions.\n  Second, the Mexico City policy also prohibits organizations that \nactively promote abortion from receiving funds. This means our Federal \ntax dollars should not be used to support the lobbying efforts of pro-\nabortion organizations that are attempting to change the abortion laws \nin other countries. These are groups that are trying to push pro-\nabortion laws, pro-choice laws\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nin many other countries. Why should we be involved in lobbying efforts \nin other countries on a controversial topic such as abortion? That \nmakes no sense whether you are pro-life or pro-abortion as to why we \nshould do that.\n  These are basic considerations I believe we should take into account \nwith the amendment I have offered today to strike the language in this \nbill which guts the Mexico City policy. The current bill language guts \nthe Mexico City policy. In effect, my amendment would ensure the Mexico \nCity policy stands as is. It would stand.\n  I wish to recognize, too, that my colleagues, particularly the \nSenator from California, she and I have had various debates about this. \nI certainly don't question her ability. I don't question her heart. We \nview this differently. I don't think we should be anywhere near \npolicies that promote abortion overseas. I see no reason the United \nStates should be involved in policies that promote abortion overseas or \nthe support of organizations that promote abortions overseas. My \ncolleague from California looks at this differently. I respect her and \nher opinion on this.\n  I would hope our colleagues would look at this and simply ask--\nparticularly those who are voting on this for the first time--is this \nsomething they want the United States to be associated with. A lot of \npeople get mad at the United States for pushing its weight around \noverseas. A number of people get in our face and mad at the United \nStates for pushing cultural changes overseas. I would think most of my \ncolleagues would be very sensitive to our pushing cultural changes \noverseas, saying: OK, we have policies about democracy, we have \nthoughts on that; and people should be allowed to govern themselves. We \ndon't necessarily want to push our views on major moral issues around \nthe world today. Yet here is one of a most offensive nature to many \nAmericans, to many people overseas, and the United States is funding \nit.\n  Why not take the money and use it to do water well promotion or \nprovide AIDS drugs to help people to be able to live or malaria or \ntuberculosis, where there is no controversy associated with that. In \nthose situations, people would applaud us helping them out with a \nproblem they have, instead of getting involved in a very divisive moral \nissue in their country as well as ours. This doesn't make sense that we \nwould do this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2707\n\n  Madam President, in the order of agreement, I would like to call up \nnow the second amendment that I would propose, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the current one be set aside and the second amendment be \ncalled up.\n  I do not have a number. It deals with the Kemp-Kasten language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the current amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2707.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit funding of organizations that support coercive \n                               abortion)\n\n       On page 240, beginning on line 4, strike ``Provided'' and \n     all that follows through ``sterilization:'' on line 9 and \n     insert ``Provided further, That none of the funds made \n     available in this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior \n     appropriations may be made available to any organization or \n     program which, as determined by the President, supports, or \n     participates in the management of, a program of coercive \n     abortion or involuntary sterilization:''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this is a provision similar to the \nlast one, as far as the issue. It is more specific. It has been the \npolicy of the United States since 1985, and consistently been the \npolicy of the United States through Republican and Democratic \nCongresses, through Republican and Democratic administrations. It is \ncommonly referred to as the Kemp-Kasten legislation. It would require \nthe reinsertion of what is known as the Kemp-Kasten law into this \nlegislation. This law helps to ensure that American taxpayers do not \nsubsidize groups and organizations with ties to coercive abortions and \nforced sterilizations. So this is a narrower subset of the past \namendment, the last amendment that I put forward. I would like to read \nit to my colleagues. It is a short amendment. It is well-known \nlanguage. I would hope it would get near unanimous support in this \nbody. We would put this language in the bill:\n\n       That none of the funds made available in this Act nor any \n     unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made \n     available to any organization or program which, as determined \n     by the President, supports, or participates in the management \n     of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary \n     sterilization.\n\n  Coerced abortion. Involuntary sterilization. It says you cannot \nsupport groups or organizations that participate in each of those. Now, \nI don't know of anybody in the Congress who I have ever run into at all \nthat supports coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n  We have seen involuntary sterilization at times in the past in this \ncountry, and it was a bad, dark chapter. This is not something we want \nto be a part of. What we are saying is you cannot support any \norganization overseas that is involved in involuntary sterilizations or \ncoerced abortions, commonly referred to, as I said, as the Kemp-Kasten \nlegislation. This has been the law on the books for 20 years, and I \nthink my colleagues can see why.\n  This is something people don't support. It has been in place since \n1985 through Republican-led Congresses and Democratically led \nCongresses, Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. \nHowever, year after year the language has been watered down in the \nForeign Operations appropriation bill and essentially gutted. That is \nwhy in this amendment my colleagues will support it. This is language \nwe would reinsert into this bill.\n  This commonsense provision prohibits funding of these organizations. \nOne important effect of this law has been to prohibit taxpayer funding \nof the United Nations Population Fund. That is what this narrow piece \nof the debate will be about, because of that agency's support for and \nparticipation in the management of the population control program of \nthe People's Republic of China. This program relies heavily on \nGovernment-coerced abortions.\n  This gets a bit personal with me. One of our children is adopted from \nChina. I think often of the woman who had our child, Jenna; that \nsomehow she fought through a system that would have paid for, in places \nand cases, a coerced abortion. But she fought through this system to \nhave the child who is my daughter, who is 9 years old, and who won her \nthird grade spelling bee contest. She is, I think, a beautiful gift to \nsociety. A beautiful gift to the world. Why would we want to be \nanywhere closely associated with any government or organization that \nwould have forced people, such as my daughter's mother, to have an \nabortion? I don't know why anybody would want to be associated with \nthat or come anywhere close to that.\n  I read to my colleagues, and we inserted in the Record an AP story \nabout this still going on today. This is not an isolated incident. This \nhappens in many places. We have held Senate hearings with people where \nthe local population control officials in China are very aggressive on \npushing a one-child policy, and that you have to get a license for that \nchild. Many women will flee a local community when they are pregnant in \norder to have their child somewhere else. My daughter was left on the \ndoorsteps of an orphanage by somebody who fought through that system. \nMaybe she was from a community that was some ways away, but somehow she \nfought through to have this child. Why would we want to be anywhere \nclose to something like that?\n  The Appropriations Committee-approved bill has inappropriately \nremoved the Kemp-Kasten provision by changing the language in important \nways. It requires evidence that the UNFPA directly supports coercive \nabortion. We, as a civilized society, should reject the brutal practice \nof forced abortion, whether it is promoted directly or indirectly. If \nyou have local population planning authorities in China who are \nindirectly supporting coercive abortion, do we want to be anywhere \nclosely associated with that? I don't think so. The bill removes the \nlanguage giving the President the explicit authority to invoke the \nprovision.\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\n  We ought to allow the President to enforce this provision, as it is \nessential, I believe, to a civilized society. A civilized society \ndoesn't do forced abortions, coercive abortions or involuntary \nsterilization. The Brownback amendment would restore the Kemp-Kasten \nlanguage that has been the law for over 20 years.\n  While we have had a rigorous debate in this country about abortion, \nwe have come to some fundamental agreements, I believe. One of those \nagreements is we should not use tax dollars to fund coercive abortion. \nIt is a brutal practice and it should be stopped. We should not use \nthis as an occasion for partisan politics. Whatever your thoughts on \nabortion, we should be able to agree that forced abortion goes too far. \nIt is not worthy of the America we all know is possible. I envision an \nAmerica where the strong protect the weak.\n  We ought to value each life and every life, everywhere and without \nexception. That is why I talk often about being pro-life and whole-\nlife. I believe the life in the womb is sacred. I believe the life of a \nchild in Darfur is sacred and a child in China. It is a hopeful message \nand a unifying message and it is one that should apply in this bill on \nthis language.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Brownback amendment to prohibit \nfunding for forced abortions and return to the sensible policy of the \npast 20 years and to advance a culture of life; to not get involved in \nother countries' internal debates on abortion, particularly ones \ninvolving forced abortions and sterilizations.\n  I yield the floor, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, can you tell me what the order is, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 30 minutes. \nThe Senator from Kansas has 13 minutes 7 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you let me know when I have used 20 \nminutes of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2719\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2719, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Menendez, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2719.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the application of certain restrictive \neligibility requirements to foreign nongovernmental organizations with \n  respect to the provision of assistance under part I of the Foreign \n                        Assistance Act of 1961)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n REMOVAL OF CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO \n                 FOREIGN NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n       Sec. 699B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     regulation, or policy, in determining eligibility for \n     assistance authorized under part I of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental \n     organizations shall not be ineligible for such assistance \n     solely on the basis of health or medical services, including \n     counseling and referral services, provided by such \n     organizations with non-United States Government funds if such \n     services do not violate the laws of the country in which they \n     are being provided and would not violate United States \n     Federal law if provided in the United States, and shall not \n     be subject to requirements relating to the use of non-United \n     States Government funds for advocacy and lobbying activities \n     other than those that apply to United States nongovernmental \n     organizations receiving assistance under part I of such Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nOlympia Snowe, to offer a very important amendment that could \nsignificantly enhance the health and well-being of millions of women \naround the globe. This amendment would overturn the so-called Mexico \nCity policy, also known as the global gag rule, which undermines a \nnumber of key principles and goals on which our country is based.\n  As many of you know, this policy was put in place at a conference in \nMexico City in 1984. When we learned what it really did, we dubbed it \nthe ``global gag rule.'' As many of my colleagues know, the policy \nliterally gags foreign organizations that receive USAID family planning \nfunds.\n  Let me be clear about this issue. Under the gag rule, international \nfamily planning organizations that provide perfectly legal family \nplanning services with their own funds in the countries in which they \noperate are prohibited from receiving U.S. assistance if they provide \nlegal abortion services and those services include counseling or \nreferral services, or they also do not get the funds if they publicly \nsupport the right to comprehensive reproductive health care.\n  Let me bring this home to you. I know you are a mom of a young child. \nIf a mom walks into one of these family planning clinics that receives \nUSAID funds with her 11-year-old daughter who has been raped and wants \nto be counseled as to what the options are or wants to be told where \nshe can take that child, this organization will lose all their USAID \nfunds if they help that mom and that traumatized daughter. Is this \nAmerica? We are talking about punishing family planning clinics all \nover the world if they use their own funds for perfectly legal \nactivities to help families.\n  I will give you a clear example. Until 2004, abortion in Ethiopia was \nillegal unless the life of the mother was at stake, and complications \nfrom unsafe procedures were the second leading cause of death among \nhospitalized women. The Government decided to have a national debate \nabout how to fix this problem which was taking a terrible toll on \nEthiopian women. That is right, the Ethiopian Government said: Let's \ntalk about what is right for our people, what is right for our customs, \nwhat is right for our way of life, and how can we save women's lives.\n  In order to weigh in on this debate, the two largest family planning \norganizations in Ethiopia actually had to give up their U.S. funding. \nThat is why we call it a gag rule. The organizations were gagged from \nexpressing themselves. They could not engage in the debate for fear of \nlosing their funds. So the two largest family planning organizations in \nEthiopia decided they would give up their U.S. assistance in order to \nspare women's lives. Imagine, as a result of this misguided policy, \nU.S. misguided policy, the two largest family planning organizations in \nEthiopia lost U.S. funds simply because they wanted to weigh in on a \ndebate about reproductive health care.\n  One of the things about President Bush that we all love is when he \nspeaks about democracy and how democracy should be the centerpiece of \nour foreign policy. I ask you, what is democratic about gagging people? \nWhat is democratic about saying you have no right to free speech unless \nyou agree with me? Then, if you agree with me, I support your right to \nspeak. That is what the global gag rule is. Free speech is only \nallowed, under this administration, when that speech agrees with them. \nWhat is happening as a result? Women are dying and there are \nunnecessary abortions. This is a terrible result of this policy. \nBasically, we say to people who are doing hard work to help their \npeople: If you don't agree with us, gag it. If you don't gag it, you \nare not going to get funds. This feeds into the stereotype of America \nthat is around the world today. Most foreigners do not like us very \nmuch these days. They look at this administration, and they say that \nour strategy is: Do as we say; don't do as you choose.\n  I always thought that a legitimate democracy had the right to self-\ndetermination, that they were not punished if they said what they \nthought. We are not talking about spending a penny of U.S. money for \nabortions abroad. That has been illegal since 1976. We are not talking \nabout using one cent of U.S. money to pay for lobbying for abortions. \nThat also has been illegal all those years. We are talking, again,\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nabout gagging family planning organizations that use their own money, \nin a legal way in the country in which they are present, to help women \nwho desperately need help, to help children who are raped, to help \nchildren who are victims of incest.\n  In both 2003 and 2005, this Senate debated this exact amendment, and \nit passed with bipartisan support on both occasions. Why am I back? \nBecause, sadly, the Senate never took final action on those bills, so \nwe need to go back again and back again and back again until there is a \nclear decision on this issue. That clear decision is America, the \ngreatest democracy in the world, is not going to tell other countries \nthey have to see everything the way a particular administration sees \nit. They should have the right to make their own decisions. As a \ncountry that believes in democracy, free speech, and improving the \nhealth and well-being of people all over the world, it is time for us \nonce and for all to do away with this harsh and cruel policy. The \nhealth and lives of millions of women depend on it, and that is why \nrepealing this global gag rule is so important.\n  This is not a small matter; this is a large matter. In the bill \ncurrently on the floor of the Senate and in the House bill, some steps \nhave been taken to ease the burden of the global gag rule. However, it \nreally does not go the distance. The bill before us today tries to \naddress it by allowing contraceptives to be provided by the United \nStates to international family planning organizations that would \notherwise be ineligible. But at the end of the day, these organizations \nare still gagged, they still can't lobby for changes in the law in the \ncountries in which they work. They still cannot even refer someone for \nan abortion.\n  Again, I take the case of the mother who walks into one of these \nclinics with a child who is the victim of rape or incest and the mother \nis desperate: Where can I take my child? Please tell me.\n  We can't tell you because if we tell you, we are going to lose our \nfunding.\n  Meanwhile, the child is losing time here in a battle to save her \nhealth. That is shameful. That is not something to be proud of.\n  Let's face it, these organizations need the funding and they need the \nfreedom to exercise the most basic rights of humankind: the rights to \nfree speech and expression to try to change policies they think are \nfundamentally wrong. In truth, we need family planning clinics to have \nopen doors, not just to provide contraceptive services--which are so \nimportant--but to attend to all the aspects of reproductive health \ncare.\n\n  Let me tell why I get so emotional about this issue. Approximately \n500,000 women die from pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum \ncomplications every year--500,000. Think of your largest cities--\n500,000 women a year, 1 woman every single minute. This includes deaths \nfrom a horrific condition known as obstetric fistula, which occurs when \nwomen's bodies are too young or underdeveloped to give birth. In \nEthiopia, this problem is particularly prevalent, where child marriage \nrates are extremely high and some girls actually get married at 7, 8, \nand 9 years of age.\n  The fact that we as a country would do anything to harm access to \ncomprehensive family planning is shameful. This is the 21st century. \nEven if you would never, ever want a member of your family to have an \nabortion, even if you would want a member of your family never to know \nthat it even exists as an option, put aside your own feelings and allow \nother people to make their choice.\n  Let me give a specific example of what happens when international \nfamily planning organizations are barred from speaking out against \ninjustice in the countries in which they operate. I will tell you a \nstory I have told on the floor before, a story that a nongovernmental \norganization leader from Nepal told us at a hearing I chaired in the \nForeign Relations Committee in 2001.\n  Like so many nonprofits, this NGO was forced to make an impossible \ndecision when faced with the unjust imprisonment of a 13-year-old girl \nnamed Min Min. What did Min Min do? A 13-year-old girl--why was she in \nprison? Because she was raped by her uncle. A relative took her for an \nabortion, and instead of going after the uncle, they put her in jail; a \n13-year-old girl, sentenced to 20 years in jail. But because of this \noutrageous gag rule, the organizations that operated inside Nepal were \nfaced with a horrific choice: They would either lose their funding or \nthey would keep their mouths shut and not try to free Min Min and \nchange the laws. Do you know what they did? They gave up the money and \nthey struggled, but they did the right thing, because Min Min was raped \nby a relative, she became pregnant, her family forced her to have an \nillegal abortion, and therefore she was sentenced to 20 years in \nprison. Imagine--a 13-year-old girl sent to jail for 20 years for the \ncrime of being raped by an uncle.\n  Is that the kind of country we are, that we would tie the hands of an \norganization that wants to help that child and tell them: If you try to \nhelp that child and change the laws here, you lose your American \nfunding. Doesn't that make us proud as Americans? No, it doesn't. It \ncertainly doesn't make me proud. I hope it doesn't make anyone proud \nwho would vote on this important amendment later on today.\n  I praise that nongovernmental organization, that health care agency \nfor saying: You know what, it is not worth the money; it is not worth \nthe money. These countries have people in them who struggle for money. \nThis child celebrated her 14th birthday in prison, her 15th birthday in \nprison, but because that health care organization, that NGO, was able \nto change the laws, Min Min was set free. That organization lost \n$100,000 in funding because they saved a child, and they had to let 60 \nstaff members go. That meant stopping a program that reached more than \n50,000 people in remote communities.\n  What are we doing? What are we about? Are we about helping families? \nOh, we hear it all the time: family values. I have them. I want to help \nthat mom who walks into a clinic with a pregnant 11-year-old girl who \nwas raped. I don't want to punish the people who help her. I don't see \nhow you stand for family values if you do that. It doesn't make sense.\n  What we are doing by keeping the gag rule in place is saying to \nclinics and doctors: You have to choose between helping the people in \nyour country by speaking out, by offering them referrals and \ncounseling, or American dollars. This is not a good policy for this \ncountry. This is a shameful policy for this country. I am very \noptimistic that, again, we will have a successful vote to overturn this \nglobal gag order.\n\n  President Bush says he will veto it. Let's have the debate. Let's \nhave the debate because I think any moderate, sensible American will \nsay this policy is misguided, and at the end of the day women and \nchildren are being hurt by it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I would ask how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes, 43 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, in the time I have allotted, I would \nlike to respond to some of the arguments put forward by my colleague \nfrom California, who is a tremendous advocate on the cause and the \ncase. We certainly see it a different way, different light. There is a \nterm that is starting to move around the world a fair amount today \nbecause they are seeing it in practice. The term is called gendercide. \nIt is a product of family planning institutions in places, \nparticularly, such as China and India. There are laws in India, \nparticularly, that you cannot reveal the sex of a child in utero \nbecause so many of the female babies are being killed. Even then they \nare not working as laws. The people doing the sonograms will wink or \nnod to tell whether it is a girl or a boy child. And if it is a girl \nchild, a lot of times the parents will go on and go forward with an \nabortion.\n  It has a result and effect that is taking place--normal balance \nratios. You normally have a few more male children born than female \nchildren. In China your average now is 115 males\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nborn per 100 females. In some areas in China the ratio is 120 to 130 \nmales to 100 females in the country.\n  As I mentioned, my own experience with adopting a child from China, \nJenna--Jenna, a joy in our household. And if you go into a Chinese \norphanage, it is virtually all female children in a Chinese orphanage. \nThere will be some male children. They are the ones who have some \nphysical, sometimes mental difficulties, but otherwise it is all girls \nin the orphanage.\n  My colleague talks about that women are dying through these policies. \nYes, they are dying through these policies. Female children around the \nworld are being killed through these policies. Female babies are being \nleft at orphanages or other places around the world because of these \npolicies. I think that is a powerful indictment of a system that still \nforces abortions on people, still forces people to have forced \nsterilizations. I do not think we should be anywhere around these. That \nis why the second bill, on the Kemp-Kasten, I hope would pass the body \nnearly unanimously because it is about forced abortion and forced \nsterilization that is taking place.\n  My colleagues may say, well, I do not think it still goes on. I \nmentioned an article. I only read a piece of the quote in it, but I \nwanted to read further in it.\n  Radio Free Asia reported this year that dozens of women in a small \ncity in a central province in China were forced to have abortions \nbecause local officials failed to meet their population targets.\n  From a report in Radio Free Asia:\n\n       In one province thousands of farmers rioted in May after \n     family planners levied huge fines against people with too \n     many children. Those that didn't pay were told their homes \n     would be demolished and their belongings seized.\n\n  This is in an AP article and reported by Radio Free Asia. In that \nsecond amendment I put forward, we are saying: We do not want any part \nof this. We do not want any part of an organization that does support \nthis. We do not want to support a coercive family policy in China. We \ndo not want to associate with any organization that does. I would hope \nall of my colleagues would say: I do not want to see or be a part of \nanything like that.\n  My colleague from California talks about us gagging other people. \nThey are free, organizations in every country are free as they want to \nbe to advocate any policy they want to. We just do not want to fund it. \nWe do not need to fund it. If they want to advocate different abortion \npolicies, that is fine. We do not have to pay for it, and we should not \npay for it, on something that is so controversial here and there. These \nare policies that are controversial in other countries.\n  If we dispute over the money, let's use the money to fight malaria or \nAIDS or tuberculosis. We will all agree on doing that. We do not gag \nthem. They can do whatever they want. People in those countries get it \ntoo. If the United States is funding them, we are funding that voice. \nWe are associated with that voice. I agree there are terrible things \nthat happen in various parts around the world. But these abortion \npolicies are not something that we should be supporting or funding, \nwith its controversy here and there.\n  There is a basic right around the world, a basic right that I think \ntrumps all other rights. It is the right to life. It is the right to \nlive. Why would we support policies, promote organizations that are \npromoting policies that are opposed to that very basic right? If you do \nnot get that one, any of the others do not matter a whole lot, do they? \nIf you do not get to live, if you continue to have the kind of \ngendercide and gender imbalances in various countries taking place, you \nare not going to have the voices there. You are not going to have the \nfemale voices that are there because they are being killed. This is \nhappening in our world today. We do not need to do it.\n  There is a thought--it is a Proverb actually that says:\n\n       There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it \n     is death.\n\n  One can argue for the saying: Well, OK, this is right for us to do. \nWe need to support family planning. I do not think so. I do not think \nthat is the right way. There are ones who could look at this and say: \nThis is about women's rights and we should use this for women's rights. \nI do not think you have to support abortion or abortion provider \norganizations to support women's rights. I think we can do that through \nother means.\n  But at the end of the day what this does, and what these policies do, \nis it ends in death. This ends in the death of a lot of children. The \nnumbers are there, and they are huge. They are the ones we should not \nbe associated with. So I would ask again, my colleagues, on Kemp-Kasten \nto support this language that we would not fund any organizations or \nsupport any groups that support forced abortion and involuntary \nsterilization. That one I do not think anybody should disagree with, \nand that we should reinsert the Mexico City language that we will not \nsupport organizations that directly or indirectly support abortion or \nlobby for abortion. These are matters that countries there should take \ncare of. If these provisions remain in the bill, the bill is not going \nto become law, and it will be back to us.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think this debate has been a good one, \nand Senator Brownback and I are used to debating this issue. I think we \nlay out our case the best we can. But let me be clear. I deplore \ngendercide. I am the mother of a daughter. I would do anything to \nprotect her. I deplore hurting girls. I deplore hurting women.\n  That is why it is so difficult for me to understand my friend's \nposition on the Mexico City global gag rule policy. If he says he \ndeplores hurting women, hurting children, hurting girls, then why would \nhe support a policy that would punish a health care organization \noperating abroad from using its own funds to protect women, girls, \nchildren, families? Why would he support that?\n  He says: Oh, we are not gagging anybody. They can say anything they \nwant. They just will not get our money. Well, this is America. We help \npeople who are doing good things. That is the reason at one time we \nwere beloved in the world. Is it not a good thing to help an \norganization that is using its own funds to help girls and women, to \nprotect an 11-year-old who was raped to make sure she gets the health \ncare she needs? Would not we want to think that American funding should \nhelp get contraceptives to families abroad? Should we help them if they \nhave an unintended pregnancy or a rape or incest in their family?\n  That is why I do not understand how my friend's rhetoric matches his \nactions. I think it is cruel to continue the global gag rule. I think \nit is cruel to punish an organization that had to give up all of its \nmoney and all of its staff to go to work to change the law, to free a \nyoung girl who was raped by her uncle, and instead of the uncle going \nto jail, because of the laws in Nepal at that time, the child went to \njail, and had her 14th and 15th birthday in jail and could have had 18 \nmore years in jail had the organization not walked away from U.S. \nfunding. How does that make you feel as an American? It makes me feel \nvery sad.\n  Then my colleague says he agrees that women are dying from these \npolicies. But he does not define what are ``these policies.'' Well, let \nme define these policies. Women are dying because of Mexico City \nlanguage, because of the global gag rule known as Mexico City.\n  Let me read from the New Republic.\n\n       The destructiveness of the gag rule is hard to overstate. \n     The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500,000 \n     women in developing countries die each year from causes \n     related to pregnancy and childbirth. Of those, roughly 70,000 \n     die from back-alley abortions. And aid restrictions have hurt \n     those groups best positioned to help. In Kenya, for example, \n     two health organizations have had to shut down their clinics \n     since 2001 after proving unable to abide by the gag rule and \n     losing their USAID funding. Many of these clinics were the \n     sole providers of health care for women and children in their \n     respective regions, and most had offered post-abortion care--\n     critical in a country where abortion is illegal, unsafe, and \n     causes an estimated one-third of maternal deaths annually.\n\n  Imagine a clinic had to shut down its doors because America withheld \nits funding. They could not afford to keep it open. And women came \ncrying into the front door there, bleeding from back-alley abortions. \nThis is something my friend speaks about as being humane and kind and \ngood.\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\n  Well, today the Senate has a chance to take a stand against the \nglobal gag order. The Senate has a chance to express itself in favor of \nthe health of women, of girls. I am proud to be offering this \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to retain the remainder of my time, set aside \nthe amendment, at which time we will have a vote on it at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2700.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, before the clerk reports the amendment, \nI ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 minutes to speak on \nthe amendment, followed by--that my amendment be set aside and Senator \nLieberman be recognized for 5 minutes to call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2700.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provision in section 113 that increases the \n   limit on the United States' share for United Nations peacekeeping \n operations during fiscal year 2008 from 25 percent to 27.1 percent so \nthat the United States does not pay more than its fair share for United \n                          States peacekeeping)\n\n       On page 231, strike lines 1 through 7.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, the history of our financial commitment \nto United Nations peacekeeping should be a cautionary tale. For \ninstance, from 1988 to 1994, U.N. peacekeeping spiraled out of control \nas the number of operations more than tripled and costs soared from \n$268 million to $3.5 billion. Finally, in 1994, the Democratically \ncontrolled Congress and President Clinton enacted legislation \nunilaterally reducing the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget \nfrom 31 percent to 25 percent. The annual U.S. peacekeeping bill fell \nfrom almost $1 billion to around $300 million back in 1997. With the \nhistoric Helms-Biden U.N. agreement, we managed to clear up our fair \nshare of arrears in exchange for much needed reforms.\n  Congress later agreed to a glidepath in our peacekeeping assessment \nrate, still maintaining the 25-percent cap in law but permitting higher \nauthorized levels as we worked to achieve that goal.\n  Last year the United States recognized our assessment at 25 percent; \nthe same as the year before. Now in a Democratically controlled \nCongress, there is suddenly a push to roll back this achievement. It is \nestimated that for 2007, each percentage point over the cap costs U.S. \ntaxpayers $50 million per year. There is no way the United States \nshould pay a penny more than the 25-percent assessed contribution rate. \nDespite scandal after scandal, the U.N. has neglected to adopt any \nreforms that would address the abuse, misconduct, mismanagement, and \ncorruption that have plagued its peacekeeping operations and the body \nas a whole. United Nations peacekeepers are reported to have committed \nsuch egregious crimes as the rape and forced prostitution of the women \nand young girls they are sent to protect, all under the protection of \nthe blue helmet. Peacekeepers have also been accused of torturing and \nmurdering prisoners in their efforts to smuggle gold and arms to the \nrebels they were charged with disarming. Tell me how these actions such \nas these are worth more money.\n  The United Nations cannot even spend the billions of dollars they \nreceive now in a manner that is above reproach. According to the U.N. \nOffice of Internal Oversight, from the audit of $1 billion in U.N. \npeacekeeping contracts over a 6-year period, $298 million was subject \nto waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I rise in support of this amendment that would actually keep our \nassessment rate at the 25-percent rate instead of what is in the bill, \nraising it to 27.1 percent. I personally think we should decrease it \neven further, but the least we should do is keep it at the 25-percent \nrate.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2691\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2691.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Coleman, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2691.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that, of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n  available for the Economic Support Fund, $75,000,000 shall be made \n  available for programs of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs of the \n    Department of State to support democracy, the rule of law, and \n                          governance in Iran)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n     SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNANCE IN IRAN\n\n       Sec. 699B. Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title III for other bilateral economic \n     assistance under the heading ``Economic Support Fund'', \n     $75,000,000 shall be made available for programs of the \n     Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs of the Department of State to \n     support democracy, the rule of law, and governance in Iran.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment I am pleased to \noffer with Senators Brownback and Kyl. It would restore the $75 million \nrequested by the administration to support programs of democracy, rule \nof law, and governance in Iran.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Coleman and Graham be added as \noriginal sponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No government today poses a greater threat to the \nUnited States, indeed, to the Middle East and probably to the world, \nthan the Islamic Republic of Iran. We are all aware of the belligerent \ninternational behavior of the Iranian regime, its efforts to develop \nnuclear weapons, its use of Islamist terrorist groups such as Hamas, \nHezbollah, and the Taliban, to undermine moderate governments across \nthe Middle East, its designation by the United States State Department \nas the No. 1 state sponsor of terror and, of course, its escalating \nproxy war against American troops and Iraqi civilians and military in \nIraq, where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been training, arming, \nequipping, and directing terrorists who are responsible in turn for the \nmurder of hundreds of American soldiers and the murder of thousands of \nIraqi civilians and soldiers.\n  What may, I fear, be less appreciated is that Iran's extremist \nterrorist behavior abroad is matched by equally extremist behavior at \nhome. Just as the Iranian regime has been supporting the forces of \nrepression and terror against the people of Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, \nand Afghanistan, it is also escalating a campaign of repression and \nterror against its own citizens, the people of Iran. As the New York \nTimes reported yesterday, the Iranian Government has in recent months \n``arrested prominent intellectuals, suppressed the Iranian student \nmovement, rolled back social freedoms, purged university faculties, \n[and] closed newspapers.''\n  This assault on Iranian civil society has been well documented by the \nmost prominent international human rights nongovernmental \norganizations. Amnesty International, for instance, reports that ``in \nrecent months, the Iranian authorities have been carrying out a \nwidespread crackdown on civil society, targeting academics, women's \nrights activists, students, journalists and labor organizations.''\n  Dissidents and democrats in Iran today are under attack by their own \nGovernment. The question before this\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nCongress is whether we are going to stand with them in solidarity or \nwhether we will turn away our heads. This amendment would provide $75 \nmillion in funds, the amount requested by the administration; in fact, \nannounced by Secretary of State Rice. That announcement, I know from \nsources I have, was broadly heard and appreciated within the Iranian \ncivil society dissident movement. The committee has recommended one-\nthird of that amount of money. This $75 million would go to labor \nactivists, women's groups, journalists, human rights advocates, and \nother members of Iranian civil society. It provides Congress an \nopportunity to demonstrate that even as we condemn the behavior of the \nIranian regime, we stand with the Iranian people, a people with a proud \nhistory who truly are, in my opinion, yearning to be free. That freedom \nis suppressed by the fanatical regime that dominates their lives today.\n  The alternative path before Congress, if we don't adopt this \namendment, would be to cut the administration's request by two-thirds. \nAt that level of funding, existing programs will not only be unable to \nexpand, they will actually be cut back. In other words, at just the \nmoment when the Iranian Government is engaged in an unprecedented \nrollback of the human rights and political freedoms of the Iranian \npeople, the American Government will be rolling back its own programs \nto help defend those rights and freedoms. Why would we do this?\n  The report language of the Appropriations subcommittee, I say \nrespectfully, says that ``the Committee supports the goals of promoting \ndemocracy in Iran,'' but ``it is particularly concerned that grantees \nsuspected of receiving U.S. assistance have been harassed and arrested \nby the Government of Iran for their pro-democracy activities.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to be given another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In other words, the argument against this amendment \nseems to be that we should give less to help dissidents in Iran because \nour help, in turn, may lead to their harassment by the totalitarian \ngovernment in Tehran. I respectfully disagree with this logic. I know \nthat we do not give less to democracy advocates in Myanmar or Zimbabwe \nor Belarus when they are being harassed by the regime, nor do we give \nless to freedom fighters behind the Iron Curtain in Poland, \nCzechoslovakia, and Hungary. On the contrary, it is precisely when \ndissidents are under attack that they need more help from the United \nStates, not less. I am sure my colleagues would agree that if we give \nless money to these civil society human rights activists in Iran, the \nIranian regime will not repress them any less. The repression probably, \nin fact, will be greater. As to the argument that those who accept this \nmoney--and I can say, speaking generally, that the money is given \nthrough third parties, international organizations, to the civil \nsociety human rights advocates in Iran--that somehow they will be \nharassed for receiving this money, I believe the just and right thing \nto do is leave that decision to those who are fighting for freedom in \nIran, for us to be willing to help them if they want that help. The \nrecord is clear there.\n  Since the State Department began making these grants 8 months ago, 90 \npercent of the fiscal year 2006 funds have been obligated, with the \nremaining funds expected to be obligated by mid-September. Perhaps \nthere are some Iranian groups that do not want our funding, but it is \nclear that many others do. The need is great. It is beyond the $75 \nmillion this amendment would provide. That choice should be theirs. Our \nmoral responsibility is to make the money available to these courageous \nfighters for freedom in Iran, those who want not only more freedom but \na better future for themselves and their children.\n  I want to close by saying that we know from history that dissidents \ncan change history, because history is made not by abstract, inexorable \nforces but by individual human beings such as Vaclav Havel or Lech \nWalesa or Andrei Sakharov or Natan Sharansky. It was the bravery of \nthese people that kindled our moral imagination to see the suffering of \nmillions behind the Iron Curtain, and it was their leadership that \ninspired millions more to cast off their shackles and overthrow a cruel \nand dictatorial system of Communist government that many thought would \nendure forever. Like the Communist terrorists of eastern Europe, the \nleaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran repress their people because \nthey are frightened of them. They know how powerful the dissidents and \nthe democrats in their midst can become. These are the people to whom \nthis money would go. That is the reason my colleagues and I have \noffered this amendment.\n\n  I ask all Members of the Senate to support it, and I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nthe Lieberman amendment for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2691\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this is the Lieberman-Brownback \namendment; and several others are on the amendment as well. I have \nworked on this issue for some period of time. Over the past 4 years, we \nhave been able to get some funding for democracy-building activity \ninside of Iran. It has been a difficult project. We have not been able \nto get much money secured, but it follows a long tradition of \nsuccessful efforts at targeting regimes that do not support democracy, \nthat undermine democracy, indeed, even support terrorism around the \nworld, by building civil society organizations within that country.\n  It is very interesting to me you can get a message into Iran, and \nthere is a good possibility, there is an excellent prospect of building \ncivil society organizations inside Iran. You can look at some of the \nthings that have taken place recently where there has been a bus driver \nstrike and the possibility of a labor union movement forming there or \neven with some of the teacher strikes or some of the student strikes.\n  You are clearly seeing the people inside Iran are opposed to the \nregime. We\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\nneed to work, I believe, with them and with others to form civil \nsociety organizations inside Iran to go at the regime itself, and to \nundermine the regime itself, of saying: If you are not going to support \nour civil rights here, we are going to oppose you.\n  We saw some of these things taking place with some fruit of success \ninside the Ukraine, where you had a revolution that took place there, \nwhere you had a number of civil society organizations that had built up \nover a period of years, over time, so that when there was a movement of \nthe people where they decided they didn't like that autocratic \ndictatorship, that autocratic rule that was taking place, there was an \nunderlying group that said: Yes, here is where we should go as a group \nand as a society.\n  Plus, I think we have to recognize what Iran is. The Iranian \nGovernment is the lead sponsor of terrorism around the world. The \nIranian people do not support the Government. They are in direct \nconflict with the United States now in their support and development \nand funding of troops, of people being trained in Iran or supplied in \nIran to go into Iraq. We can oppose, exterior-wise, the Iranians. We \ncan oppose the regime that way. But one of the key things we can also \ndo is say, internally, there should be a development of a civil society \nwithin Iran, an internal support for people there.\n  The Iranian regime not only threatens us, they directly and violently \nthreaten a key ally of ours in the region in Israel. In addition to the \nwell-publicized extremist rhetoric from President Ahmadinejad, Iran \ndirectly funds groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran directly funds \nthem, which are designed--these groups--to perpetuate violence and \nthwart efforts for Middle Eastern peace.\n  Their regime is engaged in a campaign against the United States \ninterests in Iraq, as I have stated. Some in the United States would \nprefer to ignore Iran's threats to our operations or pretend they do \nnot exist at all. It is increasingly clear Iran's leaders are \ndeliberately and purposely targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. The Iranian \nregime does not want the United States to succeed in Iraq and is \nconsistently resorting to violence to underscore that threat. I also \nnote we are also learning of the regime's sponsorship of violence \ninside of Afghanistan as well.\n  In short, it is not enough to contemplate what might happen if the \nUnited States and Iran came to blows. Based on the actions of the \nregime in Tehran, Iran is already in conflict with the United States.\n  On our current course, the future is not bright. Iran is moving ever \ncloser to a nuclear capability that will allow it to threaten the \nsecurity of anyone who opposes its dreams of dominating the Middle \nEast.\n  This amendment provides for the full $75 million for democracy \nprograms. It would take the first step in this direction. We must call \nthe regime to account for its flagrant human rights abuses committed \nagainst the Iranian people.\n  I have worked with a number of Iranian dissidents. I have done talk \nradio programs that have broadcast into Tehran.\n  The regime is brutal in opposing its own people. It is a huge sponsor \nof terrorism, the largest in the world. It is one we should oppose, and \nthis is a key method that needs to be adequately funded--and I think \nhardly funded very much at $75 million. But if you cut that down to $30 \nmillion, you are below a target that probably even can be of much \neffect at all. We clearly need to do this.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I want to add Senator \nCollins as a cosponsor to this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Collins be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMartinez and Vitter be added as cosponsors to both of my amendments I \npreviously spoke about, amendments Nos. 2707 and 2708, related to \nMexico City policy and the Kemp-Kasten law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, so we can get to the status of things, we \nnow have approximately five amendments that have been offered that we \nknow we are going to have to have votes on. There are a number of \namendments which have been submitted, and we are waiting for Members to \ncome down to present those amendments or, in the alternative, to tell \nus what they want to do with them.\n  We would like to wrap this bill up tonight, but it is going to be \ndifficult unless we get Members to participate in this process by \nactually appearing on the floor and telling us how they want to deal \nwith their amendments. However, as to these five amendments that have \nbeen offered, I hope we can go to a vote on them fairly soon and at \nleast get the process started.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have three amendments that I will \ndiscuss in a group, and I believe one of them will be accepted by the \nmajority and ranking member, and that is an amendment creating \ntransparency at the World Bank on the malaria program. I will spend a \nvery short time talking about that.\n  What we know is we have seen in the last 2\\1/2\\ years a tremendous \nchange--much of it thanks to the chairman of this committee in terms of \ntransparency and in working with us on the malaria program--but we have \nseen a change from using the wrong medicines, the wrong techniques, and \nthe wrong prevention techniques. We have 2 million people a year in \nAfrica die from a preventable, curable, treatable disease.\n  Not long after I came to the Senate, myself along with Norm Coleman \nand other people who have done great work--and Senator Brownback as \nwell--on malaria, as well as the chairman, what we saw was an \nineffective program. The President had a malaria initiative--PMI--and \nit was set out and peer-reviewed--scientific data to approach this \ndisease from both prevention and treatment. What we saw at the World \nBank was a failed $500 million program and an attempt at another \nprogram for which there is no transparency. But the reports from the \nscientific literature Lancet, the greatest medical periodical from the \nBritish, had a devastating article outlining the fact that the World \nBank continues to use drugs that don't treat, drugs that have \nresistance, it does not do preventive indoor spraying, does not \ndistribute on a free basis bed netting--the three significant, \nconsistent ways in which we treat African malaria, as well as the way \nwe treat it throughout the rest of the world.\n  So I want to thank them in advance for doing that. This simply says \nthat the World Bank has to be transparent with what they are doing on \nmalaria.\n  What we know is the World Health Organization has also changed \nsignificantly. We are going to see hundreds of millions of people's \nlives markedly changed through an appropriate drug treatment prevention \nstrategy for malaria. Of those 2 million people who die every year, 500 \nmillion of them are 5 years of age and under--I mean 500,000. Five \nhundred thousand are pregnant women. There are another 500,000 children \nwho are permanently brain damaged from malaria. If we are going to help \nin foreign aid, then it ought to be effective foreign aid. So I thank \nthe chairman and ranking member for their consideration on that.\n  The next amendment I would like to bring up talks about having some \ntransparency with the $5.3 billion we send to the United Nations every \nyear. This body, as well as the House, unanimously passed transparency \nand accountability for our own Government and our own agencies. We are \ngoing to see this next January where everything in this country where \nthe taxpayers' money is spent is going to be online and available for \ntaxpayers, peer-reviewed looks, watchdog groups, as well as the press \nto see how we are spending money.\n  What this amendment does is it ensures that the U.S. contribution to \nthe United Nations is not being wasted to fraud, which we have seen \nmultiple times at the United Nations--waste, abuse, corruption, which \nwe have seen and which has been documented--by maximizing the public \ntransparency of all U.N. spending or our contribution thereof. This \namendment says that the Secretary of State certify publicly that the \nUnited Nations is publicly transparent about its spending this year, \nbefore any of the money we are going to send to the United Nations next \nyear is sent. The basic transparency required by this amendment would \ninclude a posting on a publicly available Web site of copies of all \ncontracts, grants, program reviews, audits, budgets, and progress \nreports relating to fiscal year 2007.\n  There are a lot of reasons the U.N. should be accountable and \ntransparent, the first of which--and I won't go into a lot of details--\nis the Oil for Food Program where $10 billion was mismanaged, stolen, \nand fraudulently used in a way that was totally unaccountable, to the \ndetriment of the people of Iraq. As of this time, there have been eight \nguilty pleas, two guilty verdicts, two agreements of forfeiture \njudgments, and nine pending cases. There are also fugitives from the \ncorruption of that.\n  The U.N. to this day refuses to fully and publicly release the Oil \nfor Food Program's contracts and financial documents. Some people will \nsay: Well, you can't force this on the U.N.\n  (Mrs. BOXER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COBURN. There is not an accountability that we can require.\n  We are the largest contributor to the United Nations. We have a \nrequirement and a responsibility to the people of this country to make \nsure that money is well spent. The easiest way to make sure money is \nwell spent and properly spent is for it to be transparent and available \nto the people who are making these contributions.\n  The second reason we should be concerned about how the U.N. spends \nmoney is procurement fraud. Last year, former U.S. Ambassador to the \nU.N. John Bolton testified to the Federal Financial Management \nSubcommittee that of the $1 billion in U.N. peacekeeping contracts that \nwere audited--they didn't audit all of them but just the first $1 \nbillion that they audited--a third was found to be lost to waste and \nfraud and corruption. The U.N. refused to release this audit, even to \nSecretary Bolton, our representative at the U.N; however, he was able \nto secure a leaked copy of it. What that $1 billion represents in terms \nof waste, fraud, and abuse is our entire contribution to peacekeeping. \nFor all the money we pay for worldwide peacekeeping through the U.N., \nwhat we can extrapolate from this audit is that our entire contribution \nwas wasted.\n  There is an even more worrisome program at the U.N. called the United \nNations Development Program. What we know over the last 10 years is \nthat over $100 million has been funneled inappropriately, fraudulently, \nand without any oversight to North Korea for things which it should not \nhave gone. Ten million dollars, at least, was transferred in cash \ndirectly to the leaders of the North Korean regime. We know some of \nthat cash was used to purchase homes in Europe and Canada. The Chicago \nTribune reported there was evidence that they deposited cash into the \nsame account that North Korea used to buy ballistic missiles. The \nUnited Nations Development Program refuses to allow our own \ninvestigators from our own Government to audit and review its financial \ninformation. It refuses, despite the United States sitting on the UNDP \nExecutive Board and being the largest contributor to the UNDP budget.\n  Basic transparency--the idea that we give money and they spend money \nto accomplish good in the world--can only be effective if we know where \nthe money is spent and how it is spent. The idea to have the U.N. \ntransparent will protect against future scandals.\n  One of the things that bothers me the most about this and our \ncontribution is the fact that the U.N. refuses to be transparent with \nthe money we give them. Every domestic agency, every government program \nin this country is required to provide this body detailed financial \ninformation, program reviews, audits, and budgets. According to OMB, we \nspend an excessive $5.3 billion of the taxpayers' money on the United \nNations, but despite repeated\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\nrequests by Ambassador Bolton, by congressional committees, by \noversight committees, by committees on investigation, the U.N. refuses \nto make available information as to how it spends its money, make its \naudits available, program reviews available, or any other financial \ndata available to the Congress or the world at large or the public in \nthis country.\n  The only way we have been able to find out what we have been able to \nfind out is that documents have been leaked. This amendment matters. \nThe reason it matters is that every dollar lost to U.N. corruption is \none less dollar that can save the life of an African child, one more \ndollar that could efficiently prevent violence around the world. Just \nin what we know on UNDP waste and fraud last year, 20,000 lives could \nhave been saved in Africa from HIV. Or take the country of Uganda, \nplagued by civil war, and epidemics, and other things; according to the \nWorld Bank, their whole GDP was less than what we have wasted.\n  Think about the impact we could have. Some will say the U.N. has a \nprocurement Web site where information on all contracts that are \ngranted is posted. They didn't have that until 2\\1/2\\ years ago when we \nstarted pushing. It only shows a very small percentage of moneys. It is \nnot thorough or comprehensive. It is controlled by the U.N. Secretariat \nand not all the other agencies under the U.N. So we don't get a look at \nhow our money is spent at the U.N.\n  This is an amendment that has real teeth. This says what is good for \nour country in terms of how we spend our money, making it publicly \navailable and transparent to hold us accountable, ought to apply to the \nU.N.\n  Madam President, I will talk for a moment about amendment No. 2716. \nThis is a straightforward amendment that moves money around in this \nappropriations bill. I think we can make a great case for why we ought \nto do it. What this amendment does is divide and take away money from \nthe global environment facility, which is run by the World Bank but \nmanaged by the United Nations, which has been found to be totally \nfailing in both what it is trying to accomplish and also measuring the \nresults of what it accomplishes. We redirect that money into the \nPresident's malaria initiative--$30 million--to bring it up to what \nthey requested. It is a highly successful program that is done right. \nIt is one of our best foreign programs. It has metrics, measurements, \naccountability, and results-based, oriented goals that can be measured \nand quantified. It takes and puts the remainder of that money, $76.67 \nmillion, into other lifesaving programs in the child survival and \nmaternal health programs, the global environment facilities in the \nWorld Bank, administered by the UNDP, for which grants and contracts \nare awarded for the purpose of addressing or preventing harm caused by \nmanmade climate change.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has audited or looked at this, \nand there are no results they can demonstrate; there is no direction in \nterms of the grants or no evaluation of the grants. They said it is \nfailing to prevent any environmental damage, based on what they have \nseen. It hasn't mitigated any that are already there. It agreed with \nthe United States in 2002 to implement performance guidelines. It \nagreed to those. Yet it has done nothing in the last 5 years to meet \nthe required agreement with our Government. It doesn't allocate its \nfunds based on performance or environmental benefit. In other words, \nthere is no relationship between getting the result and the money that \nwas spent. It lacks any significant anticorruption guidelines. We know \nit is there as well. Yet they refuse to agree to these things our \nGovernment has asked for. It is another mismanaged program by the UNDP.\n  What does the effect of moving this money to other areas mean? What \nwe know is that, with the President's malaria initiative, we are fast \non our way to solving this dread disease in Africa, this preventable \ndisease in Africa. We are gearing up the focus countries with a plan to \nexpand that. By not funding this at the expected level, or the level \nthat was requested, it means two or three more countries are not going \nto have the right drugs for malaria. They are not going to have the \nresidual training. They are not going to have the trained staff with \nwhich to do that properly. We are not going to have long-term bed \nnetting available for all these families, which is more important. Two \nmillion people in Africa are dying from malaria or an ineffective \nprogram that is not accomplishing its goals even though it has a great \nname?\n  This amendment simply moves the money around to a way in which we \nhelp children, help refugees, and we help fight the battle against \nmalaria in Africa. I hoped the President's malaria initiative would \nhave been fully funded. This will fund it and allow us to expand the \nmost successful foreign aid program we have, in terms of fighting \ndisease. I hope we have consideration of that amendment. I will ask for \na vote if it is not going to be accepted by the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 p.m. \ntoday, whatever is pending be set aside and the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the following amendments in the order listed, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the vote; \nthat prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; that after the first vote in \nsequence, the other votes, if they require a rollcall, be limited to 10 \nminutes each: the Ensign amendment No. 2700, Lieberman amendment No. \n2691, Brownback amendment No. 2707, Boxer amendment No. 2719, and the \nBrownback amendment No. 2708.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the next amendment I want to spend some \ntime on has been in the news of late. The Global Fund initiative has \nbeen a very important tool in terms of fighting HIV, TB, and malaria, \nwhich are the three significant diseases around the world that are \nlimiting progress, health, life, and sustainability for many people \nthroughout the world.\n  What this amendment does is eliminate the secrecy of the operation of \nthat group. I am not highly critical of discretionary spending to \naccomplish a goal, but I am highly critical of not having transparency \non where money goes. We can do that in a way that protects \nwhistleblowers and in a way that satisfies the American public that if \nwe are going to send their money overseas, we know exactly what it is \nspent on and how it is spent.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It conditions 20 percent of our \ncontributions to the Global Fund, which is significant, on \ncertification by the Secretary of State that the Global Fund has made \nall the financial and programmatic documents available to the public on \na Web site. That says if you are going to spend $100 million on a drug, \nput it on a Web site and say whether you competitively bid it, and here \nis what we paid for it. If you paid a consultant, say here is how much \nwe paid them for it. It is the American taxpayers' money.\n  I think it is significant that the total amount of money contributed \nto date for the Global Fund, which I support, has been $2.9 billion. If \nwe follow both what the committee or the Senate happened to do, we are \ngoing to have that above $6 billion at the end of next year; $6 billion \nis a significant amount of money. What the global fund says is they \nhave an Inspector General and that we don't need this. The problem is \nthat Inspector General reports are good only if the people who have \ndecisionmaking capability on the funding get to see those reports. The \nboard at the Global Fund doesn't even get to see the reports. As a \nmatter of fact, the IG of the Global Fund recently retired over the \ncontroversy of his IG report that was very critical of the management \nof the Global Fund.\n  The answer to accountability is transparency in what we do. This is a \nstraightforward amendment that conditions only 20 percent of the \nmoney--less than the increase of what we will be funding with the \nGlobal Fund--by saying you have to become transparent, you have to \nbecome accountable, and it has to be accessible. It is\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nsimple. We will get better value for the dollars we contribute to the \nGlobal Fund if, in fact, we adopt this amendment.\n  The other thing that will happen is more people will have lifesaving \ntreatments or preventive strategies applied to them if we have \ntransparency and accountability.\n  All of the amendments we have talked about today are essentially \nabout transparency. It is about if we are going to send American money \ninto foreign places through independent agencies, separate from our own \nGovernment, we ought to know how that money is spent. It is \nstraightforward. All of us would do the same thing as we give our \nmoney--we look at church budgets and we look at nonprofits' budgets \nwhen we contribute to them, and we find out how they are spending their \nmoney. We have independent reporting in this country on nonprofits on \nhow they spend money and how much percentage on overhead and whether \nthey waste money. So all these amendments are about accountability--\naccountability through transparency. I admit they have some teeth. But \nwe are not going to be accountable for the American taxpayers' dollars \nunless we apply enough pressure to get transparency so we know where \nthe American taxpayers' dollars are going.\n  I also want to submit for the Record a copy of a whistleblower \nconversation at UNDP, associated with one of the other amendments. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Mr. Robert Benson, Chief, Ethics Office, United Nations.\n     From: Mr. Mathieu Credo Koumoin, Ph.D.\n     Re: request for ethics review of my dismissal through whistle \n         blowing retaliation review and protection from \n         retaliation.\n     Date: September 4, 2007.\n       I am a former UNDP staff member (dismissed as of December \n     31st, 2006) with a case pending before the Joint Appeals \n     Board (JAB acceptance letter dated February 15th, 2007). \n     Prior to my joining UNDP/GEF on a leave of absence from the \n     African Development Bank where I served for 3 years as a \n     Senior Public Utilities Economist, I was an Energy Economist \n     with the World Bank in Washington, DC for 6 years. As of \n     December 31st, 2007 when I was dismissed and including my \n     academic/teaching and Research experience as a Mellon \n     Research Fellow from the University of Pennsylvania, \n     (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) I have 16 years of \n     International Development experience from the World Bank, the \n     AfDB and UNDP-GEF combined.\n       Following my initial success within UNDP-GEF and to avoid a \n     perception of conflict of interest, I was encouraged by UNDP \n     to resign my position with the AfDB in December 2005 only to \n     be announced on March 23rd, 2006 that my contract would not \n     be renewed when it expires in June 30th, 2006 on performance \n     grounds. This, despite the fact that: (i) the performance \n     review which had barely started was not complete; (ii) I \n     received very satisfactory reviews on my performance at mid-\n     term based on both the volume and the substantive quality of \n     my projects (see attachment); (iii) was warmly congratulated \n     by my line supervisor and even promised a promotion to D1 if \n     the Program Executive Coordination would sign off (see \n     attachment); (iv) received strong endorsement from GEFSEC \n     Secretariat on all of my Project submissions to GEF Council \n     which captured 85% of the entire Climate Change market niche \n     in Sub-Saharan Africa; ahead of all other competing GEF \n     Implementing Agencies; and (v) received a formal written \n     promise of being kept on board by the Executive Coordinator \n     around mid-term review prior to the strong procurement \n     battles and pressures (see attachment).\n       The totality of the above set of circumstances led me to \n     resign my position with the AfDB in December 2005 to ensure \n     that my effectiveness within UNDP-GEF would not be undercut \n     by the sizable co-financing expected from the AfDB; \n     particularly as my line supervisor--subsequently--formally \n     apologized to me for pressing me beyond the breaking point on \n     the contract procurement and funds re-direction issues in \n     November 2005.\n       I have attached to this request for review prima-facie \n     evidence supporting that I was under tremendous pressure from \n     my line Management to re-direct funds and carry out sole-\n     source contracting to UNIDO (based in Vienna), and IEPF \n     (Francophone Institute of Energy and Environment based in \n     Quebec-Canada), and tried to bring these problems to the \n     attention of higher officials (see attachment). It is \n     important to note that, in my best professional judgment, the \n     activities requested by my line Management violated basic \n     rules of UN/UNDP procurement with respect to transparency, \n     competition and accountability, as the African countries for \n     which the funds were intended in the first place were being \n     left in the dark, and the project documents approved by GEF \n     Council were quite clear along with the initial project \n     concept review sheet from GEFSEC which ruled that IEPF was \n     not eligible to execute or implement the GEF African \n     Microhydro Project on behalf of beneficiary African \n     countries. As vividly illustrated in the enclosed annexes, my \n     resistance to the above pressure is thoroughly documented \n     along with my Supervisor's insistence and ultimate apologies \n     (see attachment) only when he decided to fire me in \n     retaliation for my stubborn rejection of a sole sourcing \n     scheme to award IEPF together with UNIDO UNDP contracts from \n     my Regional African Microhydro project. The sole sourcing \n     scheme being forced upon me by my supervisors at the expense \n     of Africa-based regional economic commissions as clearly \n     stipulated in the GEF Council approved project documents was \n     the only bone of contention with my Management. For my \n     whistle blowing efforts and because I had the courage to \n     bring these issues to the attention of the Administrator and \n     other higher up officials, I was fired without due process \n     and have been unable to find work; in part as a direct result \n     of damaging references from UNDP and in part as a result of \n     the on-going legal process.\n       On the basis of the above along with the pieces of evidence \n     attached, in absence of an Ethics Office within the UNDP, and \n     of a functional whistleblower policy as well as independent \n     internal control and oversight mechanisms, I believe that I \n     deserve to have my case reviewed by the United Nations Ethics \n     Office, which is the only one mechanisms established and \n     recognized by UN Member States, equipped to provide internal \n     administrative review and protection from retaliation and I \n     am so requesting.\n       I look forward to your kind attention and consideration. \n     Should you require further information you can contact me \n     directly or my legal counsel.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This outlines the fact that in the Global Fund, UNDP has \ntrue corruption in terms of directing how the money is spent to their \nfriends, not the people who can actually do the work or not those who \nare best suited for the work, but rather at the whim of a friend of \nsomebody working at UNDP. It is very revealing.\n  What is even more revealing is that UNDP refused to accept a U.N. \nethics office and so, therefore, the whistleblower at UNDP doesn't even \nhave the protections of other people at the United Nations. So we have \nan individual who was doing a great job, but because he reported and \nrefused to send money to somebody not capable of doing a job, not \ncapable of performing with a good portion of our taxpayers' money, he \ngets fired. That is the kind of transparency we need to have at the \nUNDP and at the Global Fund.\n  It is my hope the Members of this body will seriously consider that \nwe ought to be applying the same standards to where we send money \noutside of our Government that we are now applying to our Government. \nIt is my hope that I will have the consideration of the ranking member \nand the chairman in supporting these amendments.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2705 Withdrawn\n\n                           Amendment No. 2773\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 2705 and call up \namendment No. 2773. Amendment No. 2705 is one of the en bloc amendments \nand it is the wrong number. I wish to replace it with amendment No. \n2773.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2773.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that the United States contribution to the United \n   Nations is not being lost to waste, fraud, abuse or corruption by \n   maximizing the public transparency of all United Nations spending)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n         TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n       Sec. 699B.  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used by the Department of State \n     as a contribution to the United Nations or any subsidiary \n     body of the United Nations, including any organization that \n     is authorized to use the United Nations logo, until the \n     Secretary of State certifies that the United Nations, such \n     subsidiary body of the United Nations, or such organization, \n     as the case may be, is fully and publicly transparent about \n     all of its spending, including for procurement purposes, that \n     occurred during fiscal year 2007, including the posting on a \n     publicly available web site of--\n       (1) copies of all contracts, grants, subcontracts, and \n     subgrants awarded or utilized during fiscal year 2007;\n       (2) copies of all program reviews, audits, budgets, and \n     project progress reports relating to fiscal year 2007; and\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\n       (3) any other financial information deemed necessary by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) The documents required to be made available under \n     subsection (a) shall be in unredacted form, except that such \n     information as determined necessary by the Secretary to \n     protect the identity of whistleblowers or other informants to \n     investigations and reports and proprietary information may be \n     redacted.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going to begin voting in about 15 \nminutes. The Senator from Oklahoma has offered a series of amendments. \nI happen to be in great sympathy with the basic thrust of these \namendments. They are basically trying to make these programs which \naddress disease more efficiently delivered and have better oversight \nwith more transparency. They are legitimate proposals.\n  I hope as we participate in this voting sequence we can work with the \nSenator and come to an agreement on most of these amendments because I \ndo believe the thrust of them is the correct direction to go, which is \nto demand transparency and to make sure the money we are spending gets \nwhere it is supposed to go and make sure, especially in the area of the \nmalaria and HIV battles which we have in Africa, that we are using \nthese funds efficiently and that the right medicines are being \ndelivered.\n  I appreciate the Senator's proposals. Hopefully, as we proceed with \nthese amendments--I know the chairman feels this way and I certainly \nfeel this way. I believe we should wrap this bill up tonight. We can \nwrap it up tonight if Members will tell us how they want to handle \ntheir amendments. We are ready to vote on them. If they want to vote on \nthem, we will vote on them. We do need to get some Members to come \nforward. They have offered their amendments, filed their amendments, \nand they should tell us specifically how they want to handle those \namendments so we can complete the process of passing this legislation, \nwhich is important and should be moved forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2700\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2700 \noffered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2700\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. Instead of \nraising the percentage of money that the United States pays for U.N. \npeacekeeping from 25 percent, the current level the last couple of \nyears, to 27.1 percent, my amendment would strike that and keep it at \n25 percent.\n  We have read about the atrocities U.N. peacekeepers have committed \nacross the world. There are many reforms the United Nations needs to \ndo. When the Democrats were in control, with President Clinton, they \nlowered it from 31 percent to 25 percent as the percentage we would \npay. I actually believe it should be lower, but it should not be raised \nfrom 25 percent to 27.1 percent.\n  We should continue to put pressure on the United Nations to do the \ndesperately needed reforms at the United Nations and not send the \nprecious tax dollars the American taxpayers send to us to be wasted at \nthe United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, both Senator Gregg and I will oppose this \namendment. In doing so, we are supporting President Bush's number on \nthese dues. The fact is, we can't ask the U.N. to carry out \npeacekeeping missions unless we pay our dues.\n  For example, this Congress pushed very hard to have the U.N. do a \npeacekeeping mission in Darfur just last month. After we pushed for \nthat, they agreed to it. Now we have to do what our own Ambassador \nsays, what President Bush has said, and what the Secretary of State has \nsaid: We have to pay our share of peacekeeping operations.\n  I would hope Senators will join with the distinguished ranking member \nand myself and oppose this amendment by voting no.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am voting no and actually supporting the administration \non this position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has now expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2700.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this amendment simply reinstates the \nKemp-Kasten language that has been part of U.S. policy for 25 years. I \nwill read the amendment:\n\n       . . . none of the funds made available in this Act nor any \n     unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made \n     available to any organization or program which, as determined \n     by the President, supports, or participates in the management \n     of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary \n     sterilization.\n\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\n\n  All we are saying with this amendment is no U.S. funds for coercive \nabortion or forced, involuntary sterilization. I hope everybody in the \nbody would be opposed to forced abortion, whether you are pro-life or \npro-choice, and opposed to involuntary sterilization. These are things \nwhich have no place in U.S. policy and funding by U.S. Government \nagencies. If this is part of the bill, the bill will be vetoed, and it \nis bad policy and it is a bad idea and it is morally reprehensible.\n  I hope all my colleagues will vote for amendment No. 2707 and oppose \nforced abortion and forced sterilization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, no one, no one supports forced abortion or \nforced sterilization. Let's be honest about that. What this is, there \nis a provision in the U.S. law called the Kemp-Kasten amendment. It is \ndesigned to ensure that U.S. Government funds do not go to \norganizations engaged in coercive abortion or involuntary \nsterilization. We all support that. But the law has been construed \ndifferently by the White House to deny funds to the UNFPA because it is \na program in China. The irony is they are trying to give alternatives \nto abortion. They are trying to give alternatives to forced \nsterilization. If we agree to this amendment, then what we are saying \nis we will turn our backs on the most populous nation on Earth, a \ncountry that is rapidly becoming the largest contributor to global \nwarming, and we will not support a program that will give them \nalternatives to abortion and forced sterilization.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Snowe. I ask for the attention of colleagues because \nwomen's lives are on the line. The Senate has twice passed this \namendment which overturns the Global Gag Rule, otherwise known as the \nMexico City policy.\n  Colleagues, I wish to tell you a story, a compelling story of what \nhappened in Nepal in 2001. A little 13-year-old girl was raped in Nepal \nby her uncle. A family member took her for an abortion.\n  Under the laws of Nepal, they sentenced that little girl to 20 long \nyears in jail. Because a family planning agency helped her and because \nthat family planning agency in Nepal, an NGO, spoke out on behalf of \nchanging the laws that put a little girl in jail and let the uncle \nfree, America withheld its funds. That is shameful. It is wrong. Please \nhelp me overturn this Mexico City global gag rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if the Senator from California is \naccurate on what she stated--and I don't have any doubt she is--why \ndon't we fund groups that support groups that are for women's rights \nbut not ones that support abortion. The Mexico City language--and it \nhas done this since Ronald Reagan was President--said: We will not use \nU.S. taxpayer funding to fund abortions overseas. We won't support \ngroups that fund abortions overseas. You can be pro-choice and say: I \nthink that makes sense, because I don't think we should use taxpayer \nfunding to support abortion or to promote abortion policies overseas. \nWe should let them decide this deeply moral subject that is a very \ndifficult subject in our country, let alone in places around the world. \nI urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment. We don't need \nto do this. I respect the Senator from California, but I believe there \nare better places for us to use taxpayer funding than to fund abortions \nor groups that are promoting abortion overseas. It is a tough enough \nissue here. I urge Members to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2719.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. We have had a very productive \nday. We have two of our finest managers on this legislation, Senator \nLeahy and the Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg. I always get the \nnames turned around. It should be ``Gregg Judd.'' Anyway, the end is in \nsight.\n  We have a number of amendments that are still pending. We have a \nnumber of amendments offered by one Republican Senator. We will accept \nthose amendments. The problem if he demands votes on these amendments \nand we have other amendments that come forward--I would hope there \nwould be some consideration given to that.\n  We are at a point now where we have had a number of Senators who have \nbeen looking over in detail the managers' package. We should be able to \ncomplete this bill very quickly. The point I am making is, we are going \nto finish this bill tonight whether there are four votes or however \nmany votes it takes. I would hope we could do this. We have been \nmeeting with Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi to see if we can work \nsomething out on reconciliation. That should be able to be completed \nlikely not tonight, but I think we could do it sometime early in the \nmorning. But we are going to finish this appropriations bill tonight.\n  I have had this conversation with the distinguished Republican \nleader. He knew I was going to make this brief statement. So I would \nhope everyone would understand where we are. We have had a very \nproductive few days. This would be a good way to end the week. I look \nforward to completing this legislation as soon as possible tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2708\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2708, offered by the Senator from Kansas.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It \nreinstates what U.S. policy has been since 1984. It was repealed under \nthe Clinton administration and then brought back in, and it is simply \nthat the United States would not fund abortions or groups that promote \nabortions overseas.\n  I wish to make one quick note to individuals. There is a new term \nthat has entered into the lexicon, and it is called ``gendercide.'' It \nis in countries where abortion is being forced and promoted, where they \nare now having male-female ratios where the girls are being killed in \nutero because they are girls. It is called ``gendercide.'' I do not \nthink it is a policy or something we should be any part of.\n  This amendment simply reinstates U.S. policy that we will not be \ninvolved in countries promoting abortion policies or promoting abortion \nwith our taxpayer dollars. I ask my colleagues to vote aye on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, colleagues, if you voted to repeal the \nglobal gag rule, then the obvious way to vote on this amendment is no.\n  What the Senator is trying to do is to strip a very simple thing out \nof the bill, which says that we are not going to deny contraceptives to \nfamily planning groups simply because they do not toe the line with the \nglobal gag rule. If you voted with us to do away with the global gag \nrule, you certainly would vote to do away with this amendment.\n  Why would we deny contraception to families who need it desperately? \nIt would be a terrible vote to vote aye on this amendment because you \nare consigning a lot of women to abortion, and we do not want to do \nthat. We want to get them contraception. So if you believe in family \nplanning, this is a very clear ``no'' vote on the Brownback amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues very much.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Boxer for her \nleadership on this issue of such importance to the health of the \nworld's poorest women.\n  On his first day in office in January 2001, President Bush, by \nexecutive order, with no prior consultation with Congress, reinstated \nthe controversial Mexico City policy on international family planning. \nThe President explained his decision with these words:\n\n       It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used \n     to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote \n     abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief \n     that the Mexico City policy should be restored.\n\n  If U.S. law did, in fact, permit taxpayer funds to be used to pay for \nor promote abortions overseas, then the President might have had a \npoint. But our law does not allow that. Our law explicitly prohibits \nany U.S. funds from being used for abortion or to promote abortion.\n  That is the settled law of the United States. It was passed by the \nCongress and signed into law by President Clinton. It is something we \nhave all supported. In fact, it has been the law for as long as I can \nremember, even during past administrations. It is already against the \nlaw to use taxpayer funds for purposes related to abortion. Somebody \nshould have told that to President Bush.\n  In fact, the Mexico City policy, which he reinstated and has \nmaintained ever since, goes much, much further. Many have called it a \n``global gag rule.'' It prohibits taxpayer funds from being used to \nsupport private family planning organizations, if they use even one \ndollar of their own private funds--not taxpayer funds, but private \nfunds--to provide advice, counseling, and information about abortions, \nand to advocate for safe abortion practices in countries where tens of \nthousands of women suffer injuries or die from complicatlons from \nunsafe abortions.\n  If we tried to impose the Mexico City policy on any family planning \norganization within our borders, it would violate the first amendment. \nBut we impose it on those same organizations when they work overseas \nbeyond the reach of our Constitution.\n  Proponents of the Mexico City policy say that it will reduce the \nnumber of abortions. There is not a shred of evidence to support that \nillogical argument. The reality is the opposite. The International \nPlanned Parenthood Federation, which is cut off from U.S. Government \nsupport because of this policy, used every U.S. tax dollar it received \nin the past to provide voluntary family planning services, like \ncontraceptives, to couples who lack them. By providing for the first \ntime modern birth control methods to people in countries where abortion \nwas the primary method of birth control, the number of abortions goes \ndown.\n  I remember the distinguished former Senator from Oregon, Senator Mark \nHatfield, a dear friend of mine, one of the most revered Members of \nthis body, who became chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nSenator Hatfield was fervently pro-life, opposed to abortion, very \nstrong in his beliefs. I remember a debate on the Mexico City policy \nwhen he stood here--and he probably said it best. I will quote what he \nsaid:\n\n       It is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are \n     not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates \n     increase. The Mexico City policy is unacceptable to me as \n     someone who is strongly opposed to abortion.\n\n  Contrary to a lot of the press reports, this issue is about far more \nthan abortion. It is about protecting the health of women in \ndesperately poor countries where more than half a million women die \neach year from complications relating to pregnancy, and where women \nhave little control over their own bodies or their lives. We have the \nopportunity, at very little expense, to help. Instead--not to save \nmoney but to make a political point--we cut off that help.\n  The Mexico City policy has been the subject of more political \nposturing, more press releases, more fundraising letters, more debates, \nmore votes, and more Presidential vetoes, than virtually any other \nissue I can think of.\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\n  I remember when President Clinton did the right thing by repealing \nthe Mexico City policy. When he did that, a Republican Congress \nresponded by sharply cutting funding for voluntary family planning--not \nfunding for abortions but for voluntary family planning. President \nBush's fiscal year 2008 budget request for family planning does the \nsame thing. His budget would cut it drastically, contrary to what he \nsaid he would do back in 2001.\n  The predictable, tragic result would be an increase in the number of \nabortions and of deaths of women from botched abortions.\n  Again, the evidence is indisputable that when family planning \nservices are available, the number of abortions goes down.\n  I have traveled to many parts of the world. My wife is a registered \nnurse. She has traveled with me. We have seen how bad the situation is. \nWe have seen how a little help can move women in many parts of the \nworld generations ahead of where they are today.\n  That is what the Boxer amendment would do. It would restore U.S. \ncredibility and leadership on an issue of great importance to global \nhealth, to population growth, to global warming, and to the work of \nprivate organizations to make lifesaving services available to the \nworld's poorest women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would advise all Senators here that the \nmajority and minority staffs are working on a unanimous consent \nagreement to get us to the end of tonight, which they will get to. In \nthe meantime, I have something that will alert everyone as to what is \ngoing to happen tomorrow.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2669\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes consideration of the conference report on H.R. 2669--that is \nthe Education reconciliation--tomorrow at 9 a.m, there be 75 minutes \nfor debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member, and \nthe Senate vote on the conference report at 10:15 a.m. with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  I would say to everyone here that I have talked in some detail to \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi about this. When we finish the work on the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill tonight, anyone who wants to \ntalk about this tonight--that is this, the Education reconciliation \nbill--can do that, up to 8 hours and 45 minutes. It will not take that \nmuch time. When we finish the proceedings for this evening, there will \nbe 75 minutes left tomorrow for debate equally divided between Senators \nEnzi and Kennedy on the Education reconciliation bill.\n  I have had a number of Senators on both sides ask what the schedule \nis in the morning. That is it. I ask that this be confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say that Senators Leahy and Gregg \nand their valiant staff are working on something to complete the \nForeign Operations bill. We should have that momentarily. So if \neveryone would be patient, we should have that shortly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Nevada yield to me?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope we will do that. In a few minutes, it will be our \nintent to begin a series of rollcalls. Apparently, there are a number \nof amendments Senator Gregg and I were willing to accept, but the \nSenator said he would prefer having rollcalls. That means we will be \nhere for a few more hours than we needed to be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the call of the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator will speak for 5 minutes on an \namendment he intends to offer. Senator Feinstein may come to speak for \n5 to 10 minutes on an amendment she wishes to offer on behalf of \nSenator Dodd. Then Senator Dole will speak for 5 to 10 minutes on an \namendment she wishes to offer. Hopefully, we can proceed then to vote \non the pending amendments, including the four of the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn. That is not a formal unanimous consent \nrequest. It is a hoped-for scenario.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2774\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and I call up amendment No. 2774 and I will speak on \nthat for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2774.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by international organizations, \n agencies, and entities that require the registration of, or tax guns \n                owned by citizens of the United States)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                           RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS\n\n       Sec. 699B.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be made available to any international organization, \n     agency, or entity (including the United Nations) that \n     requires the registration of, or taxes a gun owned by a \n     citizen of the United States.\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. In fact, perhaps I should not have waived reading of \nit. It is a few sentences. So I will do it myself:\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be made \n     available to any international organization, agency, or \n     entity (including the United Nations) that requires the \n     registration of, or taxes a gun owned by a citizen of the \n     United States.\n\n  That is the entire amendment, the entire sum and substance of the \namendment. As such, it is a straight funding limitation amendment, \nwhich has been ruled by the Parliamentarian as completely germane. This \nis a version of a full-blown, freestanding bill that I have filed in \nthe past, specifically last Congress. It was S. 1488. I filed that bill \nand had 17 cosponsors.\n  Many folks who haven't followed the proceedings on this in the U.N. \nmay ask: What is this all about? Why is this necessary? Unfortunately, \nit is about an effort in the United Nations to bring gun control to \nvarious countries through that international organization. \nUnfortunately, that has been an ongoing effort which poses a real \nthreat. This goes back to 1995, when this issue of international gun \ncontrol was first put before the U.N. General Assembly. Then, in 2001, \nthe General Assembly adopted a program of action designed to infringe \non second amendment rights. In fact, from July 11 to 15 they met at the \nU.N. in New York City to finalize some agreements on that.\n  It is of significance that Dr. Rebecca Peters is the new head of that \neffort in the U.N. and, in particular, the entity within the U.N. that \nleads that International Action Network on Small Arms. That may not be \na household name but perhaps it should be, particularly to second \namendment advocates, because Dr. Peters is the person who led \nAustralia's massive effort at far-reaching gun control. She has been \nvery vocal on the subject, debating, for instance, Wayne LaPierre of \nthe NRA on numerous occasions. Other pro-gun control advocates would \nhelp facilitate procedures within the U.N. program of action that could \nvery well impact and infringe U.S. citizens' second amendment rights.\n  Therefore, again, that gets back to the Vitter amendment, which \nsimply says we are not going to support any international organization \nthat does that; that requires a registration of U.S. citizens' guns or \ntaxes U.S. citizens' guns. If other folks in this Chamber think that is \nnot happening, that it is never going to happen, my reply is simple and \nstraightforward: Great, then this language has no effect. It is no harm \nto pass it as a failsafe. It has no impact. But, in fact, related \nefforts have been going on in the U.N. since at least 1995. I hope this \ncan get very wide, bipartisan support, and I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this very fundamental, straightforward amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2772\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2772, pending at \nthe desk, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2772.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit funds appropriated under this Act from being \n    expended in violation of section 243(d) of the Immigration and \n                            Nationality Act)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. 699B.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be expended in violation of section 243(d) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)) (relating \n     to discontinuing granting visas to nationals of countries \n     that are denying or delaying accepting aliens removed from \n     the United States).\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, when I visited with sheriffs across North \nCarolina over August, one of their main concerns was the lack of \ndetention space to hold criminal aliens when they are apprehended. It \nis unconscionable that our State and local authorities have to struggle \nwith resources because uncooperative countries fail to take back their \nnationals who have been ordered by the courts to be removed from the \nUnited States.\n  This amendment is simple and is consistent with current law. It \nprohibits funds from being expended in violation of section 243(d) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act. In other words, it prevents the \nState Department from issuing visas to citizens of countries that \nrefuse to accept these court-ordered-removed illegal aliens.\n  During fiscal year 2003, the year for which we have the latest \ninformation, the detention of criminal and non-criminal aliens from the \ntop eight uncooperative countries that blocked or inhibited their \nremoval cost the United States over 981,000 detention days and $83 \nmillion. The status quo is unacceptable--it is costing much needed \ndetention space and resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid aside, with the \nunderstanding that the managers will examine my amendment and we will \nreturn to it at a later time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are willing to have a voice vote on it right now.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2772) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2721\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2774 be set aside and that amendment No. 2721 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for Mr. Dodd, \n     for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Corker, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2721.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase by $10,000,000 the amount appropriated or \n   otherwise made available by this Act for the Peace Corps, and to \n                           provide an offset)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n\n                     ADDITIONAL PEACE CORPS FUNDING\n\n       Sec. 699B.  (a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title III under the heading ``peace corps'' is \n     hereby increased by $10,000,000.\n       (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     title IV under the heading ``foreign military financing \n     program'' is hereby reduced by $10,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment by Senator Dodd and \nmyself increases the funding for the Peace Corps by $10 million for a \ntotal of $333.5 million. This matches the President's request and the \nfunding level in the House bill. The offset comes from unobligated \nforeign military financing funds.\n  The Peace Corps is one of our most effective and successful foreign \naid programs. Since 1961, over 190,000 Americans, including 25,000 from \nmy home\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nState of California, have served as Peace Corps volunteers in 139 \ncountries. Currently, there are 7,749 volunteers serving in 73 \ncountries.\n  I am a big fan of the Peace Corps. They are diplomats, and they \nrestore people's confidence in this country. The Peace Corps also \nprovides critical education. In fact, approximately 20 percent of the \nPeace Corps volunteers today are serving in predominantly Muslim \ncountries. And at a time when United States prestige is at an all-time \nlow, Peace Corps volunteers provide a different face of America--one of \ncompassion, one of care, and one of understanding. This amendment \nmatches the President's request in the budget. It matches the funding \nlevel in the House. It is offset by unobligated balances. I urge that \nthe amendment be adopted today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am certainly in sympathy with the \npurposes of the amendment. The Peace Corps is an extraordinary \norganization filled with very dedicated and special people who give of \ntheir life, willing to go into the countryside in parts of this world \nand help people out, out of their concern for social well-being and the \nbetterment of others. They are very admirable people. So I support the \nnumber. But the offset is an issue.\n  I have discussed this issue with Senator Dodd. I have not had a \nchance to discuss it with Senator Feinstein. Senator Dodd and I reached \nan understanding that we would try to find a better offset in \nconference.\n  With that understanding, I certainly have no objection to this \namendment. I ask that it be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2721.\n  The amendment (No. 2721) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Gregg and I are trying again to get \na finite number of amendments. I appreciate that we have had two \namendments that could have gone to rollcall votes. We accepted them and \nsaved time. We have a number of other amendments that fall into that \nsame category. But I guess as the hour goes on, people want to \ndemonstrate how good they are, and if we want to accept it, they want a \nrollcall vote. I have never been able to figure that out, but that is \ntheir right. Of course, it keeps everybody here beyond the time we \notherwise would have to be here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, while we are waiting to do some \nhousecleaning and get business in order, I rise to thank the staff of \nthe majority and the Republican staff on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee. These folks work very hard. They are totally dedicated to \nmaking sure these funds are effectively used.\n  The majority staff is led by Tim Rieser, who does an excellent job, \nand the Republican staff is led by Paul Grove, who does an equally \nexcellent job. The Republican team of Michele Wymer and LaShawnda Smith \nis a small group, but they are very effective. I know the majority \nstaff has the same sort of lean organization, and they are very \neffective.\n  Our ability to accomplish our business around here is clearly staff \ndriven. We depend immensely on them, their abilities, and their \nexpertise. I thank them all for the great job they do and specifically \nthank them for the job they have been doing on this appropriations \nbill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendments remaining in order to H.R. 2764 be the following, and a \nmanagers' amendment which has been cleared by the managers and the \nleaders; that there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation \nto each amendment equally divided and controlled in the usual form; \nthat no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote; and that \nafter the first vote in the sequence, the vote time be limited to 10 \nminutes each: Coburn amendment No. 2773; Coburn amendment No. 2716; \nCoburn amendment No. 2706; Coburn amendment No. 2704; Cardin amendment \nNo. 2689; Brown amendment No. 2701; Vitter amendment No. 2774; a Levin \nsense of the Senate on Iraq refugees; a Kyl amendment on material \nsupport; a Coleman amendment on UNDP; Obama amendment No. 2692, with a \nmodification; a Kyl-Leahy sense of the Senate on Egypt; a Bingaman \namendment on UNFPA; that upon disposition of all amendments, the bill \nbe read a third time, and without further intervening action or debate, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend my \nprevious consent request to reflect, where I said Kyl material support. \nIt is Kyl-Leahy material support; and where I said Kyl-Leahy sense of \nthe Senate, Egypt, it is Kyl-Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The first one in order will be Coburn No. 2773.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2774\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Vitter \namendment No. 2774 be taken up for a short debate and voted out of \norder at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the debate time be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward, \nand I will read it word for word.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be made \n     available to any international organization, agency, or \n     entity (including the United Nations) that requires the \n     registration of or taxes a gun owned by a citizen of the \n     United States.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this amendment is necessary because of \nefforts within the United Nations that have been ongoing to push gun \ncontrol on the world stage through the U.N. This has been going on \ninitially since 1995 but in all seriousness particularly since 2001. \nMany folks within the United Nations have pushed very hard for their \nso-called program of action. Specifically, Dr. Rebecca Peters has been \nhead of that effort. She became very well known for spearheading the \nmassive gun control effort in Australia.\n  Mr. President, I urge a very strong bipartisan vote on this measure \nso we send a clear message to the U.N. that we will not tolerate this \nsort of movement and we will not send any U.S. taxpayer dollars to any \nentity, including the U.N., that does this.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes \nafter the first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is already part of the order.\n  Does anybody want time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2774.\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before we go to third reading, I wish to \nthank Senator Gregg for his tireless efforts on this bill and the \nMembers of the Appropriations Committee which passed this bill \noriginally 28 to 1. I will say more about Senator Gregg's staff and my \nstaff tomorrow so as not to hold up third reading.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with Senator Leahy and thank him for \nthe fair and open way he has pursued this bill. I thank his staff \nagain, as I did earlier, for their great work, and my staff, obviously, \nalso. It has been a very fair and open process, and I very much \nappreciate his treatment of the Republican membership in this exercise.\n\n\n     Accelerating RFA for Soils, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Senator \nfrom Vermont an issue that has major implications for food security and \nenvironmental protection in developing countries and the United States.\n  Over the last decade, the Soils Management CRSP has performed \nadmirably with the University of Hawaii serving as the management \nentity. It is through my relationship with the University of Hawaii \nthat I have learned that this program has successfully developed \nglobally applicable science-based principles and tested them on a site-\nspecific basis in more than 22 developing countries in Africa, Asia, \nand Latin America. This has enabled users to access decision support \ntools to diagnose problems at specific locations in any country, and \nprescribe alternative solutions to correct them.\n  While the Soils Management CRSP has been successful during its \nplanned 10-year life, I am pleased that the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development will build on the accomplishments of this \nprogram and seek a broader scope\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nfor a succeeding CRSP. The Agency correctly perceives that, while sound \nsoil management is critical to food security, sustainable natural \nresources management, and economic growth and progress in the \ndeveloping world, soil resources must be managed in the context of all \nresources in the ecosystem. I support the establishment and operation \nof the Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP.\n  My concern is that the Agency does not plan to compete the new Soil, \nWater, and Ecosystem Services CRSP until 2009. With a likely 2-year \ninterruption of research activity, the useful elements of expiring \nCRSPs are likely to be compromised and continuity of resource \nmanagement research will not be forthcoming.\n  To circumvent these problems, I ask your support in encouraging the \nAgency to accelerate a request for applications, RFA, for a Soil, \nWater, and Ecosystem Services CRSP through established competitive \nprocesses. Conducting the RFA in fiscal year 2008 will minimize the \nloss in program continuity associated with recently expired CRSPs such \nas the Soils Management CRSP. Acceleration will minimize risks to food \nsecurity and protection of the environment in developing countries and \nin the United States. An earlier competition for the new CRSP will go a \nlong way toward preserving the momentum and expertise of the \ncollaborative network of researchers involved in recently completed \nCRSPs.\n  I believe that the committee recommendation for funds for \nCollaborative Research Support Programs in 2008 is sufficient to \naccommodate a request for applications--RFA--for a Soil, Water, and \nEcosystem Services CRSP in 2008. I also emphasize that my interest is \nin a more comprehensive resource management CRSP solicited through \nestablished competitive processes based solely on merit and abilities \nto deliver science-based recommendations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for bringing this issue to \nmy attention. I agree about the importance of continuity and momentum \nin natural resource management research. I will work to ensure that \nyour concerns are communicated to the Administrator of the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development and that the Agency is encouraged to \nutilize funds appropriated for 2008 to accelerate the RFA process for a \nSoil, Water, and Ecosystems Services CRSP in 2008.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague for his consideration and support of \nthe Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP.\n\n\n                       Passport Services Offices\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee in a brief \ncolloquy regarding the situation at the State Department's Passport \nServices Offices. Like many Members on both sides of the Hill, my \noffice in recent months has been deluged by constituents who have had \ntremendous difficulties getting passports in time for trips they have \nplanned, often many months in advance. I appreciate the fact that the \nsubcommittee has responded to this situation by providing additional \nresources to the Department to address the passport backlog.\n  Freedom and ease of travel to foreign destinations is extremely \nimportant to the competitiveness of American business as well as for \nindividual recreational and family needs. Many American businesses, \nincluding a significant part of the American travel industry, depend on \npassport services companies to obtain necessary travel documents for \ntheir employees and customers in an expedited fashion so they can \ntravel not just when they want to but when they need to. Passport \nservices firms also assist individual citizens when they are not \nlocated near one of the regional passport offices, have physical \ndisabilities, or simply cannot get off work to make a personal visit to \nthe passport office.\n  The number of passport issuances nationally has grown by more than \n130 percent in recent years. At the same time, the demand of U.S. \ncitizens and corporations for the expedited services of passport \nservices companies has never been greater. However, in recent years \nregional Passport Services Offices have limited the number of \n``slots,'' or applications, that individual passport services companies \ncan submit on a daily basis. The reductions at all the regional offices \ncollectively have reduced nationally the number of applications \nindividual companies can submit by over 40 percent. It is now clear \nthat the recent problems with passport delays faced by the traveling \npublic as a whole are related to the problems faced by passport \nservices companies in the last few years: lack of resources and \nimproper allocation of resources by the Department.\n  Instead of creating more work, passport services companies assist \npassport services' adjudicators by using barcode computer technology, \nensuring application forms and supporting documents are filled out \naccurately and completely, and improving efficiency and decreasing \nconfusion at passport acceptance facilities nationwide by thoroughly \npreparing applicants before acceptance agents.\n  Leading travel industry representatives have formally expressed \nstrong support for efforts to allow passport services companies to \nsubmit more applications. The American Society of Travel Agents, Cruise \nLines International Association, the National Business Travel \nAssociation, the Travel Business Roundtable, and the Travel Industry \nAssociation of America have all written the Department of State \nexpressing unqualified support for the industry's request for more \nslots for individual companies.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nis it true that the committee has provided the Department $40 million \nover the President's budget request to enhance passport operations?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is true. I would say to my colleague from Arkansas \nthat this subcommittee is not satisfied with the performance of the \nDepartment in the last few months with respect to the adjudication and \ndistribution of passports in a timely fashion. We recognize that a \ntremendous number of dedicated public servants at all levels of the \nState Department have been putting in long hours trying to get rid of \nthe backlog in passports. We think it is very important, however, \nespecially as the deadline for implementation of the Western Hemisphere \nTravel Initiative gets closer, that the Department be better prepared \nto handle spikes in demand for passports and to disseminate better \ninformation about the procedures and options available for getting \nexpedited passports.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Increasing the number of daily applications individual \npassport service companies can submit is an essential component of \nmeeting the personal and business travel needs of American citizens who \nrequire special assistance. Because these companies submit applications \nto the exact specifications of Passport Services, allowing individual \nfirms to submit more applications daily would enable Passport Services \nto adjudicate a greater number of applications more efficiently.\n  As the chairman may know, Arkansas is now home to a passport \nprocessing facility that is working on all cylinders helping to \neliminate the backlog. The Washington Regional Agency of Passport \nServices already has staff dedicated exclusively to processing \napplications submitted by passport services companies. Does the \nchairman/ranking member of the subcommittee agree that we should \nencourage the consideration of a similar approach in all regional \noffices to facilitate the daily increase in applications for passport \nservices firms and recommend Passport Services expand one of its \nregional offices to provide significantly expanded dedicated services \nto passport service companies?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree that we should encourage the Department to \nconsider providing such dedicated infrastructure, especially if it will \nhelp to alleviate the backlogs that have occurred all over the country.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his attention \nto this issue.\n\n\n               Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I remain deeply \nconcerned about reports of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.\n  The people of the United States and the Philippines enjoy a close \nfriendship that is deeply valued on both sides. Our nations have a \nstrong bond that is supported and celebrated by the 3 million\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nAmericans of Philippine ancestry that live in the United States today. \nCalifornia alone is home to more than 1 million Filipino Americans.\n  Because of the close ties between our two nations and our two \nmilitaries, it is essential that the government of Gloria Arroyo take \nstrong action to end the killings and punish those who have committed \nabuses.\n  Over the past 6 years, hundreds of extrajudicial killings have taken \nplace throughout the Philippines. Those targeted have included \njournalists, religious leaders, political figures, human rights \nactivists, and union leaders.\n  For too long, the Government of the Philippines has not taken \nsufficient action to address extrajudicial killings and bring those \nresponsible to justice.\n  Last year, pressure from international human rights groups, foreign \ngovernments, and political leaders forced the government of President \nArroyo to launch an investigation into the killings that was headed by \nretired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo. The Melo Commission report, \nwhich was made public early this year, found that the killings of \nactivists appear to be part of an ``orchestrated plan'' and that the \nPhilippine National Police has made little progress in investigating or \nprosecuting cases.\n  Philip Alston, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary \nor Arbitrary Executions has stated that the Philippine Armed Forces \nwere in ``a state of almost total denial'' on the need to address ``the \nsignificant number of killings which have been convincingly attributed \nto them'' and that a ``culture of impunity'' exists within the \nPhilippine justice system.\n  In response, the Philippine Government has announced that it is \ntaking steps to address these abuses. President Arroyo has said herself \nthat ``these killings will be resolved and the military will continue \nto be a vanguard for freedom.''\n  Last week in Manila, hundreds of relatives and supporters of those \nwho are missing or killed marched to demand action and justice. One of \nthe marchers carried a picture of her son, an activist who was \nreportedly abducted from a mall last April by seven armed persons who \nidentified themselves as police officers. The car used in the abduction \nwas traced to a vehicle impounded at a Philippine military base. \nDespite an order from the Supreme Court, the military has not released \nthe missing activist.\n  During a hearing I chaired in March on this issue, a bishop from the \nUnited Church of Christ in the Philippines testified that, ``with such \nan appalling death toll of extrajudicial killings in our country at \nthis time of the Arroyo administration, nobody could ever claim that \nshe or he is not afraid and is safe. I admit that I have that fear . . \n. ''\n  I am very pleased that Senator Leahy has included language in the \nSenate State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill that \nfences $2 million of military assistance on the condition that the \nSecretary of State certifies that the Philippine Government is \nimplementing the recommendations of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on \nExtrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, that the Philippine \nmilitary is not engaging in acts of intimidation or violence against \nmembers of legal organizations that advocate for human rights, and that \nthe Government is investigating and prosecuting those who have \ncommitted extrajudicial killings.\n  This binding legislative language is critical. I hope that Secretary \nRice is able to produce a report that states that the Philippine \nGovernment is taking real action and the Philippine military is no \nlonger responsible for the deaths of innocent persons.\n  Senator Leahy, if the Philippine Government fails to meet the three \nconditions contained in this act, will you work with me to place \nadditional limitations on future U.S. military assistance to the \nPhilippines?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I share Senator Boxer's concern about extrajudicial \nviolence in the Philippines and will continue to monitor this situation \ncarefully. I will consider additional limitations on future U.S. \nmilitary assistance if the Philippine Government fails to adequately \naddress this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support amendment No. 2708 that would \nprevent contributions to organizations that perform or promote abortion \nas a method of family planning. I was unable to be in attendance for \nthis vote. However, if I had been present, I would have voted in favor \nof this amendment. Similarly, I support amendment No. 2707 that would \nprohibit funding of organizations that support coercive abortion. If I \nhad been present, I would have voted in favor of this amendment.\n  I oppose amendment No. 2719 that would rescind the ``Mexico City \nPolicy'' in its entirety, and, had I been present, I would have voted \nagainst it.\n  Life is the most important gift each of us is given, and I believe \nthat abortion unfairly takes the innocent life of an unborn child who \ndeserves protection, morally and legally. For this reason, I oppose \nabortion, except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the \nmother is endangered.\n  The ``Mexico City Policy'' denies U.S. population assistance funds to \nprivate organizations that campaign to legalize abortion in foreign \ncountries, or which otherwise promote abortion as a method of family \nplanning. I believe that we must be committed to protecting the life of \nunborn children, and I do not support the expenditure of U.S. taxpayer \ndollars for the purposes of funding abortions, whether inside or \noutside the United States. While I understand the need for family \nplanning services, particularly in developing countries, and support \nefforts to meet these needs, I do not believe that abortion is an \nappropriate form of birth control. For this reason, I oppose the \nallocation of taxpayer money to organizations that promote and provide \nabortion services.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the increasing instability along the \nTexas/Mexico border is of great concern to me. U.S. citizens who live \nin the border communities of my home State are caught in the crossfire \nof drug cartels engaged in illegal trafficking of drugs, weapons, cash, \nand people.\n  Nuevo Laredo, a city across the river from Laredo, TX, has been \ncaught up in a violent turf war between rival drug gangs fighting for \nbillion-dollar smuggling routes into the United States. This issue is \nrelevant because many people are missing as a result of the violence in \nNuevo Laredo, including over 20 U.S. citizens.\n  One tragic example involves Brenda Cisneros and her friend Yvette \nMartinez a 27-year-old mother of two young girls. On September 17, \n2004, the two women were celebrating Brenda's 23rd birthday at a \nconcert across the border in Nuevo Laredo. Neither has been seen since.\n  The ongoing drug wars in Nuevo Laredo are spilling over into Laredo \nand nearby communities in the United States. I fear the threat of \nviolence to our citizens who live and work in border regions will only \ncontinue to escalate. This condition is unacceptable and Mexico must \nact immediately to end this situation.\n  Federal, state, and local law enforcement officials along the border \nroutinely seize guns, ammunition, drugs, and illegal aliens. \nAdditionally, Border Patrol agents face hundreds of assaults each year \nranging from shootings, to rock throwing, to attempts to run them over.\n  In August 2005, I sent a letter to the Attorney General requesting \nthat additional resources be allocated to remedy this situation. The \nAttorney General and the administration quickly took action to protect \nthe people of Texas by sending a Violent Crime Impact Team to address \nthe violence, particularly the problem of missing persons.\n  However, as I noted in a letter to Tony Garza, the U.S. Ambassador to \nMexico, ``the good work of U.S. law enforcement will never be enough \nwithout serious commitment and strong efforts from Mexico.''\n  Since April 2006, I have been working with Ambassador Garza to \nencourage the Mexican government to help U.S. law enforcement and \nincrease Mexico's efforts in locating the numerous missing persons from \nthe Laredo area. I have also met with other top-level Mexican officials \nand urged them to allocate more resources toward finding the missing \npersons, and to coordinate efforts with the United States. It is clear \nthat Mexico must do more to crack down on violence along the border.\n  This legislation provides funds for international narcotics control \nand law enforcement. The purpose of this provision is to assist foreign \ncountries in\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\ncombating narcotics, gangs, terrorism, and crime. The House has already \npassed this bipartisan bill, and we must ensure the programs we are \nfunding are focused in the right direction by including explicit \nlanguage.\n  According to the House Judiciary Committee report, the committee \n``continues to support a strong United States counternarcotics \nassistance program in order to protect United States communities from \nthe ravages of drugs.'' Furthermore, the House Judiciary Committee \nrecommendation includes $27.5 million for programs in Mexico to support \nthe fight against human, drug, and weapon smuggling.\n  The amendment I am offering today ensures that a portion of this \nfunding will be allocated for locating the many missing Americans who \nhave been lost in the battles between drug cartels. It is simply \nunacceptable to allow U.S. citizens to become casualties of the violent \nwar being waged by drug gangs in Mexico.\n  The truth is that, just as the violence and instability on the border \nis a serious problem for both countries, the solution lies both with \nthe United States and Mexico. It will take all of our efforts and \nMexico's efforts combined to win the battle against border violence.\n  Any legislation that appropriates funding for programs to combat drug \nsmuggling in Mexico must also allocate resources to combat the fallout \nof drug trafficking. My amendment simply goes one step further in \nprotecting our communities from the turmoil surrounding the narcotics \nconflict by facilitating the return of missing Americans to their loved \nones.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2764, the Department of State, \nForeign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2008.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $34.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2008, which will result in new outlays of $17.1 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $33.5 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation \nfor budget authority and is $5 million below its allocation for \noutlays.\n  The reported bill includes provisions that make changes in mandatory \nprograms--CHIMPS--that result in an increase in direct spending over \nthe 9-year period, 2009-2017. These provisions are subject to the point \nof order established by section 209 of the 2008 budget resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2764, DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED AGENCIES\n                          APPROPRIATIONS, 2008\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                General\n                                                                purpose\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.........................................     34,243\n    Outlays..................................................     33,511\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority.........................................     34,243\n    Outlays..................................................     33,516\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority.........................................     34,243\n    Outlays..................................................     33,201\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority.........................................     34,943\n    Outlays..................................................     32,748\n \n                    Senate-Reported Bill Compared To\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority.........................................          0\n    Outlays..................................................         -5\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority.........................................          0\n    Outlays..................................................        310\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority.........................................       -700\n    Outlays..................................................        763\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to reiterate my \nlongstanding opposition to any amendments or modifications to the \nMexico City policy, the Kemp-Kasten amendment, or any exceptions on the \nuse of funds as authorized in Public Law 108-25, the United States \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. \nSome provisions related to these items are included in the State and \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill that the Senate is prepared to \npass, and I anticipate that if this language remains part of the final \nmeasure, the bill will draw a veto threat from the administration. \nAlthough I will support this bill in the spirit of moving this process \nforward, I look forward to working with my colleagues and Members of \nthe House to ensure that the final version of the bill can be signed by \nthe President and does not undermine these critical pro-life and pro-\nfamily provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had a question of the manager or the \nranking member. We have been waiting now a long time, and we have just \nheard that things are settled. I am not sure anybody knows what that \nmeans. I don't. I hate to ask other Senators if they do.\n  Might I ask, procedurally, does this mean when we finish this vote \ntonight we are through?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might answer my friend, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, it is my understanding from the leadership \nthat this will be the final vote tonight. I understand the leadership \nhas scheduled something for tomorrow morning, but this will be the \nfinal vote tonight.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would say if the Senator is suggesting we \nadjourn sine die, I could support that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised by the leader there will be \none vote tomorrow at 10:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On a different matter.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and that \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), and the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, let me speak as in morning business \nabout a dear friend who died this last Sunday, and that is Ed \nMcGaffigan. Ed has been a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nnow for over 10 years. He is the longest serving member of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission in the history of our country. Prior to that, he \nwas a staff member in my office working with me on foreign policy \nissues, on defense policy issues, on science and technology issues. The \ncountry has lost a great public servant, and we have all lost a great \nfriend with the passing of Ed McGaffigan.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1983, I was appointed to the Armed \nServices Committee, and I have remained on that committee for \nessentially 20 years. When I first got here, I needed the help, \nobviously, of someone who knew something about foreign policy and \ndefense policy, and I called Professor Joe Nye at the Harvard's Kennedy \nSchool to ask if he could recommend anyone. His immediate response to \nme was: There is a young man working in the White House Science Office \nnamed Ed McGaffigan. I would recommend Ed without any reservation. If \nyou could persuade Ed to work for you in this capacity, you would be \nextremely well served. As it happened, I was able to persuade Ed to do \nthat in 1983.\n  He worked with me on defense issues and foreign policy issues and \nscience and technology issues for 13\\1/2\\ years. Then he moved on and \nwas appointed by President Clinton to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. He was appointed to a term on the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and then reappointed to a second term by President Clinton \nand reappointed once again by President Bush.\n  I will always be grateful to Professor Nye for his immediate and \nsuperb recognition of Ed. Ed had many virtues. He was a man of great \nfaith. He was faithful to his God, of course, his family, his job, and \nhis country. He was known for his love of his family, his wife Peggy, \nand his children, Eddie and Meggy. He saw his job as public service. He \nmade a decision early in his career to pursue public service. He worked \nin the State Department, he worked in the White House science office, \nhe worked in the Senate, and he worked as a member of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. In each position, he demonstrated great ability \nand uncompromising integrity.\n  Ed made it his business to understand whatever the issue was at hand \nbetter than anybody else. He had the intellectual capacity and the \ndetermination to do exactly that. He sought expert advice, but he was \nnot one who would accept any advice at face value. He was trained as a \nphysicist; he was a physicist. He had an extremely keen mind, and he \nwas in the enviable position of being able to be his own expert, having \nhis own expert views on many subjects.\n  The second advantage I would cite for Ed in his public service was \nhis courage. He employed that courage time and again when he stepped up \nto be the teller of truth. One recent column described him as a \n``debunker of hype.'' There was another story that was written about Ed \nthis week, where he was referred to as a ``feisty advocate for nuclear \ntechnology.'' I can see how someone might interpret his statements and \nactions that way, but, in fact, Ed saw himself not as an advocate for a \nparticular technology--nuclear or any other--but instead as a person \nwho was unafraid to tell the truth even when that went against the \npopular view, even when it meant dispelling widely shared myths.\n  Ed had the intellectual ability and the courage to accomplish a \ntremendous amount. There was no question or surprise when he chose to \nuse that intellectual ability and courage to face the illness that did \nfinally claim his life. He did all of the reading that was doable on \nthe subject of that illness. He asked hard questions. He took in the \nanswers, and he managed his life for the last 8 years in the best way \npossible.\n  As sometimes happens with cancer--which is what ultimately \nprevailed--there are days of remission and there are also days of \nillness. Recently, he enjoyed a reprieve from the pain and discomfort \nthat was caused by the disease and the treatment. Bob Simon and Sam \nFowler of the Energy Committee and myself were fortunate to have lunch \nwith Ed in the Senate diningroom in June. It was a typical meeting with \nEd. He was focused on the future, on how to accomplish the important \nwork of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He was a devoted public \nservant to the end of his days. He achieved an enormous amount. Much of \nhis ability to achieve in these final months and throughout his career, \nof course, was due to the superb work of his staff at the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. They deserve great credit, as well, for helping \nhim in these final months. Ed must have been one of the few hospice \npatients in the country who continued to work 4 days a week. As far as \nI know, he is the only hospice patient to testify before the Senate in \nJuly.\n  Ed made the most of the reprieve he was granted, but this last week \nhis illness came forward and he died on Sunday. He was buried in \nArlington, VA, today. The Senate is a poorer place for his passing, and \nthe country has lost a great public servant. We have all lost a very \ngood friend.\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11206-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11206-S11207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ED McGAFFIGAN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Iraq, as I have \nevery day this week that we have been here. First, I know we all have \nthe deepest gratitude and respect for the sacrifice of the brave men \nand women serving our country so valiantly in Iraq. Make no mistake \nabout it, the troops are doing their job. I am concerned, however, that \ntheir mission is not worthy of their great sacrifice, especially the \nPresident's surge.\n  The surge, despite earlier reports this week, has failed to meet the \nobjectives set out by the President. And the President can't change \nthat fact by changing the goal. He is now claiming progress in Iraq as \nevidence that the surge--directed at Baghdad--is working. While the \nPresident has claimed progress in Anbar, it was not the surge that \nbrought the momentary calm to this region, because the surge was \nfocused mainly on Baghdad, and the difficult process of political \nreconciliation. Its objective, as stated by the President himself, was \nto create breathing room for the central Iraqi Government to make \npolitical progress.\n  Our brave troops have been in Anbar for years and years, doing the \nfirst-rate job they always do in what is a very difficult environment. \nNow, however, some elements of the local population, and some of their \nleaders, have made common cause with the brave men and women of our \nmilitary. They have cooperated with our troops out of distaste for the \nbrutal methods of al-Qaida. While this is a welcome and helpful \ndevelopment, it is neither the foundation upon which a successful long-\nterm strategy can be launched, nor is it a result of the surge, which \nwas targeted mainly at Baghdad and the national Iraqi political \nprocess.\n  We have heard about successes in the past. They are temporary. They \nare not based on any permanent structural change or any permanent \nchange in the views of the Iraqi citizens. The Shiites, the Sunnis, and \nthe Kurds still despise each other. They dislike each other more than \nthey like any central government. We have heard about success in the \npast in Baghdad, and we have heard about success in Fallujah, and they \nvanish like the wind because the fundamentals on the ground haven't \nchanged.\n  Now, at a time when the American people are crying out for a change \nin course, some are pointing to a temporary situation in one province--\nAnbar--as a way to continue the present misguided policy. It makes no \nsense. It makes no sense because the fundamentals in Iraq stay the \nsame. There is no central government that has any viability, and the \nwarlords in Anbar Province have no relationship with the central \ngovernment whatsoever. The Shiites, the Kurds, and the Sunnis, as I \nhave stated, dislike each other far more than they like or want any \ncentral government, and these two facts doom the administration's \npolicy to failure.\n  We should not have our brave soldiers fighting a civil war caught \nbetween rival political and religious factions.

Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation that would make higher education more accessible and more \naffordable, provided that the legislation does not worsen the deficit \nover the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that the conference report for H.R. 2669, the College Cost \nReduction and Access Act, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-\nneutral reserve fund for higher education. Therefore, pursuant to \nsection 306, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget \nresolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Carney\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I speak \ntoday in honor of a fallen soldier. American hero MSG Scott M. Carney \nwas killed in military operations on August 24, 2007. My deepest \nsympathy and prayers go out to Scott's wife Jeni and twin sons Jacob \nand Justin. I also express sincere sympathy and gratitude to his \nparents Geneva and John Carney and his brothers and sister.\n  An Ankeny, IA, resident, Scott was killed during a humvee rollover \nnear Herat, Afghanistan. Scott was a member of the Iowa National \nGuard's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Division out of Boone, IA. Scott \nenlisted in the U.S. Army in 1989 and had been a member of the 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team since 2004.\n  Scott will be fondly remembered and missed dearly. His wife described \nScott by saying he ``died doing what he loved, serving his country and \nprotecting the freedom that we enjoy and providing the people of \nAfghanistan with the opportunity for freedom.'' I know I speak on \nbehalf of all Iowans when I express gratitude for Scott's 18 years of \nmilitary service. While I speak today with great sorrow, I also speak \nwith great pride; pride in having soldiers like Scott, willing to make \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  A fellow soldier lent an apt description of Scott when he said ``the \nArmy was his life. He loved his family dearly and was a great family \nmember. He was also part of the team.'' I ask all Americans to spend a \nmoment today in prayerful gratitude for the family of a true American \npatriot, fallen hero MSG Scott M. Carney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11208-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On the night of August 9, 2007, three friends with developmental \ndisabilities were verbally assaulted by four teens as they left a \nCheektowaga, NY, restaurant. Two of the friends, a 22-year-old local \nman and his 19-year-old girlfriend, got into their vehicle and began to \ndrive away. The teens continued to taunt the couple with derogatory \nnames for the developmentally disabled. The four youths drove after the \ncouple in two cars, reportedly swerving repeatedly at the victims' car \nand nearly hitting it. The disabled couple's car crashed as they tried \nto turn onto the Cheektowaga Thruway, causing significant damage to \ntheir vehicle. According to witnesses, the crash happened after the \nvictim sped up to get away from the attackers' vehicles. The teens sped \naway, but thanks to witnesses and restaurant surveillance tapes, the \npolice were able to apprehend the teens. Three of them were charged \nwith perpetrating a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11208-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ILLICIT GLOBAL SMALL ARMS TRADE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, illegally traded small arms and light \nweapons are cheap and readily available in many areas of the world. \nThese weapons contribute to instability and violence in developing \nregions, creating fertile breeding grounds for rogue actors, \nundisciplined militias, and even terrorists. Confronting the threat of \nglobal terrorism requires a multifaceted approach which should include \nefforts to curb the illegal small arms trade while promoting programs \nthat destroy surplus and obsolete weapons so they are taken out of \ncirculation world-wide.\n  The M-16 and the AK-47, both automatic rifles, and shoulder launched \nsurface-to-air missiles, called Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or \nMANPADS, are the most commonly traded weapons in the estimated $1 \nbillion a year illegal arms trade. I am not talking about legal and \nvetted government to government transfers; I am talking about the \nillicit arms trade that results in these weapons ending up, frequently, \nin the most lawless regions of the world and in places where they could \nbe used to attack U.S. troops.\n  I have just returned from a trip to Africa, where I saw firsthand the \ndevastating toll these weapons have had in eastern Democratic Republic \nof Congo, DRC, as well as in northern Uganda. The eastern part of DRC, \ndespite that country's successful election last summer, is rife with \ninstability and small arms are the weapons of choice. I saw how they \nare used to destabilize communities and how they wreak havoc on \ninnocent civilians. I visited a center for ex-combatants in Bunia, in \nthe Ituri region of North Kivu, and saw the newly disarmed soldiers \nbeginning the process of ``re-entering'' life without a weapon. The \nU.N. agency running this program had already removed the child soldiers \nbut many of the former soldiers I saw looked exceedingly young. They \ncouldn't have been much older than 18 or 20 and yet there they were \nreceiving a second chance at life--a chance to live free of violence.\n  In Iraq, the illicit small arms trade supplies insurgent groups that \ncontinue to hamper U.S.-led efforts to stabilize and rebuild the \ncountry. In Afghanistan, illegally obtained small arms are used by \nwarlords to attack U.S. troops and maintain areas of refuge for \nterrorists. Much of the recent violence that has plunged Somalia into \nchaos has been carried out by extremists with automatic rifles. In \nColombia, narcoterrorist paramilitary operations, including kidnappings \nand the murder of hostages, are fueled by a steady flow of small arms \nthat are smuggled into the country. The influx of small arms into \nDarfur, much of which is in violation of a U.N. arms embargo, has \nhelped perpetuate the conflict between the Sudanese government, \nassociated Janjaweed militias, and the numerous rebel factions. Many \nother countries in sub-Saharan Africa--including Angola, and Liberia--\nhave been profoundly impacted as they became victims to decades of \nbrutal war perpetuated by these illegal arms flows.\n  I am pleased that the President requested, the House passed, and the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has provided, over $44 million for the \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons Destruction Program in Fiscal Year 2008. \nThis is a significant increase for a much-needed and very successful \ninitiative. Indeed, since 2001, this program has helped 25 countries \ndestroy over 1 million weapons that might have otherwise have been used \nto create unrest and chaos.\n  The fight against global terrorism remains the highest national \nsecurity priority of the United States. The illegal global trade and \nensuing use of small arms and light weapons clearly destabilizes \nregions that extremists and terrorists can then use as safe havens in \nwhich to operate. The United States must do all it can to curtail the \nillegal small arms trade world-wide while it works to simultaneously \neliminate the conditions that breed extremism and instability. The \nSmall Arms and Light Weapons Destruction Program is a critical \ncomponent in that fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11208-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11208-S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SUN YET WONG\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, NRO, is honoring two individuals, Dr. Paul G. Kaminski and Mr. \nSun Yet Wong, who have made significant contributions to the discipline \nof national reconnaissance. They will be inducted as members of Pioneer \nHall. This prestigious award bestowed to 71 people is the NRO's highest \nhonor.\n  Of these two individuals, I am honored to know Mr. Wong and I wish to \ncongratulate him on being selected by the NRO for the 2007 Class of \nPioneers. The work of technological revolutionaries, such as Mr. Sun \nYet Wong, has made significant and lasting contributions to the \ndiscipline of national reconnaissance, and has set the stage for future \nadvancements in the field. His efforts have helped advance technology \nby contributing to the effectiveness of\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\nNRO satellite systems. Today, the NRO continues to build on his \nrevolutionizing successes.\n  Mr. Wong's career in national reconnaissance began in 1955 and \ncontinues to the present day. Although he is being honored with this \naward because of his outstanding work and contributions to the \neffectiveness of NRO satellite systems, Mr. Wong has been a major \ncontributor to a number of technological advancements. Among his \nachievements, Mr. Wong was the key designer of support equipment for \nground-test deployment of satellite solar panels whose application \novercame a structural on-orbit deployment anomaly. He also introduced \nthe use of a synthetic lubricant to stabilize and extend the life of \ncontrol movement gyroscopes used on NRO satellites. He currently works \nas a consultant for TriSept Corporation and Boeing Space Systems.\n  Mr. Wong is a true pioneer who continues to revolutionize technology. \nAgain, I commend him for all that he has done and wish him the very \nbest in future endeavors. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEW MEXICO MAINSTREET ACCREDITATIONS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize several cities \nin New Mexico that have recently received national accreditation for \ncompleting the Main Street Four-Point Approach. The National Trust Main \nStreet Center recently named nine cities' Main Street projects as being \nnationally accredited. Those nine communities include Artesia, Clayton, \nClovis, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, Raton, and Silver \nCity.\n  The work that has been done in these communities to preserve the \nhistory of downtown, as well as bring it into the 21st century, is to \nbe honored. Main streets are a big part of every community's history. \nThey provide a look into the past, and with these revitalizations, a \npositive look into the future. Downtown used to be the hub of a city. \nWith the invention of the automobile, cities have spread out and often \nno longer have just one central area of activity. With these new \nimprovements to local main streets, towns are beginning to experience \nbusinesses returning to these areas. These towns have been able to \nmarry the past with the present. They are honoring old businesses that \nhave been in downtown areas for years, while encouraging new businesses \nto open their doors in this district. The success of their efforts is \nevident by this award.\n  I congratulate these cities on the good work they are doing to bring \nthe main street appeal back into their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               30TH ANNUAL ENCHANTED CIRCLE CENTURY TOUR\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

What better way to see the breathtaking Sangre de \nCristo Mountains than on a bicycle? This tour has given many residents \nand visitors of New Mexico the opportunity to experience our State in a \nnew way. It is not for the faint of heart though. It takes incredible \nstrength to overcome the elevation, elements, and endurance challenge \nthis tour presents. The September 8 start will be a major milestone for \nthis community, and it is my hope that this tradition continues for at \nleast another 30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MARY McALENEY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I commend a Mainer who has \ngone above and beyond the call of duty in public service to our State \nand the Nation. On June 30 of this year, Mary McAleney retired from her \nposition as district director of the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's Maine district Office after serving in that capacity \nfor 9 dedicated years. Her retirement from this post is a loss to all \nof Maine's 151,000 small businesses. Mary has always worked with the \nbest interests of Maine's small businesses in mind, and her efforts on \nbehalf of our State's small firms has been widely praised. In March of \nthis year, the Maine Small Business Development Centers named Mary \ntheir Small Business Champion for her tireless efforts to serve \nMainers. Her commitment to, and enthusiasm for, small enterprises has \nimpressed all who have had the privilege of working with her.\n  I will never forget when, in the spring of 2006 following devastating \nflooding in York County, Mary helped to organize a tour for me of the \ndamage. On very short notice, she made arrangements to visit numerous \nbusinesses affected by the flooding, rallying business leaders to stay \noptimistic and begin the recovery process. Over the years, Mary proved \ntime and again that she could be relied upon in times of crisis to \nassist small businesses in need, and as a Mainer herself, she knew \nexactly how to be helpful, knew the right person to call, and found a \nway to get results.\n  Mary's public service began with her work as a staffer in the Maine \nLegislature. Leaving Augusta, Mary came to Washington to work for \nformer Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, where she served as \nchief of staff. Prior to her appointment to the Maine SBA, Mary served \nas district director for the Massachusetts SBA from 1995 to 1998. \nWithout any doubt, it is clear from the first time Mary meets anyone \nthat Mary McAleney's passion is Maine! She grew up in eastern Maine, in \nthe town of Vanceboro, where she undoubtedly learned the value of \nsustaining a rural economy, and realized the challenges many Mainers \nfrom rural areas of the State face in order to support a family. \nThroughout the years, Mary has demonstrated this zeal by her remarkable \nability to work with people from all sides of the spectrum, because she \nis among them in spirit and determination.\n  The State of Maine owes a debt of gratitude to Mary McAleney for the \noutstanding work she has done fighting for Maine's small businesses. \nWhile she will be sorely missed at the SBA, I know Mary will continue \nher distinguished service to Maine in innovative and beneficial ways. I \nwish my good friend continued success and offer my sincere appreciation \nfor her devotion to Maine's small business community.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for affording me the opportunity to speak \nabout this truly exceptional Mainer and American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-5", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11209-6", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11209-S11210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 954.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Klobuchar, \n        Mrs. Dole, Mr. Vitter, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2021. A bill to provide $50,000,000,000 in new transportation \ninfrastructure funding through bonding to empower States and local \ngovernments to complete significant infrastructure projects across all \nmodes of transportation, including roads, bridges, rail and transit \nsystems, ports, and inland waterways, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, despite the record transportation funding \nthat Congress provided in the 2005 Transportation Reauthorization bill, \nSAFETEA-LU, our Nation's infrastructure is being stressed to the \nbreaking point. Our ports and rail lines are at or near capacity. Our \nhighways are clogged. The tragedy in Minneapolis last month showed the \nentire country that our bridges are in desperate need of repair.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has noted that over the next \n5 years $1.6 trillion in investment is needed from all levels of \ngovernment to keep our Nation's current transportation system up to \ndate. To put that into perspective, our Nation's infrastructure needs \nroughly six times as much funding as was included in SAFETEA-LU.\n  The question is ``Where do we find the transportation funding that \nour country needs to meet our transportation and our economic needs?''\n  Senator Thune's and my answer is to invest in America.\n  Everyone agrees that our country's infrastructure needs are \ntremendous. Everyone agrees that our country needs to invest more in \ntransportation. What Congress hasn't been able to agree on is where to \nfind the money. Gas taxes just don't generate enough revenues to even \nbegin to satisfy highway and transit needs.\n  In this budget climate, pots of extra Federal money are not just \nsitting around waiting to be used, and States surely don't have any \nextra money either. Most have budget deficits. All the conventional \nfunding sources are coming up short, so Senator Thune and I think it is \ntime to think outside the box and outside the trust funds. The Federal \nGovernment is about the only entity in the country that does not borrow \nmoney for capital projects, but in this climate it should and it must.\n  Senator Thune and I have come up with a creative approach to provide \n$50 billion of additional new funding for transportation projects our \ncountry desperately needs by issuing Build America Bonds. Our country's \nneeds are so great that we think funding should be made available that \nis in addition to SAFETEA-LU.\n  Our legislation is not a substitute for fixing the transportation \ntrust fund. We still must address that problem, and next year we must \nstart on a new transportation bill. Our legislation is meant to provide \nextra money on top of regular transportation funding.\n  This money could not be earmarked by Congress. This will not fund any \nSenator's pet project. This money will be controlled by the States, and \nused for the projects they think are most critical.\n  An annual amount of approximately $500 million from trade fees will \nbe placed in an Infrastructure Finance Account and invested for the \nlife of the bonds, which will generate more than enough to repay the \nentire $50 billion principal amount.\n  That means the only cost to the Government is the ``interest \nportion'' on the bonds, which is in the form of tax credits. With this \nfunding mechanism, as little as $2 billion a year could generate the \n$50 billion in funding for transportation infrastructure. I call that a \nvery smart investment in our country's infrastructure.\n  This investment is badly needed.\n  Citizens stuck in traffic choking on exhaust need relief. Truckers \nwho need to detour miles out of their way to avoid weight-limited \nbridges need relief. As our economy struggles with stagnating wages, \nthe loss of even basic health benefits for many, and a mortgage market \nthat is spiraling downward, the American worker needs relief.\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that each $1 billion \nof funding for transportation directly produces nearly 50,000 jobs. So \nunder the Wyden/Thune proposal the $50 billion of new transportation \nfunding will provide critical economic stimulus that will create up to \n2.5 million family wage jobs.\n  This is an economic stimulus idea that will generate more funding for \nthe economy now. It will create jobs. It is a chance for the Federal \nGovernment to hold up its end of the bargain with our States.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today, Senator Wyden and I are introducing \nan important piece of legislation that seeks to address the significant \ntransportation infrastructure needs that exist across the country. The \nBuild America Bonds Act would provide $50 billion in infrastructure \ninvestment for all states across the country.\n  This legislation is a slightly modified version of bills that Senator \nWyden and others advocated in previous Congresses. While the Federal \nGovernment has allocated record funding levels to States under the \nTransportation reauthorization bill that Congress passed in 2005, the \nneed for infrastructure improvements far exceeds available Federal and \nState funding sources.\n  For instance, the American Society of Civil Engineers has noted that \nover the next 5 years, $1.6 trillion in investment is needed from all \nlevels of government to keep our Nation's current transportation system \nup to date. To put this into perspective, this funding level is roughly \nsix times larger than what is currently being spent.\n  Our legislation, the Build America Bonds Act, is not intended to \nreplace the current user-fee structure the highway trust fund relies on \ntoday--it would be a supplemental funding stream that would allow \nStates to address the backlog of important highway, bridge, rail, and \nwaterway projects that exist in every State across the country.\n  The funding under our legislation would not be earmarked by \nCongress--it would be distributed directly to States. Further, this \nmuch needed funding would create over 2 million jobs, spur significant \neconomic growth, save lives by making much needed improvements to \ntransportation problems that exist from coast to coast and keep our \neconomy moving.\n  Our legislation is cosponsored by Senators Coleman, Klobuchar, Dole, \nVitter, and Collins. In addition, the Build America Bonds Act enjoys \nthe broad support of a diverse group of business, labor and \ntransportation groups, including: Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica, AGC, American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, AASHTO; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; National Association of \nManufacturers, NAM; National Construction Alliance--a coalition of the \nLaborers, Carpenters, and Operating Engineers Unions; American Highway \nUsers Alliance; and many others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2024. A bill to provide for interregional primary elections and \ncaucuses for the selection of delegates to political party Presidential \nnominating conventions; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am proposing today and will \nfile legislation to create a comprehensive and nationwide process for \nvoters to select nominees every 4 years for President of the United \nStates. This legislation will establish six Presidential primary \ndates--the first one in March of a Presidential election year, two in \nApril, two in May, and one in June.\n  Each of these contests would feature at least one State from six \ndifferent regions, six geographic regions around the country. The order \nof States within each region would rotate every 4 years--every \nPresidential election. That order would be determined at the beginning \nby lot in order to determine the sequence. And then the next \nPresidential election, the ones who had gone first in March would then \ngo to the end of the line and they would be in June, and the list would \nmove up.\n  It would give voters in the larger States a strong voice in selecting \nthe nominees over that 4-month period while also giving the citizens in \nthe smaller States a fair say, instead of the present system we have \nnow where the small States are the ones that have an inordinate \ninfluence in selecting the nominees of the two great parties.\n  So in this legislation, by featuring States from each of the six \nregions, there will be racial, ethnic, economic, and regional diversity \non each of the primary dates. And, of course, it has a much more \nrational proposal for an agenda, in that you start in March and it \nconcludes in June of the Presidential election year, instead of this \nchaotic situation we have now with States trying to get ahead of each \nother, with them starting now as early as the early part of January and \nwith it being frontloaded so that, in effect, we may find the \nPresidential nominee decided by the middle of February.\n  I am introducing this legislation with my colleague Senator Levin of \nMichigan. It is our experience as Senators from Florida and Michigan \nthat we have seen firsthand how unfair and undemocratic our \nPresidential primary system has become. I might say this legislation \ntracks Senator Levin's brother's legislation filed in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Sandy Levin. Our bill is going to try to \napproach a rational way of selecting the nominees for President of the \nUnited States instead of this chaotic system we have now.\n  Now, neither bill is going to fix the current controversy we have \nover the sequence of the contest in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and \nSouth Carolina. For that, a short-term fix is certainly needed. What we \nhave now is this chaotic situation where all the small States are \ntrying to get ahead of each other. This certainty is needed to resolve \nthe fix created by several States moving their 2008 primaries ahead of \nsome of the other States. In my State, the Republican legislature of \nFlorida--signed into law by a Republican Governor--moved the Florida \nprimary from March to January 29. In Senator Levin's State, a \nDemocratic legislature--signed into law by a Democratic Governor--moved \nits primary to January 15. What we may find is that other States may \nfollow suit with a big jump.\n  I have proposed to the Democratic National Committee that it allow, \nfor this particular Presidential cycle, the traditional first-in-the-\nNation States to move ahead of my State on January 29; and, instead, \nthe party leaders have decided that Florida's votes are not going to \ncount in the 2008 Presidential primary. The DNC said Florida's earlier \nprimary, which was signed into law by our Governor, would alter the \nsequence of Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. So last \nmonth, the party officials decided to strip Florida of its 210 \ndelegates to the national convention. That means that this country's \nfourth largest State will have no say in picking the Democratic \nPresidential nominee. Well, that is simply unacceptable.\n  Florida still has several weeks to find a solution for the DNC that \nit will accept; or, as I have suggested, legal action may be necessary. \nIt is a case of fundamental rights versus the rules of a political \nparty. And as to our right to vote, and to have that vote count, there \ncan be no debate. I want to say that again. As to our right to vote, \nand to have that vote count, there can be no debate.\n  Senator Levin and I will work hard to ensure that the controversy \nover the respective positions of Florida and Michigan in the primary \nschedule are resolved; and, for the long term, our legislation would \nbring order to the next and all future Presidential primary seasons. It \nwould ensure that no one State has a disproportionate influence on the \nselection of the nominees. By introducing this bill today, we want to \nbegin a broader discussion about achieving lasting reform.\n  With the experience we have had in Florida, in the disputed \nPresidential election in 2000, and again 6 years later, with there \nhaving been an ``undervote'' of 18,000 votes in a congressional \nelection in one county in Florida, Sarasota County, the sensitivity in \nFlorida of having the right to vote and to have that ballot count, and \nto have that ballot count as intended, is paramount, and it is highly \nsensitive in the State of Florida. For a political party to punish a \nState for stepping out of line is the height of insensitivity in \nunderstanding that those votes are critical and that people know their \nsacred right of the ballot is protected. We\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nintend to see that the right to have their votes counted, and counted \nas they intend, is preserved.\n  In the meantime, we have to bring rationality to this process. The \nregional primary system set up in this legislation Senator Levin and I \nare introducing today is a suggested approach so that by the year 2012 \nwe will have order in selecting our Presidential nominees instead of \nthe chaos we find ourselves in now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the State of Louisiana to match Federal \nfunding to fully address the Road Home Program shortfall; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nan important issue that will determine the success of long-term \nrecovery efforts in the gulf coast. As you know gulf coast was \ndevastated in 2005 by two of the most powerful storms to ever hit the \nU.S. in recorded history Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We also \nexperienced the unprecedented disaster of having a major metropolitan \ncity, the city of New Orleans, under up to 20 feet of water for 2 weeks \nwhen there were 28 separate levee failures which flooded 12,000 acres, \nor 80 percent of New Orleans following Katrina.\n  I strongly believe that the Congress can provide vast amounts of tax \ncredits, grants, loans, and waivers but all these benefits will not \nspur recovery if we cannot get people back into their homes. That is \nwhere recovery must start and end. In Louisiana alone, for example, we \nhad over 20,000 businesses destroyed. However, businesses cannot open \ntheir doors if their workers have nowhere to live. Louisiana also had \n875 schools destroyed. Again, teachers cannot come back to school and \nteach our children if they do not have a roof over their heads. So a \nfundamental piece of recovery in the gulf coast is to allow disaster \nvictims to return home and rebuild.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce legislation which is extremely \nimportant to the recovery in the State of Louisiana. This is because, \nover the past few months, we have learned that the Road Home is facing \na shortfall of billions of dollars due to various reasons. There is \ncertainly more than enough blame to go around for the mistakes in the \ncreation and management of the Road Home program, and fixing them will \nbe a shared responsibility. But a significant initial flaw can be found \nin the inadequate and unfairly distributed funding which represented \nall the administration was willing to commit towards Louisiana \nrecovery. At this stage, the funding shortfall threatens to stall \nrecovery in Louisiana and leave homeowners without the vital funds they \nneed to rebuild their homes. To address this important issue, the bill \nwe introduce today includes an authorization of funds so that if the \nState of Louisiana puts up $1 billion towards the Road Home shortfall, \nadditional funds necessary to shore up the program would be available. \nI strongly believe this bill will serve as a hand up, not a hand out. \nThe State of Louisiana shares a financial obligation to address the \nshortfall and this bill would hold it accountable, but with the State \nmeeting their obligation the Federal Government also would step in to \nhelp.\n  In closing, let me reiterate that this bill addresses one of the most \nfundamental needs following a disaster: the need to return home. \nWhether residents live in million dollar mansions, rental housing, or \npublic housing they all share a desire to return to their communities \nand, in particular, their homes. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation as now these disaster victims are counting on the \nCongress for action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Louisiana Road Home Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ROAD HOME PROGRAM SHORTFALL.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary for the State of Louisiana to carry out the Road \n     Home Program, provided that as of June 1, 2007, the State of \n     Louisiana has provided at least $1,000,000,000 for such \n     Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2029. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for transparency in the relationship between physicians and \nmanufacturers of\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\ndrugs, devices, or medical supplies for which payment is made under \nMedicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a month ago I outlined an important \nissue affecting all Americans who take prescription drugs or use \nmedical devices--the need for greater transparency in the money that \ndrug and device companies hand out to doctors. Today, I am pleased to \nintroduce the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, along with Senator Kohl, \nchairman of the Special Committee on Aging. This legislation will bring \nmuch needed transparency to the financial relationships that exist \nbetween the drug and device industries and doctors.\n  There is no question that the drug and device industries have an \nintricate network of financial ties with practicing physicians. These \nfinancial relationships can take many forms. They can include speaking \nhonoraria, consulting fees, free travel to exotic locations for \nconferences, or funding for research. Drug and device companies spend \nbillions and billions of dollars every year marketing their products. A \ngood amount of this money goes directly to doctors in the form of these \npayments.\n  This practice, and the lack of transparency around it, can obscure \nthe most important question that exists between doctor and patient: \nWhat is best for the patient?\n  As the editorial board of the Des Moines Register wrote recently, and \nI quote, ``Your doctor's hands may be in the till of a drug company. So \nhow can you know whether the prescription he or she writes is in your \nbest interest, or the best interest of a drug company?'' That is an \nexcellent question. Currently, the public has no way of knowing whether \ntheir doctor has taken payments from the drug and device industries, \nand I intend to change that--not just for Iowans but for all Americans.\n  Payments to a doctor can be big or small. They can be a simple dinner \nafter work or they can add up to tens of thousands and even hundreds of \nthousands of dollars each year. That is right--hundreds of thousands of \ndollars for one doctor. It is really pretty shocking.\n  Companies wouldn't be paying this money unless it had a direct effect \non the prescriptions doctors write, and the medical devices they use. \nPatients, of course, are in the dark about whether their doctor is \nreceiving this money.\n  The Physician Payments Sunshine Act sheds light on these hidden \npayments and obscured interests through the best disinfectant of all: \nsunshine. This is a short bill, and a simple one. This bill requires \ndrug and device manufacturers to disclose to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, on a quarterly basis, anything of value given to \ndoctors, such as payments, gifts, honoraria, or travel. Along with the \nmoney, these companies will have to report the name of the physician, \nthe value and the date of the payment or gift, its purpose, and what, \nif anything, was received in exchange. This bill then requires the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to make the information \navailable to the public through a searchable web site.\n  And this bill has some teeth, too. If a company fails to report, the \nPhysician Payments Sunshine Act imposes a penalty ranging from $10,000 \nto $100,000 for each violation.\n  Many States are ahead of the curve on this and have passed, or are \ncurrently considering, similar measures. In 1993, Minnesota required \nthe Nation's first public disclosure of gifts and payments from \nwholesale drug distributors. Vermont passed a similar law in 2003, \nalthough much of the information is not publicly available. More \nrecently, the District of Columbia, Maine, and West Virginia have \nfollowed suit in requiring disclosure, though not all make the \ninformation available to the public through a web site. The General \nAssembly in my home State of Iowa may soon be requiring disclosure as \nwell.\n  But this kind of information shouldn't be available only to Americans \nwho happen to be lucky enough to live in a State already addressing \nthis problem. On the contrary, this information should be accessible to \nall Americans across the country and it should be updated in a timely \nmanner. I propose to my colleagues that now is the time to act.\n  I realize that some critics, including many of the drug and device \ncompanies, are going to say that creating this sort of national \ndatabase is too time consuming and too expensive. I can hear the \ncomplaints already. But let me remind you again--the drug companies are \nalready reporting their payments to doctors in Minnesota and other \nStates. Companies already have this information available. We aren't \nrequiring them to go out and obtain it--we are just asking them to \nshare it with the American people.\n  Perhaps even more telling is that at least one industry leader has \ntaken the goal of increased transparency into its own hands. Although \nit is not making its payments to doctors publicly available, Eli Lilly \nhas taken important steps to meet the public's demand for increased \nsunshine. In response to my investigation of drug company payments for \ncontinuing medical education, Eli v Lilly voluntarily created a web \nsite that details payments they make to organizations like patient \ngroups and hospitals. I commend Eli Lilly for taking the lead on that \nissue, and I look forward to working with them on my latest effort.\n  This bill is careful not to burden small businesses--it applies only \nto companies with annual revenues over $100 million. It is the largest \ncompanies who are driving this practice, and for whom disclosure would \nbe least burdensome.\n  Further, during a meeting on a separate matter with officials from \nGlaxo Smith Kline in early August, my staff brought up the idea of drug \ncompanies reporting payments to physicians. I am happy to say that Dr. \nMoncef Slaoui, the chairman of research and evelopment for Glaxo Smith \nKline, said that he was also interested in a little sunshine. In fact, \nhere are his exact words: ``We're happy for transparency.'' I would \nlike to commend Dr. Slaoui for his comments and I look forward to \nworking with him and leaders at other companies on this bill.\n  It is not only industry leaders who are leading the way on the issue \nof increased transparency--some of America's best medical schools are \ntaking steps to prevent conflicts of interest among their physicians. \nIn fact, the Yale University School of Medicine, the University of \nPennsylvania, and the Stanford University Medical School have gone so \nfar as to prohibit certain gifts and payments altogether.\n  So let me be clear. This bill does not regulate the business of the \ndrug and device industries. I say, let the people in the industry do \ntheir business. After all, they have the training and the skill to get \nthat job done. Just keep the American people apprised of the business \nyou are doing and how you are doing it. Let a little bit of sunshine in \nto this world of financial relationships--it is, after all, the best \ndisinfectant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11218-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11218-S11219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 309--COMMENDING THE APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY \n   MOUNTAINEERS OF BOONE, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR PULLING OFF ONE OF THE \n              GREATEST UPSETS IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL HISTORY\n\n  Mrs. DOLE (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The severe loss of credibility of the United Nations \n     Human Rights Commission, whose members have included Libya, \n     Sudan, and Cuba, led United Nations Secretary-General Kofi \n     Annan to remark in 2005 that the Human Rights Commission was \n     ``casting a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations \n     system as a whole'' and to call for the creation of a new \n     United Nations human rights institution.\n       (2) Calls for the reform of United Nations human rights \n     institutions led to a proposal for a new Human Rights Council \n     to replace the Human Rights Commission, which was adopted by \n     the United Nations General Assembly on March 15, 2006, in \n     General Assembly Resolution 60/251 (2006).\n       (3) The United States voted against General Assembly \n     Resolution 60/251 (2006) because the proposed structure of \n     the Human Rights Council did not contain provisions designed \n     to address the fundamental flaws of its predecessor body, \n     such as a requirement that members of the Council be \n     democracies that respect human rights.\n       (4) The United States chose not to run in the elections for \n     membership in the Human Rights Council in 2006 and 2007 for \n     fear that the Council would reflect the same patterns as the \n     Human Rights Commission.\n       (5) The stated purpose of the Human Rights Council is to \n     objectively and non-selectively promote and protect human \n     rights in the entire world, and therefore in all 192 Member \n     States of the United Nations.\n       (6) The Human Rights Council is composed of 47 members, 24 \n     of which are considered ``free democracies'' by Freedom House \n     in its 2007 ``Freedom in the World'' report.\n       (7) The current members of the Human Rights Council include \n     countries such as Cuba, Angola, Azerbaijan, and Saudi Arabia.\n       (8) During the first year of operation of the Human Rights \n     Council, which included 5 regular sessions and 4 special \n     sessions, the only country in the world that was directly \n     condemned as a violator of human rights was Israel.\n       (9) In its first year of operation, the Human Rights \n     Council passed only 12 state-specific resolutions: 9 \n     resolutions that condemned the Government of Israel, and 3 \n     resolutions on Sudan that did not condemn the Government of \n     Sudan.\n       (10) Freedom House lists 19 countries in its 2007 ``Freedom \n     in the World'' report as the ``Worst of the Worst'' regimes \n     that violate human rights, yet none of these countries has \n     been the subject of a resolution by the Human Rights Council \n     except for Sudan.\n       (11) During its first year, the Human Rights Council held 4 \n     special sessions to address the most egregious and urgent \n     human rights issues, with 3 sessions dedicated to Israel and \n     1 session dedicated to Sudan.\n       (12) The Human Rights Council special session on Sudan held \n     in December 2006 resulted in the appointment of an assessment \n     mission to Darfur led by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jody \n     Williams, and this assessment mission submitted a report \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Williams Report'') to \n     the Human Rights Council in March 2007 that concluded that \n     the Government of Sudan was responsible for ``large-scale \n     international crimes in Darfur''.\n       (13) The Human Rights Council has not condemned the \n     Government of Sudan in spite of the Williams Report and the \n     numerous reports documenting the human rights violations of \n     the Government of Sudan compiled by the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights.\n       (14) On June 19, 2007, the Human Rights Council adopted \n     governing rules that further discredit the Council's \n     operations, including--\n       (A) the establishment of only 1 country-specific permanent \n     agenda item for the ``Program of Work'' on ``human rights \n     violations and implications of the Israeli occupation of \n     Palestine and other occupied Arab territories'';\n       (B) the elimination of the mandates of the special \n     investigators for human rights for Cuba and Belarus, despite \n     extensive reporting by these investigators indicating that \n     there are widespread, systematic violations of human rights \n     taking place in both countries; and\n       (C) the adoption of measures that limit the independence of \n     operations of the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights and hinder the ability of \n     independent human rights investigators to report findings on \n     human rights abuses.\n       (b)(1) No funds appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     any Act for fiscal years\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\n     2008 or 2009 for contributions to international organizations \n     may be made available to support the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council.\n       (2) The prohibition under paragraph (1) shall not apply for \n     a fiscal year if, during that fiscal year--\n       (A) the President determines and certifies to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives \n     that the provision of funds to support the United Nations \n     Human Rights Council is in the national interest of the \n     United States;

STUDY OF WORLD BANK'S EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE SUCCESS \n                   OF THE PROJECTS IT FINANCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is often difficult to determine how financial \n     assistance from the World Bank benefits the recipient \n     countries because the World Bank has vague objectives and \n     places too much emphasis on the amount of financial \n     assistance it gives, rather than on the results of such \n     assistance.\n       (2) In fiscal year 2006, 20 percent of the funds \n     appropriated under the heading ``International Development \n     Association'' could not be disbursed until the Secretary of \n     the Treasury certified to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that World Bank procurement guidelines would be \n     applied to all procurement financed in whole or in part by a \n     loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development (IBRD) or a credit agreement or grant from the \n     International Development Association (IDA).\n       (3) While it is important to develop domestic procurement \n     procedures, the potential for graft and corruption in many \n     other countries is too great to allow the World Bank to \n     deviate from its own process for managing the procurement of \n     goods and services.\n       (4) A high percentage of senior level World Bank employees \n     enjoy excessive compensation and other benefits, including \n     home leave that reimburses such employees, their families, \n     and their nannies for the expenses associated with travel to \n     their countries of nationality.\n       (5) Congress is also concerned about the thousands of World \n     Bank consultants whose annual incomes are similar to or even \n     greater than the incomes of senior level World Bank \n     employees.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the World Bank should increase its focus on performance \n     requirements and measurable results.\n       (c) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study on the actions taken by the World Bank \n     to--\n       (1) measure the success of the projects financed by IDA;\n       (2) employ accurate means to measure the effectiveness of \n     projects financed by IDA\n       (3) combat corruption in governments that receive IDA \n     funding;\n       (4) establish clear objectives for IDA projects and \n     tangible means of assessing the success of such projects; and\n       (5) use World Bank processes and procedures for procurement \n     of goods and services on projects receiving financial \n     assistance from the World Bank.\n       (d) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report \n     to Congress that includes--\n       (1) the results of the study conducted under subsection \n     (c);\n       (2) the number of World Bank employees and consultants; and\n       (3) the monetary compensation and other benefits that the \n     World Bank provides to the individuals identified under \n     paragraph (2).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2783.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the conference \nreport that we will be voting on tomorrow morning. I will also have \nmore comments tomorrow morning. I wished to give a little bit of an \nexplanation of where we are. There is a limited time of debate in the \nmorning prior to the vote. I am sure Senator Kennedy and I will give a \nlittle fuller explanation of the vote and the reconciliation package, \neven following that discussion, so anyone who is interested can have as \nmuch knowledge about what is in the conference report as they could \nget, except by reading it. So most of the comments will be tomorrow \nmorning, but I wanted to make a few preliminary comments tonight since \nthe time is limited before the vote in the morning.\n  As I mentioned, I do rise to speak in support of the conference \nreport.\n  Two years ago, Republicans took the lead in reducing subsidies to \nlenders and providing greater benefits to students through more grant \nassistance and reduced loan costs. In this conference report, we \nproduce an additional $22 billion in savings by further reducing \nsubsidies to lenders and applying those savings to increased grants for \nlow-income students, for expanded loan forgiveness, and for reduced \ninterest rates on undergraduate subsidized loans.\n  We all agreed that if there is an excess subsidy in the student loans \nprograms, it should be eliminated. The key questions are how much \nexcess there is and how to eliminate it. There are not any clear-cut \nanswers to those questions. One approach included in this conference \nreport is the reduction of the special allowance payments, the SAP, to \nlenders.\n  I am pleased we retained provisions that recognize the unique role \nthat our not-for-profit lenders have in providing information and \nservices to students and their families. Not-for-profit lenders focus \non communities and serve students locally. For this reason, we \nmaintained the 15 basis points differential cut in special allowance \npayments between for-profit and not-for-profit lenders. The cut in the \nSAP to for-profit lenders is 55 basis points and for not-for-profit \nlenders is 40 basis points.\n  We took a first step in this conference report toward refining the \nway these levels are determined, by including an auction pilot that \nlets the marketplace determine the appropriate SAP level for the Parent \nPLUS Program, which is a small part that allows us to have a little \npreview of how an auction process would work, and also help to work out \nany bugs if it works out to be a good demonstration project.\n  This conference report provides additional need-based grant aid which \nis a critical component of increasing access to and affordability of \ncollege. Over 55 percent of the savings are dedicated to increasing the \nPell grant award. In the next 5 years, low-income undergraduate \nstudents will see the maximum Pell grant award increase by more than \n$1,000. Additionally, we increase the income protection allowance so \nstudents are not penalized for working and for saving for college. It \nhas been a problem in the past. If you work and save for college, you \nwould have been better off to have bought a car because it would count \nagainst you. We raise the income threshold for automatic eligibility \nfor a maximum Pell grant.\n  I am also pleased we were able to retain the guarantee rate on \nstudent loans at 97 percent for all lenders through fiscal year 2012. \nIn this way, we avoid disruption in the student loan market and ensure \nthat students have access to Federal student loans.\n  However, I wonder if we are going too far in cutting the support for \nthe largest Federal financial aid program, the Federal Family Education \nLoan Program--that is the private loan program, the FFELP program. The \nchallenge we face is we will not know until it is too late if the cuts \nwe have made have undermined the stability of the program and created \nhardship for the students it serves.\n  Despite the emphasis on increased grant aid, the claim of increased \nsavings for borrowers has a hollow ring. Reducing student loan interest \nrates is a good sound bite. It does nothing to help students pay \ntuition bills. Further, in reality, cutting the interest rate in half, \nto 3.4 percent, will help only a small group of borrowers for the loans \nthey take out for 1 year of their education, 4 years from now. Then the \nbenefit disappears.\n  A quick calculation of the real benefit borrowers will receive shows \nthat for a cost of $6 billion to taxpayers, individual borrowers will \nsee savings of only $6 a month. I would much rather see the $6 billion \ngo to help low-income students through a Pell grant increase than to a \nhollow sound bite, and that is the approach the Senate took, to \nincrease the Pell grant rather than the reduction in the distant future \nof a small percentage in the interest rate.\n  Finally, as an accountant and a member of the Budget Committee, I \nwould be remiss if I didn't point out that we are debating a conference \nreport on reconciliation which is a process designed to reduce the \nFederal deficit, not to create new mandatory programs and increase \nentitlement spending. I am disappointed to say the net savings for \ndeficit reduction in this conference report is only $750 million. I \nwould admit that is the requirement we were given by the budget to \nproduce--$750 million. The last time we did a budget reconciliation we \nput half the money that was saved by canceling some of the subsidies to \nthe corporations to budget deficit reduction.\n  I do wish to remind my colleagues that a few weeks ago we considered \nreconciliation and higher education reauthorization together. This is a \nkey point. The Senate did it consecutively.\n  On a Thursday, we did the reconciliation bill. The next voting day we \nhad was a Monday, and on Monday we passed the higher education \nreauthorization.\n  This is a bill that is long overdue. We have done short extensions \neight times, and we recognize that we passed them together in the \nSenate with strong bipartisan support. In fact, the reauthorization \nbill vote was 95 to 0. So we not only achieved savings, but we ensured \nthe quality and effectiveness of our Federal Student Aid Programs. \nTherefore, support for this conference report is limited by the fact \nthat we are not also considering the larger higher education \nreauthorization package, although I am expecting that we will get some \nvery solid agreement from the House folks to begin consideration of \nthat, I hope yet this month, so it can be completed early and we can \nhave both parts of the package.\n  Tomorrow I will go into a little bit more on what is in that other \npackage that completes what we are doing in reconciliation. In the \nreconciliation we are eliminating some of the subsidies, and then we \nare reallocating that money. That money will go to help students. But \nthe bulk of the help actually comes in the reauthorization package. It \nis ever so essential that we do that.\n  I think the Senate would have been agreeable to put the two bills \ntogether and get them both finished at the same time, but it is not \npossible because the House has not finished action on the Higher Ed \nreauthorization.\n  Tomorrow I will go into some more detail on what it is that is \nmissing from the package by just doing the reconciliation part of the \npackage. I will be encouraging people to vote for the reconciliation \npackage and then the reauthorization package when we are able to get \nthat together.\n  I will be encouraging the House, in every way possible, to make sure \nthey get that reauthorization part of the package done, and I have some \nrelative assurance that they are going to do it soon. I would like some \nmore solid assurance they are going to do it soon.\n  With that, I will conclude my remarks for tonight and look forward to \nthe bipartisan discussion we will have tomorrow. I want to thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for the great work he and his staff did on \nthis package. It is not often in this body that people listen and then \ntry and find the solution. I would say they and my staff have worked \ntogether well and got us here. You never get a perfect package around \nhere. This is one that will help a lot of people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/06/senate-section/article/S11237-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11237-S11238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:55 A.M.
