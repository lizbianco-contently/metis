Mr. President, right outside this Chamber stands a \nstatue of Ben Franklin. According to the Office of the Senate Curator, \nsculptor Hiram Powers received a contract from President James Buchanan \nhimself to sculpt Franklin back in 1859. The statue arrived in the \nCapitol in 1862 and has been in that spot ever since.\n  Franklin wrote many famous aphorisms that live on to this day, and I \nwanted to talk about one of my favorites.\n  Two hundred eighteen years ago today, Franklin wrote to a friend \nwords that will long outlive most\n\n[[Page S14238]]\n\nthings we say. This is what Franklin had to say:\n\n       Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\n\n  Proving the aphorism, Franklin died less than a year later.\n  While we know the certainty of death and taxes, we can do something \nto ease the burden for the 23 million Americans who will be in for a \nrather unpleasant surprise on April 15 if Congress doesn't act now to \nstop the middle-class tax hike, which goes by the rather innocuous name \nof AMT--a law that was originally intended in 1969 to impose taxes on a \nhandful of high-income individuals who used loopholes in the code to \navoid paying any regular income tax.\n  Congress has known about the need to fix this problem all year long, \nbut the majority hasn't brought a bill to the floor. Now they say it \nwill be December before a bill is brought to the floor.\n  Now, the consequences of mismanaging this stealth tax are very real. \nThis tax will grab $65 billion out of the pockets of middle-class \ntaxpayers, an average of $2,000 per family. Millions will be hit for \nthe very first time.\n  The IRS sent a letter warning the majority that unless they act \nbefore December, the tax returns of 50 million people and $75 billion \nin tax refunds will be delayed.\n  Last week, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a bill \nthat purports to delay the burden of the AMT for 1 year by socking a \nmassive $80 billion tax increase to the American people. That is the \nlast thing they need right now, and it would be a disastrous jolt to \nthe economy.\n  Maybe a massive tax hike wrapped in an AMT fix sounds like a very \ngood idea to some people, but I have a message to anyone who thinks \nthat: Such a proposal is dead on arrival in the Senate.\n  The AMT was never meant to be collected from the millions of \nAmericans whom it will hit this year if we don't act. I say this \nCongress ought to cut taxes by cutting taxes--cut taxes by cutting \ntaxes--not by raising taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14238-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

That is the reason the \nClinton economic machine worked as well as it did. When we had a new \nprogram, we paid for it. When taxes were decreased, we paid for that.\n  We are going to go ahead and do the AMT fix, but we are going to do \nit by paying for it. We cannot continually run this country in the red. \nI repeat what I have said on a number of other occasions. When \nPresident Bush took office 7 years ago, we had a $7 trillion surplus \nover 10 years. He has driven us into near bankruptcy as a result of his \nfiscal irresponsibility.\n  We are responsible. We are going to fix AMT before the end of the \nyear, but we will do it the right way; we are going to pay for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14238-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

DOW, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                 FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert M. Dow, Jr., to \nbe United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:10 a.m. shall be equally divided between the leaders and their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Reid and Senator \nLeahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for bringing Robert \nDow up for a vote this morning in the Senate. I enthusiastically \nsupport his nomination. If confirmed, he will fill a Federal District \nCourt vacancy in Chicago that has been pending for over a year.\n  Robert Dow is an outstanding lawyer and an outstanding person. We \nhave a process in Illinois that has worked almost flawlessly for the \nlast 11 years, where we have bipartisan cooperation in screening \njudicial candidates. We have had the cooperation of the White House and \nleaders on both sides of the aisle, and we have not run into a problem. \nRobert Dow is the latest example.\n  Mr. Dow was recommended for this position by former Speaker of the \nHouse Dennis Hastert, the Republican leader in our delegation, with the \nunderstanding he faced a veto from myself or Senator Obama if we \nobjected. Having met the man, having reviewed his background, there is \nno objection. He is an extraordinarily gifted and talented person.\n  He is a partner at one of Chicago's largest and most prestigious law \nfirms--Mayer Brown--and he has been named as one of the 21 leading \nlawyers in the United States in the field of telecom, broadcast, and \nsatellite.\n  There are many things you can say about Robert Dow, but I think there \nis one that stands out, as I reflect on what he had to say to us. \nRobert Dow has received an accolade that is noteworthy. In 2004, he \nreceived the annual Pro Bono Service Award from his law firm, which has \nover 1,500 attorneys, for his personal commitment to unpaid legal work \nto help those less fortunate.\n  That means a lot to me. It says he understands that being an attorney \nis not just a job, it is a profession, and a profession carries with it \nsocial responsibilities. His willingness to help the disadvantaged went \na long way in convincing me he will bring to the court the kind of \ntemperament and values which are so important.\n  The nomination of Robert Dow is a tribute to the successful \nbipartisan approach and the fact both parties look forward to his \ntenure on the Federal bench and the contributions he will make. Speaker \nHastert, Senator Obama, and I stand today excited about the prospect \nthat Mr. Dow will soon fulfill this vacancy, which has been there for \ntoo long.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Mr. Dow to be a district \ncourt judge in the Northern District of Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate continues, as we have all year, \nto make progress filling judicial vacancies when we have the \ncooperation of the White House. The nomination before us today for a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench is Robert Michael Dow, Jr., \nfor the Northern District of Illinois. He has the support of both home-\nState Senators. I thank Senators Durbin and Obama for their work in \nconnection with this nomination.\n  After we consider the confirmation of this nominee today, the Senate \nwill have confirmed 35 nominations for lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench this session alone. That matches the total number of \njudges confirmed for 2004. It exceeds the total number of judicial \nnominations that a Republican-led Senate confirmed in all of 1999, 2005 \nor 2006 with a Republican majority; all of 1989; all of 2001; all of \n1983, when a Republican-led Senate was considering President Reagan's \nnominees; all of 1993, when a Democratic-led Senate was considering \nPresident Clinton's nominees; and, of course, the entire 1996 session \nduring which a Republican-led Senate did not confirm a single one of \nPresident Clinton's circuit nominees.\n  Already this year, we have confirmed five circuit judges to the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S14239]]\n\nbench, including the nominations of Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod and \nJudge Leslie Southwick who became the fourth and fifth circuit court \nnominees we confirmed so far this year. That matches the total number \nof circuit court judges confirmed in all of 1989 and all of 2004, when \na Republican-led Senate was considering this President's nominees. It \nmatches the number of President Clinton's circuit court nominations \nconfirmed by this time in 1999 with a Republican-led Senate and is five \nmore than the Republican-led Senate confirmed in the entire 1996 \nsession. That was the session in which not a single circuit court \nnominee was confirmed. It is more than were confirmed in the entire \n1983 and 1993 sessions.\n  When this nomination is confirmed today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 135 total Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary \nChairman. During the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more \ndistrict judges--more total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 \nmonths that I served as Judiciary chairman than during the 2-year \ntenures of either of the two Republican chairmen working with \nRepublican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 47 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmations. \nAt the end of the 109th Congress, the total vacancies when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate were 51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court \nvacancies. Despite the additional 5 vacancies that arose before the \nstart of the 110th Congress, the current vacancy totals under my \nchairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are below where they were under \na Republican led-Judiciary Committee.\n  The President has sent us only 21 nominations for these remaining \nvacancies. Twenty-six of these vacancies--more than half--have no \nnominee. Of the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be \njudicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for \nnine, more than half of them. Of the 14 circuit court vacancies, six--\nnearly half--are without a nominee. If the President would decide to \nwork with the Senators from Michigan, Rhode Island, Maryland, \nCalifornia, New Jersey, and Virginia, we could be in position to make \neven more progress.\n  Of the 26 vacancies without any nominee, the President has violated \nthe timeline he set for himself at least 18 times--18 have been vacant \nwithout so much as a nominee for more than 180 days. The number of \nviolations may in fact be much higher since the President said he would \nnominate within 180 days of receiving notice that there would be a \nvacancy or intended retirement rather than from the vacancy itself. We \nconservatively estimate that he also violated his own rule 7 times in \nconnection with the nominations he has made. That would mean that with \nrespect to the 47 vacancies, the President is out of compliance with \nhis own rule more than half of the time.\n  Today we consider the nomination of Robert Michael Dow, Jr. He is a \npartner at the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, LLP, where he has \nworked almost his entire career. He received his B.A. from Yale \nUniversity where he graduated summa cum laude and his J.D. from Harvard \nLaw School where he graduated cum laude. A Rhodes Scholar, Mr. Dow \nearned a master and doctorate degrees from Oxford University. Mr. Dow \nalso served as a law clerk to Judge Joel M. Flaum on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Robert M. Dow, Jr. to the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Illinois.\n  I am very pleased that this nomination has continued the bipartisan \napproach to filling judgeships in the Federal district courts--an \napproach that has served Illinois well.\n  Mr. Dow has an impressive record of professional achievement and an \nadmirable commitment to public service. He has demonstrated fairness, \ndecency, integrity, and a strong personal character that I expect will \nbenefit the people of Illinois and all those with cases before the \nNorthern District.\n  Most recently, Mr. Dow was a partner at the Chicago law firm of Mayer \nBrown. He earned his B.A. from Yale University where he graduated Phi \nBeta Kappa in 1987, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he \ngraduated cum laude in 1993. Mr. Dow was also a Rhodes Scholar who \nreceived degrees in international relations from Oxford University.\n  Mr. Dow has also distinguished himself in his professional career, \nwhere he has received a number of honors and accolades. Mr. Dow has \nbeen named a ``leading lawyer'' 5 years in a row by Chambers USA Guide \nto America's Leading Business Lawyers. He has been listed the past 2 \nyears as an Illinois Super Lawyer in appellate law, and by the Best \nLawyers in America in communications law. Mr. Dow also received an \naward for excellence in undergraduate teaching when he served as a \nteaching fellow at Harvard University.\n  Importantly, Mr. Dow has also been an engaged member of the Chicago \ncommunity. In 2003, he served as a fellow for Leadership Greater \nChicago, which stresses the development of community awareness and \npartnerships among leaders in the city. He is also an active member in \na number of legal and academic associations as well as in his church.\n  Finally, Mr. Dow has a track record of personal commitment to pro \nbono service. Early in his career, he provided aid and advice to \nnonprofit organizations and a local court. Over the years, Mr. Dow has \nvolunteered hundreds of hours to pro bono service, and continues to do \nso. He recently earned his firm's annual pro bono award. This kind of \npublic service is essential to our legal system. When legal \nprofessionals provide voluntary expert legal counsel to those who \ncannot afford it, it shores up the integrity of our Nation's justice \nsystem.\n  It is good news for Illinois that Robert Dow will be joining the \ndistrict court. I thank him in advance for his service and congratulate \nhim on his confirmation today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Robert M. Dow, Jr., to be a U.S. district court judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that is \nimportant for our country. That is the appropriations bill for Veterans \nand Military Construction.\n  The Senate and House Appropriations Committees worked together in a \nbipartisan way to craft a bill that fully funds the Veterans' \nAdministration and Military Construction for the quality of life of our \ntroops. However, we became bogged down last week because the Senate and \nHouse leadership decided they would put forward a combination of bills \nthat have no relationship to each other. The Labor-Health and Human \nServices bill and the Veterans' Administration-Military Construction \nbill. Under normal circumstances, that might be fine. We have had \nomnibus appropriations bills before. But there was one problem. That \nis, the President had already said he would sign the Veterans bill, but \nhe would veto the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. So the \ncombination of these bills was destined to assure a veto.\n  The Veterans and the Military Construction legislation should go \nforward on an expedited basis. I call on this Congress to do that. \nThere is no reason--there is no substantive reason, no commonsense \nreason--we should delay a bill that has been agreed to by Republicans \nand Democrats and could easily pass the House and Senate and be sent to \nthe President before the end of this week.\n  Yesterday we had celebrations all over the country for veterans, \nsaying how much we appreciate their sacrifices and what they have given \nto our country. Today we come back to work, and we still don't have a \nVeterans' Administration funding appropriations passed for this year. \nIt is not that the veterans' needs are not going to be funded, because \nwe are in a continuing resolution that assures the basic things will be \ndone. But what isn't going to be done is the new priorities we put in \nthis legislation on a bipartisan basis. We have added more funding for \nresearch into protheses, artificial arms and legs, because those are \nthe kinds of injuries our troops are coming home with. They are \nbecoming veterans because, of course, they can no longer serve in \nActive Duty.\n  I will digress for one moment and say that when I visit Walter Reed \nor the Center for the Intrepid in San Antonio where young men and women \nwho have come home injured from Iraq and Afghanistan are being \nrehabilitated, they complain because they are being put out of Active-\nDuty military. That is the kind of spirit these young men and women \nhave. They will be maimed. They will have lost arms or legs; they will \nbe burned. Yet they will say: Senator, I want to go back. I want to be \nwith my comrades.\n  Of course, we are going to take care of those young men and women who \nhave sacrificed so much through our Veterans' Administration. We have \nnew priorities in these bills that will put more into research and \nrehabilitation for these brave men and women. We also have a new burn \nunit initiative to do more research on our burn victims. Many of our \ntroops come back with mental health problems. We are establishing more \nresearch and centers of excellence for post-traumatic stress syndrome \nin the bill that has been agreed to.\n  All I am asking this morning is, why not pass this bill right now? We \nhave a formality of calling a new conference committee on the separate \nbill. That could be done today. We have agreement. There is no reason \nnot to fund these new priorities. I call on the Senate and House \nleadership to make it happen. There is no excuse. We have new \npriorities. We have bipartisan agreement.\n  My message to the leadership is: Let's trust our committee members. \nLet's trust the leadership on the committees. Democrats and Republicans \ncame together. We increased the President's budget. We increased his \nrequest. He said: OK, because he knew how important it was that we \nfully fund the health care needs of our veterans.\n  Let me tell you another priority in this bill. We have heard story \nafter story of people leaving the Active Duty, usually because of \ninjuries, going into the veterans system. But what happens? There is a \nlong delay, sometimes months, before the veterans' benefits kick in. \nThese are injured warriors. In our bill, we have funding so those \napplications can be processed more quickly. We are trying to streamline \nleaving the Active-Duty military and going into the veterans system. \nThat is in the bill that is languishing this week in Congress.\n  I call on our leadership to do the right thing. Let's put politics \naside. We can take up the Labor-Health and Human Services bill in due \ncourse. But today we have a bill with bipartisan agreement that \nrequires a mere formality of calling the conference committee, having \nthe House pass it, the Senate pass it, and sending it to the President. \nWe can celebrate a joint bipartisan victory with Congress and the \nPresident coming together. That is what the American people expect. \nThat is what they are looking for in Washington. When we see the \napproval ratings of Congress and the President so low, why don't we try \na new approach? Why don't we do something everyone can celebrate? That \nis, fund our veterans and military quality-of-life issues this week. It \ncan be done. I call on the congressional leadership to do it. The \nPresident has said he will sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I associate myself with the \ncomments made by the Senator from Texas. She is right. I serve on the \nAppropriations Committee with her and have worked on veterans issues \nwith her. I very much am joining her in this effort to try to get this \nveterans bill passed because it is extremely important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14240-4", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14240-S14241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FINDING SOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, now, this year, the Senate has voted on \nIraq over 20 times. We have voted on Iraq in the middle of the night. \nWe have voted on Iraq on a Saturday. We have voted on cloture, points \nof order, motions to waive, and other permutations of the majority's \ndesire to appease moveon.org and other radical constituencies regarding \nthe war in Iraq.\n  Although Iraq is important, we have ignored other important business. \nJust last week, we just sent our first appropriations bills to the \nPresident, 38 days into the new fiscal year. We just voted on the \nAttorney General nominee, 45 days after it was sent to the Senate. We \nhave yet to address next year's veterans health care funding needs, 2 \ndays after Veterans Day.\n  The uncomfortable fact for those who would have us consider nothing \nnot urged by the radical left is we stayed the course in Iraq, followed \nthe plan for the surge as developed by the Pentagon, and we are now \nseeing the results there--but none here. Every day the situation \nimproves some in Iraq. Every day there are more new stories showing \nthat the country is moving somewhat out of its depths.\n  Allow me to read some of the news reports.\n\n[[Page S14241]]\n\n  USA Today, November 13:\n\n       The number of roadside bombs found in Iraq declined \n     dramatically in August and September.\n\n  Here is the New York Times, November 8:\n\n       American forces have routed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the \n     Iraqi militant network, from every neighborhood of Baghdad, a \n     top American general said today, allowing American troops \n     involved in the ``surge'' to depart as planned.\n\n  Here is a quote from the Washington Post of November 8:\n\n       The drop in violence caused by the U.S. troop increase In \n     Iraq has prompted refugees to begin returning to their homes, \n     American and Iraqi officials said Wednesday.\n\n  This is from the Associated Press, November 8:\n\n       Dramatic progress seen in Baghdad neighborhood.\n\n  And back to USA Today, from November 7:\n\n       With security improving In Iraq, commanders are now \n     considering how to reduce the U.S. presence without losing \n     hard-fought security gains.\n\n  So we are seeing progress in our task in Iraq. But the business we \nset aside here in the Senate on other important issues is left alone.\n  Every day our gas prices rise because we have not made meaningful \nefforts to improve our Nation's energy independence. Every day we grow \ncloser to the looming entitlement spending crisis. Every day we draw \ncloser to the expiration of the tax cuts that did so much to buoy our \neconomy in the face of 9/11 and the Internet bubble crash of earlier \nthis decade and even now help us ride through the oil and housing \nshocks to our economy. Every day we see greater lawlessness on our \nborders and confront a greater illegal immigration problem because we \nhave not passed significant border security funding.\n  The Senate is sometimes referred to as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. But that compliment is not supposed to summarize the \nsole responsibility of this institution. We are not just here to \ndeliberate and ruminate and ponder; we are also supposed to act. \nMeaningless vote after vote on ultimately pointless proposals is good \npolitics, perhaps, but not good government. It is not suitable for the \nSenate to spend weeks and weeks ignoring the people's business so that \nwe can score political points and mouth the key shibboleths on the war \non terror or by appeasing special interest groups.\n  SCHIP expired on September 30. It is imperative that Congress \nreauthorize the current program to ensure children of lower income \nfamilies still receive health coverage. Yet we make due with a short-\nterm reauthorization so that political points can be scored at the \nexpense of sound policy and practical government.\n  The farm bill expired on September 30, and we are here trying to \nsqueeze in the work required to reauthorize it in the weeks before \nThanksgiving, when we still have all but two appropriations bills to \npass.\n  It is obviously too late to fix things this session. I know we will \nbe here to the point where we are shopping for holiday presents at the \nSenate Gift Shop rather than back home. But I hope the American people \nare taking notice of what little we have accomplished this year and \ndemand better next year. We must stop mining the Nation's problems for \npartisan sound bites and try to find solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate and, indeed, \nour fellow citizens around America today about a very important matter \nbefore the Senate, the Law of the Sea Treaty. We have been studying \nthis treaty in great detail in the Foreign Relations Committee, and it \nis a matter that could eventually come before the entire Senate.\n  I started this process, looked at the treaty, began to read it with a \ncompletely open mind. But as I got into the details of it--the \nsignificant details that would govern our laws, our activity--if we \nwere to become a full participant in the treaty, many concerns began to \nmount in my mind. So I wish to come before the full Senate and before \nthe American people to outline some of those concerns in great detail.\n  To begin with, let me say there are many good, productive, positive \nprovisions of the Law of the Sea Treaty. I strongly support the same \nprovisions the U.S. Navy supports and that personnel and admirals from \nthe Navy have testified in favor of. That is really not the issue. The \nissue is the treaty as a whole and all of the provisions taken together \nand whether we should pass the treaty as a whole because we have no \nchoice but to consider the whole, not simply one provision or the \nother.\n\n  This treaty has been around for many years--in fact, decades. It was \nnegotiated decades ago. President Reagan, during his administration--\nvery correctly, I think--rejected the treaty as it stood then. Because \nof that bold rejection, negotiators went back to the bargaining table \nand changed some significant aspects of the treaty. Now, those were \nimprovements, but they don't in any way affect the main concerns I have \nabout the Law of the Sea Treaty, and that is the fundamental baseline \nthreat that the United States would be ceding our autonomy, our control \nover our own future to other international organizations that often \ndon't have our best interests in mind.\n  So that is my fundamental concern. The renegotiation doesn't change \nthat in any way. The testimony of the Navy doesn't even touch on that \nbecause it is about other provisions of the treaty. But my main concern \nwith the Law of the Sea Treaty is the United States cedes autonomy to \nbinding international tribunals--gives up American prerogatives, U.S. \npower, to binding international tribunals which, in the current \ninternational context, I do not think would often have our best \ninterests in mind.\n  So why do I say that? Well, it is very important to look at the \nspecific provisions of the treaty. We have been debating and discussing \nthis in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have had numerous so-called \nexpert witnesses. I am constantly shocked about how many participants \nin this discussion, quite frankly, including many expert witnesses, \nclearly haven't read all of the significant and important provisions of \nthe treaty.\n  One of the most important provisions of the treaty has to do with \nthese arbitral tribunals, these courts, if you will, that would have \nbinding authority over all treaty participants, including the United \nStates if the United States were to become a full treaty participant. \nSo in other words, when disputes arise under the treaty, how do you \nresolve the dispute? You go to court. That court, if you will, that \nspecial tribunal, has binding authority over the parties to the \ndispute.\n  There are different sorts of these tribunals. One sort is called a \nspecial arbitral tribunal. Under that, under Annex VIII, the United \nStates, again, cedes binding authority to these special tribunals in \ndisputes about fisheries, the marine environment, marine scientific \nresearch, and navigation.\n  What is wrong with that? Well, I think what is wrong with it--or at \nleast the threat it poses to the United States becomes clear when you \nlook at the nature of this tribunal. It is a five-person body and \nsimple majority rules. Now, who appoints the people? Well, both parties \nto a dispute pick two panelists. So if we were brought into court, if \nyou will, by another country, that other country opposing our views, \nopposing our interests, would pick two panelists, and we would pick two \npanelists. What about the fifth panelist?\n\n[[Page S14242]]\n\nThat is obviously important because it could well be the tie-breaking \nvote.\n  Under the treaty, the parties are supposed to try to agree on that \nfifth panelist. But if the parties can't agree--and, of course, that is \na distinct possibility--the party taking us into court, the other \ncountry, could then flatout refuse to agree with any of our suggestions \nand choices no matter how reasonable.\n  Then what happens? Well, then the U.N. Secretary General picks the \nfifth panelist. He picks the tie-breaking vote.\n  I will be very honest with my colleagues; I don't feel comfortable \nwith that. In the current international context, when we have been \nopposed so often at the U.N., when countries gang up on us, quite \nfrankly, so often in forums such as the U.N., I don't feel comfortable \nwith the Secretary General of the U.N. picking the tie breaker and \nessentially determining our fate.\n  There are other types of tribunals under the Law of the Sea Treaty. \nThe next type is simply called a general arbitral tribunal. It is under \nAnnex VII of the treaty. Again, the fundamental issue and the \nfundamental problem in my mind is, under that annex, under the \nprovisions of the treaty, if the United States were to become a full \npartner in the treaty, the United States would cede, again, binding \nauthority to these other sorts of tribunals regarding all other \ndisputes.\n  So, in other words, the first type of arbitral tribunal would cover \nthe four issue areas that I mentioned a few minutes ago. This general \ntribunal would cover all other disputes.\n  Now, how is this tribunal made up? Very similar, in fact, to the \nothers. Again, a five-person body, simple majority rules. Both parties \nto the dispute, in this case, pick one panelist. So if we were hauled \ninto international court, if you will, by another country, that other \ncountry would pick one panelist, and we would pick one panelist. Again, \nsimilar to the other tribunal. Then both parties together would try to \nagree on the other three panelists. Obviously, those three would \ncompose a majority of the five. But if the parties can't agree--and, \nonce again, if our opposing country, the country that has hauled us \ninto court, doesn't want to agree to any of our ideas, any of our \nsuggestions no matter how reasonable, it can just stand firm and not \nagree. In that case, those three members of the tribunal--a majority of \nthe tribunal--would be chosen by the Law of the Sea lead bureaucrat, \nthe head of the Law of the Sea under the treaty, an international \nbureaucrat similar in background and attitudes in many instances to the \nSecretary General of the U.N. Again, it is the same fundamental problem \nin my mind in that we are ceding our autonomy, we are ceding binding \ndecisions that can be very significant in terms of our fate, our \ninterests, our values, to this international court dominated by, \ncontrolled by, potentially, international bureaucrats.\n  Why is this a threat? What sort of disputes could arise that could go \nto these binding courts, or binding tribunals, panels? Well, one area \nthat is clearly covered by the treaty is pollution. One would think \nthat could be reasonable and necessary and natural with regard to \npollution in the open ocean--this is a Law of the Sea Treaty, after \nall--but it also applies to pollution from land-based sources, and that \ncomes as a great surprise to most people when they find that out. But \nthat is why it is useful to read the treaty because when you read the \ntreaty you actually find out some of these things.\n  Article 213 of the treaty is entitled--very frankly, very simply, \nvery directly--``Enforcement With Respect to Pollution From Land-Based \nSources.''\n\n  That article says:\n\n       States shall enforce their laws and regulations in \n     accordance with Article 207--\n\n  That is fair enough. We pass our laws; we should enforce them--\n\n     and shall adopt laws and regulations and take other measures \n     necessary to implement applicable international rules and \n     standards, to prevent, reduce, and control pollution of the \n     marine environment from land-based sources.\n\n  Well, wait a minute. I thought Congress and other political bodies in \nthe United States determine our domestic laws, including about \npollution from land-based sources. This is a distinct departure from \nthat. This is a mandate in an international treaty saying: We shall \nadopt other laws to enforce international notions, international \nstandards about pollution.\n  Another applicable article is Article 207, and under 207(1) it, \nagain, says:\n\n       States shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce \n     and control pollution of the marine environment from land-\n     based sources, taking into account internationally agreed \n     upon rules, standards and recommended practices and \n     procedures.\n\n  Once again, my reaction when I read that is, wait a minute. I thought \nCongress was in charge of environmental policy in the United States. I \nthought State legislatures, where appropriate, were in charge of that \npolicy--bodies elected by the people. Isn't that what democracy is \nabout? Well, this is a distinct departure. This is internationalizing \nmany of those issues with mandates in the Law of the Sea Treaty that go \nbeyond what we may think is the best law in these areas, and that we \nconform to certain international decisions.\n  Again, the title of the article couldn't be clearer: ``Enforcement \nWith Respect to Pollution From Land-Based Sources.'' Again, this is \njust one example of an issue area where the United States could well be \nceding autonomy, ceding authority to other folks outside our borders \nwho don't necessarily have our values, our notions, our best interests \nin mind.\n  What sort of situation could arise from this? Well, I think the \nsituation that would undoubtedly arise is an outbreak of international \nlawyering and litigation--trying to move decisions that are presently \nbefore elected political bodies in the United States to the \ninternational arena. Many folks who have studied this phenomenon call \nit ``lawfare.'' Again, not ``warfare'' but using international law to \noppose us and battle our interests and move those decisions from the \ndomestic political environment to an international tribunal, an \ninternational stage that very often doesn't have our best interests in \nmind. Again, U.S. autonomy gives way to international litigation.\n  This isn't a wild conjecture on my part. This isn't something I am \nimagining or seeing in the future. This is something that many \ninternational lawyers and activists are actively licking their lips \nover and looking forward to. In fact, there was a Law Review article \npublished several months ago that was very straightforward about this \nphenomenon that would occur if we become a party to the treaty. The \nauthor of this Law Review article said very clearly:\n\n       Climate change litigation--\n\n  One example of environmental issues, environmental litigation--\n\n     in national and international fora is emerging as an \n     alternative means by which to hold States and private actors \n     accountable for climate change damages. The United Nations \n     convention on the Law of the Sea is a promising instrument \n     through which such action might be taken, given its broad \n     definition of pollution to the marine environment and the \n     dispute resolution mechanisms contained within its \n     provisions.\n\n  That is exactly what I am talking about. That policy, that issue now \nis subject to our determination, and Congress is subject to the \nactivity of other elected bodies in the United States, but under the \nLaw of the Sea Treaty, it would be moved to an international forum, to \ninternational litigation, to lawfare, in many cases, against the values \nand interests of the United States.\n  We have great disagreement and debate in this body about significant \nissues such as climate change. That is legitimate in a democracy; we \nshould have those debates, and we should hash out those differences, \nand we should make the best determinations and policies we can on \nbehalf of the American people. But that is something very different \nfrom pushing those issues and those decisions outside of the United \nStates to international courts, to international tribunals over which \nwe essentially have no control.\n  There are other issue areas that could be the subject of this sort of \ninternational litigation, other countries hauling us into court to \noppose our values and interests.\n  Another topic where this could happen--and this gives me grave \nconcern--has to do with military activities. I actively asked many of \nthe expert witnesses in our hearings before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee about it. What would prevent another country from \nhauling us into international court--that court, that tribunal having \nbinding authority over\n\n[[Page S14243]]\n\nus, if we become a part of the treaty--to try to stop, prevent, \nhamstring us with regard to military activity?\n  The response was immediate: There is a clear exception in the Law of \nthe Sea Treaty that excepts military activities. That is true. Article \n298 excludes ``military activities'' from the Law of the Sea Treaty's \nbinding dispute resolution.\n  The experts didn't have a good answer to my next question. It was \nlogical. The next question is: OK, who determines what is a military \nactivity and what is not a military activity? If there is an exclusion \nregarding military activities, then this term is pretty darn important. \nWho defines this term? Who applies this term on a case-by-case basis?\n  When I asked that to the experts before the committee, there was a \nfair amount of silence. And then, after some consultation with the \nlawyers behind the experts, the answer came: Well, we believe we define \nwhat is a military activity--we, the United States.\n  The next logical question: Where does the treaty say that? Where is \nthat spelled out in the treaty? It is not. The treaty is completely \nsilent on the issue. So the treaty excludes military activities, but it \ndoesn't say what is military activity and what is not a military \nactivity. The treaty doesn't determine who determines what is and is \nnot a military activity.\n  Here in the United States, when two parties go to court, there is \noften a dispute in the beginning of the lawsuit about whether that \nparticular court has jurisdiction. Guess who decides whether that court \nhas jurisdiction. That court decides if it has jurisdiction. If the \nsame thing were to occur in the Law of the Sea Treaty, who decides \nthat? The international court, the tribunal, would decide, and it would \ndecide that crucial threshold issue against our opinion, against our \ninterests; and there we are again before a binding international \ntribunal, which could have grave effects on what we consider our \nmilitary activities.\n  Another final area of concern I will highlight that could come up as \na subject of this sort of international litigation is intelligence \nactivities. Post-9/11, perhaps nothing is more important to our \nsecurity, to the defense of our values and our way of life, than our \nnecessary intelligence activities.\n  That gave rise to an obvious question I asked the experts before the \ncommittee: Would intelligence activities be covered by the Law of the \nSea Treaty? And could these international tribunals, with binding \nauthority on us, have that binding authority over our intelligence \nactivities?\n  Once again, I would have thought this was a simple and obvious \nquestion, but it caused a long period of silence from the witnesses who \nwere there to testify in favor of the treaty. Finally, after long \nperiods of silence and much consultation with the lawyers behind them, \nthe answer was: Well, we believe our intelligence activities fall under \nthe military exemption. So we believe intelligence activities would not \ngo to court, would not go to this international court with binding \nauthority, because we believe it falls under the military exemption.\n  Again, an obvious followup question: Great. Where in the treaty does \nit say that? Long silence. Long pause. Consultation with the lawyers \nbehind the experts. Well, the treaty doesn't say that. Does the treaty \nsay anything about intelligence? The treaty doesn't mention \nintelligence--whether it is covered under the military exemption.\n  I have to tell you, that again gave me great pause and concern, \nbecause I immediately thought of this place--the Senate, the House, \nCapitol Hill--where intelligence is considered an entirely separate \nsubject matter from military. When we are up here debating matters and \nsending matters to committees, there is an Intelligence Committee that \nhandles intelligence. There is a completely separate Armed Services \nCommittee that handles military matters. Intelligence isn't subsumed \nunder military. Intelligence issues don't go to the Armed Services \nCommittee. It is a completely separate category. So why should it \nnecessarily be different in the Law of the Sea Treaty? I think an \nargument could be made--a very logical, forceful argument--that \nintelligence activities aren't excluded under the treaty.\n  Intelligence activities are different from military activities, just \nas they are considered different up here on Capitol Hill. Guess what. \nIntelligence activities could make the subject of this international \nlaw against us--before countries calling us into international court, \nbefore the international tribunals that would have binding authority on \nus--very disconcerting, particularly in a post-9/11 world, where our \nintelligence activities are so absolutely crucial to our national \ndefense and our activities necessary to preserve our values and way of \nlife.\n  Again, there are many significant issues that arise under the Law of \nthe Sea Treaty debate. Hopefully, we will have a full opportunity to \ndiscuss these issues I brought up today, and more. But these issues I \nhave discussed today are the heart of my concern with the treaty, and \nthe heart of that concern is simply that the United States would be \nceding our autonomy, our control over our own future and destiny to \ninternational bureaucrats, to international courts, who very often \nwould not have our best interests in mind and would not share our \nperspectives or our values.\n  That is something very serious to consider when you are talking about \nenvironmental policy, which has always been the subject of debate in \nelected bodies within the United States; when you are talking about \nmilitary activities, which are so important, particularly in a post-9/\n11 world; and when you are talking about intelligence activities, \nsimilarly crucial to our security, and defense of our way of life in a \npost-9/11 world.\n  I hope the Senate takes a very long, very hard look at this treaty. I \nhope every individual Senator will do something quite unusual, which is \nread the treaty, open the book, look at the details, think for \nyourself. Once I began that process several months ago, the concerns \nover this treaty--particularly with regard to U.S. autonomy--began to \nmount and multiply in my own mind. Every Senator has an obligation to \npick up the treaty itself, read it personally, and think through these \nconcerns, because the results, if things proceed as I have outlined, \ncould be disastrous.\n  With that, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats control the time until the hour \nof 12:30.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14243-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14243-S14246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESIDENTIAL VETO\n\n  Mr. President, last week, Congress took bold action on behalf of \nAmerican families by sending an appropriations bill to the President \nthat has important new investments in the everyday needs and hopes and \ndreams of the American people. It is a bill that funds our investments \nin education, health care, and in American jobs. These are not optional \ninvestments. They are not just nice little programs that can be funded \n1 year and cast aside the next. These investments are about hope and \nopportunity for our children. They are about the dignity of middle-\nclass and working families all across America. They are about our \nnational strength. Unfortunately, it appears once again that the \neveryday concerns of the American people have fallen on deaf ears in \nthe White House. This morning, the President vetoed this pro-family, \npro-child, pro-worker legislation.\n  In fact, the White House says this bill is irresponsible and \nreckless. I ask: What is irresponsible and reckless about making sure \nour children receive the best education in the world? What is \nirresponsible and reckless about finding a cure for cancer so families \nno longer see that disease claim their mothers and fathers, brothers \nand sisters before their time? What is irresponsible and reckless about \ngiving our workers the training and the skills they need to get good \njobs and support\n\n[[Page S14244]]\n\ntheir families? If anything is irresponsible and reckless, it is the \nPresident's choices.\n  The President insists on continuing to spend billions of dollars on a \nfailed policy in Iraq, but he refuses to deliver the relief America's \nfamilies need. This morning, the President signed a Defense \nappropriations bill that includes a 10-percent increase in funding \ncompared to last year, but he vetoed a bill that includes an increase \nof half that amount that would fund cancer research, investment in our \nschools, job training, and protection for our workers.\n  Let's take a closer look at what the President has vetoed.\n  The bill provides long overdue funding for education. Year after \nyear, the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress have \nfailed to make the needed new investments for better teachers and \nstronger schools. In fact, under Republican control, commitment to the \neducation of our children has continued to go down.\n  This chart shows in 2002, the year No Child Left Behind was passed, \nthere was funding at $7.7 billion. We wanted reform and resources. We \ngot it that time once it was passed. This chart shows the gradual \ndiminution of support for funding under Republican Congresses and a \nRepublican Senate. Now we see the beginning of the Democratic \nresolution and now the Democratic conference report and an increase. \nThe President's request, $1.5 billion less; the Democratic conference \nreport, $3.2 billion. And we the find the legislation vetoed.\n  This bill finally reverses that course of reductions over recent \nyears under this administration. So it delivers the largest increase in \ntitle I funding since we passed No Child Left Behind. Again, we had the \nincrease at the time of passage of the act and then a decline in \nresources, and now we see in 2008 there is an increase in the title I \nprogram for the neediest children in America. That was vetoed this \nmorning.\n  This bill delivers the largest increase in funding for education. \nThat is funding that goes to the children who have fallen the furthest \nbehind and need the most help. It pays for teachers, improved \ncurriculum, tutors, and a whole array of actions that can help students \ndo well in school.\n  It provides $4.5 billion in additional funding in education compared \nto the President's budget. How can the President of the United States \nsay he will leave no child behind when he has vetoed the very bill that \nwill enable us to do that?\n  We are working in Congress to renew the No Child Left Behind reforms \nand to make them work better, but we cannot do it with a ``tin cup'' \neducation budget. This President seems to think we can improve our \nschools on the cheap. The President says $4.5 billion more to students \nis too much. Yet he is proposing 35 times that much for the war in \nIraq. He wants us to say yes to $158 billion for Iraq, while he says no \nto $4.5 billion for American school children.\n  In Iraq, anything goes. The sky's the limit. Billions and billions \nand billions of dollars for Iraq. But here in America, right at home, a \nmodest investment in our school children gets a veto.\n  This bill includes $1 billion for high-quality programs that help \nchildren after school; afterschool programs which are so important for \nchildren. Afterschool programs assist children with their homework, \ngive them extra tutorial work, and give support when their parents are \nat work.\n  These funds will help 1.4 million needy children who need a place to \ngo after the school day ends. These are programs that help hard-working \nparents, improve student lives, and keep communities safe by decreasing \ndrug use and violence.\n  We can help these school children after school for the cost of 2\\1/2\\ \ndays in Iraq. But the President says no.\n  The bill includes $3 billion to improve the quality of our teachers. \nThose funds will be used to hire 30,000 more teachers to reduce class \nsizes. How many days of hearings have we had that demonstrate smaller \nclass sizes and well-trained teachers are absolutely essential? How \nmany times do we have to learn that lesson? We understand that lesson. \nWe have tried to, with bipartisan support, get these funds into this \nlegislation to improve the support for our teachers.\n  These funds, as I mentioned, hire 30,000 more teachers. They will be \nused for mentoring 100,000 beginning teachers and professional \ndevelopment for an additional 200,000 teachers who will go into \nunderserved communities across this country. We can do all of that for \nthe cost of a single week in Iraq. But the President says no.\n  This bill includes $500 million to help our struggling schools turn \naround. Improving our schools means supporting them. We can provide \nsupport for our neediest schools for about the cost of a day in Iraq. \nWe can take those schools that are falling further behind for a range \nof reasons--they may need restructuring, they may need additional \nassistance or targeted assistance, but whatever they need, they need to \nhave this kind of assistance. But the President says no.\n  The bill includes $7 billion to provide high-quality early education \nthrough Head Start. This week, the Congress will pass a Head Start bill \nthat will strengthen the program to make Head Start even better. Those \nfunds will be used to ensure that nearly 1 million children are ready \nto learn when they enter kindergarten. These funds build a basic \nfoundation for learning that will help these low-income and minority \nchildren for the rest of their lives. We can fund this program for the \ncost of a little more than 2 weeks in Iraq.\n\n  We are going to have a conference report, virtually a unanimous \nconference report where we have worked out the differences, that we \nwill pass in the Senate at the end of this week. The House is taking it \nup on Thursday. We will pass it the end of this week or the early part \nof next week. It includes so many of the recommendations of early \neducation. We need high-quality individuals working in Head Start and \nworking on the curriculum. We need to coordinate the various services \nfor our children in the early years, to smooth out the transition \nprocess from early education programs to kindergarten.\n  We are beginning to get that seamless web of services that we all \nunderstand are critical. We are providing assistance in education and \nsupports for children at the earliest ages. This continues on to \nkindergarten through 12th grade so children are ready for college and \nwork. That is what we are desirous of, a continuum. Read that \nmagnificent book of Jack Shonkoff, who is now at Harvard, formerly with \nthe Heller School at Brandeis, ``From Neurons to Neighborhoods.'' It \nbrings together the three great studies that were done by the Institute \nof Medicine about the developing of a child's brain, the synapsis, the \ncognitive and social abilities to deal with their social conditions, \nthe development of knowledge, a sense of inquiry and curiosity that \ndevelops and settles in a child's brain.\n  One cannot read that book and not understand that some of the best \ninvestments we make in education is in early education. We have taken \nso many of the lessons of that extraordinary document and have worked \nthem through, Democrats and Republicans alike, in our conference. We \nwill make real progress, but we need to invest the resources to do \nthat. But when we came to do it and even as we work in Congress to \nimprove the vital program, for the equivalent of 2 weeks in Iraq, the \nPresident said no.\n  This same misguided rationale applies to other investments in the \nbill as well. The President's veto means squandered opportunities for \nprogress on the major health challenges the American people face. I \nrecently spoke to a gathering of leading cancer researchers who are \nmaking extraordinary progress against this deadly disease. They have \nhelped cancer become, in many cases, a treatable illness instead of a \ndeath sentence. Every day, they are fighting to help Americans with \ncancer live longer and longer and healthier lives.\n  We have seen for the first time, in recent years, where the total \nnumber of cancer cases are going down. In the previous 20 years, we saw \nsome modification of those numbers going up. When evaluated against the \nchange in the age of our population and other indicators, it showed we \nwere making some progress that was encouraging. But the most important \nand significant has been in recent years, where we see the total number \nof cases are going down.\n  You cannot tell me that is not the result of the extraordinary \ninvestment\n\n[[Page S14245]]\n\nthat was made in the Congress in recent years in doubling the NIH \nbudget, with all of the progress we have made in mapping the human \ngenome, sequencing the genes, various extraordinary breakthroughs that \nhave come about. There are so many well-qualified, peer-reviewed \nprojects that are on the desk at the NIH that will not be funded. These \ncould offer hope for families in this country who have been touched by \nthe devastation of cancer.\n  We provided in this legislation nearly $5 billion to fund more than \n6,800 research grants to help win this fight. The President's veto \ntells Americans battling cancer that their fight for life is not a \npriority for the Nation. He tells patients they must wait a little \nlonger, dream a little less, and hope a little more faintly for the \nbreakthroughs that this research can bring.\n  On and on down the line, the President vetoed urgently needed \nresearch in heart disease, diabetes, asthma, infectious disease, mental \nhealth, and many other areas. The President would rather squander \nbillions in Iraq than invest in the research that could bring progress \nagainst these diseases and relief for millions of our fellow citizens.\n  But the damage does not stop with the impact of this veto on the \ncures of the future. Patients today will feel the bite of the \nPresident's veto.\n  Community Health Centers make quality health care possible for \nmillions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance. A veto of the \n$2 billion for community health centers included in this bill means \nthat 15 million low-income people will be denied their opportunity for \nhealth care. This, at a time when we are seeing the total number of \nuninsured increasing. The only reason it has not increased more is \nbecause of the CHIP program. If we didn't have the CHIP program, the 47 \nmillion with no coverage would have been increased a good deal more. \nBut if we look at the total number of Americans who are without health \ninsurance over the course of the years, it is 75 million Americans out \nof a population of 300 million who sometime during the course of the \nyear who lack adequate coverage, including 45 million who have no \nhealth care coverage at all. Those numbers are going up.\n  Where do individuals go? They go to their neighborhood health \ncenters. We have had remarkable bipartisan support in the expansion of \nthese programs, but when we tried to put in the resources, some $2 \nbillion for these centers included in this bill, it was vetoed. The \nCenters for Disease Control are on call to protect us 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. When there is an outbreak or disaster, CDC is there.\n  In my own community, in Massachusetts, over the weekend our water \nsupply was closed down because E. coli had penetrated the water system. \nAnd here, with all of the various health challenges we have going on \nthere is obviously a role for the FDA, but there is also a role for the \nCenters for Disease Control, which is extremely well led at the present \ntime. They provide such importance when we are considering the pandemic \ndangers for this country, let alone the pandemic dangers as a result of \nterrorism with biologics and chemicals. It will be the Centers for \nDisease Control that we are going to call on; our first responders. \nBut, no, the President's veto means our Nation's health readiness will \nbe weakened and our progress against disease will be halted.\n  Training of new doctors and nurses, assistance to hospitals in rural \nand underserved communities, improving health information technology, \nimmunizations programs, and on and on. The President has the same \nresponse to each of them: veto, veto, veto.\n  The President's veto will also be devastating to America's workers. \nWith globalization and layoffs and corporations cutting benefits, \nAmericans are worried about their jobs. The least we can do is make \nsure they are safe on the job and treated with dignity.\n  This bill provides the funds needed to enforce the labor laws that \nkeep our workers safe and give them a level playing field. This bill \nhas a very modest increase for OSHA, the Occupational Health and Safety \nAdministration. Since the implementation of this law, the number of \ndeaths has been cut by more than half in America. This is from $490 \nmillion to $501 million. This is the very minor increase in MSHA, the \nMine Safety Health Administration, from $313 million to $340 million. \nHave we forgotten what happened in the Sago mines in West Virginia or \nout in Utah, where scores of individuals lost their lives? And here we \nhave the agency that is challenged with new legislation that reflected \na bipartisan effort here in this body, Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether making the recommendations, and making these recommendations \nas well, in order that we would have safety in the workforce. Yet that \nis vetoed.\n  Just last week, three workers were killed in an explosion in a \npowerplant in Salem, Massachusetts. Terrible incidents like this are \nall too common. Every year, more than 5,700 workers are killed, with \nmore than 4,000 injured or made ill on the job. Workers everywhere--at \npowerplants, coal mines, hospitals, and construction sites--rely on our \nFederal agencies to protect them and make sure they can return home to \ntheir families each night.\n  But the President's veto takes bad employers off the hook and puts \nAmerican workers at risk. We won't have the needed funds this bill \nprovides to inspect workplaces and enforce our safety laws. Millions of \nworkers' safety and very lives will be at risk.\n  The veto of this bill is also devastating to veterans. We just \nobserved Veterans Day. Each year, nearly 320,000 brave servicemembers \nreturn to civilian life, many coming from Iraq and Afghanistan. Sadly, \nour hearing in the Labor Committee last week showed they faced daunting \nchallenges.\n  Tens of thousands of Reserve and National Guard members have lost \ntheir benefits, and even their jobs because they served their country. \nThat is why this bill provides $228 million to help our veterans find \njobs, receive training--and protect their right to return to their \nformer jobs. This is guaranteed in the law but not adequately fulfilled \nat this present time. The President's veto takes away this modest \nwelcome mat and slams the door in our veterans' faces.\n  All Americans are certainly familiar with what happened at Walter \nReed, but there are so many other aspects that we are continuing to \nsupport. Senator Murkowski, Senator Murray, and many of our colleagues \non the appropriate committees are making extraordinary efforts to help \naddress these issues for our service men and women. But we must all \nrecognize that one out of four of the homeless today is a veteran. One \nout of four of the homeless is a veteran. And if veterans return to the \nUnited States without a job, with lost backpay, or lost health \ninsurance, there is a rapid spiral right down into destitution and \npoverty and homelessness and, in some instances, suicide and other \nhorrific behavior.\n  What about other American workers who want to upgrade their skills to \ncompete and win in the global economy? This bill says we should not \ncast workers and their dreams aside. It rejects the President's cut and \nincludes $2.9 billion for job training. But the President's veto, \nagain, leaves these hard-working Americans out in the cold.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, there are 92,640 jobs that needed \nworkers at the end of last year, and there are 178,000 people who \ndidn't have jobs and were on the unemployment lists. It should be \npretty understandable that if we can get those people trained and place \nthem into productive employment, they are going to be productive, \nuseful, and valuable workers in our communities. Their hopes and dreams \nfor their families will be enhanced. And, through taxes, they will \nincrease additional tax revenues for the future. That kind of \ninvestment is necessary. But what happens, Mr. President? We see those \nprograms have been effectively vetoed.\n  This appropriations bill is about the strength and the well-being of \nAmerican families. By vetoing the bill, the President is turning his \nback on the priorities of America's families--their hopes, their \ndreams, and their opportunities. But we will not give up on providing \nthe solutions that are so desperately needed. We will continue to work \nwith our colleagues in the Senate and the House and chart a new course \nand fight for the real needs of all Americans.\n  This battle is not over. It has only just begun.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S14246]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I shall not take all that time, but I \nwanted to talk about a couple of things this morning. Before I do that, \nI want to express my appreciation for the comments of my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, about what our priorities seem to be \nand what they should be with respect to fiscal policy and \nappropriations bills as well as the larger priorities of our country.\n  Let me now talk briefly about the vote that occurred last week on the \nconfirmation of Attorney General Mukasey. I wish to talk about it \nbecause I think a very important issue that needs to be discussed--and \nwe have not really discussed it much on the floor of the Senate--is the \nissue of torture.\n  I don't think the issue of torture, for this country, is negotiable. \nAnd, I don't think it is a very difficult question.\n  But, before I talk about the issue of torture specifically, let me \njust describe what I think represents the great strength of this \ncountry, and the great strength of this country does not include a \nwillingness or an allowance to torture anybody anywhere.\n  We were engaged in a long, difficult Cold War for decades. That \nstruggle against the Soviet Union and totalitarianism lasted a long \ntime. But it wasn't, in the end, bombs and bullets that won that war; \nit was American values that won that war. It was the idea of our \ncountry, and the idea of our country is rooted in the Constitution. \nPeople are free. They believe what they want. They are able to say what \nthey want. The Government has to respect the rights of everyone.\n  That is the embroidery and the framework of our Government and our \nConstitution. America is an idea, with a written Constitution and a \nBill of Rights, that protects people, and stands for liberty, human \nrights, and human dignity.\n  In fact, those values of this country were so strong that even during \nthe Cold War those values shined a light of hope into the darkest cells \nin the Soviet Union, in the gulag prisons, in the outermost reaches of \nSiberia. We know that because people who were in those dark cells came \nout from behind the Iron Curtain and told us of the ray of hope they \nsaw from this country.\n  Millions of political prisoners were held, often in solitary \nconfinement in the Soviet Union, simply for thinking and speaking \nfreely. Many were there for years, swept off the streets in the Soviet \nUnion, never to be heard from again.\n  Often, they weren't charged. When they were, they were convicted \nafter show trials because they had no rights.\n  But some survived, and they talked about how important the idea and \nthe values were that embodied this country called the United States. \nAmerica gave them hope. The idea of America reached to the farthest and \ndarkest places on this planet. It always has, and it has offered hope.\n  Now, it is true that this country is not perfect. We all understand \nthat. But it is also true that what we stand for is very important in \nterms of the message we send around the world. It is important for our \nself-respect, and it is important for what we believe America to be.\n  It is troubling to me that polls that are done around the world show \nthat so many in the world now are very concerned about our country, \nwith views that are very negative about the United States, and these \nviews are held by historic foes but also historic friends. That is \nsomething which should concern all of us. We have to hold ourselves to \na higher standard. We always have, and we should hold ourselves to a \nhigher standard.\n  The issue of torture was an issue that arose because of the questions \nasked a candidate, a nominee, for Attorney General. There are some who \nbelieve under certain circumstances, apparently, torture is all right \nor appropriate or sanctioned. I am not one of them, and I would think \nmost Americans would not believe that.\n  George Washington led the Continental Army in the War for \nIndependence. After a large number of his troops were captured, he and \nhis troops saw Hessian mercenaries, fighting for the British, slaughter \nunarmed prisoners from the Continental Army. They saw that, and yet \nGeorge Washington refused to treat Hessian prisoners the same way. He \ninsisted we were different and we would treat people the way we should \nbe treated.\n  That is America's birthright. It has always been the case. And that \nis why the discussion about torture is so very important. It is why the \ndiscussions about treatment of detainees, about enemy combatants, about \nhabeas corpus, and about the power of the executive branch in this \ncountry are important as well.\n  The Attorney General's post is very important. I met with the nominee \nand I liked him. I talked to him about his commendable experience in \nGovernment as a Federal Judge. But his inability to answer the basic \nquestions about waterboarding and torture were very troubling to me. I \ndon't understand that inability, and I don't think, from my standpoint, \nthat issue is negotiable. Torture is not what America is about.\n  Some say or some imply that being against torture is somehow being \nsoft on terrorists. That is as despicable as it is wrong. Being against \ntorture is being for an America that is better than its enemies. Being \nagainst torture is being for an America that continues to be a beacon \nof hope around the world for doing the right thing, and it is being for \nan America that stands for the rule of law and human dignity and human \nrights.\n  So I wanted to make the point, after the debate we had last week, \nthat this is not an irrelevant issue. It is an issue that defines our \ncountry. It is an issue about who we are, the value system of this \ngreat country of ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14246-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14246-S14248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FISCAL POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe a couple of things that \nrepresent front-page news these days. Regrettably, I believe, these \nthings threaten the potential future prosperity of our country and \nrequire an urgent response on the part of the President and the \nCongress.\n  The economy and fiscal policy of this administration--and the lack of \nregulatory interest on the part of this administration--has led us to \nan abyss that is very troublesome. We see the dollar dropping in value \nto other currencies. We see a dramatic trade deficit of $2 billion a \nday, that we are buying from other countries more than we are selling \nto other countries. We see a fiscal policy budget deficit that the \nPresident says is coming down. The only way he can say the deficit is \nsignificantly coming down is that he is taking all of the surplus \nSocial Security revenues that are supposed to go into the Social \nSecurity trust fund and using every dollar of that surplus as an offset \nagainst other revenue and other spending in order to show a much lower \ndeficit. We are far off track in trade policy and fiscal policy, and \nnow we have in front of us a proposal for $196 billion in emergency \nspending--none of it paid for. That will bring us very close to three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars that the President has requested on an \nemergency basis--none of it paid for. That is not conservatism. We have \na responsibility to begin paying for these costs. We send soldiers to \nwar and the President says to the American people: You go shopping and \ndo your part for the American economy.\n\n  That should not happen. What should happen is when we send soldiers \nto go to war and ask them to wear the uniform of their country and go \nin harm's way, we should, as a responsible Congress and President, pay \nfor the costs as we go.\n  I don't understand it. The President is down there at the White House \nsaying $22 billion additional for the kinds of things that invest in \nour country--he says I am opposed to that. He said I will veto 10 of \nyour bills, if necessary. He said, I am opposed to that $22 billion of \nyour bills, half of which is invested in health care. Then he says, by \nthe way, I want $196 billion on the other side, none of it paid for, \nfor my priorities, and he says: But that is for the troops.\n  I am sorry, it is not just for the troops. A substantial portion of \nthat is for the contractors. There is dramatic\n\n[[Page S14247]]\n\nevidence of the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this \ncountry going to contractors who are profiteering, regrettably, during \na war. For a long while I have believed--we have had votes in the \nSenate and all on the other side of the aisle have voted against it--\nthat we should have a Truman-type committee, such as the one Harry \nTruman led many decades ago, that began to investigate the waste, \nfraud, and abuse in contracting that is existing, that is fleecing the \nAmerican taxpayer, undermining the American troops, going on under the \nnose of this administration, and nobody seems to care.\n  With respect to a fiscal policy that is out of control, let me \ndescribe the second portion of that, and that is an administration that \ndoesn't want regulators to regulate. I understand some do not like \nregulation, but this administration has gone way beyond the pale in \nsaying to regulators, look the other way.\n  Here is what is happening. This morning you read the newspaper and \nsee that subprime loans are beginning to have a big impact on all \nAmericans because it is beginning to have an impact on the economy. \nWhat does all this mean, subprime lending?\n  Let me describe it to you. Again, the regulators were asleep, didn't \ndo anything, didn't care very much. Here is what has been going on. We \nhave had mortgage companies that used to be kind of the slow, little \ncompanies that would lend you money for your home, down on the street \ncorner someplace, not much going on, somebody who was a thoughtful \nperson with a pencil above their ear, they were wearing a white shirt \nand suspenders. You would sit down and say, I need a home loan. They \nwould be glad to help you and they would sit down and work out a home \nloan for you. That was the way home loans worked.\n  All of a sudden, home loans have changed. All of a sudden it is a go-\ngo industry. This is what they started doing. It is unbelievable. This \nis an advertisement from the biggest home lending company in this \ncountry: Homeowners, do you want to refinance and get cash? Countrywide \nhas a great reason to do it now. A no cost finance. It has no points, \nno applications fee, no credit reporting and no third party fees. No \ntitle, no escrow, or appraisal fees. Absolutely no closing costs. So \nyou wind up with a lot more cash.\n  Here is another company that had a different thing to say, Zoom \nCredit:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will pre-\n     approve you for a car loan, a home loan or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--\n     who cares?\n\n  This is an ad from a mortgage company.\n  Millenia Mortgage had to say in their advertisement:\n\n       Twelve months No Mortgage Payment. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you.\n\n  Let me describe what all this means and what they were doing. I will \ndo it with respect to the largest mortgage lending company. Angelo \nMozilo created Countrywide Finance, the biggest mortgage company in our \ncountry. They are the ones, along with others, who helped create the \nriskier loans and in many cases targeted those loans to those who could \nnot repay.\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Late mortgage \n     payments? Denied by other lenders? Call us.\n\n  That was one of Countrywide's advertisements. Let me say again:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us--\n\n  Countrywide says.\n  So they began to attract borrowers through advertising, and then they \nhad brokers on the phone soliciting, calling somebody up, saying: Let's \ntalk about a new mortgage. We can get some cash for you and reduce your \ninterest rates. So they created ``affordability loans,'' a new \ncategory; then adjustable rate mortgages; then interest-rate-only \nloans; then reduced documentation or no-documentation loans. When I \nheard that one, I thought, What does that mean? It means just what it \nsays: If you want to get a loan, a home mortgage, and you don't want to \ndocument your income, they say that is fine, we will give you a no-doc \nloan. You will pay a little higher interest rate, but we will certainly \ngive you a mortgage if you don't have documentation.\n  One of the new mortgages they began to offer is interest-only loans \nso the borrower is required to pay interest charges only. They deferred \nany principal payment to much later; and then they came up with a pay \noption adjustable rate mortgage, which allowed the borrower to pay only \na portion of the interest, none of the principal, just a portion of the \ninterest, and defer all of it to the end of the loan. This means you \nmight end up paying much more for the house than the house is worth.\n\n  All these fancy things--what they were saying to potential borrowers \nwas, if you have bad credit, come to us because we have an instrument \nfor you.\n  This is about greed, by the way, because the brokers and the banks \nmade extraordinary amount of money. So what they did was they created a \ncircumstance where they would loan to people something called subprime \nloans. There is evidence they put people into subprime loans, even \nthough they could have qualified for prime loans. Why? Because subprime \nloans paid more. Then they rolled these subprime loans, in many cases \nfor people who couldn't repay, and they would set the interest rate \nridiculously low--pay 2 percent interest rate, for example, and then it \nwill reset in 24 months, 36 months, and when it resets, it will reset \nway up here, but in the meantime here is your monthly payment.\n  They were quoting monthly payments without the escrow, so they were \nrecording ridiculously low payments. In some cases, they were quoting \ninterest only loans, some cases with only partial interest, in other \ncases at ridiculously low rates that were going to reset at a high \nrate, and then they would attach prepayment penalties to them so they \ncould lock people in. And then what they did is they rolled this up \nlike sausage.\n  There was a story about how there used to be sawdust in with meat \nwhen they rolled sausage up so you didn't know what you were eating. It \nwas good filler, apparently. They rolled these up as securities with \nthe subprime loans, the prime loans, rolled them up as a security, \nsliced them up to be sold.\n  Guess what. The big investors out there liked this stuff. It paid \npretty high rates at this point because you were able to have \nprepayment penalties and a whole series of things. They are buying \nthese things without having the foggiest idea what is in them. The \nrating agencies are rating them as OK. So you have the folks investing \nin the securities that represent these subprimes. Then all of a sudden \nit is discovered people are not able to pay. They can't make their \nhouse payments. The interest rate gets reset. It is way up. They don't \nhave a ghost of a chance of making the house payment, and then they \nstand around scratching their head wondering what happened. I will tell \nyou what happened, a carnival of greed on the part of the mortgage \nbrokers, bank security firms--all of them, a total carnival of greed. \nNow they are all walking around scratching their head, trying to figure \nout what do we do next.\n  Well, Merrill Lynch, for example, lost $8.4 billion, I guess it was, \n2 weeks ago, so they fired their CEO. I believe he got $161 million in \nsecurities and retirement benefits--as he went out the door.\n  Last week it was CitiGroup that fired their CEO. There was a pretty \nsubstantial benefit.\n  That is going on all over the country. By the way, the head of the \ncompany that is the largest company, Mr. Mozilo, in the midst of all \nthis, head of the largest company that is engaged in all this, \nCountrywide, earned $142 million last year. He was celebrated as the \nexecutive--Fortune Magazine's prestigious Company of the Year. The \nHoratio Alger award. He made $142 million last year and the New York \nTimes reports that he was selling $138 million of his stock in the \ncompany as he was talking about how well the company was doing.\n  This subprime scandal is all about greed. It is not new. It happened \nin the savings and loan industry. It has happened in other areas. It is \nnow happening with respect to this mortgage industry scandal. The \nadministration, of course, doesn't want anybody looking over anybody's \nshoulder, so there\n\n[[Page S14248]]\n\nhas been no regulation. You have hedge funds buying into these things. \nThey are unregulated, by and large. There is no regulation, no \noversight, Katy-bar-the-door, do what you want to do, the private \nsector will be fine.\n  It is not fine. This is having a significant and serious impact on \nthis country's economy. I am going to come back to this in a moment, \nbut let me describe the other issue that is happening.\n  We wake up this morning and oil is $90 to $100 a barrel. You ask why \nis that the case? Why is oil $90 to $100 a barrel? Once again, it is \nlack of oversight. Here we have a futures market on which oil is bought \nand sold. This futures market has now become an unbelievable orgy of \nspeculation.\n  I was reading yesterday from an article, an analyst from the \nOppenheimer Company in New York, was talking about the price of oil. He \nsays:\n\n       I'm absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a \n     dime above $55 a barrel. Oil speculators include the largest \n     financial institutions of the world. I call it the world's \n     largest gambling hall. It is open 24-7. Unfortunately there \n     are segments of the market that are unregulated. This is like \n     a highway with no cops, no speed limit, and everybody is \n     going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  What is happening with oil? It is interesting, if you take a look at \nthis unbelievable speculation that is going on in the futures market. \nYou have industrial banks in this country, investment banks. They are \nactually buying tanks to store oil. This takes the oil off the market. \nThey are doing this because they believe that the price of oil will be \nhigher in the future. So they take oil off the market now, store it, \nand sell it later for a profit. This creates an upward pressure on \nprice. You now have hedge funds hip deep in the futures markets. They \ndidn't used to be. It used to be that the futures market for oil had a \nrelationship to the supply and demand with respect to oil. There were \nother tensions in various parts of the world that might affect it some, \nbut not like we have seen recently. As is the case in most areas, this \nhas gotten way out of hand. There is no way that current supply-and-\ndemand relationships with oil justify $100 a barrel. It is a futures \nmarket that is propelled by unbelievable speculation in search of \nprofits by a whole range of interests, especially now including hedge \nfunds and investment banks and others.\n\n  The question is, who are the victims of all of this? The victims are \npeople, the people who drive up to the gas pump. The victims on the \nsubprime market are the people who cannot repay a mortgage; and \nsomebody says maybe they should have known better. Maybe so, but when a \nbroker is going to make a $30,000 commission by writing a $1 million \nmortgage and selling over the phone 2 percent interest rates, I am \ntelling you there are a whole lot of folks who get sucked into that.\n  The point here is we face a situation in several areas where there is \na total, complete lack of common sense. There is this little book \nwritten by Robert Fulghum a long while ago that would, in my judgment, \nprovide some benefit to some people. The title of the book is, ``All I \nReally Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten.'' The lessons are not \nunusual. The lessons are: Play fair, don't hit, don't take what is not \nyours, wash your hands, flush--you know, the things I learned in \nkindergarten; the things that are important.\n  We could write a primer on ``All The Things I Really Need To Know I \nLearned In Kindergarten.'' We could write that primer and instantly \npeople would say you can't have an oil futures market that is rampant \nin speculation with hedge funds and others now pushing up the price of \noil having little to do with supply and demand. You can't have a \nmortgage industry in which the mortgage companies decide they are going \nto provide loans to people who cannot afford to repay the loan and make \nvery big profits and lock them in with a prepayment penalty. They are \nall fat and happy and making a massive amount of money. You can't have \nthat without a significant consequence to our economy.\n  What do I suggest? It is simple. Let's sober up a little bit on \nfiscal policy in this administration and this Congress. Maybe we can \nsay to the President: You want $196 billion. OK. You tell us how you \nwant to pay for it. Send us the recommendation, and we will certainly \ntake a look at that. We want to do everything that needs to be done to \nsupport our troops. But a substantial portion is not going to support \nour troops. It is going to support big contractors that have been \nbilking the taxpayer for a long time. We are going to take a hard look \nat that and investigate it and get to the bottom of it.\n  We need to get back on track in trade and fiscal policy. Ignoring it \nmight feel good, but it is not the right thing for the future.\n  With respect to the issue of subprime lending and futures markets, if \nthat doesn't persuade Members of this body there needs to be some \nthoughtful, sensible regulation, then I don't know what will. I chaired \nthe hearings on Enron. It was to my subcommittee that Ken Lay came on \nbehalf of Enron, raised his hand, and took the fifth amendment. Mr. Lay \nis dead. Many of the folks who worked with him at Enron are in prison. \nBut I understand what happened in that scandal. The American public, \nagain, was a victim. They got fleeced. In Enron's case, they were \nmanipulating markets to drive up the cost of electricity on the west \ncoast and bilk people out of billions of dollars. What did it mean? It \nmeant we had to put in place some regulations to prevent that from \nhappening again. What does this mean, the subprime scandal that exists, \nand its impact on the economy? It means we have to put in place some \nregulations to prevent this sort of thing from happening. People have \nprofited in a very unholy way at the expense of a lot of victims across \nthe country.\n  What does it mean when people go up to the gas pump this afternoon \nand pay a substantial amount for a tank of gasoline at a time when the \nprice of oil is running toward $100 a barrel and the futures market is \ndriving that price up, having very little to do with supply and demand \nbut more to do with an orgy of speculation? It means we ought to care \nabout that. It means there ought to be some regulatory oversight.\n  This administration has a lot to answer for, as does the Congress. I \nam pleased to be a part of the majority, and we are working hard to try \nto respond to and deal with these issues. But these issues are not \ngoing to go away. The prosperity of this country's future is at stake. \nWe need to get it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14248-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14248-S14253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY 2007\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, over the past weekend, our Nation observed \nVeterans Day, a day to commemorate the connection between the American \npeople and America's veterans. This connection is something that the \nAmerican people are always aware of at the bottom of their hearts, \nthough it may not always be in the front of our minds as we go about \nour daily lives.\n  We Americans often define ourselves by the freedoms we enjoy. \nAmerica's veterans are men and women who sacrificed some of their own \nfreedoms to serve and defend our Nation. The connection between these \ntwo groups--the defended and the defenders--may not always be visible, \nbut it cannot be denied. Veterans Day gave us the opportunity to recall \nthat connection, to honor those who wore the uniform of our country.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it has been my \nprivilege to work alongside other leaders in answering a simple \nquestion: How do we best honor veterans? Having so recently celebrated \nVeterans Day, I am pleased to report on the committee's work in the \nareas of legislation and oversight to try to answer that question.\n  The Committee on Veterans' Affairs has worked diligently to fulfill \nits oversight and legislative responsibilities, demonstrated in part by \nour hearing and meeting schedule. We have held 40 hearings and \nmeetings, including 7 field hearings, since our organizational meeting \nin January. The committee has heard from 220 witnesses, and reported 4 \nnominees to the Senate, each of whom was later confirmed.\n  At our committee's very first meeting, I discussed my agenda to work \nwith other members to bring the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs together to provide a seamless \ntransition for veterans from DOD to VA. We focused on seamless \ntransition and set an agenda to pursue the issue in the coming year.\n\n[[Page S14249]]\n\nThese actions were taken long before the horrible news reports about \nconditions at Walter Reed shocked the country into action. Our \nforesight positioned the committee, in collaboration with the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, to craft legislation that attacked the flaws \nwithin the DOD and VA systems. I am pleased that our legislative \nresponses were incorporated into the National Defense Authorization \nAct. I look forward to seeing them become law.\n  Two weeks after the organizational meeting, the committee held its \nfirst hearing, which was on VA and DOD cooperation and collaboration. \nWe heard testimony from officials from VA and DOD, as well as the \npersonal stories of veterans who slipped through the cracks during \ntheir transition from military service to veterans status. This would \nbe the first of a number of hearings the committee would hold on VA and \nDOD cooperation and collaboration. Later hearings on this issue focused \non specific areas such as health care, education, information \ntechnology, and benefits.\n  In February, I contacted DOD on behalf of VA's Polytrauma Center \nhealth care providers so as to ensure that VA providers had easy and \nappropriate access to DOD's Joint Patient Tracking Application. This \nmedical information sharing application is important to data sharing \nbetween VA and DOD. I was pleased when DOD responded shortly \nthereafter, providing assurance that they would resume their important \ndata sharing practices.\n  The decision to focus on cooperation and collaboration between DOD \nand VA was made well before news broke on the deplorable conditions at \nWalter Reed. As these news stories moved questions about veterans care \ninto the forefront of America's attention, our committee put our focus \non the total system of care, involving DOD and VA.\n  Shortly after the press revelations of problems at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center, I visited Walter Reed, along with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. On the way back to the Capitol from that visit, we agreed to \nhold an unprecedented joint hearing of the Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committee on the issue of DOD-VA cooperation and collaboration. \nOn April 12, we held that hearing, further pursuing answers both about \nwhat was happening at Walter Reed and how we could fix it and about the \noverall state of the relationship between the two Departments.\n  From that hearing and subsequent work on the problems at Walter Reed \nand elsewhere in both the DOD and VA systems, and how those problems \naffected wounded servicemembers, it was clear that a commonsense \napproach was needed.\n  One specific focus of that effort was on how to reform the DOD \ndisability system so as to promote greater uniformity among the \nservices and between the services and VA. On April 30, I introduced S. \n1252, a bill that would mandate a number of changes to the DOD \ndisability evaluation system, including uniform use of the Veterans \nAffairs rating schedule across the military services, inclusion of all \nconditions which render a member unfit when making a disability rating, \nuniform training of Medical Evaluation Board/Physical Evaluation Board \npersonnel, and accountability by DOD to ensure compliance with \ndisability rating regulations and policies.\n  Just as veterans and servicemembers benefit when VA and DOD work \ntogether, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Committee \non Armed Services saw an opportunity to collaborate on legislative \nsolutions. All of the provisions of S. 1252 were included as part of S. \n1606, the joint SVAC and SASC proposed Dignified Treatment of Wounded \nWarriors Act of 2007, which was later included in the 2008 National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n\n  While demands on VA have dramatically increased over recent years, VA \nfunding has not. To allow the hard working men and women of VA to do \ntheir jobs without having to worry about whether there will be \nsufficient funding, we have sought a substantial increase to VA \nfunding. I am pleased that the funding level in VA's fiscal year 2008 \nappropriations bill amounts to the largest funding increase in the \nhistory of the Department.\n  The appropriations bill also includes significant increases that will \nenable the Veterans Benefits Administration to pay for up to 3,100 new \nfull-time employees. I hope the VBA will use these funds to attack the \ncurrent backlog of veterans' claims aggressively. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to enact this historic and long overdue \nincrease in funding for veterans.\n  In working on the legislative front, the committee has taken a \ncollaborative approach with other Members of the Senate and the House \nof Representatives. Our focus has been on getting good law enacted, \nwhatever the vehicle. I am pleased to report on the committee's \nprogress on many pieces of legislation, some of which have already been \nenacted into law.\n  As we continue to pursue adequate funds to pay for the true cost of \nwar, we must also recognize that the nature of the battles our troops \nare fighting has changed as well. VA health care must be better \nprepared to address traumatic brain injury, the signature wound of the \ncurrent war. To improve VA's diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation \nfor traumatic brain injuries, I introduced S. 1233, the proposed \nTraumatic Brain Injury and Health Programs Improvements Act of 2007. \nThis bill, amended to include a number of other health care provisions, \nwas reported by the committee. In addition, many of the provisions of \nS. 1233 were later incorporated into the Wounded Warriors Act and the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  S. 1233 would increase access to VA health care for combat veterans, \nextending the period of eligibility during which recently released or \ndischarged combat veterans have unfettered access to VA care from 2 to \n5 years. This provision will help ensure that these newest combat \nveterans have more time to identify and deal with invisible wounds, \nsuch as traumatic brain injury and PTSD. Another key provision of the \nbill relating to the treatment of invisible wounds is a requirement \nthat VA provide a servicemember with a mental health evaluation within \n30 days of making such a request.\n  S. 1233 also would enhance care for older veterans already in the VA \nsystem. It would repeal the 2003 VA regulation which barred Priority 8 \nveterans, so-called ``higher-income'' veterans, from enrolling in the \nVA health care system, essentially re-opening the system to these \nveterans. Many issues have been raised this year with regard to access \nto VA care for veterans residing in more rural areas, and S. 1233 \nincludes an entire section aimed at looking at ways to increase access \nfor rural veterans.\n  I am also very proud of the provisions in S. 1233 that seek to expand \nand enhance services for homeless veterans. We all recognize the sad \nreality that veterans suffer disproportionately from homelessness. S. \n1233 would not only increase the resources available to community-based \nentities that provide reintegration services to those who are already \nhomeless, it would also provide supportive services to low-income \nveterans to help prevent homelessness.\n  This bill also contains a significant increase in the travel \nreimbursement benefit paid to certain veterans who are forced to \ncommute long distances to access care at VA facilities. The current \nmileage reimbursement rate is only 11 cents per mile, and this rate has \nnot been increased since 1978. The committee bill would increase the \nrate to 28 cents per mile--a substantial increase and one that will \nhopefully help ease the financial burden for those who have to travel \nsometimes hundreds of miles to get to a VA hospital or clinic.\n  Two other health care bills that I introduced this year are currently \nmoving through the committee process--S. 2160, the proposed Veterans \nPain Care Act of 2007, and S. 2162, the proposed Mental Health \nImprovements Act of 2007. The committee is scheduled to mark up both of \nthese bills, along with two others, tomorrow. I hope to see each of \nthem passed by the end of this year.\n  For too many veterans, returning home from battle will not bring an \nend to conflict. They will return home, but the things they have done \nand seen in combat will follow them. Invisible wounds such as PTSD are \ncomplicated and can manifest themselves in many different ways. Studies \nhave estimated that as many as 1 out of every 5 Iraq\n\n[[Page S14250]]\n\nwar veterans are likely to suffer from readjustment issues. It is clear \nthat action is necessary on the part of Congress to ensure that VA is \nequipped to deal with these issues.\n  In April, the committee held a hearing dedicated to veterans' mental \nhealth concerns and VA's response. We heard very compelling testimony \nfrom witnesses who suffered the consequences of invisible wounds in \ntheir families and their own lives. Randall Omvig spoke of his son's \nsuicide upon returning from Iraq. Tony Bailey spoke of his son's \nstruggle with substance abuse, and of his ultimate death from it. \nPatrick Campbell shared his own experience with PTSD and the \nexperiences of his fellow servicemembers. Their touching and often \npainful stories put human faces on an issue that is to often reduced to \nnumbers.\n\n  The proposed Mental Health Improvements Act is a direct outgrowth of \nthat hearing and the testimony given by those who have suffered with \nmental health issues and by their family members. The bill addresses \nthe immediate needs of veterans by ensuring high quality mental health \nservices at VA facilities and in their communities. The measure also \nseeks to address the plight of veterans who suffer both from PTSD and \nsubstance abuse.\n  S. 2160, the proposed Veterans Pain Care Act of 2007, would enhance \nVA's pain management program. It is estimated that nearly 30 percent of \nAmericans--some 86 million people--suffer from chronic or acute pain \nevery year. A recent study conducted by VA researchers in Connecticut \nfound that nearly 50 percent of veteran patients that are seen at VA \nfacilities reported that they experience pain regularly.\n  While pain increases in severity with age, it is also a growing \nproblem among younger veterans who have been injured in the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Many of these veterans are coming home with \nsevere injuries--often traumatic brain injuries--that require intensive \nrehabilitation. In some cases, younger veterans will have to live with \nthe long-term effects of their injuries, of which pain is a large and \ndebilitating part.\n  Pain management is an area of health care that by many accounts is \nnot yet to up to par, in both the private and public sectors. S. 2160 \nwould standardize VA's pain management program on a national, \nsystemwide level, by requiring VA to establish a pain care initiative \nat every VA health care facility. Every hospital and clinic would be \nrequired to employ a professionally recognized pain assessment tool or \nprocess, and ensure that every patient who is determined to be in \nchronic or acute pain is treated appropriately. The bill also calls for \ncomprehensive research on pain management to improve care for chronic \npain.\n  During this session, I introduced S. 1163, the proposed Blinded \nVeterans Paired Organ Act of 2007, a bill that would offer enhanced \nbenefits to veterans who suffer from service-connected impairment of \nvision. The bill was amended in committee and the language that was \nfavorably reported to the full Senate was inserted into H.R. 797, the \nHouse companion, and passed on November 2. The Senate-passed H.R. 797 \nwould broaden the benefit eligibility requirements for two distinct \ngroups of veterans with impaired vision due to service--those with \nservice-connected blindness in one eye who subsequently suffer loss of \nvision in the other eye later in life and those who receive special \nmonthly compensation for multiple disabilities, including vision \nimpairment.\n  The amended bill also includes a series of provisions that would \nenhance memorial and burial benefits for veterans and private \ncemeteries, including permanently authorizing VA to provide government \nheadstones or markers for the privately marked graves of veterans \ninterred at private cemeteries; instructing VA to design a medallion or \nother device to signify a decedent's veteran status, to be placed on a \nprivately purchased headstone or marker, as an alternative to a \nGovernment-Furnished headstone or marker; extending the time limit for \nStates to be reimbursed for the unclaimed remains of veterans; and \nauthorizing $5 million for operational and maintenance expenses at \nState cemeteries. The provisions in the bill are fully paid for through \nlegislative repeal of a Court of Veterans Appeals decision which \ninappropriately extended a needs-based benefit to a population that \nCongress did not intend to receive it.\n  Because inflation erodes the value of the dollar, Congress is \nresponsible for adjusting compensation for service-connected \ndisabilities. This year I sponsored S. 423, the proposed Veterans' \nCompensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2007. The veterans' COLA \nlegislation ensures that the purchasing power of veterans' benefits, \nincluding compensation for veterans and assistance for their survivors, \nis maintained. This annual COLA is done in recognition of the Nation's \ngratitude towards veterans young and old for their service and \nsacrifices.\n  As the sponsor of the Senate version of this bill, I was pleased to \nsupport the passage of the House companion, H.R. 1284. I applaud \nCongress and the President for their work in making it law as of \nMonday, November 5, 2007. I hope veterans, including the 17,000 \nrecipients of compensation who are served by VA's Honolulu Regional \nOffice, benefit from this demonstration of our appreciation.\n  Oversight investigations carried out by committee staff uncovered \nconcerns in the veterans' benefits system as well. To improve the \nbenefits system, the committee reported S. 1315, the proposed Veterans' \nBenefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill would improve veterans' \nlife insurance, adaptable housing, education benefits, and provide the \ncommittee with more oversight data. It would also address a 60-year \nwrong that is still being done to Filipino veterans who served under \nthe U.S. Armed Forces during World War II.\n  In the years since the end of the Second World War, Filipino veterans \nand their advocates, especially my distinguished colleague, Senator \nInouye, have worked tirelessly to secure these veterans the status they \nwere promised when they agreed to fight under U.S. command in defense \nof their homeland and to protect U.S. interests in the region.\n  This bill would also more than double the maximum amount of Veterans \nMortgage Life Insurance that a service-connected disabled veteran may \npurchase from $90,000 to $200,000. The VMLI program was established in \n1971 and is available to those service-connected disabled veterans who \nhave received specially adapted housing grants from VA. In the event of \nthe veteran's death, the veteran's family is protected because VA will \npay the balance of the mortgage owed up to the maximum amount of \ninsurance purchased.\n  The measure would also establish a new program of insurance for \nservice-connected disabled veterans that would provide up to a maximum \nof $50,000 in level premium term life insurance coverage. This new \nprogram would be available to service-connected disabled veterans who \nare less than 65 years of age at the time of application. Under the new \nprogram, eligible service-connected veterans would be able to purchase, \nin increments of $10,000, up to a maximum amount of $50,000 in \ninsurance.\n  S. 1315 would also increase the amount of supplemental life insurance \navailable to totally disabled veterans by 50 percent, from $20,000 to \n$30,000. This provision stems from S. 643, the proposed Disabled \nVeterans Insurance Act of 2007, which I introduced in February of this \nyear. Many totally disabled veterans find it difficult to obtain \ncommercial life insurance. This legislation will give totally disabled \nveterans better life insurance, a small measure of support for veterans \nwho sacrificed so much.\n  In addition, this bill would expand eligibility for retroactive \nbenefits from traumatic injury protection coverage under \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance. This insurance program went into \neffect on December 1, 2005. All insured servicemembers under SGLI from \nthat point forward were covered under traumatic injury protection \nregardless of where their injuries occur. However, individuals \nsustaining traumatic injuries between October 7, 2001, and November 30, \n2005, which were not incurred as a direct result of Operations Enduring \nor Iraqi Freedom, are not eligible for a retroactive payment under the \ntraumatic injury protection program. S. 1315 would expand eligibility \nto these individuals.\n\n[[Page S14251]]\n\n  The reported bill would allow for home improvements for totally \ndisabled servicemembers prior to release from active duty. This \nprovision is very important because many servicemembers return home to \nfinish their rehabilitation and recuperation prior to discharge from \nthe military. Their homes need to be adapted so that they can live \ncomfortably and independently.\n  S. 1315 also contains a number of provisions derived from S. 1215 \nwhich I introduced on April 25 that would make four small but necessary \nchanges in existing laws relating to education and employment. First, \nit would restore the funding cap on the amount of funding available for \nState Approving Agencies to the fiscal year 2007 level of $19 million. \nWithout this restoration, these entities that assist VA in approving \nprograms of education would be facing a reduction of more than 30 \npercent beginning in fiscal year 2008. It is particularly important for \nSAAs to have adequate resources as more veterans return to civilian \nlife and begin to use their educational benefits.\n  Second, it would update the special unemployment study required to be \nsubmitted by the Secretary of Labor to the Congress by requiring that \nit cover veterans of Post 9/11 Global Operations. It would also require \nthe report to be submitted on an annual, rather than a biennial, basis. \nBy updating this report, we will have more data available to us on more \nrecent groups of veterans those who served and are serving in the Gulf \nWar and Post 9/11 Global Operations. This should better help us assess \nthe needs of current veterans entering the work force and develop \nappropriate responses.\n  Third, the bill would extend for 2 years a temporary increase in the \nmonthly educational assistance allowance for apprenticeship or other \non-the-job training. Eliminating the temporary increase would mean a \nmonthly benefit rate cut on veterans enrolled in this type of training \nand remove marketable incentive to encourage individuals to accept \ntrainee positions they might not otherwise consider.\n  Finally, the bill would provide for a waiver of the residency \nrequirement for State veterans' employment and training directors. By \ngiving the Secretary of Labor the ability to waive the 2-year residency \nrequirement, this provision would help ensure that the best qualified \nindividuals from any state may be considered for SDVET vacancies.\n  Both S. 1233 and S. 1315 were reported to the Senate in late August \nand have been pending floor action ever since. It is most unfortunate \nthat we have been unable to reach agreement to proceed to their \nconsideration, due in part to an abrupt and unexpected change in the \nminority committee leadership. Late last week, just days before \nVeterans Day, the other side of the aisle affirmatively blocked \nconsideration of this important legislation that has the support of a \nmajority of the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Let me be \nclear--I do not expect all Members to support or agree with these \nbills, only to allow for their consideration by the full Senate. If \nmembers have amendments to offer, bring them forward. We can then craft \nan agreement under which the Senate might do its work and debate these \nbills.\n\n  One final legislative item that I wish to mention--recently, I worked \nwith my colleague Senator Webb on a matter of symbolic and real \nimportance to servicemen and women as well as to veterans. Concerned \nthat the Department of the Army was in a rush to replace the Tomb of \nthe Unknown at Arlington National Cemetery, I introduced an amendment \nto the National Defense Authorization Act requiring the Army to prepare \na comprehensive report for Congress before any further action could be \ntaken. I am hopeful that this provision will be in the final agreement \non the NDAA and look forward to the report, and its recommendations on \nhow to best steward this national treasure.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am mindful \nof the employment issues facing veterans, members of the Guard and \nReserves, and their families as they seek to move from the military to \nthe civilian workforce. Making this transition is never easy, and for \nyounger veterans it can be particularly difficult. For members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves, returning to a job they previously held \nmay be challenging for a variety of reasons. For family members, the \nuncertainty of multiple and extended deployments poses different \nobstacles. Finally, the obstacles facing those who are disabled during \ntheir service can sometimes seem overwhelming. The needs of these \nindividuals deserve our utmost attention and resources.\n  The committee has held two oversight hearings on employment issues \nthis session. The more recent of the two hearings focused specifically \non the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of \n1994, or USERRA. As our troops are returning home from battle, many of \nthem seek to return to the jobs that they held prior to their military \nservice, particularly those serving in Guard and Reserve units. I must \nadmit to being particularly upset at the volume of USERRA claims \nrelated to Federal service. It is simply wrong that individuals who \nwere sent to war by their government should, upon their return, be put \nin the position of having to do battle with that same government in \norder to regain their jobs and benefits.\n  It is well known that veterans make good employees. Despite the \nchallenges many face, veterans across the country are working and \nexcelling in the labor force. They know how to work and they bring with \nthem a wealth of expertise and experience. I believe the employment \ndata supports my belief since rates of unemployment for veterans \ngenerally are lower than their nonveteran counterpart. However, the \nrate of unemployment for younger veterans and those recently separated \nfrom active duty tends to be higher than their nonveteran peers. I \npledge to continue to pursue these issues aggressively in the months \nahead.\n  The issues regarding veterans' educational benefits are especially \nimportant to me. Having attended college at the University of Hawaii \nunder the original World War II GI bill, I know the value of this \nimportant benefit first hand.\n  The complexity and the importance of the issues surrounding the \nvarious education assistance programs administered by VA have been \nheard at two hearings this session. I plan to build off of the findings \nfrom both hearings for the committee's future work in this area. \nEducational assistance benefit has an important role in terms of a \nreadjustment benefit for returning veterans and servicemembers. \nProperly tailored, these same benefits form an important keystone in \nrecruiting and retaining high caliber young men and women in the Armed \nForces. The balance between these twin goals is very complex and needs \ncareful examination.\n  I am concerned that the current structure of benefits has some flaws. \nIt is disturbing to me that servicemembers who are in the line of fire \nand who place their own safety in jeopardy in service to our country \nhave to pay for their educational benefits. It is also disturbing that \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve who complete multiple deployments in \ncombat situations run the risk of having no educational benefits \navailable to them.\n  I do not expect to see a quick or easy answer for veterans' education \nbenefits reform. I believe we will need to build a foundation for \ncooperation, compromise and consensus building. That will take some \ntime. But I believe this process has begun, and that by working \ntogether, we will be able to develop something that is really \nmeaningful to veterans, their families, and their futures.\n  As I noted earlier, the committee held seven field hearings over the \nyear. The first, chaired by Senator Brown, was held on May 29, 2007, in \nNew Philadelphia, OH, and focused on the issues facing veterans in the \nrural areas of Appalachia. Two months later, the committee held its \nsecond field hearing, chaired by Senator Testor, again focusing on the \nneeds of rural veterans. This hearing was held on July 21, 2007, in \nGreat Falls, MT. These hearings, along with the insights of our \ncommittee members, enabled the committee to develop and mark up \nlegislation to address certain issues facing rural veterans.\n  On August 17, 2007, Senator Murray chaired a field hearing in Tacoma, \nWA. The hearing focused on the mental health care services available to \nveterans and servicemembers in the State of Washington.\n\n[[Page S14252]]\n\n  In August, I chaired a series of field hearings in my home State of \nHawaii, on the islands of Maui, Oahu, and the Big Island. These \nhearings brought high-ranking VA officials from Washington, DC, to \nexamine the state of VA services for Hawaii's veterans and returning \nservicemembers.\n  On August 28, 2007, the committee held a field hearing in Augusta, \nGA, on cooperation and collaboration between VA and DOD, chaired by \nSenator Isakson. The specific focus of the hearing was on VA and DOD \ncare for wounded servicemembers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  The committee has also carried out aggressive oversight activity \nduring this session. Since January, the majority staff has conducted 95 \ndays of oversight involving 28 trips to 18 states as well as to Korea, \nGuam and American Samoa. Oversight investigations have included visits \nto nine separate VA regional offices.\n  During these nine visits, oversight staff reviewed a total of 119 \nindividual veteran claim files, including 45 claim files for members of \nthe National Guard and various Reserve units. Claims were selected for \nreview based upon claims for service-connected disability due to \ntraumatic brain injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, or \nmusculoskeletal conditions. In particular, the reviews were conducted \nto identify any systemic problems impeding the fair and efficient \nadjudication of veterans' claims.\n  On a national level, one of the most critical issues identified by \nthe claims review was a VA regulation which resulted in the denial of a \nrating higher than 10 percent for almost all traumatic brain injuries, \nor TBI, claims. As noted earlier, TBI has been described as a signature \nwound of the current conflicts. Medical evidence supports the view that \nsevere long-term consequences can result from blast injuries \ninvolving improvised explosive devices, or IED, such as those used in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Despite this, VA adjudicators believed that they \ncould not authorize a rating in excess of 10 percent, or $115 per \nmonth, because of a current VA regulation.\n\n  Upon learning of this problem, I contacted VA's Under Secretary for \nBenefits, Daniel Cooper, to ask why veterans with migraine headaches \nwere eligible for higher disability ratings than combat veterans with \nTBI. I was pleased when Under Secretary Cooper informed me that VA \nadjudicators have been instructed to stop limiting ratings to 10 \npercent if not warranted. However, because Under Secretary Cooper's \ninstruction is not binding upon the Board of Veterans Appeals or the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, I also wrote to the \nActing Secretary for Veterans Affairs, Gordon Mansfield, to ask that \nthe ``10 percent and no more'' regulation be rescinded. I understand \nthat VA is now working on new regulations for the adjunction of TBI \nclaims which will hopefully resolve this matter. I will continue to \nmonitor these claims and VA's actions.\n  In addition to the restrictive instruction in the rating schedule, it \nappears that neither the military services nor VA are providing \ncomprehensive and thorough evaluations of veterans with mild and \nmoderate TBI. While veterans who are being treated at polytrauma \ncenters appear to be getting appropriate diagnosis and treatment, this \nis not true for veterans with significant, but less severe injuries. I \nbelieve that it is imperative that veterans with silent wounds, such as \nmild and moderate TBI have a comprehensive evaluation of their signs \nand symptoms by appropriate medical specialists. New data, such as the \nrecently released information from VA that nearly 6 percent of the \nveterans from Iraq and Afghanistan screened have sustained traumatic \nbrain injuries, adds to the importance of legislation that improves \nVA's ability to respond aggressively.\n  Review of service medical records for claims involving PTSD indicated \npoor follow-up, assessment and referral of servicemembers who endorsed \nsymptoms of PTSD on postdeployment surveys. This matter has been noted \nby the GAO and others. In some cases, veterans were discharged for a \n``personality disorder'' which was not manifested prior to combat \nexposure and with no evaluation of classic PTSD symptoms. In other \ncases, veterans with significant psychiatric symptoms were not \nconsidered for a military disability retirement, but were awarded \nbenefits by VA upon discharge.\n  The committee's oversight investigations indicate that VA generally \ndid a better assessment of claims for service-connected PTSD than the \nmilitary services. However, for some disorders, VA will not grant \nservice-connection for the small number of veterans who were diagnosed \nwith PTSD during military service without independent verification of \nthe stressor which gave rise to the diagnosis by military doctors. Some \nveterans who served in Iraq, but did not receive a medal acknowledging \ntheir participation in combat, have experienced difficulty establishing \ntheir ``personal participation in combat'' in order to validate the \nexistence of a combat stressor.\n  Under current law, veterans who allege disabilities related to their \ncombat experience may prove their claim without presentation of \nofficial military documents. In order to clarify this issue and provide \ncombat veterans with the benefits intended, I recently introduced S. \n2309, the proposed Compensation for Combat Veterans Act. This bill \nwould provide that service in a combat zone, recognized as such under \nthe Internal Revenue Code, shall be sufficient proof that the veteran \nengaged in combat for purposes of the relaxed evidentiary requirement. \nI hope that we will be able to address this issue in the coming months.\n  There is no question that the Guard and Reserve have experienced \ndifficulties due to our current combat engagements, in a fashion quite \nsimilar to branches such as the Army and Marine Corps. There is some \nconcern that members of the National Guard and Reserve units receive \nless favorable consideration of their service-connected claims than \nmembers of the Armed Forces. While oversight investigations did not \nsubstantiate allegations of less favorable treatment for Guard and \nReserve claimants, other issues may require further analysis. Many \nregional office staff reported significant difficulties in obtaining \ncopies of the medical records of members of the Guard and Reserve. As a \nresult, I wrote to the National Guard Bureau to express my deep concern \nabout a policy that I had been told exists in some states that requires \nNational Guard members to sign a release form before their Service \nMedical Records can be shared with VA for purposes of adjudicating a \nclaim for compensation benefits. Acting upon my request, the National \nGuard Bureau sent guidance to the field that removes the requirement \nthat servicemembers sign release forms to have their records provided \nto VA.\n  VA cannot be expected to end the benefits backlog if it lacks the \nstaff to adjudicate veterans claims. While VA froze hiring in this \narea, there has been an increase in the number and complexity of claims \nreceived. As a consequence, the backlog has ballooned beyond already \ndisconcerting levels. Although the infusion of additional monies for \nstaff should improve the situation, some offices have too few \nexperienced staff compared to the number of new hires. Oversight \nstudies have found that less experienced staff is more likely to make \nerrors on veterans' claims.\n  In some cases, service medical records are maintained in an \nelectronic format and are not provided to VA adjudicators in any form. \nIn other cases, medical reports are scanned into the Veterans Health \nAdministration electronic records, but are not able to be viewed by VA \nadjudicators who use a CAPRI system to access VHA records. I have \nquestioned VA about the need to make these records available to VBA and \nam awaiting a response.\n  While the committee does much direct oversight, as chairman, I also \nrely on the VA's inspector general. Indeed, the IG has consistently \nserved as the committee's right hand in the execution of our oversight \nresponsibilities. In the last year alone, the IG has provided us with a \nnumber of professional inquests and reports on issues of critical \nimportance to veterans' health care. In the areas of traumatic brain \ninjury, mental health, and substance abuse, among others, the IG has \nidentified the problems and solutions with an insightfulness that few \ncan match. The IG has also responded to my investigation requests in an \nefficient and collegial manner. The IG is, without question, the \ncentral gear in VA's internal\n\n[[Page S14253]]\n\ncontrols and quality assurance mechanism.\n  All American's have a role to play in honoring veterans. Ordinary \ncitizens give in extraordinary ways, such as volunteering at VA \nhospitals and VA shelters, and supporting local Veterans Service \nOrganizations. For those of us who serve in Congress, we have a special \nprivilege and responsibility to honor veterans by ensuring that they \nreceive the benefits and care they have earned through service. This \nCongress has done much for veterans already, but there is more to be \ndone.\n  The Committee on Veterans' Affairs will continue to do its share \nthroughout this Congress. To name just two items of pending business, \nwe will hold a markup tomorrow on pending legislation, including a bill \nthat is designed to improve significantly VA's programs which address \nthe mental health needs of veterans, especially those recently returned \nfrom combat, and second, the Committee is preparing to consider the \nnomination of Dr. James Peake to become Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  I close with this thought: On the battlefield, one never leaves \nbehind a fallen comrade. Similarly, veterans should never be left \nbehind by a system designed to care for and honor them. We cannot stand \nby while veterans who have fought for our country have to fight to get \nthe care and benefits they have earned through their service. The \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs will respond to whatever challenges may \narise in our work on behalf of those who rose up to defend and serve \nour Nation. To our veterans: Our thoughts, prayers, gratitude, honor \nand pride are with you, not only on Veterans Day, but always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14253-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, this Senate deliberated and voted \non the nomination of Judge Mukasey for the position of Attorney General \nof the United States. I opposed that nomination, and I believe it is \nappropriate to indicate formally and officially and publicly my \nconcerns and my rationale for this vote.\n  This was not a decision that was made lightly. The Constitution gives \nthe President the unfettered right to submit nominees to the Senate, \nbut the Constitution also gives the Senate not only the right but the \nobligation to provide advice and consent on such nominations.\n  We do not name a President's Cabinet, but it does not mean we are \nmerely rubberstamps for his proposals. Senatorial consent must rest on \na careful review of a nominee's record and a thoughtful analysis of a \nnominees's ability to serve not just the President but the American \npeople.\n  As I have said in the past, unlike other Cabinet positions, the \nAttorney General has a very special role--decisively poised at the \njuncture between the executive branch and the judicial branch. In \naddition to being a member of the President's Cabinet, the Attorney \nGeneral is also an officer of the Federal courts and the chief enforcer \nof laws enacted by Congress.\n  He is, in effect, the people's lawyer, responsible for fully, fairly, \nand vigorously enforcing our Nation's laws and the Constitution for the \ngood of all Americans.\n  Although I believe Judge Mukasey to be an intellectually gifted and \nlegally skilled individual, I am very concerned about his ability to \nnot just enforce the letter of the law but also to recognize and to \ncarry out the true spirit of the law.\n  Frankly, I found Judge Mukasey's lawyerly responses to questions \nregarding the legality of various interrogation techniques, in \nparticular waterboarding, evasive and, frankly, disturbing.\n  Waterboarding is not a new technique, and it is clearly illegal. As \nfour former Judge Advocates General of the military services recently \nwrote to Senator Leahy, in their words:\n\n       In the course of the Senate Judiciary Committee's \n     consideration of President Bush's nominee for the post of \n     Attorney General, there has been much discussion, but little \n     clarity, about the legality of ``waterboarding'' under United \n     States and international law. We write because this issue \n     above all demands clarity: Waterboarding is inhumane, it is \n     torture, and it is illegal.\n\n  These gentlemen have devoted themselves to their country, as soldiers \nand sailors and aviators, and also as attorneys. At the crux of their \nservice was the realization that what we espoused, what we stood for, \nwould also be the standard we would claim for American soldiers and \naviators and sailors and marines if they were in the hands of hostile \nforces. It is clear in their eyes--and should be clear in our eyes--\nthat waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture, and it is illegal.\n  It is illegal under the Geneva Conventions, under U.S. laws, and the \nArmy Field Manual. The U.S. Government has repeatedly condemned the use \nof water torture and has severely punished those who have applied it \nagainst our forces.\n  As Evan Wallach--a judge in the U.S. Court of International Trade and \na former JAG who trained soldiers on their legal obligations--wrote in \nan opinion piece in the Washington Post, it was for such activities as \nwaterboarding that members of Japan's military and Government elite \nwere convicted of torture in the Tokyo war crimes trials.\n  The law is clear about this horrifying interrogation technique. \nWaterboarding is illegal torture and, to suggest otherwise, damages the \nvery fabric of international principle and more importantly, of what we \nwould claim and demand for our own soldiers and sailors and marines.\n  Now, Judge Mukasey was given several opportunities to clearly state \nthat waterboarding is illegal. Instead, he went through a lengthy legal \nanalysis regarding how he might determine if a certain interrogation \ntechnique was legal and then told us that if Congress actually wrote a \nlaw stating that a particular technique is illegal, he would follow the \nlaw. I found the last declaration almost nonsensical. This is the \nminimum requirement we would expect of any citizen of this country, \nthat if we passed a law, they would follow the law.\n  I think we expect much more from the Attorney General. We expect him \nto be a moral compass as well as a wise legal advisor. We expect he \nwould be able to conclude, as these other experts and as our history \nhas shown, that this technique is indeed illegal. We need an Attorney \nGeneral who has the ability to both lead the Department of Justice and \nto tell the President when he is crossing his boundaries. We do not \nneed a legal enabler to the President. We need an Attorney General who \nwill stand up for his obligation to the Constitution, and make this his \nforemost obligation, rather than his obligation to the President.\n  Not definitively stating that a technique such as waterboarding is \nillegal demonstrates to me that Judge Mukasey does not have those \nqualities we need in an Attorney General. As we learned from Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales, we need someone who is willing to stand up to the \nPresident instead of helping the President negotiate around either the \nletter or the spirit of the Constitution.\n\n  This is not just an academic exercise. If the question of whether \nwaterboarding is illegal torture was asked of the parents of American \nsoldiers, their answer would be quite\n\n[[Page S14254]]\n\nclear: Of course, it is. If it was applied to the spouse or the loved \none of a soldier--their answer would be: Of course, it is. I think \nthose people are as expert as Judge Mukasey and certainly much more \ncandid.\n  I also think we have risked a great deal in the administration's \nembrace of these techniques because today, as we look around the world, \nthere are many nations that do not even need that kind of suggestion to \nembark on the torture of their own citizens. The Burmas of the world \nand other countries, they will use what we say and do as justification \nfor what they might want to do. I think we have lost the moral high \nground during this whole exercise going back several years.\n  Finally, I would like to mention my concerns about Judge Mukasey's \nresponses to questions regarding executive power. His responses to \nthese questions did nothing to reassure me. In fact, I now believe that \nJudge Mukasey believes that even a constitutional statute could become \nunconstitutional if its application constrains the so-called \nconstitutional authority of the President.\n  As we all know, the genius of our Founding Fathers was not to allow \npower to be concentrated in the hands of the few. Indeed, they were \nparticularly concerned about a concentration of power in the hands of \nthe President.\n  Although they made the President the Chief Executive Officer of our \nGovernment and the Commander in Chief, the Founding Fathers constrained \nthe President through the very structure of our Government, through \nboth law and treaty. The Attorney General has a duty not just to serve \nthe President but also to support, protect, and defend the \nConstitution.\n  I did not vote in support of Alberto Gonzales's nomination to be \nAttorney General because I was concerned about his ability to serve \nmore than the President--a concern that has been borne out by the \nevents over the last several months. It is largely because of his \nactions we are in the quandary we are in today with respect to torture \nand so many other issues.\n  Instead of protecting our Nation's Constitution and upholding our \nlaws, he engaged in actions that damaged our Nation's core values and \nput our citizens' rights at risk both here and abroad.\n  Given the extreme politicization of the Department of Justice, and \nthe demoralization that has followed in his wake, I believe our Nation \nneeds an Attorney General who can help lead us like a beacon of light \nand help right our country's moral compass as an example again for the \nrest of the world.\n  I do not think Judge Mukasey met that standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We have the farm bill before us. We have been trying for a week to do \namendments on the bill. The Republicans have said that because this \nbill is being handled in such an unusual procedural way, they are not \ngoing to let us move forward on this bill.\n  This bill is being handled similar to every farm bill in the last 30 \nyears. In that entire period, there has only been one time that a \nnongermane amendment was offered, and that was on the last farm bill \nwhen Senator Kyl offered an amendment dealing with the estate tax. It \nwas a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That is it.\n  So for the minority to cry about this is simply that they are crying \nabout something there is no reason to cry about. We want to move this \nbill. I had a conversation this morning right over here on the floor \nwith the distinguished Republican leader and the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Saxby Chambliss. At that time, as I understood the \nconversation, the Republicans had 10 amendments they wanted to do. \nLet's look at them. We have some we want to do. Let's pare them off, \nset very short time limits on them, and move this bill.\n  This is an important bill. If this bill does not move forward--a bill \nthat is being treated similar to every other farm bill in recent \nhistory--the reason it is not going forward is the Republicans. If they \ndo not want a farm bill, why don't they say so. They can explain to all \nthe farm organizations around the country that they did not want a farm \nbill, they wanted us to extend what is now in existence. If that is \nwhat they want, why don't they say so?\n  It is unfortunate we have been unable to move forward on these \namendments. The first amendment pending is a bipartisan amendment \noffered by Senator Dorgan. It is a good amendment. It is one that \nshould be debated and voted on. Another amendment is a complete \nsubstitute--that is my understanding--and Senator Lugar and Senator \nLautenberg want to do that amendment. Let's debate it, find out what \nthe will of the Senate is, and move on. But to be in this position is \nreally unfair to farm State Senators, to farmers and ranchers, to the \nSenate, and to our country. If you are unwilling to fight, just say so. \nIf you don't want this bill to come forward, just tell us that. Don't \nplay these games that they are not treating us right procedurally. This \nis the way this bill is always handled.\n\n  So I just think it is something we need to do. It is an important \npiece of legislation. The committee, on a bipartisan basis, reported \nthis bill out with an overwhelming vote. This is not a Democratic bill; \nit is a bill reported out by the Agriculture Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis. So I hope this afternoon we can get some work done on the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend, the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank our majority leader for all the support he has \ngiven us in getting this bill through even when we worked in committee \nand working with the Finance Committee to make sure we had the \nnecessary money to meet our obligations and bringing it to the floor in \na timely manner. We had all last week; we couldn't get anything done. \nWe have this week before we go home for the Thanksgiving break. We \ncould finish this bill, I say to our leader, we could finish this bill \nif we could just get the other side to agree to start the process.\n  We have an amendment, I say to the leader, before us which we could \ndebate. We could even put a time limit on it. We have another amendment \non which we could put a time limit. We could get two or three or four \namendments done today. But, I say to the leader, I am very frustrated \nthat we have the farm bill out here, we are ready to go--we have been \nready for some time--there are amendments filed, and we would like to \nget started on it, but we can't until the minority leader agrees to \nmove ahead and says we can bring up some of these amendments and move \nahead on them. I just hope we don't waste another whole day.\n\n[[Page S14255]]\n\n  I ask the leader, is there any way we can get the other side to kind \nof help move us along? I have talked to my ranking member, Senator \nChambliss. He wants to move ahead. He has the desire, as I do. As the \nleader pointed out, this bill came out of committee on a bipartisan \nvote. There are going to be amendments, and I may support some and not \nothers, and I am sure my ranking member will support some and not \nothers, but that is the amendment process. I think we have a good bill \nthat is going to wind up getting a lot of support on the Senate floor, \nand the sooner we get to it, the better off we are.\n  So I am just kind of perplexed, I guess, as to why the minority \nleader won't let us move ahead or why we can't get some amendments and \ntime agreements.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend that we have, as I \nunderstand it, 22 amendments upon which the 2 managers have agreed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. We could take care of those very quickly. There are \namendments that, in the minds of the managers, improve the bill. We \nshould get those done. We are unable to move on anything.\n  The calendar dictates a lot of what happens here in Washington in \nCongress. We have a limited amount of time. We have 3 very short weeks \nwhen we come back after Thanksgiving before Christmas. I say to my \nfriends, we are not going to have time to work on the farm bill when we \ncome back after Christmas. We don't have time. We have to take care of \nall of our appropriations matters. The funding for this Government runs \nout on December 14. We have some must-do things that run out at the end \nof this year. So the record should be spread with the fact that Senate \nDemocrats have been willing and terribly interested in moving this farm \nbill. If it doesn't go forward, the blame is at the doorstep of my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  We are in the majority. We Democrats are in the majority, but it is a \nslim majority. The way the Senate operates, the Republicans can stop us \nfrom doing a lot--not everything but a lot. But I would bet, if there \nwere a fair vote and not some arm-flexing exercise, that a vast \nmajority of Democrats and Republicans want this farm bill to move \nforward. Are they asking me--is this what they are asking--to file \ncloture on this bill so we can have a cloture vote on it Thursday? Is \nthat what they want? Is that what we are going to be relegated to, \nfiling cloture on this bill without having heard a single amendment? \nAnd why? Because they won't let us. Is that what they want? If cloture \nfails--I know it will fail, not because of Democrats but because of \nRepublicans. We know we have broken records here in this year of this \nsession of Congress by having to file cloture 52 times. Only one of \nthose cloture motions was a bipartisan effort. We did it once. That is \nall. So I am very disappointed because I don't see what the Republicans \nare going to gain.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my leader, if he will yield \nagain, I think we have set a record in committee. In a day and a half, \nwe had a comprehensive, 5-year farm bill passed--in a day and a half. I \ndon't think that has ever been done.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, that was the culmination \nof weeks and weeks----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Months.\n  Mr. REID. Of meetings between Democrats and Republicans to move this \nbill along.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. I have great admiration for the Agriculture Committee for \ngetting a bill out of that committee on a bipartisan basis. There are \npeople who want very badly to try to improve this bill, but nothing \nwill be done. It is Tuesday. We have this bridge thing coming, dealing \nwith the Iraq war, tomorrow. Time is wasting. I am beginning to have my \ndoubts, I say to everyone here, because of the intransigence of the \nRepublicans, that we can do a farm bill.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope we can overcome that because, as the leader said, \nwe had great agreement in committee. He is right. We worked weeks and \nweeks and weeks in meetings with people in getting it all together, and \nin a day and a half we got it through on a unanimous vote--not one \ndissenting vote. So we have a good bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, on the floor right now \nare farm State Senators--Arkansas, Georgia, North Dakota, North Dakota, \nIowa--and in the back of the room is a State that does a lot of \nagricultural products, the State of New York. Now, as I look around \nthis room, Senator Dorgan is an example. Senator Dorgan's amendment is \npending--a bipartisan amendment. He supports this bill. It came out of \ncommittee, but he thinks it would be an improvement. Why shouldn't he \nhave an opportunity to offer that amendment and have a debate on it? \nThat is what this is all about. It is unfair to everyone concerned, as \nI have mentioned before, that we are not able to move on this important \npiece of legislation. I am from the State of Nevada. We grow alfalfa. \nWe are the largest white onion producer in America. We grow garlic but \nmostly alfalfa and white onions. This bill is important to those \nfarmers out there. There are things from which they will benefit. I \njust think it is too bad we can't move forward. This is a bill----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Oh, I am sorry. And Kentucky grows things too.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would just say to my friend, the majority leader, I \nam on the Agriculture Committee. I am from a farm State. I want a farm \nbill. We have been discussing how to go forward. If I may be so bold to \nsuggest--I know Senator Chambliss and Senator Harkin have been working \non a list of amendments. I think we ought to see if we can lock in a \nlist. It will be bigger than we would like, but that is the way it \nalways starts. Most of those will go away in one way or another, but at \nleast it would help define the universe. I think that is achievable, \nhopefully sometime this afternoon, and it will allow us to get started. \nThat is what I would recommend.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it would be untoward on the Senate floor to \nwalk over and hug the Republican leader, but that is what I feel like \ndoing. I agree with him 100 percent. I think we should try to get a \nnumber of amendments locked in, whether it is 5 or 50, whatever it is. \nI think we should get it done and start moving on this bill.\n  I have been, as my friend from Kentucky knows, in a minority position \nmore than I would like to admit here in the Senate as the minority \nDemocratic leader. I understand he has certain things to do within his \ncaucus. Whatever was needed to be proven has been proven. Let's move \nforward on this bill as the Republican leader has outlined. We greet \nhis suggestion with open arms.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, would the leader yield just one more time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to ask the minority leader if during this \ntime we are trying to work out a set number of amendments, we know \nthere are two or three amendments that are absolutely going to be \noffered. One is the one we are on right now. Then there is another one \nwith I think Senators Lugar and Lautenberg. I am just wondering if we \ncould get time agreements on those.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, let's take one step at a time. He \nhas made an offer, and let's see what we can do. He has indicated--the \nranking member of the committee is here, you are here, and we will work \non that and see if we can get something done in the next little bit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the majority leader. I think that is a good \nway to go forward, and we will work on it this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me just say while the leadership is \nhere, we appreciate their assistance in moving this bill. Senator \nHarkin, Senator Conrad, and I have taken our list of amendments we have \nout there and we are working through them to try to get down to a \nreasonable number. One problem, frankly, we are having--and I think \nmaybe on the other side too--is we keep having people come forward with \namendments. I would simply say to colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nthat we are going to reach a limit with these amendments, and if you \nhave an amendment, we need to know about it now so we can negotiate and \ndeliberate in good faith relative to the number of\n\n[[Page S14256]]\n\namendments that are going to be on this list so that we can pare those \namendments down to a reasonable number.\n  I thank the leadership for working with us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The important point here is that I think everyone on the \nfloor wants to get this bill passed, and while there will be some \namendments, my hope and my expectation--I have one amendment--would be \nthat we would relatively easily get time agreements, have a reasonable \nnumber of amendments with time agreements. I think there should be a \nlot of cooperation on the floor because I think all of us want what you \nwant, and that is to get a piece of legislation passed. This was not \neasy to get out of the committee. I support this bill. I am going to \nsupport a couple of amendments here and there, but by and large I think \nwe are on the right track, and I appreciate hearing the words of the \nminority leader today on this subject because we need to get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I am enormously relieved to \nhear what has been discussed, and I hope in the next few moments that \nwe could agree, first of all, on amendments that have to be voted on \nfor both sides, No. 1; No. 2, that we would agree on time limits, and \nit is very clear that unless the time for the debate on amendments that \nmust be voted on is limited to 1 hour apiece, on average--some could be \na little more, some could be a little less, but if we don't on average \nhave time agreements of 1 hour or less, we cannot finish the work this \nweek; and finally, that we agree to an order. I have seen colleagues \nwho are very interested in some certainty. For example, if we could do \nGrassley-Dorgan in an hour and a half and then go to Lugar-Lautenberg \nfor an hour and a half to at least begin the process, that would be \nenormously helpful, and then establish a list in order with time \nagreements.\n  I wanted to take a moment to respond, as leadership is working on \nthat kind of proposal, to an article that appeared in the Washington \nPost this morning that I thought was not telling the whole story about \nthis farm bill. They have asserted that there is all this new spending \nin the farm bill. They focus just on the spending side of the ledger; \nthey didn't focus at all on how we pay for it.\n  I want to indicate that it is true that there are increases in this \nbill. We have increased spending on nutrition by $5.3 billion; on \nconservation, we have increased resources by $4.5 billion; on energy, \nby $1.1 billion and then an additional $1.4 billion from the Finance \nCommittee, for a total increase in energy of $2.5 billion.\n  Where did we find the resources for those additional investments? \nWell, that is the uses on this side, and the sources are on this side. \nOver one-third of the money came out of the commodity programs. \nCommodity programs have been reduced. They have been reduced from the \nbaseline. They have been reduced as a share of total Federal spending. \nThe fact that the press--at least some elements of the press--seem \nunwilling to tell the American people is that the reduction in \ncommodities--over a third of the money that has been used to give more \nmoney for nutrition, more money for conservation, more money for \nenergy, a third of the money came out of commodities.\n  Almost a third of the money came out of crop insurance. Now, if you \nare going to tell the story, Washington Post, tell the whole story. \nThese are not just my estimates. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers, \nor the committee's numbers; these are the numbers from the CBO. They \nshow, on the 2007 farm bill, commodity programs have been cut by $4.2 \nbillion, crop insurance by $3.7 billion, for a total savings out of the \n$7.9 billion. That is from these so-called baselines. These are facts.\n  They also seem to overlook the fact that if you look back on the last \nfarm bill, you will see that the estimate at the time was that the farm \nbill would take 2.3 percent of total Federal spending. The commodity \nprograms were to take three-quarters of 1 percent. Look at the contrast \nwith this farm bill. With this farm bill, the total share of Federal \nspending is down from 2\\1/3\\ percent to less than 1.9 percent, and \ncommodity programs--the ones that draw all of the conflict and the \ncontroversy--have been dramatically reduced to one-quarter of 1 percent \nof total Federal spending. The Washington Post never mentions these \nfacts.\n  If we look at commodity program outlays on this chart, here is the \nbaseline at the time of the farm bill. This is what it would cost into \nthe future. Look at the estimates from the CBO on what the commodity \nprograms will cost now. It is a very dramatic reduction in real terms, \nin relative terms--in whatever terms you want to use. If you are going \nto report honestly to the American people, then you need to tell them \nthe whole story, not just the story that is the way you want to write \nit. You have an obligation to people to tell them the whole story so \nthey can make a judgment about what is fair and what is right.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. It is paid for. It takes up a much \nsmaller share of total Federal spending than the previous farm bill, \nand the commodity provisions have been cut by two-thirds as a share of \ntotal Federal spending. If you look at where the money goes--I will \ntell you, I sometimes read these articles and hear broadcasts, and I \nwonder why don't these reporters tell people where the money is going. \nYou would think this is all for subsidies for rich farmers.\n  The fact is, the vast majority of the spending in this bill is going \nto go to nutrition programs; 66 percent of the money in this bill is \ngoing to go for nutrition programs. Have you seen any article written \nby the major mainstream press that has told the American people that \nfact? Nutrition programs go to every corner of this country. They are \n66 percent of the money in this bill. Crop insurance is 7.6 percent. \nConservation is 9 percent. Again, conservation is important to every \ncorner of America. When you put conservation and nutrition together, \nthat is 75 percent of the spending in the bill. Commodity programs are \nonly less than 14 percent of what is in this farm bill.\n  I hope at some point somebody will start to tell the American people \nthe full story. I certainly don't read it in the Washington Post. I \nhave not seen a single story in the Washington Post about agriculture \nthat I thought was fair and balanced. I have not seen one. They are \nwriting with a point of view. They are writing as advocates.\n  When I grew up, news people felt an obligation to try to tell both \nsides of the story. But, apparently, those days are gone. Today, if a \npublication has a point of view, or your television program or \ntelevision station or network has a point of view, that is how you \nreport it. You report one side of the story. That is not responsible, \nand it is not telling people what they really need to know to make an \ninformed judgment. It is withholding from people certain information \nthey would need to make any kind of objective judgment. That is what is \ngoing on here.\n  I don't want my colleagues to be fooled or to miss the point that \nthis farm bill is taking much less of total Federal spending than the \nprevious farm bill, and the commodity provisions that, in the last farm \nbill, were estimated to take three-quarters of 1 percent of Federal \nspending is down to one-quarter of 1 percent. Why do we need that one-\nquarter of 1 percent? Very simply, because our major competitors, the \nEuropeans, are providing more than three times as much support to their \nproducers as we provide to ours. This is a fact. The Europeans are \nproviding more than three times as much support to their producers as \nwe provide to ours.\n  So what happens if you yank this slim rug out from under American \nproducers? Even though we are already outspent more than 3 to 1 by our \nmajor competitors, what would happen if we yank that rug out from our \nproducers? Two words: ``mass bankruptcy.'' That is what would happen.\n  Is anybody paying attention? Do these publications or these news \nbroadcasts give one whit about what happens to the rural economy in \nAmerica? Why don't they ever report that the Europeans--on export \nsubsidies--are outgunning us more than 80 to 1? That is a fact. But \nthey don't seem to care.\n\n[[Page S14257]]\n\nThey don't seem to care because, I guess, it doesn't affect their \neconomic lives directly. But I represent a State that has farm and \nranch families from one side of our State to the other, from one corner \nof North Dakota to the other. The hard reality is they are out there \ncompeting against the French and German farmers, and they can do that. \nThey are ready to do that, to take on a fair fight. But when you ask \nthem to take on not just the French and German farmers but the French \nGovernment and the German Government, as well, that is not a fair \nfight. To say to our farmers and ranchers: You go out there and take on \nthe French and German farmers, and while you are taking on the French \nand German Governments, your Government is going to be AWOL, absent \nwithout leave; your Government is going to declare unilateral \ndisarmament; your Government is going to let you fend for yourself--\ngood luck, Charlie, because the other side is outgunning us more than 3 \nto 1 already.\n  But some here say, let's not even put up a fight; let's throw in the \ntowel and let the Europeans take over world agriculture. They are \nalready equal to us in world market share. They are already advancing \nevery day, increasing their market share, while ours slips--they are \nnot alone, by the way. It is also our friends in Brazil, Argentina, and \nother countries who manage their currencies to secure advantage in \nterms of agriculture.\n  How long will it be, I ask these cynics, before America succumbs on \nthe agricultural front the way we have on automobiles, electronics, and \nall the others, where our foreign competitors have taken the advantaged \nposition? How long? We are right on the brink of it happening now.\n  This farm bill is an attempt to meet many needs of the American \npeople. As I said, if you look at where the money goes, the \noverwhelming majority of this money goes for nutrition; 66 percent of \nthe money in this bill goes to nutrition. I hear some of my colleagues \nfrom nonfarm States saying, ``I don't have a dog in this fight; I don't \nreally care what happens in the farm bill.'' Really? Then you don't \nknow what is in the bill. Somebody from a nonfarm State who says they \ndon't have anything in this fight simply don't know what is in the \nbill.\n  Sixty-six percent of the money goes for nutrition, 9 percent for \nconservation, and more for research and trade. That is where the money \ngoes in this bill. Commodity programs are a small minority of less than \n14 percent. As a share of total Federal spending, the commodity parts \nof this bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will be \nless than one-quarter of 1 percent of Federal spending. That is a fact. \nIt is an important fact. It is a fact that the Washington Post, \napparently, doesn't want people to know because they never report it. \nThey also never report that the vast majority of this money goes to \nnutrition programs, or that the next biggest category is conservation. \nThey have an agenda, and their agenda is to look down their nose at \npeople who are in production agriculture, farm, and ranch families, who \napparently don't have their respect.\n  It is interesting, they don't write the same kind of article about \nany other industry that gets help from the Federal Government. \nVirtually every industry in America has some kind of Federal \nassistance, whether it is highways for the trucking industry or \nairports for the airline industry or any of the other things that are \ndone for industry after industry. I don't see them come after them with \nthis same sort of look-down-your-nose arrogance because that is what it \nis. It is incredible arrogance.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will have a chance to pay \nattention to both sides of the story in this farm program today. They \ndeserve to hear both sides of the story.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today, President Bush vetoed the \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill. I \nwish I could say I was surprised but, frankly, few actions by this \nPresident surprise me anymore. This is a good bill, a bipartisan bill, \na bill that cleared both Houses with clear, strong majorities. In fact, \nthe first one cleared here by 75 votes. It is a bill that reflects the \ncritical education, health, job training needs of our country, \nespecially for Americans who are at the bottom rungs of the socio-\neconomic ladder. The bill was endorsed by more than 1,000--actually \n1,075, to be exact--health, education, social service, and labor \norganizations in this country. There are disability groups in this \nletter, disease advocacy groups, school groups, community action \npartnerships, religious groups--millions of people across America are \nrepresented on this letter. This morning President Bush turned his back \non all of them.\n  He seems to have no problem pouring billions of dollars into Iraq for \nschools, hospitals, job programs, health needs, but when it comes to \nthose priorities here in America, the President says no. After spending \nall these billions of dollars on schools, hospitals, job programs, and \nhealth needs in Iraq, it is time to start investing some of that money \nhere in America.\n  The President insists we have to stick to exactly the top number in \nhis budget. Frankly, if we did that, we would be cutting programs such \nas the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program for the elderly at \na time when we know fuel prices are going to be extremely high this \nwinter.\n  The President completely zeroed out the social services block grant \nand cut the community services block grant by 50 percent.\n  Under the President's budget, we would be cutting the National Cancer \nInstitute. At a time when we are starting to make some progress in the \nfight against cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so many other \nthings, he cuts funding for the NIH.\n  Again, we need to put more money into special education to help some \nof our beleaguered property tax payers in our States.\n  We have a backlog of several hundred thousand cases in Social \nSecurity. People who have paid in all their lives to Social Security, \nif they have a problem and they have an appeal pending or a case to be \nheard--there are 700,000 backlogged. It is about a year-and-a-half wait \nright now to get Social Security. It is unconscionable. We put money in \nthere to reduce the backlog.\n  We wanted to fund more community health centers as one of the great \nthings we have done in this country to help people who are not getting \ntheir health care needs attended to, to get them at their community \nhealth care centers. It has done a great job nationally.\n  We put more money into the Head Start Program. And No Child Left \nBehind--we put more money in there to meet our needs in title I \nschools, teacher training.\n  These are all provisions that were in our bill. As I noted before, it \nwas bipartisan. I worked very closely with Senator Specter, our ranking \nmember. There were dozens of provisions and funding increases in the \nbill that were requested specifically by Republicans, those on the \nother side of the aisle who requested that we increase funding in these \nareas. Unfortunately, it seems Mr. Bush is more interested in provoking \na confrontation than in governing responsibly. He recently dismissed \nthe funding in this bill as ``social spending,'' as though somehow it \npays for ice cream socials or Saturday-night socials or something such \nas that--social spending. I never heard it referred to like that. It is \nout of bounds, it is out of touch, it shows how isolated this President \nhas become.\n  Every dime of additional funding in this bill goes to bedrock \nessential programs and services that have been shortchanged in the last \nfew years. I mentioned them: community health centers, Head Start, NIH, \nspecial education, student aid, social services block grant and \ncommunity services\n\n[[Page S14258]]\n\nblock grant, Pell grants. These are all things that have been \nshortchanged. The President's budget would cut NIH, LIHEAP, special \neducation, and eliminate the community services block grant, job \ntraining, housing and emergency food assistance for our most needy \ncitizens. Apparently, Mr. Bush sees this as frivolous social spending. \nI couldn't disagree more.\n  We have to keep the President's veto this morning in context. During \nthe 6 years Republicans controlled Congress, Mr. Bush did not veto a \nsingle appropriations bill, including many that went over his budget. \nHe never vetoed one of them. Now Democrats are in charge. Yes, we have \ngone over budget in some of the areas I mentioned and not only with the \nsupport but the encouragement of Republican Members who wanted to add \nmore money. I guess because the Democrats run Congress now, the \nPresident says he will veto them. He did. He vetoed the bill this \nmorning, but he never vetoed one in 6 years even though they were above \nhis request. It smacks of the most blatant form of partisanship and \npolitics. It kind of goes beyond the pale.\n  A few weeks ago the President sent up a new supplemental spending \nbill. We will be working on that this week. I don't know if we will \npass it this week or when we come back in December. It is more than \n$196 billion, mostly for Iraq. The Congressional Budget Office now \nestimates that Mr. Bush's war in Iraq will cost a staggering $1.9 \ntrillion in the next decade. Yet he vetoed this bill, over $12 billion \nin funding for education, health, biomedical research, and other \ndomestic priorities.\n  You ask: $1.9 trillion, $12 billion, what does it mean? Look at it \nthis way: Do away with all the zeroes. It means Mr. Bush is asking for \n$1,900 for Iraq. Yet he vetoed this bill because we spent $12 more than \nwhat he wanted. That shows misplaced priorities: $12 billion a month \nfor the war in Iraq, yet he vetoed this bill which is $12 billion for a \nwhole year.\n  What is most disappointing about the President's veto this morning is \nhis total unwillingness to compromise. Any time we work out bills, we \ncompromise. That is the art of democracy. We compromise. No one around \nhere ever gets everything he or she wants, but we make compromises. We \ndo it in committee; we do it on the floor of the Senate. We do it \nbetween the House and the Senate. Then when all is said and done and we \nwork in conference, usually the President will work with us to work out \nproblems. This is where the White House is. Where do we meet? The \nPresident never came to our conference--I shouldn't say the President \ndidn't, but his people never came to our conference to offer \ncompromises, where we might meet halfway.\n  When the President sent down his veto message, he mentioned two \nthings about our bill: One, it had the lifting of his ban on stem cell \nresearch; two, it spent more money than he wanted. I thought a \ncompromise might be: OK, we will take off the stem cell stuff, and you \nagree to the spending priorities we have. We voluntarily, to try to \nmeet the President halfway, said: OK, we will take off the stem cell \nissue, even though Senator Specter and I both believe strongly in it. \nIt passed the committee with only three dissenting votes. The Senate \nhas spoken at least twice in support of an embryonic stem cell bill to \ntake off the handcuffs the President has put on scientists. But even \nthat wasn't enough.\n  Then we went to conference. We thought: OK, will the President now \ntry to meet us somewhat on the spending part? The answer was no. It was \nhis way or the highway. We either agree totally with the President or \nhe is going to veto it and the White House will put pressure on the \nHouse because that is where the bill goes for an override, to keep them \nfrom overriding his veto.\n  It is sad the President has taken that position. Under the \nConstitution, Congress does have the power to override a veto. It \nhappened last week with the water resources bill. He vetoed it. Both \nthe House and Senate voted over two-thirds, as is constitutionally \nrequired, to override the veto. We could do it on this bill that funds \neducation, everything from Head Start, elementary education with title \nI, No Child Left Behind, elementary and secondary education, college \nwith Pell grants, student loans, forgiveness of loans if you go into \ncertain occupations such as medically underserved areas, legal \nservices, or become a prosecuting attorney--the type of occupations \nthat don't pay a lot of money but are needed in our country.\n  On health, especially all the biomedical research that was in that \nbill for NIH, the money for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention for making sure we get more flu vaccine this year \nstockpiled, not to mention all of the efforts that CDC is doing in \nstockpiling other vaccines in case of a terrorist incident, something \nthat might happen--we hope it doesn't, but we have to be prepared for \nit--that is in this bill he vetoed.\n  I mentioned things such as low-income heating energy assistance for \nlow-income elderly. This is all in this bill. Now it is up to the House \nwhether they will vote to override the veto. It will be interesting to \nsee how many House Members would vote to override the President on the \nwater resources bill but would not vote to override a bill that deals \nwith health, education, community block grants, NIH, the Centers for \nDisease Control. It will be interesting.\n  The Water Resources Development Act was an important bill. I was \nstrongly supportive of it. It goes basically to meet one of the urgent \ninfrastructure needs of the country: waterways, to make sure we upgrade \nour locks and dams and make sure they are adequate to the environmental \nneeds and river transportation needs for the next century. It is vital. \nThe Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor appropriations bill \nis sort of the counterpart of that in terms of the human \ninfrastructure, making sure we have the best educated populace, that we \nmeet the health care needs of people, that we invest in cutting edge \nresearch, that we have good job retraining programs.\n  We just had a case where a Maytag plant, after all these years, \nclosed in Newton, IA. We need job retraining programs. That is in this \nbill the President vetoed. It is human infrastructure needs.\n  It will be interesting to see how many House Members vote to override \nthe President when it comes to the physical infrastructure but now will \nnot vote to override the President when it comes to the human \ninfrastructure. I hope it is very few. I hope we get the same number of \nvotes to override the President's veto on this Education, Health and \nHuman Services, and Labor appropriations bill as we got on the water \nresources bill.\n  It is a sad day that the President would veto this bill. We went out \nof our way to meet him halfway, but he said absolutely not. It is his \nway or nothing else.\n  That is not the way we do things. The President is not acting \nresponsibly, quite frankly, in this area. I don't know what we can do. \nIf the House overrides the veto, I am pretty certain we would have the \nvotes here to override the veto. We would have to wait for the House to \nact first. I hope they do, and I hope we get it. I hope we vote to \noverride the veto. But until then, we have to see what the House is \ngoing to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           President's Veto of Labor, Hhs Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, they say in life you can really judge a \nperson's values by where they put their wealth. Certainly, we all love \nour families, and we think nothing of spending a lot of money on our \nchildren. We all value our health, and we go to great extent to spend \nwhatever is necessary to have a healthy lifestyle and to live on for \nmany years.\n  The President, today, had a chance to demonstrate his values with his \nveto pen. He had a chance to decide what priorities we should have in \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S14259]]\n\nfor our future. We sent him a bill called the Labor, Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill.\n  There was a venerable Congressman from Kentucky named Bill Natcher. \nHe served for many years and distinguished himself as never having \nmissed a rollcall vote in his life. I will not get into that side \nstory, but his responsibility in the House Appropriations Committee was \nto chair the subcommittee that generated this spending bill, the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services bill, the bill that includes education, \nhealth care, medical research--programs that really directly reach the \npeople of America. He called it the people's bill. He used to wear \nthese starched white shirts and dark-blue suits and silver-gray ties. \nHe looked like a Senator. He had the gray hair and would stand there \nand say: This is the people's bill. The people should vote for it. And \nthey did. Overwhelmingly, House Members--Democrats and Republicans--\nwould vote for it because this bill really does reach families \neverywhere across America.\n  President Bush decided to veto this bill today. He vetoed the bill, \nwhich is rare. Incidentally, he never vetoed a bill until this year. \nNow, he has, after a long search, found his veto pen and is using it \nfrequently. He vetoed this bill this year because it called for 4 \npercent more spending than he had asked for--$6 billion.\n  Madam President, $6 billion is a lot of money, for sure, but not by \nFederal budget standards. The President, before he vetoed this bill, \nsigned the Defense appropriations bill. That bill was 10 percent over \nhis request, and yet he signed it. When it came to this bill that \nreaches families and people across America, he said no.\n  Of course, this President, who says we cannot afford $6 billion for \nprograms for the American people, is asking us for $196 billion for \nprograms for the people of Iraq--$196 billion. It is hard to understand \nhow we cannot afford health care in America, cancer research in \nAmerica, education in America, worker protection in America, homeless \nshelters for veterans in America, yet $196 billion for Iraq. I said it \nbefore. This President gets up every morning in the White House, opens \nthe window, looks outside and sees Iraq. He doesn't see America, \nbecause if he would see America, he would understand the American \npeople across this Nation value so much the priorities he vetoed today.\n\n  Yesterday we celebrated Veterans Day. We acknowledged what the men \nand women who have served this country mean to us, our history, and our \nfuture. There were a lot of good speeches given by great politicians \ntalking about how much we value our veterans. Those speeches had hardly \nbeen finished when the President returned to the White House to veto \nthis bill.\n  This bill would have provided funding for employment and health \nprograms for veterans. It is hard to believe in America that one out of \nfour homeless people is a veteran. You see them on the streets of your \ntown, large and small; you see them standing on the highways with \nlittle cardboard signs. One out of four of them is a veteran. This bill \ntried to provide counseling, shelter, ways to give these veterans a \nplace to sleep at night. The President vetoed it and said it was too \ndarn much spending.\n  This bill would have provided $228 million for veterans employment, \n$9.5 million for traumatic brain injury, and $23.6 million for the \nHomeless Veterans Reintegration Programs.\n  Last night on television I saw a program. James Gandolfini, who was \nthe star of ``The Sopranos,'' had a special documentary; I believe it \nwas called ``Alive Day.'' I think that was the name of it, but you \ncouldn't miss it if you saw it because he invited veterans on this \nprogram to be interviewed, veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who had \nbeen injured. These young men and women came and talked about their \nlove of this country, their service to our Nation and what they had \nbeen through. This beautiful young woman who had been a lieutenant in \nthe Army had a rocket-propelled grenade explode right next to her, \ntearing off her right arm and shoulder. She now has a prosthetic arm \nthat appears to be real but of course does not even have function to \nit, but it is what she uses. It was a touching moment when she talked \nabout what her future would be, this beautiful young woman, this \ndisabled veteran.\n  There were many amputees--some of them double amputees--talking about \ntrying to put their lives back together. Some of the most painful \nepisodes involve victims of traumatic brain injury. There was one young \nman with his mother sitting next to him. They showed before pictures, \nwhen he was a hard-charging soldier, happy go lucky and a lot of fun, \nwho then sustained a serious traumatic brain injury and now is in a \nwheelchair. He hopes the day will come when he can once again walk and \nrun. It is hard to imagine we could give tribute to those veterans \nyesterday and veto a bill today that would have spent just $9.5 million \nfor traumatic brain injury programs, but the President did that this \nmorning.\n  The President came to Washington and said he wanted to be the \neducation President. We remember it well because he came up with a new \nterm we hadn't heard before called No Child Left Behind; he persuaded \nleaders on both sides of the aisle to vote for it and produced a new \neducation program for America. This bill provided money to make that \nprogram work. It is not enough to identify the problems in our schools \nand the difficulties facing our children and our students; you need \nhelp to make certain you have the best teachers in the classroom, the \nproper class size, the right equipment at the school.\n  We also understand early childhood education is essential for kids to \nsucceed. Show me a family where the mom and dad focus on teaching that \nchild to read and read to the child and take the child out and speak to \nthem in adult terms and I will show you a child probably destined to be \npretty good in kindergarten. A lot of kids don't have that good \nfortune; mom and dad are off to work. So the Head Start Program is a \nway to give them a fighting chance. The bill the President vetoed today \nincluded more than $7 billion for the Head Start Program, increasing it \nby $200 million from last year. The President said we can't afford to \nincrease the Head Start Program.\n  The bill also included $18 billion for higher education initiatives \nand student financial aid. How many working families do you know with a \nchild they want to see go to the best school in America, struggling \nwith the idea of how they will pay for it and the debt they will carry \nout of school? We put money in this bill to help those families help \nthose students, and the President said we can't afford it.\n  The President's budget would have provided title I funds for 117,000 \nfewer students and cut the number of new teachers in classrooms by \n8,000. So the President says it is wasteful for us to provide title I \nfunds to help children from disadvantaged families--117,000 more--and \nnew teachers and classrooms by 8,000. At the same time, he wants $196 \nbillion for a war in Iraq not paid for.\n  In Illinois, almost 3,500 students will be left behind by the \nPresident's veto, and 200 teachers will not be hired. Will that be \nbetter for those schools, those families, those children? Of course \nnot.\n  The appropriations bill the President vetoed also included $11.3 \nbillion for special ed, kids with special challenges who need special \nhelp and with that help have a chance to succeed. The President said we \nspend too much money on those kids and he vetoed it.\n  Had Congress provided what the President requested, Federal funding \nfor disabled children would be lower by an average of $117 per child. I \nhave been in schools with special education classes, and I have watched \nthe special care those children need and receive, often one-on-one \nhelp. If that teacher is caring and competent, the child has a chance--\njust a chance--to come out of the shadows of darkness and have a \nfuture. That is what this bill is about--a bill the President says \nAmerica cannot afford.\n  In the area of health care--this is one I think touches me and most \npeople--we included $29 billion for medical research at 27 institutes \nand centers at the National Institutes of Health. Senator Mikulski \nknows all about this. This is in her neck of the woods in Maryland. The \nNational Institutes of Health and what they achieve, we put in this \nbill $29 billion and included $1.4 billion more than the President \nrequested for medical research at NIH.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, would the Senator from Illinois yield \nfor a question?\n\n[[Page S14260]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator aware the President's budget actually \ncut NIH by $310 million? He cut the National Institutes of Health \nprojects by $310 million, wiping out research opportunities for those \nyoung scientists with breakthrough ideas, as well as those which were \nready for advancements; is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of it. I will tell my colleagues the Senator \nfrom Maryland probably recalls that over the last 10 years or so, this \nhas kind of been an area of real bipartisan cooperation. We may fight \nlike cats and dogs over everything else, but we said: Come on, when it \ncomes to the National Institutes of Health and medical research, \nDemocrats get sick and Republicans get sick, too, and our kids do as \nwell, so let's all join hands and promise we are going to increase the \nspending for medical research, not just to find the cures but also, as \nthe Senator from Maryland says, to build up the infrastructure of \ntalented professionals who will devote their lives to this medical \nresearch. The President says: No, we can't afford it.\n  Madam President, $1.4 billion, we can't afford to spend $1.4 billion \nmore on cancer research, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's? We can't afford that? Well, for $12 billion to $15 billion \na month, we can obviously afford a war in Iraq, but the President can't \nfind money for the war against disease and death in this country. That \nis truly unfortunate.\n  Since I see my colleague from Maryland, I will surrender the floor \nand give her a chance to speak. I hope this veto today will not go \nunnoticed. Elections have consequences. In the last election, the \nAmerican people said: We are going to give you--the Democrats--a \nmajority in the Senate and a majority in the House. Now do something \nwith it.\n  We have tried. We have succeeded in many areas. But we have run into \nthe opposition of this President more often than not. When we tried to \nchange the course and policy of the war in Iraq, the President used his \nfirst veto as President of the United States to veto on foreign policy, \nto veto that decision. When we tried to change his horrendous decision \nto stop medical research involving stem cells, he used his veto pen \nagain. When we tried to provide children's health insurance for \nmillions of kids across America who are not poor enough to qualify for \nMedicaid but not lucky enough to have health insurance in their family, \nhe used his veto pen again. He used it again today.\n  Why is it a recurring theme that we see this President stopping \nefforts by this Democratic Congress to address the issues people care \nabout: Health care, making sure we have the best; medical research to \nfind those cures; making sure our schools are preparing the next \ngeneration of leaders; making certain that as a country, we move \nforward in providing health insurance protection for kids. It is a sad \nmoment.\n  I hope the House of Representatives can rally the votes to override \nthat veto. I hope a few of our Republican friends who joined us in \npassing this bill, with over 70 votes, if I am not mistaken--I think \nclose to 75 votes--I hope they will stand with us again and override \nthis President's veto--a mistake, a mistake this President made at the \nexpense of America's families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments on the farm bill be laid aside and that I be allowed \nto speak on two important amendments that I will offer at an \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I rise to speak about two very \nimportant amendments. I will ask for a vote on both of these amendments \nat an appropriate time. The first amendment requires the U.S. \nGovernment to label any food that comes from a cloned animal or its \nprogeny. The second amendment would increase food safety because I will \nask for three studies on the impact of cloned products in our food \nsupply--the impact on trade, the impact on the economy, and the impact \non health.\n  But let me talk about the fundamental problem. See this picture up \nhere? This is Dolly. You remember Dolly, the cloned lamb that burst \nonto the scene? Dolly is cloned. She has gone from a novelty to a \nbiotech product, to possibly Dolly burger in your food supply. So we \nhave gone from: Hello Dolly, who are you, to being on the verge of \nhaving Dolly burgers in our school lunch program, maybe Dolly \nBraunschweiger in our Meals on Wheels program. Why are we on the verge \nof doing that? It is because the FDA said it is OK. You remember the \nFDA. They said OK to Vioxx. They said OK to a lot of things.\n  It seems, in December of 2006, the FDA announced that milk and meat \nproducts from cloned animals are safe for human consumption. Now, I \nhave very serious doubts about that, but I am not a scientist, so I \nwant more science and more research. Most Americans agree with me, that \nscientists should be able to monitor cloned animals as they enter the \nfood supply. To my dismay, FDA has refused to label cloned food. I \nbelieve people have a right to know and a right to make their own \ndecisions.\n  The American people find cloned food disturbing. A Gallup poll \nreports over 60 percent of Americans think it is immoral to clone \nanimals. My bill doesn't deal with morality. My bill deals with: When \nyou eat it, you know where it came from. Consumers have a right to \nknow. They have no way to tell if the food comes from a cloned animal, \nthe cloned animal's progeny, such as Dolly, or if it comes from a cow, \na pig, a chicken. I want the public to be informed.\n  I am for consumer choice. If most Americans don't want cloned milk \nand meat, they should not be required to eat it. I cannot stop the \ncloning of animals. Maybe that would not be a good idea. I cannot stop \nthe FDA from approving it. I don't believe in meddling at that level. \nBut I can insist on labeling. And if it enters your food supply, \nwhether you buy it at the supermarket or whether you are in a \nrestaurant or whether it is going to be in the child's school lunch \nprogram or your elder parents' Meals on Wheels program, you ought to \nknow about it. My amendment would require labeling by the FDA and the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to put a label on all food from cloned \nanimals that says this product is from a cloned animal or its progeny. \nThese labels would be at the wholesale level, retail level, or \nrestaurant level, or wherever the U.S. Government acts in calling it \nnutrition. It would allow the American people to make an informed \ndecision on what they are eating.\n  You would think I am creating Armageddon. The BioTrade Association \nhas been all over me with the functional equivalent of cleats, running \neditorial boards, and whispering science as they know it into the ears \nof the ed boards. If they have such confidence that cloned food is OK, \nwhy would they care if it were labeled? If they had such confidence \nthat the American people would be indifferent to labeling, why would \nthey oppose it?\n  They say it will cost too much. Guess what. They said it about \nnutritional labeling. They said that about other forms of labeling on \nour food. I reject those arguments. I believe you want to know this. I \nreally believe you want to know if you are eating cloned food.\n  Madam President, you know me. You know I am one of the people in the \nSenate who has stood fairly on the side of science, the technology \nadvancements it brings and the need always for more research. I believe \nwe need more research into what this means. What is the impact and \nconsequence on public health, on individual health, on unborn children, \nwhich I know is a great concern to many of our colleagues here? We \ndon't know. Are we going to wake up and, instead of fetal alcohol \nproblems, have the impact of cloned food? I don't know that.\n  My second amendment would require three studies: a health impact \nstudy on cloned foods and do more of it; an economic impact to the \nUnited States from adding cloned food to our food supply; a foreign \ntrade impact on exporting food made in the United States from cloned \nanimals.\n  My amendment also requires scientific peer review of the FDA's \ndecision to improve scientific rigor. It would eliminate and assure \nthere were no conflicts of interest. Many studies done with cloned food \nwere done with the supporters of cloning, and those who would profit \nfrom cloning. The FDA received over 13,000 comments\n\n[[Page S14261]]\n\nwhen it released its initial decision that food from cloned animals is \nsafe. Many of these comments said more information is needed. \nScientists said there is more information needed. The public said more \ninformation is needed. I believe we need to listen to the National \nAcademy of Sciences, which is the premier adviser to the Congress and \nthe people on this.\n  The National Academy of Sciences agrees that cloning is a brand-new \nscience. There may be unknown and unintended consequences. These \nscientists recommend this technology be monitored and urge postmarket \nsurveillance. You cannot have postmarket surveillance unless it is \nlabeled. If it is mixed in with your food, you won't be able to do \nthis.\n  The FDA tells us that once they determined cloned food is safe, they \nwould allow it to enter the market. The scientists want this labeling. \nI believe we are going down a difficult path. In Europe, they call this \ntype of food ``Frankenfood.'' Cloned beef is having a hard time in the \nmarketplace. Do we want the EU to ban all American food products \nbecause the people are worried about ``Frankenfood'' and are worried \nthat this ``Frankenfood'' has been mingled with the other food? \nEssentially, they could ban all exports of meat products there. I don't \nwant to hear one more thing coming from the EU that says they don't \nwant to buy our beef or lamb because they are worried that it is \n``Frankenfood.''\n  Again, I am worried about it. How about having an amendment that \nmandates a study on the trade impacts?\n  I also believe in science and research. I believe, therefore, we need \nto mandate a study now and follow a scientific program based on sound \nscience. Were they accurate? Were they impartial? Were they free of \nconflict of interest? What additional research needs to be done? We \nneed to be able to also look at the impact on our economy. Are we \nrunning a shortage in beef, lamb, and so on, so that we have to go to \ncloned animals? I don't think so. It seems to be readily available in \nthe American marketplace. I don't know why we need to do this.\n  People say, well, don't you believe in the FDA? I do. The FDA is in \nmy State. Over a thousand dedicated men and women work there every day. \nWhat I also know is that the FDA has been making some pretty big \nmistakes. They have been making mistakes in their food supply. They \ncannot stand sentry over spinach and E. coli in our own country. How \nare they going to monitor Dolly as she makes her way into our food \nsupply? They don't even have enough people to keep an eye on E. coli \nspreading in spinach in our own country. What about the food coming in \nfrom other countries that we don't seem to be able to stand sentry \nover?\n  The FDA has not had enough resources in the food supply area. Then \nthey say: Don't worry, honey, we will take care of you. We learned that \nline a long time ago and we know how false it was. The FDA, I believe, \nneeds more help. They need more research. They need more monitoring, \nand this is why I am for labeling. Labeling would tell us where these \nfoods go. It would give us the ability to have postmarket surveillance \nto look at the consequences, some of which might be OK and some of \nwhich might be quite questionable. So all I am saying is give the \npublic a right to know and let's do more studies.\n  I don't know about Dolly. She looks so sad here in this photo, \ndoesn't she? I don't know if she is happy that she is a clone, and I \ndon't know if she is sad that she is a clone. I know whatever happens \nto Dolly, and whatever breakthrough comes from cloning--and maybe there \nare wonderful things that I don't know about. I do know that when I sit \ndown on my heart-smart program and bite into a nice juicy roll, I want \nto know whether I am eating beef, lamb, or a Dolly burger. So my \namendment simply says: Give me the right to know; otherwise, I will \ntake further steps to say bah, bah to Dolly burgers.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Presidential Veto\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today the President, our President, \ndemonstrated once again that he values political posturing more than \nmaking America a safer, healthier, more economically strong nation.\n  This morning, President Bush vetoed a bipartisan, fiscally \nresponsible Labor-HHS-Education bill that increases funding for \nprograms to improve student performance, makes college more affordable, \nsupports lifesaving medical research, and provides relief for families \ncoping with rising home heating costs.\n  The bill also provides money for veterans employment programs, \nhomeless veterans, and research to help those veterans suffering from \ntraumatic brain injuries.\n  The President, in an effort to convey the appearance of fiscal \ndiscipline, has threatened to veto 10 of the 12 appropriations bills--\n10 out of 12.\n  Today the President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \nbill because Congress chose to increase funding by 5 percent. The \nhypocrisy of the President's political posturing became even more clear \ntoday. This morning, the President signed the Defense appropriations \nbill which provides a $40 billion, or 10-percent, increase for the \nDepartment of Defense. Also, this morning, the President vetoed the \nLabor-HHS-Education bill because Congress chose to restore \nirresponsible and shortsighted cuts proposed by the President.\n  As part of the President's political message, he describes the 5-\npercent increase for Labor-HHS-Education programs as ``bloated'' \nspending. I call it responsible investments in research in cancer, \nheart disease, diabetes, in educating our children, in providing access \nto health care to rural America, and to heating the homes of low-income \nelderly Americans.\n  The President proposed to cut funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth by $279 million for studying cancer, diabetes, and heart \ndisease. Under the President's budget, the National Institutes of \nHealth would have to eliminate 717 research grants that could lead to \ncures or treatments for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and other \ndiseases.\n  Congress restored those cuts and provided an increase of $1.1 \nbillion. I ask the question: Is increasing spending for the National \nInstitutes of Health by 3.8 percent ``bloated'' spending? Is it? Of \ncourse not.\n  The President proposed over $3 billion in cuts for educational \nprograms, including special education, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and \nimproving teacher quality. Congress--that is us--restored those cuts. \nIs increasing by 3 percent to educate our children bloated spending? I \nask the question again. Congress restored those cuts. Is increasing \nfunding by 3 percent to educate our children bloated spending? No.\n\n  The President proposed cuts of nearly $1 billion from health \nprograms, such as rural health, preventive health, nurse training, and \nmental health grants. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, restored those \ncuts. I ask the question: Is providing an increase of $225 million for \ncommunity health centers bloated spending? Is it? Certainly not.\n  The President--our President--proposed to cut low-income home energy \nassistance by $379 million. Congress restored that cut and provided an \nincrease of $250 million. With the price of a barrel of oil reaching \n$100, does anyone really think increasing low-income home energy \nassistance is bloated spending? No.\n  No Senator will be cold this winter. I will not be cold this winter. \nYou on that side of the aisle will not be cold this winter. We on this \nside will not be cold this winter. No Senator will be cold at home this \nwinter. The President will not be cold down at the White House. No. Yet \nthe President wants Congress to slash such assistance.\n  President Bush's Budget Director, Jim Nussle, with whom I met several \nweeks ago, indicated he would be prepared to negotiate in good faith \nwith Congress over our differences in spending. To my dismay--to my \ndismay--Director Nussle has not reached out to the leadership of the \nAppropriations Committees in the House and the Senate in a genuine \neffort to find common ground.\n\n[[Page S14262]]\n\n  Now, what is the problem? Why, Mr. President, why, Mr. Nussle, is the \n$40 billion increase for the Department of Defense fiscally responsible \nwhile a $6 billion increase to educate our children and improve the \nhealth of our citizens bloated spending?\n  Now, let's stop--please, let's stop--this charade of political \ngamesmanship. I say this most respectfully to our President. Let's move \nforward for the good of the American people. They deserve more from \ntheir elected officials.\n  I suggest to this White House that it stop its intransigence and help \nus--the elected Representatives of the people in Congress--to enact \nthis vital legislation. Let's sit down together and work out the \nproblems in this bill. Providing for our people's needs should not be a \ngame of us versus them. It should not be a Republican White House \nversus a Democratic conference. People's lives should not be fodder for \nego-driven political games.\n  Homeless veterans, veterans in need of health care, children in need \nof education, these must not become the target in a foolish game of \nkickball. I urge this White House--I plead with this White House--to \nsit down with the Congress and address the growing unmet needs in this \ncountry. If we can build schools and hospitals in Iraq, we can \ncertainly provide health care and education for our own citizens. \nNobody wins in a game of chicken, and surely the White House can and \nought to work with us--us, in Congress--to stop this charade.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 7 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, November voters in my State of Ohio spoke \nout for change. They spoke out for a very different and new set of \npriorities in Washington, priorities that match their own priorities \nand their own values back home.\n  Heeding their calls earlier this year, Congress raised the minimum \nwage, passed potentially lifesaving stem cell legislation, voted to \nexpand access for health insurance to literally 4 million low-income \nchildren, and last week, Congress sent to the President the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services bill for his signature, a bipartisan bill \nthat was filled with our national priorities. That bill would increase \nfunding for Head Start and Pell grants and programs that benefit our \nNation's veterans.\n  Earlier today, once again, the President made it clear that this \nadministration and its supporters do not share the priorities of \nAmerica's middle class. He vetoed lifesaving stem cell legislation, he \nvetoed expanding access to children's health insurance, and he, today, \nvetoed the bipartisan bill for Head Start, to give preschool kids a \nchance. He vetoed the legislation that included Pell grants to give \nmiddle-class working families, working-class kids an opportunity to go \nto college without a huge, onerous burden on them when they leave \ncollege. And he vetoed legislation that would matter to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  Today's veto was a veto of middle-class families and a veto of our \nvalues as a nation. The Labor, Health and Human Services bill funds the \npriorities that matter most in Ohio and across the Nation--more funding \nto help low-income children get the best possible start in school, more \nfunding for students hoping to realize their American dream, more \nfunding for programs to help our Nation's veterans with job training, \nwith college costs, and to help with the all too serious issue of \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  The day after Veterans Day, the day set aside to honor our Nation's \nveterans, the President vetoed legislation that would benefit those who \nhave sacrificed so much for our great country. That, Mr. President, is \nunacceptable.\n  Yesterday, in Cleveland, at the Wade Park Veterans Hospital, I spent \nthe afternoon with veterans from northeast Ohio, listening to them and \ntheir concerns. I learned that they need more, not less, assistance \nfrom the Federal Government. I heard from a former Ohio National \nGuardsman living in Jefferson, OH, not far from Ashtabula. Before being \ndeployed to Iraq, he was an engineer and his wife was the vice \npresident of a local company. After being injured in Iraq by an IED, he \nreturned home suffering from a traumatic brain injury, a spinal cord \ninjury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Unable to work full time \nbecause of his injuries, this former National Guardsman, who worked \nfull time before he left, now had to rely on disability compensation to \nsupport his family. His wife Julie had to leave her job to care full \ntime for her child and for her husband. His care requires four trips \nweekly to the nearest VA hospital, a trip of about 110 miles each way.\n  I heard from a reservist, CPL Anthony Niederiter, of Euclid, OH, who \nwas deployed to Iraq in 2005. Corporal Niederiter shared stories about \nthe need for a better system that helps our military men and women \nreturn to civilian life after serving our country. The confusing \ntransition process has caused veteran after veteran to miss filing \ndeadlines for health benefits and educational opportunities.\n  One veteran, one soldier, told me after he left the military, he \napplied for dental benefits 32 or 33 days after he left the military. \nBut he found out if you don't apply within 30 days, they are not \navailable. Nobody told him that. Others have been denied educational \nbenefits because they didn't follow the right rules because nobody told \nthem that when they left the military.\n  Too many commanding officers, after these troops are used up and of \nno value anymore to the military, just wash their hands of them and \nlook to the next class of military recruits they are going to send off \nto war, not informing those who are leaving, those who have served \ntheir country--frankly, not caring enough to make sure those veterans, \nthose soldiers leaving the Armed Forces have been notified and told of \ntheir rights and the benefits they are able to receive--education, \nhealth care, and the like.\n  I heard from Dr. John Schupp, a Cleveland State University professor, \nwho emphasized the importance of doing more, not less, for our \nveterans. Dr. Schupp founded the SERV Program, a two-semester program \nat Cleveland State University designed just for veterans. The program \nhelps veterans apply for GI bill benefits, offers veterans-only classes \nthat help ease the transition back into the classroom for many veterans \nwho have not been in a classroom for 6, 8, 10 years or longer. He works \nwith veterans to navigate VA issues and offers a veteran-to-veteran \nmentoring program.\n  Mr. President, we need more programs like this. Dr. Schupp's \ninvolvement, his brainchild, his program--much of this should be done \nby the Department of Defense before our soldiers, our marines, and our \nsailors leave government or military service. Dr. Schupp has taken up \nthe slack, frankly, for much that hasn't been done. We need more \nprograms like this, not just in Ohio but across our great country.\n  We need more Federal investment in our Nation's veterans. We must \ncontinue to honor our heroes from World War II and Korea and Vietnam, \nwhile finding ways to care for the new generation of veterans returning \nfrom Afghanistan and Iraq--and Kosovo, as one of the veterans came from \nyesterday. As more and more veterans return from these overseas \nengagements, especially from Afghanistan and Iraq, we must ensure that \nthis growing group has access to the best care and the best benefits \navailable. They have earned them.\n  Congress cannot simply wait to correct problems that arise. We can, \nwe must anticipate those problems and address them now, not later. \nProviding care and support for Ohio's veterans is a moral obligation. \nInstead of vetoes, our veterans deserve, from their Government, the \nsupport they have earned. Congress can start by overriding the veto of \nthe Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to stand up for middle-class \nfamilies, stand up for our communities, stand up for our workers, and \nto stand up, importantly, for our Nation's veterans. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to override this veto.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S14263]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized to speak as in morning business, \nwithout objection.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate environmental \ncommittee, and also on the Energy Committee, it is my view that the \ntime is long overdue for Congress to go beyond deal-making and politics \nas usual in addressing the crisis of global warming. The droughts, the \nfloods, and the severe weather disturbances our planet is already \nexperiencing will only get worse, potentially impacting billions of \npeople, if we do not take bold and decisive action in the very near \nfuture.\n  While the Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade bill is a strong step \nforward--and I applaud both Senators and I applaud Senator Barbara \nBoxer for her entire leadership on global warming--it is my view that \nlegislation as currently written does not go anywhere near far enough \nin creating the policies the scientific community says we must develop \nin order to avert a planetary catastrophe.\n  This legislation is also lacking in paving the way for the \ntransformation of our energy system, away from fossil fuels into energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy technologies.\n  Here are some of my concerns about the Lieberman-Warner bill. These \nare concerns I will be working on in the next number of weeks, trying \nto improve that legislation. First, virtually all the scientific \nevidence tells us, at the least, we must reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by 80 percent by the year 2050, if we stand a chance to \nreverse global warming. Unfortunately, the Lieberman-Warner bill, as \ncurrently written, under the very best projections, provides a 63-\npercent reduction. In other words, under the best projections, this \nbill does not go far enough, according to the scientific community, in \ngiving us a chance to reverse global warming. Secondly, this \nlegislation allows major polluters to continue emitting greenhouse \ngases for free until the year 2036. In fact, old-fashioned, dirty coal-\nburning plants could still be built during this period. That is wrong. \nThe right to pollute should not be given away for up to 26 years. \nFurther, in calculating emission reductions, this bill relies much too \nheavily on ``offsets,'' a process which is difficult to verify and \nwhich could lead to the underreporting of emission reductions.\n  Third, this bill provides a massive amount of corporate welfare to \nindustries that have been major emitters of greenhouse gases, while \nrequiring minimal performance standards and accountability for these \nsame industries. According to a recent report published by Friends of \nthe Earth, the auction and allocation processes of the bill could \ngenerate up to $3.6 trillion over a 40-year period. While a large fund \ndoes exist in the bill for ``low carbon technology,'' there is no \nguaranteed allocation for such important technologies as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, hydrogen or for energy efficiency. But there is a \nguaranteed allotment of $324 billion over a 40-year period for the coal \nindustry through an advanced coal sequestration program and $232 \nbillion for advanced technology vehicles.\n  The time is late. If Congress is serious about preventing \nirreversible damage to our planet because of global warming, we need to \nget our act together. We need to move in a bold and focused manner. Not \nonly are the people of our country looking to us to do that, but so are \ncountries all over the world. The good news is, we can do it.\n  As Members will recall, in 1941, President Roosevelt and the Congress \nbegan the process of rearming America to defeat Naziism and Japanese \nimperialism. Within a few short years, we had transformed our economy \nand started producing the tanks and bombs and planes and guns needed to \ndefeat Nazism. We did it because of the leadership of Roosevelt and the \nCongress. In 1961, President Kennedy called upon our Nation to \nundertake the seemingly impossible task of sending a man to the Moon. \nWorking with Congress, NASA was greatly expanded. The best scientists \nand engineers in this country and in the world were assembled to focus \non the task. Billions of dollars were appropriated and, in 1969, as we \nall remember with great pride, Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the Moon. \nWe did it. There was a challenge. We stepped up to the plate. We did \nit.\n  As a result of global warming, the challenge we face today is no less \ndaunting and no less consequential. Quite the contrary. Now we are \nfighting for the future of the planet and the well-being of billions of \npeople in every corner of the world. Once again, if we summon the \npolitical courage, I have absolutely no doubt the United States of \nAmerica can lead the world in resolving this very dangerous crisis. We \ncan do it.\n  In that context, let me take a moment to suggest some ways we can \nstrengthen the Lieberman-Warner bill--and I look forward to working \nwith those Senators and the entire committee--to aggressively reverse \nglobal warming. Most importantly, significant resources in this bill \nmust be explicitly allocated for energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy, the areas where we can get the greatest and quickest bang for \nthe buck. In terms of energy efficiency, my home city of Burlington, \nVT--and I have the honor of having been mayor of that city from 1981 to \n1989--despite strong economic growth, consumes no more electricity \ntoday than it did 16 years ago because of a successful citywide effort \non the part of our municipally owned electric company to make our \nhomes, offices, schools, and buildings all over the city more energy \nefficient. That is what we did in Burlington, VT. In California, which \nhas a strong and growing economy, electric consumption per person has \nremained steady over the last 20 years because of that State's \ncommitment to energy efficiency. In other words, in Burlington, VT, and \nthe State of California--and I am sure in other communities around the \ncountry--despite economic growth, the consumption of electricity does \nnot have to go soaring, if we invest in energy efficiency, if we rally \nthe people to not waste energy.\n  Numerous studies tell us that by retrofitting older buildings and by \nestablishing strong energy efficiency standards for new construction, \nwe can cut fuel and electric consumption by at least 40 percent. If we \nwant to save energy, that is how we do it. Those savings will increase \nwith such new technologies as LED light bulbs, which consume 1/10th the \nelectricity of an incandescent bulb, while lasting 20 years. These LED \nlight bulbs are on the verge of getting on the market. We have to \nfacilitate that process and get them all over the country as soon as we \npossibly can.\n  In terms of saving energy in transportation, it is beyond my \ncomprehension that we are driving automobiles today which get the same \nmileage per gallon--25 miles per gallon--as cars in this country did 20 \nyears ago. Think of all the technology, all of the changes. Yet we are \ndriving cars today which get the same mileage per gallon as was the \ncase 20 years ago. That is absurd. If Europe and Japan can average over \n44 miles per gallon, we can do at least as well. Simply raising CAFE \nstandards to 40 miles per gallon--less than the Europeans, less than \nthe Japanese--will save more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia. How \nabout that? That makes a lot of sense.\n  Further, we should also be rebuilding and expanding our decaying rail \nand subway systems and making sure energy-efficient buses are available \nin rural America so travelers have an alternative to the automobile. \nEverybody knows the state of the rail system in America today is \nabsolutely unacceptable, way behind Europe, way behind Japan. Subways \nin large cities need an enormous amount of work. In rural States such \nas Vermont, there are communities that have virtually no public \ntransportation at all. We have to address that crisis, if we are \nserious about global warming.\n  In terms of sustainable energy, the other area we can make tremendous \nleaps forward, wind power is now the fastest growing source of new \nenergy in the world and in the United States, but we have barely begun \nto tap its potential. In Denmark, for example, 20 percent of the \nelectricity is produced by wind. We, as a Congress, should be \nsupporting wind energy, not only through the creation of large wind \nfarms in the appropriate areas but through the production of small \ninexpensive wind turbines which can be used in homes and\n\n[[Page S14264]]\n\nfarms all across rural America. These small turbines can produce up to \nhalf the electricity an average home consumes and are now--right now, \nforget the future--reasonably priced. Without Federal tax credits, \nwhich are available, without rebates such as what is being done in \nCalifornia today, a 1.8-kilowatt turbine is now being sold for some \n$12,000, including installation, with a payback of 5 to 6 years. That \nis a pretty good deal. If you are not worried about global warming, if \nyou are not worried about carbon emissions, it is a good deal because \nyou are going to save money on your electric bill.\n\n  The possibilities for solar energy are virtually unlimited. In \nGermany, a quarter of a million homes are now producing electricity \nthrough rooftop photovoltaic units, and the price per kilowatt is \nrapidly declining. In California, that State is providing strong \nincentives so 1 million homes will have photovoltaic rooftop units in \nthe next 10 years. But the potential for solar energy goes far beyond \nrooftop photovoltaic units. Right now in the State of Nevada, a solar \nplant is generating 56 megawatts of electricity. What we are now \nbeginning to see developed in the Southwestern part of the country are \nsolar plants which are capable of producing enormous amounts of \nelectricity. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of \nthe U.S. Department of Energy:\n\n       Solar energy represents a huge domestic energy resource for \n     the United States, particularly in the Southwest where the \n     deserts have some of the best solar resource levels in the \n     world. For example, an area approximately 12% the size of \n     Nevada (15% of federal lands in Nevada) has the potential to \n     supply all of the electric needs of the United States.\n\n  Whether that area can in fact supply all the electric needs of the \nUnited States, I don't know. But I have recently, in the last couple \nweeks, talked to people who are involved in these solar plants. They \nsay in the reasonably near future, they can supply 20 percent of the \nelectricity our country needs. There it is, sitting there, ready to \nhappen. Our job is to facilitate that process and make it happen sooner \nrather than later.\n  Perhaps most significantly, Pacific Gas & Electric, which to my \nunderstanding is the largest electric utility in the country based in \nCalifornia, has recently signed a contract with Solel, an Israeli \ncompany, to build a 535-megawatt plant in the Mohave Desert. This \nplant, which should be operating in 4 years--my understanding is they \nare going to break ground in 2, and it should be operating in 4 years--\nwill have an output equivalent to a small nuclear powerplant and will \nproduce electricity for some 400,000 homes. This is not a small-time \noperation. The people I talked to involved in this industry say this is \nthe beginning. Think of what we can do if we provided them with the \nsupport they need.\n  Most importantly, people say: Well, that is a good idea, but \nunfortunately this electricity is going to be sky high, very expensive.\n  That is not the case. The price of the electricity generated by this \nplant to be online in 4 years is competitive with other fuels today and \nwill likely be much cheaper than other fuels in the future.\n  News reports indicate that the 25-year purchase agreement signed by \nPacific Gas and Electric with Solel calls for electricity to be \ninitially generated at about 10 cents per kilowatt, with very minimal \nincreases over the next 25 years--minimal increases because this is a \nprocess that does not have all that many moving parts. There it is. It \nneeds maintenance. It needs work. But, unlike gas, unlike oil, you are \nnot looking at a volatile market. There is the Sun. It will shine. So \nwe are talking about a price over a 25-year period which probably will \nend up being less than 15 cents a kilowatt in the year 2035, which I \nsuspect will be not only very competitive, it will be more than \ncompetitive.\n  The potential for solar plants in the Southwest is extremely strong. \nWhile there certainly is no magical silver bullet in the production of \nnew, nonpolluting energy sources, experts tell us we can build dozens \nof plants in the Southwest, and that this one nongreenhouse gas-\nemitting source could provide a huge amount of the electricity our \ncountry needs.\n  Geothermal energy is another source of sustainable energy that has \nhuge potential. Mr. President, as you know, geothermal energy is the \nheat from deep inside the Earth. It is free, it is renewable, and it \ncan be used for electricity generation and direct heating. While \ngeothermal is available at some depth everywhere, it is most accessible \nin Western States where hydrothermal resources are at shallow depths.\n  Currently, the United States has approximately 2,900 megawatts of \ninstalled capacity, which is just 5 percent--5 percent--of the \nrenewable electricity generation in the United States. The installed \ngeothermal capacity is already expected to double in the near term with \nprojects that are under development, but this is just the tip of the \niceberg.\n  A recent report for the U.S. Department of Energy by the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, suggests that geothermal \ncould provide 100,000 megawatts of new carbon-free electricity at less \nthan 10 cents per kilowatt hour, comparable to costs for clean coal. \nDrilling technology from the petroleum industry is the key to unlocking \nthis huge potential. Enhanced geothermal systems tap energy from hot \nimpermeable rocks that are between 2 and 6 miles below the Earth's \ncrust.\n  So geothermal is another opportunity for us as a nation to be \nproducing large amounts of energy in a way that does not emit carbon \ndioxide and does not create greenhouse gases.\n  An investment of $1 billion--less than the price of one coal-fired \npowerplant--could make this resource commercially viable within 15 \nyears. The potential payoff is huge. It is estimated that electricity \nfrom geothermal sources can provide 10 percent of the U.S. base-load \nenergy needs in 2050.\n  In terms of the future--in terms of the future of our planet--the bad \nnews is that scientists are now telling us they have underestimated the \nspeed and destructive aspects of global warming.\n  As you remember, Mr. President, the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, which recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, along with \nformer Vice President Al Gore--many of those scientists are now saying \ntheir projections were too conservative, that the planet is warming \nfaster than they had anticipated, and the damage will be greater if we \ndo not move boldly to reverse it. That is the bad news.\n  There is good news, however. The good news is that, at the end of the \nday, we know how to reverse global warming. We know what to do. What is \nlacking now is not the scientific knowledge, though more and more \nknowledge will come, and it is not the technology, though more and more \ntechnology will be developed, and sustainable energy will become less \nand less expensive. But after all is said and done, we know what we \nhave to do. We know how to make our homes and our transportation \nsystems more energy efficient. We are now making great progress in \ndriving down the cost of nonpolluting, sustainable energy technologies. \nThat is what we are doing.\n  What is lacking now is the political will--the political will to \nthink outside of the box, the political will to envision a new energy \nsystem in America which is not based on fossil fuels, the political \nwill to stand up to powerful special interests that are more concerned \nabout their profits than about the well-being of our planet.\n  So I think not only the children--the young people of our country and \nthe people all over America--but people throughout the world want this \nCongress to catch up to where they are. They are far ahead of where we \nare. I think if we have the courage to do the right thing here, we can \nreverse global warming. In the process, we can create millions of good-\npaying jobs, we can help restore our position in the international \ncommunity as a country that is leading and not following on this issue \nof huge consequence.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S14265]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin because I know he is going to \nbe speaking shortly, and I wanted to follow Senator Sanders.\n  As the Chair of the Environment Committee, I was very interested in \nhis presentation. I thank him for caring so deeply about global \nwarming. The thing we have to do around here is get a good bill down to \nthe floor. Because everything Senator Sanders talks about--geothermal, \nsolar--everything he talks about--green jobs--depends on our ability to \nget a good bill to the floor of the Senate.\n  What also is interesting is that Senator Sanders called the \nLieberman-Warner bill a very strong bill. I agree with him. It is a \nvery strong bill. And that is before we even make some perfecting \namendments out of subcommittee.\n  I think it is interesting, it is the evening time now. Senator Harkin \nis on the floor, and Senator Cardin is the Presiding Officer. Senator \nHarkin is a cosponsor of the Lieberman-Warner bill. Senator Harkin is \ntruly a great conservationist, as we are going to hear from him. He \ngave a presentation to us at our caucus lunch that showed how deeply \ncommitted he is to this country's environment.\n  The fact that he is on the Lieberman-Warner bill gave a great lift \nand a great boost to that piece of legislation. Mr. Cardin, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, sitting in the chair, our Presiding Officer, has played \na tremendous role already in moving forward the legislation if we are \ngoing to address global warming.\n  There is not any question that the ravages of global warming are \naround the corner. Is it going to be 20 years? Is it going to be 10 \nyears? Do we already see it? Some say yes--in Darfur, in some of the \nweather patterns, in some of the fires, in some of the floods, in some \nof the droughts--because the scientists tell us that unfettered global \nwarming will lead to extremes in weather. So it is coming down the \ntrack right at us.\n  We have some options in this Senate as to what we are going to do \nabout it. We can hold out for the ``perfect'' bill. I can say, as \nsomeone who wrote a bill with Senator Jeffords, and then Senator \nSanders: Oh, I know which bill is perfect for me; it is the bill I \nwrote. I know my friends in the Senate each could take their turn at \nwriting a bill, and that bill would be ``perfect'' for that Senator. \nBut this is a legislative body, and if you have 100 ``perfects,'' and \nwe cannot agree to come together on a very good bill, we get nothing \ndone.\n  I would suggest that for those who, very well-intentioned, decide to \nturn their back on a very good bill because it is not their idea of \n``perfect,'' I think that is an irresponsible position to find yourself \nin. I feel very strongly about that.\n  There is much about the Lieberman-Warner bill I am going to work to \nstrengthen in the full committee. If the bill gets to the floor, I am \ngoing to work hard to strengthen it. But I know, as long as it is a \nvery strong bill, we need to move it forward.\n  So we could hold out for the ``perfect.'' That is very dangerous \nbecause that leads to no bill. And no bill--doing nothing about global \nwarming in the face of all the science--would be very irresponsible.\n  The next thing we could do is have a bill that is very weak. I think \na very weak bill is dangerous because people will think, ``Oh, they \nhave taken care of global warming,'' when, in fact, we have not. You \nmay be stuck with a weak bill, and you cannot strengthen it, so that is \na problem too.\n  So it seems to me we could hold out for the ``perfect,'' and that \nmeans no bill, we could have a dangerously weak bill, which is a very \nbad option, or we could have a very good bill. We know that. We have \npeople who are saying: Wait a minute, this bill, Lieberman-Warner, is \ntoo weak. We heard some of that on the floor tonight. It is too weak. I \nwant an 80-percent cut in 2050, and it is 65 percent. So is the \nsolution to do nothing? I say no. Then we have many people on the other \nside who say this bill is too strong. It is kind of like the three \nbears--what is just right?\n\n  I think what is just right is a very strong bill that moves us \nforward, that asserts the real dangers of global warming, and we know \nwhat that is: sea level rise. Those of us who went to Greenland saw \nwhat could happen if that sheet melts. We could see huge increases in \nsea level for all of us who represent coastal States, and the whole \ncountry and the world will suffer. The intelligence community, the \nDepartment of Defense--they are saying to us: With a few feet rise in \nsea level, we are going to have refugee problems, we are going to have \nevery problem in the world. So the fact is, we can't turn our backs.\n  We had a hearing on the public health implications of unfettered \nglobal warming. The star witness was the head of the CDC, Julie \nGerberding, Dr. Gerberding. She is the top doc of the country. She had \nvery strong views that we have to look at the public health impacts. \nFor example, what is going to happen to our elderly when heat levels \nrise and they can't seek refuge? What is going to happen to our \nchildren when they are swimming in lakes and streams and rivers and \nthose bodies of water are so warm that dangerous amoebas live in those \nwaters? What is going to happen to them? What is going to happen to the \npeople of the world when they can't get the food they need?\n  So what happened was the White House redacted page after page of \ntheir own head of the CDC--they redacted page after page of their own \nhead of the CDC. Her testimony was redacted. When we wrote and asked \nfor it, the answer came back from the White House Counsel: Oh, no, we \ncouldn't possibly send you this. This is a breach of executive \nprivilege and the rest.\n  Can you believe, Mr. President, that the people of this country who \npay the taxes for the CDC employees cannot hear what the top doc has to \nsay about the ravages--the potential ravages--of global warming? This \nis what we are facing. Yet we see signs that the people who think our \nbill doesn't go far enough are going to team up with the people who \nwant to kill this legislation. What a tragedy that would be. And who \nloses? The people of the United States of America. These new \ntechnologies that are going to save us, the ones Senator Sanders talked \nabout--he talked with great passion about solar and wind and all the \nrest--you are not going to get it, folks, unless you have a bill that \nputs a price on carbon. If you hold out for your version of the \nperfect, trust me, it isn't going to happen, and you give false hope to \npeople--false hope to people.\n  So I would just say to my colleagues who may be listening that we \nhave a golden opportunity in the Environment Committee. We have held \nmore than 20 hearings on global warming. We have this bipartisan bill. \nWe have gotten it through the subcommittee. We are working to make it \nbetter, get it through the full committee and onto the floor of the \nSenate, where we will see where people stand. We will have amendments \nthat range from one extreme to the other, and we will see where people \nstand on global warming.\n  I would say to you, Mr. President, coming from a State that has done \nso much about this already, we are late to the game. We are late to the \ndance. We are late to the party. But we are not too late, unless \neverybody stands up and says: If I don't get it my way, then I will \nshow you the highway. We have a lot of that going on already. We have a \nPresident who really won't talk to us about anything. He won't talk to \nus about Iraq; he won't meet us halfway there. He won't talk to us \nabout CHIP; he won't meet us halfway there. He won't talk to us about \neducation funding; he won't meet us halfway there. Won't, won't, won't, \nwon't, won't. He vetoed the Water Resources Development Act. We \noverrode it. He still has never said he was wrong. There is too much of \nthat. We in the Senate have to show that we are adult enough to admit \nthat the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good, particularly when \nthere is so much at stake.\n  So I am excited about the work of the Environment Committee, and I am \nso pleased we had a bipartisan breakthrough. I am so grateful to all \nthe groups out there who are helping us, who are giving us the courage \nto move forward, because, believe me, special interests are going to be \npounding us, pounding us, pounding us.\n  To wrap this up, there are always people who say no to the science. \nThere are always people who say: Oh, no, HIV doesn't cause AIDS, I \ndon't believe it.\n\n[[Page S14266]]\n\nThere are always people who say cigarette smoking doesn't cause lung \ncancer. I am sure there were people who said to Jonas Salk: Your \nvaccine idea is just not going to work. We have to go with the \nconsensus view, and we have it on our side. We know we have to act.\n  So it is going to be an exciting time in the Environment Committee. \nIt is going to be an exciting time here on the floor when this \nlegislation comes to the floor. I don't know exactly when that will \nhappen, but it will happen, and when it does we will have a chance to \nfulfill our responsibility not just to our generation but to our kids' \ngeneration and our grandkids and future generations. I see young people \nsitting here on the floor of the Senate helping us out every day. Their \ngeneration has so much at stake.\n  I met with some young people from the UC system, UC Santa Cruz. They \nare going to 100 percent renewable energy to run UC Santa Cruz, and all \nof the different campuses, UC campuses, are going to try to do that. So \nwhether we vote here or we don't vote here, the people are way ahead of \nus. How sad it is if we were to walk away from this challenge because \nit wasn't just right on page 102 or page 6. It is never going to be \nperfect, I say to my colleagues, but we have an obligation to come \ntogether. We did it with the Clean Water Act years ago, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. We have really \nmoved forward, and we became a leader in the world. We are behind the \nworld today, and the world is looking to us.\n  So I am excited about this challenge, and I thank Senator Sanders for \nhis passion, for coming down and making the case for solar energy, \nmaking the case for wind energy. But I will say to him and everyone \nelse within the sound of my voice that it isn't going to happen unless \nthis Congress sets up a cap-and-trade system with mandatory cuts in \ncarbon. It just isn't going to happen the way it should.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank, Senator Harkin for \nthis time.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MENENDEZ). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is hard to believe, but we are on the \nfarm bill. As any casual observer might notice, we are not doing \nanything. We sit here with an empty Chamber. The farm bill has now been \non the floor for over a week. The farm bill was laid down a week ago \nyesterday, as a matter of fact, and nothing has happened. Why hasn't \nanything happened? Because we can't get anything from the other side.\n  We want to move ahead. We wanted to ask unanimous consent to go ahead \nwith an amendment with a time limit, vote on it, and move to another \namendment, but the other side refuses. The Republican leadership \nrefuses to move ahead on the farm bill. I suggested earlier today that \nwe may at least want to have some amendments up. We cannot get consent \non the other side. So here we sit. At this rate, we may not have a farm \nbill.\n  We worked very hard on it this year. First, on the other side in the \nHouse, they got a farm bill passed early. We met and worked hard on it \nall summer long and worked with the Finance Committee to get extra \nfunds to meet our obligations. I am checking on this right now, but I \nbelieve we had a record movement of a farm bill through our committee \nthis year--a day and a half, a short day and a half.\n  Now, this is my seventh farm bill. I have never seen anything move \nthat fast. It was the result of weeks and weeks and months and months \nof working with the other side, with everybody working together, \nhammering out agreements, before we brought it to the committee. That \nis a good way of doing things around here. You establish relationships, \nfigure out what people need to make sure they take care of their \nconstituents. We came out of committee with not one vote against the \nfarm bill. That never happened before, either, to the best of my \nmemory. We always have a split vote coming out of committee on the farm \nbill. So it took a day and a half to get it out.\n  I commend my ranking member, Senator Chambliss, who worked very hard \non his side to pull things together. I don't even know how many \namendments we had in that day and a half--four, five, or six--not very \nmany. We disposed of them; we either adopted them or not. When we voted \nthe bill out, we didn't have one dissenting vote.\n  So you would think a bill such as that coming to the floor could be \nhandled rapidly. But then we got here and we wanted to move it, so our \nmajority leader, exercising his right as majority leader, said we will \ndo this bill and we will do relevant amendments. If it is relevant to \nthe farm bill, we will take all comers. Bring them all. That sounds \ngood to me--open debate, open amendments. Bring on the amendments to \nthe farm bill. But the other side said, no, they may have some \nextraneous amendments dealing with children's health care, estate \ntaxes--I don't know what else. We may have had some on this side too. \nBut we were agreeing that we would not take any non-relevant \namendments, whether they were from Democrats or Republicans. I thought \nthat was a pretty good way to proceed, to just focus on the farm bill. \nThe Republican side said no.\n  We have been locked here for over a week. I say to my friends in farm \ncountry--farmers, ranchers, agribusiness, the suppliers, wholesalers, \nretailers, shippers, those who sell seed, the elevator operators, \nfertilizer dealers, and those in the livestock industry, who want to \nknow what the farm bill is like so they can plan ahead on whether they \nare going to milk more cows or fewer cows: Will the milk go to class A \nor class B? Will we feed more cattle or will we shift to feeding hogs? \nWhat is the lay of the land going to be? They need certainty. The \nlivestock market is volatile as it is, but they need some certainty as \nto what we are going to do here. That is why we worked very hard to get \nthe bill done, hopefully, by December, which is not unusual--except for \nthe last farm bill when I was chairman at that time, the House was in \nRepublican hands and the Senate was Democratic, and we got it through \nahead of schedule. But for that one exception, every farm bill comes in \nlate. That is just the nature of things around here, I guess. We \nusually get them done by December. The present farm bill is expired. We \nare now on a continuing resolution.\n  I say to my friends in farm and ranch country, you ought to be \ncalling up the minority leadership and saying we ought to get this farm \nbill through. We have to get it through. But if we don't move soon, we \nwill have an extension of the present farm bill. We will just extend \nit. All the work we have done this year will be for naught. We will \nhave to pick it up again some other time. That may be what will happen \nbecause of the fact that we cannot get an agreement to move ahead. We \nare stuck here at 6:20 in the evening, and we have been on the bill 1 \nweek with not one amendment. All we ask is for the other side to bring \nforth amendments, and we will get ours and start moving.\n  I know we are trying to work things out. After a while, my patience \nruns out. Next week, we have Thanksgiving. People want to go home for \nThanksgiving. If we don't finish the farm bill this week, it is going \nto be hard to have a farm bill done before we go home for Christmas. I \nknow what it is like after Thanksgiving when we come back. We have 3 \nweeks, and we have all our appropriations bills. I am chairman of one \nof the appropriations subcommittees. We have all that to do. We have \nthe Iraq war funding to consider, and we have some tax bills. Everybody \nis going to want to get out of here and get home for Christmas.\n  I say to all those watching, if we don't get a farm bill done this \nweek, it will be hard to get one done this year. Maybe we will have to \ngo into next year sometime to get it done. I hope that doesn't happen, \nbut here we sit with no action, and there are going to be other things \nto be brought up this week, such as conference reports.\n  So here we sit. I hope we can reach some agreement and move ahead \nrapidly. If we don't, it looks as if we may be in for a long continuing \nresolution on the farm bill--either into next year or beyond. I don't \nknow when we can\n\n[[Page S14267]]\n\nfinally get it done. But it is too important to just leave it go. We \nwould like to get it done. Is there everything in the farm bill I would \nhave wished for? No. Senator Chambliss and every member of the \ncommittee could say the same thing. That is the art of compromise. This \nbill is a good compromise among all regions of the country. I hope we \ncan move ahead.\n  I want to talk a little about one area of the farm bill about which I \nfeel very passionate. Even though we have done some good things, we \nhaven't done as much as we need to do, considering the enormity of what \nconfronts us in terms of the loss of our soil, the pollution of our \nwater and waterways, and the degradation of whole areas of this country \nbecause of intensive cropping or lack of good practices. We are facing \na dire circumstance in this country where we are going to lose the \nproductivity of our soil. Almost like global warming, it may reach a \npoint where the scales have tipped so far that to get the productivity \nback, to clean up our waterways might be almost impossible or will cost \nso much money that we won't be able to do it.\n  All of the farmers I have fought for so hard over these last 32 years \nare what I call the front line of conservationists. Farmers and \nranchers want to protect the soil. They want to leave it better for \nfuture generations. When you are caught between a rock and a hard place \nin terms of all of the input costs, what it costs to produce a crop, \nthe demands on those crops, and some negative incentives in the system \nright now in terms of Government support to farming and ranching--you \nput all those together, and there is a counterpressure, if you will, \nfrom the Government and from society at large against the farmer being \na good conservationist.\n  We are placing tremendous demands on our food and fiber producers in \nthis country--tremendous demands--and, with the ethanol boom and \nothers, even more demand for the productivity of our soil. So what is \nhappening right now, in many cases, is we are pushing it to the limits \nand beyond the limits to what soil can carry and what our water can \ncarry, and now we have to think about being really good \nconservationists, not on the scale of the individual farmer but on a \nnational scale.\n  I wish to take some time to talk about conservation and what is \nhappening in our country at large in terms of conservation and what is \nhappening to our soil and water in America and why we have to do \nsomething about it and why little steps, little things aren't going to \ndo it. We need some big steps, big interventions, just as we do on \nglobal warming. The previous two speakers talked about that. If we just \ntinker around the edges, it won't mean anything. It is the same with \nconservation. We need a national commitment to a conservation ethic to \nrestore, renew, and preserve our waterways, our soil, our wildlife \nhabitats, and, yes, the source of our water. All that needs to be \npreserved.\n  I have some pictures I wanted to point to here, some charts to give \nan idea of what I am talking about. I will bet you, Mr. President, a \nlot of Americans have seen this first picture somewhere. Every school \nkid has seen it in a history book. It is reprinted time and time again \nin one of our periodical magazines, talking about the great Dust Bowl \nof the 1930s.\n  What was the Dust Bowl? It took place in the panhandles of Oklahoma, \nTexas, some in New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, up into Nebraska, and \nstretching up into South Dakota. This is one of the famous pictures \ntaken in Cimarron, OK, in 1936 in the Dust Bowl. You can see there is \nno grass, nothing. You can see that the top of the posts are covered \nwith dust. And there is a farmer and his kids running to take shelter \nfrom yet another one of the dust storms. That was in Cimarron County.\n\n  The year before that, in 1935, under President Franklin Roosevelt, \nthe Soil Conservation Act passed and the Soil Conservation Service \nbegan providing help and service to farmers on conservation.\n  The next picture shows what happened that year. This is another \nfamous picture, of a dust cloud in Kansas. On April 14, 1935, a dust \nstorm started in eastern Montana, western North Dakota, rumbled through \nSouth Dakota into Nebraska, across Kansas into Oklahoma and into Texas. \nThis dust storm was called Black Sunday. It was the biggest dust storm \never. In fact, it was preceded the previous year by a dust storm that \nswept from west to east that dumped dust on New York City. New York \nCity got so dark it had to turn on its lights. Ships at sea could not \ndock in New York City because of the dust.\n  There is a wonderful book that I recommend that was released last \nyear. This book by Timothy Egan is called ``The Worst Hard Time: The \nUntold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl.'' I \nrecommend this book.\n  First of all, it is a great read. He tells a wonderful story about \nthe Dust Bowl, but he tells the history of the whole area and what \nhappened in that area in the 1890s, 1900s, 1910s, 1920s, up to the \n1930s. Here is what he said:\n\n       By some estimates, more than 80 million acres in the \n     southern plains were stripped of topsoil.\n\n  Mr. President, 80 million acres.\n\n       In less than 20 years, a rich cover that had taken several \n     thousand years to develop was disappearing day by day.\n\n  Eighty million acres of grassland turned over, grassland that he says \nin the book was laid down almost 20,000 years ago. As he said, this was \nland the buffalo couldn't hurt, the tornadoes, the fires, and the \nfloods struck, but the grasslands stayed, and they came back year after \nyear.\n  But then there was the land rush. That area was opened up to \nhomesteaders. They came in with plows and new equipment. They plowed it \nall up, turned it over.\n  As one person said in Timothy Egan's book, he looked around and said: \nThere is something wrong here; the wrong side is up. The dirt is up and \nthe grass is down and the wind started blowing. And then came Black \nSunday, April 14, 1935, the worst dust storm in recorded history. I \ndon't mean in this century; I mean in recorded history, the worst dust \nstorm ever.\n  Again, when people look at that picture and they read about Black \nSunday, they say: That is all over with; we took care of that \nsituation. But look at this next photograph: a dust storm, the same as \nyou saw before, and this time with color photography. That is a dust \nstorm in the same area in Kansas, taken last year. The same huge dust \nstorms rumbling through the plains because we have, once again, \nstripped the soil bare, turned the wrong side up, and we lack good \nconservation practices.\n  Here is another picture. This one could have been in the thirties \njust as the first picture I showed, but this was taken in South Dakota \nlast year. Here is a fence. We can barely see it. The top of the fence \nis almost covered, and it stretches as far as the eye can see. That is \njust dust and a few tumbleweeds. That is South Dakota last year.\n  I hope we can recall the lessons of the thirties and what putting \nmarginal cropland in production will really cost us.\n  This farm bill will prohibit allowing newly broken native sod into \nthe Crop Insurance Program. That is vitally important because you \ncannot be covered under the disaster provisions of this farm bill \nunless you buy crop insurance. So if you turn over native sod, you \ncannot get crop insurance on the newly broken land, and you will not \nget disaster payments, and you will not be eligible then for all the \nother programs. So there is a strong provision in this bill to at least \nsave some of the native sod because history can and will and does \nrepeat itself, as we have just shown.\n  That is the dust. Here is the water. This is a cornfield in my part \nof the country. We can see that it has rained, and there is water \nrunning off. It is running probably into a ditch, that ditch drains \nprobably into a small stream, that small stream runs into a bigger \nriver, and that river goes into either the Missouri River or the \nMississippi River.\n  What happens is when this soil and water runs off, it is taking with \nit phosphorous, and it is taking with it nitrogen, washing down into \nthe river. What happens to it? When it goes down river, it winds up \ndown south of New Orleans. In this next photograph, the red area is \ncalled the hypoxic area, the dead zone in the mouth of the Mississippi. \nThis picture was taken by satellite this year. That area in red is now\n\n[[Page S14268]]\n\nthe size of New Jersey. These nutrient levels are so high, that it \ntriggers an explosive growth of algae; when the algae dies, the \ndecomposition process consumes all the oxygen, so all marine life \ndies--no crabs, no shrimp, no nothing.\n  So, again, the water we saw running off these fields goes into the \nMississippi, and this is what happens to it.\n  What can be done about it? There are things that can be done about \nit. This picture show us one. I showed you a picture a little bit ago \nof the water running off the field. That wouldn't happen here. This is \nthe Boone River watershed, Hamilton County, IA. We see buffer strips \nalong the streams. So if there is a heavy rain, any runoff will be \ntrapped by the trees and the grasslands and whatever else is in \nbetween.\n  Those nutrients are good for trees. It makes them grow. The trees \nkeep the nutrients from going in the water. Practices such as this are \npromoted by several conservation programs--the Conservation Stewardship \nProgram, the EQIP program, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, and the Conservation Reserve Program, especially the \ncontinuous signup.\n\n  What is so important to note is that these are incentives paid to \nfarmers to do these strips. One might say: Why wouldn't farmers just do \nthat on their own? Why? Because of economics. The Senator was present \ntoday when I mentioned earlier about my backyard. I happen to be one of \na few people who actually lives in the house in which he was born. Not \nmany people can say that. I actually live in the house in which I was \nborn.\n  A lot of people say: Harkin, I live in the house I grew up in.\n  I said: That is not what I said. I live in the house in which I was \nborn. I wasn't born in a hospital. I was born in a house, as were all \nmy five siblings. We lived in a small town in rural Iowa. People were \nborn at home.\n  In my home, we have a nice backyard with fruit trees. My wife planted \na nice garden out there. Ever since I was a kid, I always thought I \nknew where the end of our garden was to the east, and there has always \nbeen a field there, about a 140-acre field with corn and beans.\n  Because of the high price of corn and the high price of beans, the \nowner of that property sent a notice to all of us who live around it \nsaying: I just had my property resurveyed, and my property is about 6 \nfeet more into your property than what you think.\n  He has his rights. No one ever bothered to think about it in the \npast. We had our garden there, and we had our trees. As a consequence, \nI am going to have to have some of our bushes and trees taken out and \nmove the line back. I guess I mind a little bit, but the guy is within \nhis rights.\n  One might think: What does 6 feet mean? Up until now, 6 feet never \nmeant a hoot to any farmer who farmed that land, and it has gone \nthrough three or four different hands. No one ever cared about it. \nBecause the demands are now so high on the owner of that property, and \nI am sure the farmer who farms that land says: You know, that extra 6 \nfeet, I can grow a few more rows of corn in there and get some more \nmoney. So before next year we have to move everything back, and they \nget another 6 feet.\n  I tell that story to demonstrate the pressures that farmers are under \nto plow and plant right up to the fence row or anyplace they can get.\n  I don't know the farmer who owns that land in this photograph, but I \ncan tell you his economic pressures are to plant right up to the \nstream, to get rid of all that buffer and plant right up to the stream. \nWhy doesn't he? Because he is in a conservation program that is giving \nhim incentives, payments to provide a continuous strip through there. \nHe might have made a little more money if he had planted right up to \nit, but he has probably a CRP agreement for 10 years, maybe has a CSP \ncontract.\n  I know a lot of farmers in Iowa who have done buffers like this. You \nknow what, Mr. President. They feel better about it. They feel better \nabout it because they know they are helping keep the water clean. They \nare farming the way nature really meant for them to farm. But because \nof economic pressures, they need help.\n  That is what this farm bill does, it provides some help and support. \nThey get a benefit, but I can tell you, he probably would make more \nmoney if he plowed right up to the stream. But he is willing to give up \na little bit as long as he gets some help from the Government to put \nthis buffer in. They feel better about it.\n  What do we get out of it? Cleaner water, fish, not hypoxia down in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. It cleans up our waterways. It preserves our soil \nfor future generations. That is what is in this farm bill, to help them \ncontinue to do that.\n  I talked about the Midwest. How about the East? Here is a farm in \nPennsylvania that uses many of our conservation practices. We see strip \ncropping and contour farming. They have some corn, maybe some alfalfa \nin there for livestock. It is good conservation practice. It looks as \nif he has a good rotation practices on this land.\n  There is one other item in this photograph. We see the city out here. \nIt is encroaching on his farmland. There is a program called the \nFarmland Protection Program which buys easements on land, permanent \neasements on land. So that land cannot be converted to development; it \nhas to stay as farmland. Again, here is a farmer. He could be getting \nCSP, the Conservation Stewardship Program. He may have gotten some EQIP \nmoney, and he may be getting farmland protection program money. I don't \nknow. But those are all programs involved in preserving the land. We \ncan see the strip cropping on the hillside and the contour plowing. \nThat is what he has done to hold back the water. Again, part of our \nfarm bill is to provide money for the Farmland Protection Program.\n\n  Here is something a little bit closer to where we are here in the \nCapitol. Any of us who have been around this area for any time knows \nthe Chesapeake Bay is polluted. Now, not all of that Chesapeake Bay \npollution is because of farmland. There is a lot of industrial waste \ncoming from factories and from other places up and down--plants, people \ndumping stuff out and going into the Chesapeake Bay. That has to be \nstopped. But a big part of the Chesapeake Bay problem is the nutrients \ncoming off a lot of our land, such as livestock waste. It comes from \nthe whole Chesapeake Bay watershed, which extends all the way to New \nYork State. So New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, \nMaryland, a little bit of West Virginia, all that water dumps into the \nChesapeake Bay, eventually.\n  Here is a farm in New Castle County, DE. Again, this is a prime \nexample of conservation of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Prior to this \npicture being taken--you can see some wetlands and farm fields in the \nbackground--where that wetland is, crops used to grow. So from those \nfields, nutrients ran off right into the bay. Through conservation \nprograms and through the Wetlands Reserve Program, this farmer has gone \nback and, with the help of conservation, has put this back into a \nwetlands, secluded off from the Chesapeake Bay, so any runoff filters \nthrough the wetlands. It filters through the wetlands before it gets to \nthe Chesapeake Bay.\n  If anybody wants to see how a wetlands works, you don't have to go \nmore than about 15 miles from where this Capitol is, southwest of here. \nThere is something called the Huntley Meadows Wetlands Reserve. I \nrecommend it highly for anyone. Go down there and take a stroll through \nthe wetlands. They have done a great job. They have preserved the \nwetlands, and it is right in the middle of a city. All of a sudden you \ngo from housing developments and busy thoroughfares up Route 1 and down \nsouth, and all of a sudden you are in a wetlands area. A lot of the \nrunoff from apartment houses and businesses and parking lots and \neverything else drains into this wetlands. By the time it gets through \nand dumps into the Potomac River, it is clean. The wetlands cleans it \nup. It is 15 miles from here where you can see it happen, Huntley \nMeadows.\n  This bill provides $160 million for the Chesapeake Bay to do this \nkind of work to back up into the farmlands, restore wetlands, and help \nfarmers build the structures and do the things to clean up the \nChesapeake Bay. We can do it. This farmer did it in Delaware.\n  Now, this photo is from Georgia. Well, you can't see much except this \nshows pine trees back here. All pine\n\n[[Page S14269]]\n\ntrees back here, but in the past they were overgrown and so thick that \nwildlife could not use it for habitat. So they thinned it out to \nprovided for some wildlife cover in that area. One of Senator \nChambliss's priorities was to add a feature to the Conservation Reserve \nProgram that will result in better management of soft wood pine stands \ncurrently enrolled in the CRP. The Senate bill invests $84 million in \nthis effort. Again, showing the breadth and the depth of what we are \ndoing on conservation in forested areas in the South, making sure we \nhave good conservation at work there also.\n  And lest we forget about the West, this is Arizona. This is well-\nmanaged grazing land. The Conservation Stewardship Program provides \nincentives to increase current conservation, use better management \npractices, such as rotational grazing that better utilizes the resource \nbase and increases wildlife habitat. The Senate bill continues to \ndevote 60 percent of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to \nlivestock needs.\n  Again, it is hard to see here, but what we are trying to show with \nthis is that with fences, with rotational grazing, you don't feed down \nall the grass and don't create areas where the wind blows all the dust, \nor if they have a heavy rain it runs the soil off. This is good \nconservation practice and rotational grazing. You graze for a while, \nthen you move them on. But in order to do that, you obviously need some \nfences, and fences cost money. So we provide that kind of help. If a \nrancher wants to get involved in good conservation practices with \nrotational grazing, we help with that. We help with that. So even in \nthe Arizona southwest, we can make a difference.\n  Well, now you might wonder about this picture. Well, we are all \nfamiliar with the problems affecting honeybees and other pollinating \nspecies. In this farm bill, we have made strategic changes to help with \nthis issue. In the Conservation Reserve Program, the Conservation \nStewardship Program, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nwe emphasize the creation and improvement of both the native and \nmanaged pollinator habitat. We require the Secretary of Agriculture to \nupdate conservation standards to include consideration for pollinators. \nNow, our Senate bill provides clear direction to focus conservation \nprograms on creating, improving, and maintaining pollinator habitats \nand to revise and update conservation practices to include pollinators.\n  Again, together these practices will help to establish better \npollination. We know we have had a problem with honeybees dying. We \ndon't know exactly what is causing it. They are doing a lot of research \non it now. But we do know one thing. In order for our prairies once \nagain to blossom and do all the kinds of conservation work we need, we \nneed that little animal called a honeybee for pollination purposes. So \nthis bill invests in that also.\n  Coming full circle, when I started off my talk, I showed pictures of \nthe great Dust Bowl in Kansas and places such as that--eastern \nColorado. That is where this picture was taken. If you could take a \npicture of here in 1935, you would see the Dust Bowl. What has happened \nin this area, obviously a housing development has grown up, but in the \nforeground you will see grassland. That is a grassland reserve. They \ncan't build houses there. You see a part of it, but this is a huge \ngrassland reserve--protected by an easement that ensures that it stays \nin agricultural production. Grass will grow there, and livestock will \ngraze, and the grass will hold the soil down, and keep the dust from \nblowing.\n\n  So, again, in this Grassland Reserve Program, there are about a \nmillion acres enrolled right now, but we haven't been doing it very \nlong. Remember, I mentioned in the Dust Bowl that 80 million acres--80 \nmillion acres--were turned up. We have a million in protected \ngrassland. We have a long way to go. We have a long way to go. But we \nput in $240 million for the Grassland Reserve Program in this bill to \ncontinue the program.\n  Now, again, I want to digress a little bit on this grassland. You \nsee, one of the other things we are doing in our farm bill is we are \nproviding money for ethanol--cellulosic ethanol. Ethanol not made from \nrow crops, such as corn, but cellulose made from grass, such as this. \nWith the research we are doing, we know we can make ethanol from these \ngrasses. We are getting the right enzymes to make it economical. The \nscientists and engineers tell me that in 5 years or so we will have an \neconomical means of making cellulosic ethanol. We are already investing \nin that in several ethanol plants around the country.\n  Imagine, if you will, this huge area of grasslands in the Plains \nStates, where I showed the picture of the Dust Bowl.\n  This is the picture I showed earlier of a dust storm in Kansas last \nyear. Now imagine, if you will, that rather than cropping this land, as \nwe do every year, we have grassland. Now, as Timothy Egan pointed out \nin his book, nature has a way of selecting the best ecosystem over a \nlong period of time. Nature does that, whether it is the rain forest up \nin the Northwest, the bay area here for shellfish and others, and \nbackwaters, where all the fish life starts, or in the grasslands in the \nPlains areas. So over thousands and thousands and thousands of years, \nnature laid down this thin topsoil, and on top of it grew grasses--\nbuffalo grass, blue stem, others--and through selectivity, over periods \nof time, were the hardiest to grow there. They sent their roots down \n20, 30 feet into the ground, and they could withstand years of drought, \nthe worst blizzards, and grass fires that used to sweep across the \nPlains.\n  Anyone who has ever read the Laura Ingalls Wilder book ``Little House \non the Prairie'' knows how she talks about the threat of these huge \nfires sweeping through and all of that kept coming back, the grasslands \nthat were there. Millions of buffalo ranged up and down there and had \nenough food to sustain them forever, and in 20 years we turned over 80 \nmillion acres of it that then dried up and blew away.\n  But think about this. We are going to have cellulose ethanol made \nfrom grass. Ten years from now, fifteen years from now, twenty years \nfrom now, we could see much of this land back into grassland. Not for \nbuffalo to graze on but being grown as cellulosic feedstock being cut \nfor ethanol and making fuel for our country. You don't have to plow it \nup. You leave it there, you cut it, it stays there and grows the next \nyear. We can have the best conservation, we can have our grasslands, \nand we can produce the fuel we need for this country and do it in a way \nthat is in concert with nature.\n  So that is why it is so important we get this grassland back and \nprovide the incentives to protect as much of this grass as possible, \nand that is why we put $240 million into this bill.\n  The last couple of things I want to show is the Conservation Security \nProgram, now renamed the Conservation Stewardship Program, which has \nenrolled about 15 million acres since 2002. This was a new program put \ninto the farm bill in 2002. You see, most conservation programs are \nprograms designed to give incentives to someone to take land out of \nproduction, put it into grassland, put it in trees, wetlands and buffer \nstrips. And that is an important part of conservation.\n  But there is a lot of working lands. We need farmers to be better \nconservationists on working lands, lands that are being cropped. That \nmeans, for example, putting on the right amount of fertilizer and other \nmanagement practices that can make a big difference for the \nenvironment.\n  Through the Conservation Security Program, I saw areas where farmers \nenrolled, and transitioned to precision agriculture, with equipment \nguided by the Global Positioning System. They had soil tests done of \ntheir farm, and rather than applying the same amount of fertilizer all \nover, they put the right amount of fertilizer wherever they applied \nit--more one place, less in another place. They were able to monitor \nand get the right amount of fertilizer so it wouldn't run off. They \nwere able to buy equipment so they could do minimum tillage, where they \ndidn't have to turn the soil over with the plow. They could combine, \ncut the cornstalks and leave it right there on the ground.\n  I visited a farm in southern Iowa this summer that was in the \nConservation Security Program. With help the farmer received from the \nprogram, he had purchased some equipment to do what I am talking about. \nThen he took me over his land. He had corn last year. This year, he is \nplanting beans. So he\n\n[[Page S14270]]\n\nis on a rotation, which is good for the soil. But he left all his \ncornstalks chopped and laid on the ground. At the time of my visit, \nthere was rain in his area. It rained almost 5 inches--5 inches in \nabout 12 hours. Now that is a heavy rain. We drove all over his land in \na four-wheel drive vehicle. He hardly had any soil runoff because that \nrain would hit those cornstalks on the ground, slide off--he almost had \nliterally no soil runoff.\n\n  Right across the road was a farmer who was not in the program and was \nplanting corn up and down the hillsides and there were ditches where \nthe water had taken that soil and run off the farm into other ditches, \ninto streams, and the soil was gone.\n  The program in the 2002 farm bill was a conservation program to help \nfarmers be better conservationists on land on which they were actually \nproducing crops or livestock. They didn't have to take land out of \nproduction. They just had to do things better: minimum tillage, crop \nrotations, buffer strips, applying with the right amount of \nfertilizer--that type of thing. For producers who have been able to \nenroll, it has worked wonderfully.\n  But there has been one problem. The administration decided to allow \nenrollment on the basis of a watershed rotation. Over eight years, the \nprogram would supposedly cover all the watersheds in the country, but \nit has fallen far short of that goal. That is the bad news.\n  The good news is in this farm bill we get off the watershed rotation, \nand make CSP a national program--producers in every watershed and \nregion of the states would be eligible to enroll, every year. Producers \nare ranked based upon the level of conservation they are already doing, \nand how much new conservation they are willing to do as part of the \ncontract. We are strengthening this program.\n  It is hard to see on this chart, but the conservation security \nprogram is in every State in the Nation. It is all over, from \nWashington, Oregon, California, all across the east coast. A lot of \npeople have said it is mostly for the Midwest. That is not true. On the \neast coast, on the far west up in Idaho. We even have some in Alaska, \neven some in Hawaii--again, to protect our soil and other resources.\n  The point I want to make here is in the last 5 years since we put \nthis program in, we have enrolled 15 million acres. I know that sounds \nlike a lot, but under the new program we have in this bill, with the \nfunding we have, we will enroll 13.2 million acres each year in this \nprogram--13.2 million acres every year. We had 15 million acres in 5 \nyears. We will do almost as much every year for the next 5 years. This \nmeans by the end of this farm bill we will have about 80 million acres \nenrolled in this program.\n  What will that mean? It will mean cleaner water, better wildlife \nhabitats, less soil runoff; a better environment, a healthier \nenvironment for farmers, their families, and for all of us. That is why \nthis program is so important.\n  It is sad to say, the House didn't put anything into this program and \nactually cut the program from baseline. It is an important program, one \nthat can do a lot of good for our country. But it needs to be funded \nproperly to give producers a fair shot at enrolling for it to do the \ngood it has the potential of doing.\n  Last, here is the kind of thing we are looking at here. We talked \nabout the soil and the land but it all comes down to people and the \nkind of people we have farming, and their families. That is what it \ncomes down to. How do we nurture beginning farmers? How do we get young \npeople involved in this?\n  Here is a young dairy farmer, Matt Fendry. He is 25 years old. He \nfarms near Lanesboro in southeast Minnesota. He is a beginning farmer. \nHe sells his milk through Organic Valley out of Lafarge, WI.\n  Matt, like many beginning farmers and ranchers, will benefit from the \nprovisions we have in the conservation title. Here is how we do it.\n  For beginning farmers like Matt Fendry, and socially disadvantaged \nproducers, we have included a special increase in cost-share rates up \nto 90 percent. So if the young man here wants to do good conservation \nwork on his land--maybe rotational grazing the grassland for his \ncattle--it probably will cost him a little bit to get some things \nestablished. He can get back 90 percent. He only has to put up 10 \npercent of this money. The Government will come in for 90 percent for a \nbeginning farmer.\n  Ten percent of our conservation programs will be reserved for \nbeginning farmers. And for the first time we will allow the Secretary \nof Agriculture to advance up to 30 percent of the value of an EQIP \ncontract to beginning and socially disadvantaged producers so they can \npurchase the materials they need for conservation work.\n  Most of the EQIP money that will go to Matt for what he will do for \ngood conservation would come after he does it, maybe a year after. That \nmeans he would have to borrow the money, and pay interest. Now we give \nthe Secretary authority to get what he needs, 30 percent up front, so \nif he needs to put in fencing, buy seed, whatever he needs to get this \noperation going using good conservation, he can get up front.\n  I think that is probably the bottom line here on my whole talk this \nevening, and that is what can we do for conservation. But what can we \ndo to get young people involved in a way so they start from the very \nbeginning, not just being a producer but being an environmentally \nconscious producer and one who, from the very beginning, protects our \nsoil, our water, and our wildlife habitat? That is the goal of this.\n  You can see I am very passionate about this. I am passionate because \nif you read history, you know what we are doing. We saw it in the \nphotos at the beginning of my presentation--we are repeating the \nmistakes of the past. We are abusing the land and pushing it beyond its \nproductive capacity. As I said--the farmers want to protect their soil \nand their land. But the economics of agriculture drives producers to \nproduce as much as they can when prices are high. The farm bill has to \ncounter those pressures.\n  It is not good for this country. It is not good for our society. It \nis not good for rural America. So we need to make some changes in this \nfarm bill and redirect it and guide it toward more conservation.\n\n  Back in 1998, I was wondering why it was that Europe was spending so \nmuch of government money on their farmers, yet they were complying with \nthe World Trade Organization restrictions on farm subsidies. We are \nspending less money on our farmers and somehow we are not complying. I \nwanted to see what were they doing in Europe different than we were \ndoing. So I traveled around and visited a lot of their farms.\n  No matter where I went, I saw a pristine countryside. I saw a \ncountryside with small towns that were vibrant. I saw soil that was \nprotected, waterways that were decently clean--some areas better than \nothers. Finally I began to figure it out, what countries like France, \nBelgium, Germany, Spain, England, and Denmark were doing. They were \nmaking ``green payments'' to farmers, payments to farmers for \nconservation. Under the WTO, that is in the ``green box,'' which means \nit doesn't count against WTO limits. So some of the Europeans figure \nout here is the way we support our farmers, our small towns, our \ncommunities, clean up our water, provide for a beautiful countryside, \nand, guess what, we don't take a hit in the WTO because of that.\n  That made me think. I come back, traveling around through this \ncountry, I see the wind blowing, I see the dust storms, the soil \nerosion, the hypoxia maps in the Gulf of Mexico, what is happening to \nthe Chesapeake Bay, and I think: Wait a minute, why aren't we doing \nthat?\n  We have a program now, a direct payment program--$5 billion a year, \n$25 billion over the life of this farm bill, that started in 1996, of \ndirect payments to farmers. To qualify for direct payments, all you had \nto do is have base acreage and a certain crop back in 1981 to 1985. You \ndon't have to plant anything to get this money.\n  Moreover, the bigger you are, and the bigger the base you had, the \nmore money you get. The result is that these payments lead to a cycle. \nMore direct payments means a greater opportunity to expand. More \nexpansion means more direct payments. It is like a black hole, there is \nnothing to stop it.\n  I am concerned that this cycle is hurting family farmers. It \nencourages producers to get bigger and bigger. Yet here we go, $5 \nbillion a year, $25 billion\n\n[[Page S14271]]\n\nover the life of this. It seems to me it would make much more sense and \nwould be more supported, I think, by the general populace, if we took \nthat money and put it out in green payments to farmers to build the \nbuffer strips, the contours, the wetlands, the grasslands--yes, paying \nfarmers to help them use the right amount of fertilizer and do \nrotations and things such as that, that help preserve the soil.\n  Conservation programs are perfectly acceptable under WTO. We get a \nlot out of it. I am hopeful in the coming weeks, maybe as we go to \nconference on this farm bill, we can do more for conservation.\n  I want to say we did a good job on conservation in this bill. I am \nnot denying that. We put good money in conservation. I thank my ranking \nmember, Saxby Chambliss, and all the others on the committee. It was a \nhard fight but we got the money in there. But it is not quite enough \nwhen you look at all the other things in the farm bill. We moved the \nball forward, but I think with the demands on our farmers now, what we \nsee happening around this country, we need an even greater commitment. \nWe need to do a lot more in conservation than we have ever done before \nor pretty soon the scales will tip so far that the kind of money it is \ngoing to take it to do it will be prohibitive.\n  That is why I take the time of the Senate tonight to talk about \nconservation. We need a better conservation ethic in this country. As \nwe consider the farm bill, we need to be talking about soil and water \nconservation, helping farmers be better stewards of the soil and water. \nI am hopeful as we move into more debate we can make a few changes that \nwill add some money to conservation before we go to conference. We have \ndone a lot in the farm bill, but we have a lot more we can do.\n  So I ask any Senator out there who has an amendment, if you have not \nfiled it, you better file it because pretty soon we may cut it off.\n  I am not encouraging amendments, you understand. I am just saying, if \nyou have one, you better get it in in a hurry, and we will take a look \nat it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nCalendar No. 206, the nomination of James Kunder to be Deputy \nAdministrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development; that \nthe nomination be confirmed; the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable; the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; \nand the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Reserving the right to object, I understand that \nSenator Coburn, who was on the Senate floor a little earlier, has an \nobjection to this request. On his behalf I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to say to all of our \ncolleagues, we have worked diligently to try to come together with a \nlist of amendments on the farm bill to try to make sure that we proceed \nin some sort of regular order over the next several days.\n  Unfortunately, we have been here all day without being able to \nconsider amendments. It is the unfortunate part of the way we do \nbusiness in this body, trying to be deliberate, trying to make sure we \nare fair, not operating under a rule like our colleagues in the House \ndo.\n  It is the way the Senate is designed to work. I think now it appears \nour leaders are going to be able to sit down with a list of amendments \nthat have come forward from the majority side of the aisle, a list of \namendments that have come forward from the minority side of the aisle, \nand we are going to be able to agree that these are all of the \namendments that can be considered.\n  There is no agreement that all of them are germane, but there is \nhopefully going to be an agreement shortly that will allow us to \nproceed in the regular order for the consideration of amendments. It is \na frustrating process that we go through from time to time.\n  When we were in the majority and our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle were in the minority, again, there was many a day that we sat \nwanting to move forward and not being able to because of the way the \nprocess in the Senate works.\n  I would simply say to our colleagues that I fully expect that we are \ngoing to have an agreement, which means we should be able to move \nforward with the farm bill tomorrow, from an amendment consideration \nstandpoint. Senator Harkin and I pretty well agreed on the order of a \ncouple of amendments that we will begin with that are critical \namendments for consideration.\n  I am very hopeful that within the next couple of days not only will \nwe make significant progress on the farm bill, but I am very hopeful, \nas I know Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, and all of us are who have \nbeen working very hard together in a bipartisan way to get this bill \nbefore our colleagues, to have it considered before we get away from \nhere for Thanksgiving so we can complete it early on in December and, \nhopefully, get it to the desk of the President in time that farmers and \nranchers across this country will know what the farm policy is going to \nbe for the next 5 years versus having to enter into the end-of-the-year \nprocess with a big question mark out there.\n  I simply say, again, we hope that is going to happen. I hope before \nwe leave here in the next several minutes, whatever it may be, that we \ndo have some agreement on the direction in which we are moving with \nrespect to amendments to be offered to the farm bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are still, as I understand, on the 2007 \nfarm bill. I wanted to speak to one particular title of that bill, if I \nmight, today.\n  As I have noted before, I support the Food Security and Energy \nSecurity Act of 2007, which is currently before the Senate. My hope is \nthat in the not too distant future, we will be able to reach an \nagreement with regard to amendments so that we can move this process \nforward.\n  My fear is, if we do not reach any resolution this week and this gets \npushed back until after the Thanksgiving break, that we run a very \nserious risk that we are not going to be able to get a bill through the \nSenate, conferenced with the House, before the end of the year.\n  In my judgment it is incredibly important to farmers and ranchers \nacross this country that we come to some conclusions with this farm \nbill to give them some certainty, as they approach the 2008 planting \nseason, about what the rules are going to be, what the programs are \ngoing to be, how it has perhaps changed from what we currently have in \nplace.\n  But, in any event, it is, from a timing standpoint, of great \nimportance that we act as soon as we can on the 2007 farm bill. So my \nhope would be, again, that we reach some resolution between the \nleadership on both sides as it pertains to amendments, and, of course, \nI have an amendment dealing with renewable fuel standards that I hope \nwill be able to be included in that list of amendments that we get to \ndebate and ultimately vote on.\n\n  But I do want to speak this evening with regard to one particular \naspect of this farm bill, and it is an important one. It is one that \nperhaps has not been emphasized as much in this debate, although the \nSenator from Iowa, I heard earlier this evening, speaking to the \nconservation title of the farm bill. But my colleagues and I have spent \nthe better part of the last 2 years listening to our constituents and \ntranslating those concerns and suggestions into the farm\n\n[[Page S14272]]\n\nbill that we have before the Senate today. We have also listened to \nmultiple criticisms, mostly coming from those who are not directly \ninvolved in agriculture, telling us what is wrong with this farm bill.\n\n  But today I would like to talk about the conservation title because I \nbelieve it is just as critical to production agriculture in many \nrespects as the commodity title.\n  The conservation title of the farm bill comprises only about 9 \npercent of its total cost. Yet it potentially affects more than 350 \nmillion acres of land in the United States.\n  When I say 9 percent, if you look at total spending in the 2007 farm \nbill, about 14 percent of the money in the bill is in the commodity \ntitle. Those are the programs that support production agriculture. \nAbout 9 percent is in this conservation title to which I address my \nremarks. The balance--about 67 percent or about two-thirds--of the \nfunding in the farm bill actually goes toward nutrition, those aspects \nof the farm bill that really are very much unrelated to production \nagriculture. That is where the predominant share of the money is spent. \nA lot of times when those who criticize farm bills attack the funding \nthat goes toward production agriculture, it is important to realize \nthat most of the money in this bill isn't going to production \nagriculture. It is not going to the commodity title. It is going, two-\nthirds of it, to the nutrition title. That is in contrast to the last \nfarm bill, the farm bill we operate under today, where about 28 percent \nof the funding in the bill goes to the commodity title, production \nagriculture, and about 54 percent of the funding, under the 2002 farm \nbill which is currently in effect and which we are hopefully \nreauthorizing with the 2007 version, goes toward nutrition. Under the \nnew farm bill, the one before us today, about 67 percent of the money \nwould go toward the nutrition title of the bill. I don't think it is \nfair in many respects when those who would like to criticize this \nattack it for the money going to the commodity title. That is certainly \nnot the case.\n  The 9 percent that goes into conservation is important. There \nprobably isn't anything that we do in terms of conservation or \nenvironmental stewardship that actually does more to achieve the \nobjectives we all want than this conservation title in the farm bill \nachieves.\n  This picture, taken in 2007, is an example of the role played by the \nfarm bill conservation title. What you see in the picture is CRP on the \nfarm. You see also an example of crop production, working literally \nhand in hand. If you look in the bottom part of the picture, you see \nConservation Reserve Program, the land that has been put into native \ngrasses that is in abundance. You see in the center of the photograph a \nwetland area, some water in the background. Across the way, you see the \ncornfields that have been planted. The balance that has been struck on \nthis property is seen between conservation, between native grasses, a \nwetland area that has been managed, and it all being complemented with \na corn crop as well. That sort of describes what all of us would like \nto see when it comes to the way we manage our lands and the way farmers \ngo about incorporating conservation practices into their crop \nproduction as well.\n  The CRP on this farm, the 1.5 million acres enrolled in CRP in South \nDakota added 10 million pheasants and $153 million to South Dakota's \neconomy. This year's record corn crop in South Dakota at 556 million \nbushels is worth an additional $1.8 billion to South Dakota farmers--\nagain, those two working hand in hand in South Dakota achieving record \ncorn crops at the same time that we have a record pheasant crop because \nof the good conservation practices that have been employed by many of \nthe farmers in our State and which have been in response to, their \npractices, many of the incentives that were put in place in previous \nfarm bills.\n  The second picture we have this evening is a picture taken not too \nlong ago in South Dakota, a few months back, in the year 2007, and it \ntells another story. A lot of people would look at this picture and \nsay: That must be the Great Depression, because when you look at it, \nthat certainly is what it would appear to be. But it is not a scene \nfrom the 1930s; it is a scene from last March in 2007. It is an example \nand a result of what happened when native sod was cropped, because crop \ninsurance provided an unintended incentive to convert marginal \npastureland or native sod into cropland. This picture sends a stronger \nmessage than any words could about the inherent need to take care of \nour land. The topsoil you see in the fence line and ditch along this \nSouth Dakota field took literally millions of years to create and one \ndust storm to remove. The damage you see here cannot be undone.\n  There is a sod saver provision in the farm bill we are considering. \nIt won't prohibit anyone from converting native sod into cropland, but \nwhat it does do, what the sod saver provision in this bill does is \neliminate the incentives found in current Federal farm policy that \nencourage unwise farming practices which result in the consequences \nshown here.\n  Again, it is not a scene from the 1930s, which at first glance one \nmight expect, but it is a scene literally from last March, calendar \nyear 2007, in South Dakota. It is an example of what can happen when \nbad practices are undertaken.\n  The next picture is an example of some of the native sod that is \nbeing converted to cropland in South Dakota. For the past 100 years, \nbillions of acres of prairie have been converted to productive \nfarmland. Most native sod that can be productively farmed in South \nDakota and other prairie States has already been converted to cropland. \nWe faced a shortage of money to write this farm bill. I don't believe \nit is a wise use of Federal funds to pay for crop insurance and \ndisaster programs on this type of land. If the farmer who owns this \nland wants to farm it under this farm bill, he or she is free to do so. \nBut let's not subsidize it. That is an example of land that should not \nbe brought under the plow, and this farm bill prevents crop insurance \nor disaster program payments from going to a farmer who would convert \nnative prairie ground such as this into cropland.\n  This is an example of a dust storm that was not limited to the 1930s. \nThis picture was taken in 2005 in South Dakota. Once again, we see the \nconsequences of unwise land stewardship practices disturbingly evident \nin this picture.\n  During the 1930s, South Dakota received billions of tons of Kansas \nand Oklahoma topsoil, much of it still in place in fence lines and \nfields. The programs we drafted in the conservation title of this farm \nbill, if funded adequately, will ensure that Kansas and Oklahoma \nfarmers no longer see their topsoil blow to South Dakota and that South \nDakota farmers will keep their topsoil in their fields and not in the \nditches and fence lines as we saw in the previous picture.\n  I have stated many times before and I will emphasize once more that \nproduction agriculture and conservation should not compete; rather, \nthey should complement each other.\n  This is another picture of a South Dakota cornfield in CRP. CRP is \nnative grasses in the foreground and then, of course, a cornfield \nplanted toward the background of the picture. Every agricultural area \nin the country is blessed with productive land and also land that needs \nhelp to keep from polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.\n\n  I ask those who are so critical of this farm bill to take a close \nlook at the conservation title and what it offers. In spite of the \nbudget cuts made in drafting this farm bill, which made it more \ndifficult than writing any other farm bill that has ever been written, \nI am pleased that my colleagues and I have been able to write a farm \nbill with a sound conservation title.\n  I will point out once more examples of the benefits of the \nconservation title in this farm bill: First, protecting and enhancing \nour soil and our land; secondly, providing an economic alternative to \nplacing costly fertilizer, seed, and chemicals on unproductive \ncropland; third, enhancing recreation and boosting local economies, \nwhich, as I noted earlier, created in our State of South Dakota an \nabundance of pheasants, 10 million pheasants this year, which is the \nhighest number of pheasants we have seen at any time since the 1960s--\nthey say about 1962 was the last time we had this kind of pheasant \nnumbers in South Dakota--and $153 million to the economy of my State as \na result of the recreation value that\n\n[[Page S14273]]\n\ncomes from good, sound conservation practices.\n  I believe it is very important to take a breather from the \ncontroversy surrounding this farm bill and to take a few minutes to \nfocus on the farm bill's proven capabilities to enhance rural America \nand to improve our Nation's water and soil. The conservation title will \ndo just that. This is one of many reasons this farm bill deserves the \nsupport of our colleagues.\n  I leave my colleagues with the following information regarding the \nconservation title in the 2002 farm bill. Nationwide, without a \nconservation title, we would have 13.5 million fewer pheasants, 450 \nmillion tons of topsoil disappearing every single year, 2.2 million \nfewer ducks, an additional 170,000 miles of unprotected streams, and 40 \nmillion fewer acres of wildlife habitat. That is the value of a \nconservation title in the farm bill which accomplishes multiple \nobjectives--protecting and enhancing our soil and land, providing an \neconomic alternative to placing costly fertilizer, seed, and chemicals \non unproductive cropland, and enhancing recreation and boosting local \neconomies. Nine percent of the funding in this farm bill goes toward \nthat end. That, when put in a total perspective of what this farm bill \nspends, is not that much relative to the benefit we accomplish and to \nthe bad things we avoid happening by having a good conservation title.\n  As this farm bill is debated, we will have amendments at some point \nwhen we get an agreement. The amendments will focus on a lot of other \nareas of the farm bill. Some will focus on the commodity title and \ntrying to move money around within the farm bill.\n  I am interested in the energy title. I have an amendment to the \nenergy title, and we worked very hard in crafting the energy title in \nthis farm bill to provide the necessary economic incentives for further \ninvestment in cellulosic ethanol production. The renewable fuels \nstandard amendment I hope to be able to offer along with Senators \nDomenici and Nelson of Nebraska and others on a bipartisan basis will \nmake that energy title stronger. It will improve it.\n  It will give us some headroom to work within the area of renewable \nenergy. The renewable fuels standard put in place back in 2005 called \nfor 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel by the year 2012. We are \ngoing to hit 7.5 billion gallons by the end of this year if we don't \nact to increase the renewable fuels standard. We have a terrible crunch \nthat is coming ahead of us. I hope we can get this amendment adopted \nthat raises the renewable fuels standard, moves it to 8.5 billion \ngallons in the year 2008. It will give us the necessary headroom to \nkeep this wonderful example of renewable energy in this country and a \nremarkable story going forward.\n  If we don't do something to address the renewable fuels standard, my \nfear is we will run into a wall. That would not be good. It would not \nbe good for those who have already invested in ethanol facilities. It \nwould not be good, clearly, for the economy in rural areas and all the \njobs that have been created as a result of renewable energy. As \nimportantly, if not more importantly, it will do nothing to lessen our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy, which at the end of the day \nis so important in terms of our policy objectives.\n  This farm bill, by encouraging more energy production, if we can get \nthe renewable fuels standard added to it, will take us a long way \ntoward lessening our dependence on foreign energy. I would hope before \nthis debate is concluded we will be able to have the amendments adopted \nand voted on, if not adopted, but certainly a chance to debate these \nthings which we think will make the farm bill stronger. Some of those \namendments may deal with the conservation title, but I think this \nparticular title is one that often gets overlooked in the discussion \nthat is held about the farm bill because of the focus on production \nagriculture and because of the focus on the nutrition title of the bill \nwhich really comprises about two-thirds of the total funding of the \nbill.\n  But 9 percent of the money that is spent in this farm bill, the \nconservation value we get from that and the difference it is making in \nareas all across this country in protecting our critical soil and water \nresources, in adding to our economy, providing recreational \nopportunities such as pheasant hunting in South Dakota--this is a very \nimportant title of this bill, one that there was great deliberation and \nconsideration given toward coming up with.\n  I hope at the end of the day we will get the farm bill passed before \nthe end of the year and get this conservation title, along with the \nother policy changes that are included in the farm bill, implemented \ninto law so our farmers and our ranchers and those who will benefit \nfrom the great recreational opportunities that will result from this \nconservation title will know what the rules are going to be as we \napproach this next year.\n  So, again, I have heard many of my colleagues come down and speak on \nthe floor today about different aspects of this bill. My biggest hope \nand greatest fear at this point is--my biggest hope is we get this \nthing moving this week. My greatest fear is if we do not, we are not \ngoing to get a farm bill this year. So I hope before we leave this week \nwe will come to a resolution about amendments and the way forward and \nthe process we are going to use to get a farm bill adopted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14273-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14273-S14274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 53 years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower \nnamed November 11 ``Veterans Day,'' setting aside that day to honor all \nAmericans who have served our country so honorably in the military, \nboth in war and in peace.\n  I want to take the opportunity this day of remembrance provides to \nsay to all veterans and their families, thank you for your courage, \nyour character, your strength, and the enduring power of your example. \nAll Americans owe you our gratitude and appreciation for your \ncommitment to and sacrifice for our Nation.\n  Since our Nation's struggle for freedom more than two centuries ago, \nnearly 50 million men and women have served in the U.S. military and \nnearly 25 million of these veterans are alive today. Our thoughts and \nprayers also are with our veterans of tomorrow--the 1.4 million \nAmericans serving in our Armed Forces, including the more than 189,000 \nservice men and women who are in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nBecause of the noble service and tremendous sacrifices of our men and \nwomen in uniform, the United States stands as a beacon of democracy, \nhope, and opportunity to the rest of the world.\n  At this moment, as we send soldiers to fight overseas, our support \nfor our servicemembers must remain steadfast and strong. Our veterans \nhave earned access to quality health care, affordable educational \nopportunities, and a chance to thrive once home.\n  I am proud today to be a part of this Congress that has worked to \nhonor our commitment to our Nation's veterans. In September, the Senate \npassed the Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for 2008. The \nlegislation provides nearly 65 billion dollars for the Veterans' \nAdministration. Specifically, the bill makes substantial new \ninvestments to improve and strengthen health care for our brave \nveterans, making critical investments in medical services, including \ntreatment of traumatic brain injury, TBI, and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, PTSD, for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans; funding for new \nclaims processors to address the backlog of pending disability claims, \nand the investment in VA repair and maintenance necessary to prevent \nanother Walter Reed type situation. These investments address key \nshortcomings in our veterans health care system.\n  Although a minority in the Senate blocked our ability to send that \nlegislation to the President's desk last week, we voted this past \nThursday to provide temporary funding at the level the Bush \nadministration requested. That amount is $4 billion less than what we \nin Congress originally intended. We remain committed to ensuring the VA \nreceives the full $65 billion necessary to provide veterans the care \nand services they have earned.\n  But just as important as the quality of care is access to care. My \ncolleague, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, and I have worked together to \nsecure Federal funding for two new VA community-based clinics in \nMaryland--one at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince\n\n[[Page S14274]]\n\nGeorge's County and another at Fort Detrick in Frederick County. Not \nonly will facilities like these help to reduce backlog and waiting \ntimes, they will allow more veterans to receive care close to home.\n  We know, however, that we can and must do more for our Nation's \nveterans, for those who have given so much to our country. In addition \nto giving our veterans the benefits they deserve, we must continue to \nhonor their service and keep the memory of our fallen soldiers alive. \nIn that spirit, I introduced bipartisan legislation to grant a Federal \ncharter to the Korean War Veterans Association, S. 1692, the only \nfraternal veterans' organization in the Unites States devoted \nexclusively to veterans of the Korean war. This bill unanimously passed \nthe Senate, and I am hopeful it will soon pass the House. Should that \nhappen, it will ensure that the nearly 1.2 million American veterans of \nthe Korean war will receive the Federal recognition they deserve for \ntheir dedication and sacrifice.\n  As elected leaders, we also have an obligation to act as good \nstewards for our military, exercising wise judgment for its use and \nproviding the equipment, training, and materiel necessary for its \nsuccess. My colleagues and I have made a good faith effort to act as \nthose stewards.\n  Just this past Thursday evening, Congress passed a spending bill that \nprovides $460 billion for the Department of Defense, which is $40 \nbillion above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. Congress directed \nthat money be spent on a pay raise and better medical care and benefits \nfor our troops but also on procuring new equipment for our National \nGuard, increasing troop strength, and developing the Armed Forces and \nthe tools necessary to engage in the very different types of conflicts \nwe are confronted with in the world today.\n  In his second inaugural address, a portion of which is engraved on \nour Veterans' Administration building, President Lincoln said:\n\n       Let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up \n     the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which \n     may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among \n     ourselves, and with all nations.\n\n  I see those words as a charge to us here in Government, laying out \nthe grave and important work we have left to do. But I think these \nwords can serve as a guide to all of us, in every community, today and \nevery day, as we welcome and honor our returned and returning heroes \nand work toward a more perfect Union.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, founding Veterans Day in 1954, President \nDwight D. Eisenhower called upon Americans to ``solemnly remember the \nsacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the \nair, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom. . . \n.'' Today, we heed the advice of President Eisenhower and pay respect \nto all soldiers who have sacrificed to ensure America remains free, \nsafe, and the symbol of democracy around the world.\n  Throughout history, our soldiers have been asked to abandon their \nlivelihoods to defend America's ideals and freedoms. Our soldiers have \nshouldered this great responsibility with courage, dedication, and \nhonor. In return, this Nation cannot forget the countless sacrifices \nour soldiers have made for this country. We commemorate these valiant \nAmericans who have protected the liberties and freedoms that all enjoy \ntoday.\n  Congress must do its part to honor our Nation's soldiers. We are \nprofoundly grateful for the many sacrifices that our soldiers have made \nin the current war against terrorists and in past conflicts. This \nincludes ensuring all veterans receive proper health care, benefits, \nrehabilitation, and services. Congress will continue to support our \nveterans.\n  We are all forever indebted to our veterans. I, therefore, personally \nthank all veterans and their families for the sacrifices you all have \nendured. I salute your valor and am immensely grateful for your \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14274-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE RUNNIN' BULLDOGS\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to \nproudly recognize the accomplishments of the Gardner-Webb University \n``Runnin' Bulldogs'' of Boiling Springs, NC.\n  Originally chartered on December 2, 1905, Gardner-Webb has long been \nknown for its excellent academic and athletic programs, which is a \ntestament to its accomplished faculty. As a thriving regional \nuniversity, Gardner-Webb offers eight unique degree programs on its \nbeautiful 200 acre campus. Led by University President Dr. Frank \nBonner, its approximately 4,000 students are some of the brightest \nminds their generation has to offer and I look forward to witnessing \ntheir rise through the ranks in the coming years ahead.\n  On November 7, 2007, in a truly David versus Goliath story, the \nGardner-Webb ``Runnin' Bulldogs'' basketball team visited storied Rupp \nArena to challenge the Kentucky Wildcats, one of college basketball's \nmost successful programs, boasting seven National Championships. Late \ninto the evening it became official, the Bulldogs shocked college \nbasketball by upsetting the #20 ranked Wildcats. The Bulldogs entered \nthe locker room at halftime with an 11 point lead and never looked \nback. With a final score of 84-68, head coach Rick Scruggs, team staff \nand the determined players masterfully executed their game plan which \nwill forever be remembered as one the greatest upsets in college \nbasketball history.\n  I join the university's many loyal supporters, alumni and fans \neverywhere in commending not only the Bulldogs' outstanding \naccomplishment last night, but the entire Gardner-Webb community for \ncultivating an environment that believes that accomplishing anything is \nnot only plausible, but as highlighted last night, is possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14274-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14274-S14275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRAVEL RULES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to notify all Senators that on \nFriday, November 9, 2007, the Committee on Rules and Administration \napproved the request of the Select Committee on Ethics and granted a 3-\nweek extension until December 3, 2007, for the Ethics Committee to \nissue the initial guidelines implementing the new rules on privately \nsponsored travel required by Public Law 110-81.\n  In their letter to the Rules Committee, Senators Boxer and Cornyn \nnote that unless the request is approved, the new travel rules would \nbecome effective on November 13, 2007. Due to the scheduling of a \nnumber of proposed trips on or shortly after November 13, the Ethics \nCommittee believes that the additional required paperwork would not be \nsubmitted in time for review before the trips commence.\n  The 3-week extension will afford the Ethics Committee additional time \nto post the proposed new travel guidelines on its Web site. These \nguidelines will be effective on December 3, 2007, and all privately \nsponsored travel beginning on or after that date will be required to \nconform to the new rules and guidelines.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the Ethics Committee \ndated November 7, 2007, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Select Committee on Ethics,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.\n     Hon.

Bennett,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Bennett: Consistent with the \n     Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (the \n     ``Act''), the Select Committee on Ethics requests that the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration extends until December \n     3, 2007, the deadline for the Ethics Committee's formal \n     issuance of the initial guidelines implementing the new rules \n     on privately-sponsored travel. (See Section 544(b)(4) of the \n     Act.)\n\n       The legislative history of the Act provides that the new \n     travel requirements ``go into effect 60 days after enactment, \n     or the date the Select Committee on Ethics issues the \n     required guidelines under the rules, whichever is later.'' \n     Without the requested extension, the new travel rules would \n     become effective on November 13, 2007. The Committee has \n     prepared guidelines and new forms that\n\n[[Page S14275]]\n\n     must be completed by Senate members and staff, as well as \n     trip sponsors, 30 days prior to their travel. We would be \n     ready to issue these guidelines and forms on November 13. \n     However, a number of proposed trips that have been submitted \n     to the Committee for review begin on or shortly after \n     November 13, and it would be highly unlikely that the \n     additional paperwork could be completed for review by the \n     Committee before these trips begin.\n       If the Committee on Rules and Administration extends the \n     deadline for issuance of the guidelines until December 3, \n     2007, all privately-sponsored travel beginning on or after \n     that date would be required to conform to the new rules and \n     guidelines.\n       So that privately-sponsored travel starting on or after \n     December 3, 2007, may meet the requirements of the new travel \n     rules, the Committee intends on November 13, 2007, to post on \n     its Web site a preview of the complete text of the new travel \n     guidelines, and related regulations and forms, that the \n     Committee will issue formally on December 3, 2007, if the \n     Committee on Rules and Administrations grants the requested \n     extension.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this request,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Barbara Boxer,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                                      John Cornyn,\n     Vice Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14275-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EMANCIPATION HALL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, as chairman of the \nSenate Rules and Administration Committee, to voice my support of \nlegislation to name the great hall in the new Capitol Visitor Center \n``Emancipation Hall.''\n  This legislation--S.1679--was introduced by Senator Mary Landrieu on \nJune 21, 2007, and is cosponsored by Senator Barack Obama. I am proud \nto join them as a cosponsor.\n  A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Representatives Zach Wamp and Jesse Jackson. The measure has over \n225 cosponsors in the House and last week it was approved by the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. It is my understanding \nthat it will soon be taken up by the House, which earlier approved the \nproposal as part of the fiscal year 2008 legislative branch \nappropriations bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation.\n  The naming of ``Emancipation Hall'' in the new Capitol Visitor Center \nwould be a fitting tribute to the contributions of slaves in the \nconstruction of our Nation's Capitol Building. It would also serve to \nrecognize the end of slavery in the United States.\n  The Capitol Visitor Center is nearing completion, and its Great Hall \npromises to be a spectacular place--an estimated 3 million people are \nexpected to gather in the area as they come to visit our great Capitol \neach year.\n  And through large skylights in the ceiling, visitors will be able to \nlook upwards and gaze upon the grand Capitol dome.\n  This environment is the perfect place for visitors to reflect upon \nthe construction of the U.S. Capitol, and to recognize the slaves who \nhelped to build it.\n  The total number of slaves who worked on the Capitol is unknown. But \nthere is evidence that slave workers contributed in a number of \nimportant ways to its construction. This includes a slave named Philip \nReid who played an important role in the casting of the 19-foot, \n15,000-pound bronze Statue of Freedom that rests atop the Capitol dome. \nOthers are memorialized in pay stubs to their owners for work done in \nthe Capitol.\n  Naming the Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center as ``Emancipation \nHall'' would serve to recognize both the brutal truth of our Nation's \npast and the importance of freedom as a pillar of modern America.\n  The history of slavery in the United States is a grim chapter in our \nNation's history. But the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by \nPresident Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, was an important step \ntoward abolishing slavery in the United States.\n  In the Emancipation Proclamation, President Lincoln declared:\n\n       I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves \n     within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and \n     henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive government \n     of the United States, including the military and naval \n     authorities thereof; will recognize and maintain the freedom \n     of said persons.\n\n  While the Emancipation Proclamation did not officially abolish \nslavery in all of the United States, it was an important commitment by \nthe government to end this centuries-long injustice.\n  By sustaining the history of this great act, we highlight the \nimportance of freedom. And by naming the Capitol Visitor Center's main \nentry as ``Emancipation Hall,'' we do so in a significant way that all \nvisitors of our Nation's Capitol Building will notice and respect.\n  As chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee and the \nJoint Committee on the Library, which oversees Capitol artwork, I \nbelieve it is very important to provide an accurate and diversified \nimage of our Nation for the visitors to our Capitol. The naming of \n``Emancipation Hall'' would be one step toward achieving that.\n  I also welcome a new report by the congressional Slave Labor Task \nForce, which has come forward with a number of recommendations for \nacknowledging and commemorating the work slaves performed in building \nour Capitol.\n  I look forward to working with the task force on this issue so people \nthroughout the world will know more about the contribution by slaves \ntoward constructing the building that has become the very foundation of \nour democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14275-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14275-S14276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IDENTITY THEFT ENFORCEMENT AND RESTITUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that some Senator is \npreventing the Senate from taking an important step forward to combat \nidentity theft and to protect the privacy rights of all Americans by \npassing the Leahy-Specter Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution \nAct of 2007. This bipartisan cyber crime bill, which was requested by \nthe Department of Justice, will provide new tools to Federal \nprosecutors to combat identity theft and other computer crimes. I know \nthat it is cleared for passage by all Democratic Senators.\n  The dangers of identity theft and other cyber crimes continue to \nincrease as our Nation becomes more dependent on high technology. In \nfact, just last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller stated that ``[c]yber \nthreats will continue to grow as people become more and more dependent \nupon digital technology'' and ``we will be vulnerable to terrible \nattacks.'' Prompt Senate action on this bill will bring us one step \ncloser to providing greatly needed tools to the Federal prosecutors and \ninvestigators who are on the front lines of the battle against identity \ntheft and other cyber crimes. I urge those objecting to proceeding on \nthis bill to reconsider their actions and allow the bill to be \nconsidered and passed.\n  I thank Senator Specter, who has been a valuable partner in combating \nthe growing problem of identity theft for many years, for joining with \nme to introduce this important privacy bill. I have once again worked \nin a bipartisan manner with a group of Senators on both sides of the \naisle to draft this legislation. I thank Senators Durbin, Grassley, \nSchumer, Bill Nelson, Inouye, Stevens, and Feinstein for joining with \nus as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  I commend Senators Biden and Hatch for their contributions in this \narea. I am pleased that several provisions they have suggested to \nfurther strengthen this cyber crime legislation were included by \namendment in this bill when it was considered and reported by the \nJudiciary Committee and that they, too, have now cosponsored our bill.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice in crafting this bill, and the Leahy-Specter Identity Theft \nEnforcement and Restitution Act has the strong support of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Secret Service. This bill is also \nsupported by a broad coalition of business, high-tech and consumer \ngroups, including Microsoft, Consumers Union, the Cyber Security \nIndustry Alliance, the Business Software Alliance, AARP, and the \nChamber of Commerce.\n  The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act takes several \nimportant and long overdue steps to protect Americans from the growing \nand evolving threat of identity theft and other cyber crimes. First, to \nbetter protect American consumers, our bill provides the victims of \nidentity theft with the ability to seek restitution in Federal court \nfor the loss of time and money\n\n[[Page S14276]]\n\nspent restoring their credit and remedying the harms of identity theft, \nso that identity theft victims can be made whole.\n  Second, because identity theft schemes are much more sophisticated \nand cunning in today's digital era, our bill also expands the scope of \nthe Federal identity theft statutes so that the law keeps up with the \ningenuity of today's identity thieves. Our bill adds three new crimes--\npassing counterfeit securities, mail theft, and tax fraud--to the list \nof predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft. And, in order to \nbetter deter this kind of criminal activity, our bill also \nsignificantly increases the criminal penalties for these crimes. To \naddress the increasing number of computer hacking crimes that involve \ncomputers located within the same State, our bill also eliminates the \njurisdictional requirement that a computer's information must be stolen \nthrough an interstate or foreign communication in order to federally \nprosecute this crime.\n  Our bill also addresses the growing problem of the malicious use of \nspyware to steal sensitive personal information, by eliminating the \nrequirement that the loss resulting from the damage to a victim's \ncomputer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute this \noffense. The bill also carefully balances this necessary change with \nthe legitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous \nprosecutions and clarifies that the elimination of the $5,000 threshold \napplies only to criminal cases. In addition, our bill addresses the \nincreasing number of cyber attacks on multiple computers by making it a \nfelony to employ spyware or keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers, \nregardless of the aggregate amount of damage caused. By making this \ncrime a felony, the bill ensures that the most egregious identity \nthieves will not escape with minimal punishment under Federal cyber \ncrime laws.\n  Lastly, our bill strengthens the protections for American businesses, \nwhich are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves, by \nadding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute--\nthreatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer \nand demanding money in relation to a protected computer--so that this \nbad conduct can be federally prosecuted. In addition, because a \nbusiness as well as an individual can be a prime target for identity \ntheft, our bill closes several gaps in the Federal identity theft and \nthe aggravated identity theft statutes to ensure that identity thieves \nwho target a small business or a corporation can be prosecuted under \nthese laws. The bill also adds the remedy of civil and criminal \nforfeiture to the arsenal of tools to combat cyber crime, and our bill \ndirects the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines for \nidentity theft and cyber crime offenses.\n  The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act is a good, \nbipartisan measure to help combat the growing threat of identity theft \nand other cyber crimes to all Americans. This carefully balanced bill \nprotects the privacy rights of American consumers, the interests of \nbusiness, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement. This privacy \nbill also builds upon our prior efforts to enact comprehensive data \nprivacy legislation. The Leahy-Specter Personal Data Privacy and \nSecurity Act, S. 495, which Senator Specter and I reintroduced earlier \nthis year, would address the growing dangers of identity theft at its \nsource--lax data security and inadequate breach notification. \nProtecting the privacy and security of American consumers should be one \nof the Senate's top legislative priorities, and I urge the majority \nleader to take up that measure at the earliest opportunity.\n  Again, I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have joined \nSenator Specter and me in supporting this important privacy \nlegislation, as well as the many consumer and business groups that \nsupport this bill. I urge whoever is holding up this bipartisan bill to \nstop delaying this measure so that the Senate can promptly pass this \nimportant and much needed privacy bill before the Thanksgiving recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a support letter from the Chamber of \nCommerce be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 2007.\n     Hon.

The Chamber strongly supports S. \n     2168, the ``Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of \n     2007,'' and congratulates the Committee on the Judiciary for \n     reporting favorably this important legislation.\n       The Internet today is a major engine of economic growth for \n     the United States. Unfortunately, accompanying this amazing \n     growth has been the continued rise of malicious cyber \n     activity by very coordinated and clever criminal networks.

Mr. President, today, I join a bipartisan group of \nSenators in support of the Healthy Americans Act. This legislation \nmarks the beginning of what I hope will be a growing bipartisan effort \nto address one of our most daunting domestic challenges--health care \nreform. Historically, the issue of health care and how to solve our \ngrowing crisis has divided us, but we must find a way to come together \nand provide leadership on an issue that is central to the lives and \nfinances of millions of Americans.\n  There are over 47 million uninsured people in America today; another \n16 million are underinsured. Diminished health and shorter life spans \ndue to lack of health insurance cost an estimated $65 to $130 billion \nannually. Meanwhile, an estimated $35 billion in uncompensated care is \ndelivered to uninsured individuals annually.\n  The ever-rising costs of health care are being felt by all Americans, \nnot only those who are uninsured. When I speak to constituents in my \nhome State of Connecticut, I am struck by the number of currently \ninsured families who worry about maintaining that coverage. With \npremiums rising more rapidly than wages, it is increasingly difficult \nfor these families to continue to afford their coverage.\n  And the costs are certain to continue rising. Health spending between \n2006 and 2015 will total $30.3 trillion and will grow at an average \nrate of 7.2 percent--2.3 percent higher than the average annual GDP \ngrowth rate. To bring the growth in health care spending into line with \nthe annual GDP growth rate, we would need to decrease health care \nspending by $3 trillion over this period.\n  But while we spend more than any other nation in the world on health \ncare, Americans do not receive the highest quality of care. A 2003 \nstudy published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that in \nthe U.S., appropriate medical care is provided to individuals \napproximately 50 percent of the time.\n  It is clear that we must work across party and ideological lines to \ncover those that are uninsured in this Nation, provide health security \nto those hardworking families with insurance, bring the rising costs of \nhealth care under control, and provide high quality care to all. In the \npast, I have advocated for, and have proposed, targeted reforms to our \nhealth care system. I proposed the creation of a program called \nMediKids to insure all children in America from the moment of their \nbirth to 25 years of age. Families would choose from a menu of private \nhealth care plans and pay based on their income. And for the millions \nof uninsured adults in the U.S., I proposed the establishment of a \nprogram called MediChoice, which would create large pools of coverage \nto bring the cost of health insurance down, and would provide the \nuninsured, the self-employed,\n\n[[Page S14277]]\n\nand small business employees with affordable private health insurance \noptions. In addition, my plan would have included a new program called \nFairCare to reduce racial disparities, increased the number of school-\nbased health centers around the Nation, reinvested in our public health \ninfrastructure, and provided new funds and incentives for the \nimprovement and adoption of health information technology. Lastly, my \nhealth care proposal included a new strategic investment in promising \nbreakthroughs in biomedical research to bring new treatments, \ndiagnostics, and cures to the public. I will continue to support these \nincremental reforms as we move forward.\n  But as our health care system shows increasing signs of strain and \ngrowing numbers of Americans join the ranks of the uninsured, I also \nbelieve that we must seriously consider comprehensive, systemic reform \nto achieve the goal of quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans.\n  For that reason, I am proud to support the Healthy Americans Act, a \nstrong proposal that provides this Congress with a bipartisan starting \npoint on health care reform.\n  The Healthy Americans Act has the potential to offer universal \ncoverage while using a fiscally responsible approach, which I believe \nare the keys to moving forward in a bipartisan manner. The legislation \nwould reform the tax code in a well-thought out manner to make \ncomprehensive health care reform a true possibility. By realigning key \nprovisions in the Tax Code, this legislation would achieve universal \ncoverage without adding yet another burden to the Federal budget. \nThe legislation would also shield American business from ever-rising \nhealth care costs and, by unleashing market forces, protect the economy \nby reining in overall health care costs--all while reassuring our \nfamilies that their health care will always be there.\n\n  An independent health care consulting group found that through new \nrevenues, savings, and the restructuring of tax credits, the Healthy \nAmericans Act would not result in new Federal spending. The group also \nprojects that the proposal would reduce the annual health spending \ngrowth rate by 0.86 percent totaling a savings of $1.48 trillion from \n2007-2016, or 4.5 percent of total spending over that time period. \nLastly, the group estimates that the proposal would cover 99 percent of \nall Americans.\n  The act would establish a centrally financed system of private health \ninsurance for all Americans. Comprehensive coverage policies would be \navailable through new insurance pools, which would harness the power of \na reformed health insurance marketplace that would provide individuals \nwith choice and value. The plan would be paid for by eliminating the \ncurrent employer health benefits tax exclusion, which is estimated to \ncost the Federal Government approximately $200 billion per year. \nInstead, subsidies would be provided to lower income and working \nfamilies to purchase comprehensive coverage. Employers, in turn, would \nconvert the health benefits they currently provide to employees into \nhigher wages that employees would use to buy health insurance. Lastly, \nindividuals would also receive a new health insurance premium tax \ndeduction to prevent tax increases in middle-income workers resulting \nfrom the higher wages.\n  This proposal embodies both the foundation and architecture for \nbuilding a health care system that will achieve universal coverage. \nEach of the stakeholders in our health care system--from individual \nAmericans, employers, to insurance companies, health care providers and \nhospitals--will gain something under this plan. I believe this \nlegislation offers crucial benefits for all stakeholders while calling \non them to make equitable, economically efficient contributions to the \nshared effort of achieving health security for all Americans.\n  As we move through what I hope will be a successful legislative \nprocess, I will be working with my colleagues to ensure that we perfect \nthe balance this bill strives to reach. That effort will be crucial for \nmy home State of Connecticut. First, nearly 60 percent of Americans \ncurrently receive coverage through their employers, and in Connecticut, \nmore than 60 percent of our workers are covered through employers. We \nmust move cautiously and ensure we protect coverage for those currently \na part of the system that has served us for decades, and provide \nAmerican businesses with the support necessary to make short-term \nchanges in benefits, in exchange for long-term cost savings and \nincreased competitiveness. At the same time, moving away from a \nprimarily employer-based system of coverage would provide individuals \nwith true portability and stability of coverage, while, again, \nprotecting competitiveness of American businesses against runaway \nhealth care coverage costs, in this new global economy.\n  Second, the legislation as currently drafted would mandate that \nemployers provide employees higher benefits equivalent to the amount \nthat employers currently contribute for employee health care benefits. \nWe should consider the prudence of safeguards following a mandate \nperiod in order to prevent employees from facing wage cuts that would \nreduce their capacity to purchase comprehensive coverage.\n  Third, a new health premium tax exemption will be created by this \nlegislation so that most workers are not paying higher taxes with the \nincrease in wages, which are to be used for the purchase of health \ninsurance. But in many States, such as mine, the cost of living and \ncost of health insurance are higher than in other parts of the nation, \nplacing unique pressures on residents of those States. Therefore, I \nplan to work with Senator Wyden and the other sponsors of the act to \nmove in a direction that will take account of differences in health \ninsurance coverage costs, as well as in cost of living.\n  Lastly, the proposal would transition Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries \ninto the new program. Given the complex health needs of many Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, we must ensure that they have the necessary levels of \ncoverage under any new system. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on each of these issues.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleagues, Senators Wyden and Bennett, \nand of the bipartisan group that is supporting this legislation, and I \nam proud to join them. If we put aside partisan politics and muster \npolitical will, we can provide the American people with true leadership \non this most important domestic policy issue, and can succeed in \nbringing quality health care to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14277-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14277-S14279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in honor of the eighth annual \nInternational Education Week, which runs Monday, November 12 to 16, \n2007, I would like to emphasize the importance of international \neducation and exchange programs and the key role they play in \nstrengthening our own educational system, shaping our young citizens to \nbecome successful in our interconnected world, and improving our image \nas Americans overseas.\n  In so doing, I want to share a number of stories from my constituents \nabout how their international education and exchange experiences have \nchanged their lives. While I do not have time to read all of their \nstories, I will ask to have them printed in the Record as each and \nevery one of these stories demonstrates how critical it is that we \nsupport international education and exchange programs and initiatives.\n  You will see in all of my constituents' stories a common theme--\ninternational education has opened their eyes to the fact that we are \nan interconnected global community and that we have responsibilities as \nAmericans to reach out to that global community. A constituent, Claire \nfrom River Falls, WI, wrote to me that:\n\n       I was an AFS student in high school (in Brazil) and since \n     then firmly believe that if we could lift every 16 year old \n     out of their ``comfort zone'' and have them live somewhere \n     else in the world for a few months; we'd end war and \n     certainly increase global understanding.\n\n  I agree with this statement and firmly believe that if we all stepped \nout of our ``comfort zone,'' we would be facing a future that is more \nstable and secure than where we appear to be today.\n  International education and exchange strengthens our own educational \nsystem in a variety of ways. First and foremost, educational exchanges \nbetter prepare our children for\n\n[[Page S14278]]\n\nthe workforce and competing in the global economy. Katherine from River \nFalls shared her experience working through a nongovernmental \norganization called Building Tomorrow. She wrote:\n\n       While in Uganda [with Building for Tomorrow], I was \n     fortunate enough to have a home-stay experience with a \n     Ugandan family . . .  I and two other Building Tomorrow \n     members were paired with a doctor because we all had an \n     interest in some aspect of health care . . . This experience \n     was remarkable and contributed to my decision to pursue a \n     career in public health.\n\n  International education and exchange strengthens our own educational \nsystem. Teachers and students participating in exchange programs are \nable not only to broaden their own horizons, they also inform their \npeers of their experiences and thinking and, in so doing, contribute to \ntheir school systems for the lasting benefit of others. Sandra, a \nteacher in Sun Prairie, wrote to me that she participated in two \nseparate Fulbright Hayes Group Projects Abroad and that, ``both \nFulbright-Hayes Group Projects Abroad inspired me to develop innovative \ninterdisciplinary curriculum units, made infinitely richer by my newly \nacquired photographs, video footage, cultural artifacts, interview \nnotes, books published outside of the U.S., and personal reflections . \n. . As a result of ongoing internationally focused literacy \nprogramming, my middle school students, including reluctant and \nstruggling readers, seek out books on other cultures and countries, are \nintrigued by world maps, and pay more attention to world news and \nglobal concerns.''\n  International education and exchange programs foster greater cultural \nunderstanding. Today's students are tomorrow's leaders--and the better \nthey understand other cultures, the better prepared they will be to \nmake informed and balanced decisions for the benefit of our Nation's \nand our world's security and well-being. Thanks to the disastrous \npolicies of this administration, anti-American sentiment around the \nworld is at alarming levels. Those policies were based, in part, on \ninadequate information or misinformation about the rest of the world. \nAs a result, future American leaders are facing a world that is fraught \nwith mistrust. Their overseas experiences today will build \nrelationships for tomorrow. Those experiences will form their future \ndecisions and provide them with a broader appreciation of others' views \nand interests.\n  Sarah, a senior at University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, wrote to \nexplain to me about her semester abroad program:\n\n       Traveling and studying abroad in general taught me about \n     American and other cultures, societies, views, and ideas, \n     different forms of government, a greater sense of \n     independence, and how to look at cultures and traditions that \n     are different from my own with an open mind, rather than \n     making judgment[s] before I know all the facts.\n\n  As U.S. citizens, many of us have privileges that countless millions \nof people throughout the world will never experience. International \neducational opportunities encourage a greater sense of social \nresponsibility to assist those who face lives of poverty, disease, and \nthe effects of natural disasters. Lacey, a 25 year-old graduate of UW \nMadison, e-mailed me upon her return from spending a summer studying in \nChina which impacted her so much that she is returning to be a \nvolunteer interpreter at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. She wrote:\n\n       I use my travels and the things I learn from each place to \n     bring back to my community with me and try to give back in \n     whatever way I can as much as possible.\n\n  Finally, our citizens are our best diplomats. International education \nand exchange programs offer them the opportunity to reach out to others \nto reverse negative or inaccurate images that the rest of the world has \nformed. Kathy from Oshkosh shared with me how her experiences changed \nher perceptions:\n\n       I recall with distinct clarity a conversation I had with my \n     host mother in Spain about the people of Islam in our \n     country. She was very surprised that I had friends who are \n     Muslim and that I respect their culture and religion. She \n     told me that I changed the way she views Americans . . . \n     Senator Feingold, I am no longer just a citizen of the United \n     States of America. I am a citizen of the World.\n\n  Congress has an important role to play in enabling and promoting \nthese experiences for our constituents. I was a strong supporter of the \ncreation of the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad \nFellowship Program, an independent commission created in 2004 for the \npurpose of recommending a program to greatly expand the opportunity for \nstudents at institutions of higher education in the United States to \nstudy abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing \ncountries. One of my colleagues--Senator Durbin--has taken an important \nstep in working to implement the commission's published recommendations \nby introducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of \n2007, S. 991. But this bill is not enough. We also need to be \nsupporting opportunities for every American to study overseas. And if \nnot study, then to volunteer or participate in one-on-one exchanges. \nCultural misunderstanding makes our world more dangerous, and, as you \nhave heard from the accounts I have read, it is our citizens who make \nthe biggest, longest lasting change.\n  As we recognize and celebrate International Education Week, I call on \nall Americans to take a little time to learn something new this week \nabout another culture, and I encourage all Americans to recognize and \nsupport international education and exchange throughout the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have constituent stories \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Additional Stories\n\n       In the summer of 2005 our family, which owns a dairy farm, \n     did an international exchange with a Mexican college student \n     named Ceci.\n       Boy oh boy did it open our eyes to the cultural differences \n     as well as similarities that we share. Our children later did \n     a reciprocal exchange, and stayed with Ceci's family for 3 \n     weeks, and again this summer we had an opportunity to go \n     visit Ceci's family who live in Queretaro, Mexico. I have \n     also volunteered to speak about this cultural eye opening \n     experience to our local elementary school, and have shared \n     our pictures of the farms we visited while in Queretaro. Very \n     similar...\n       Our countries have so much to offer each other, it sickens \n     me that our government is spending so much money in the name \n     of terrorism to build a wall between our borders. I respect \n     the need to secure our borders, but there should be a \n     diplomatic way in which we could legally allow those seeking \n     work to come here and work. Those who come are following a \n     dream of a job, not a dream to kill Americans. If we were \n     working them to place them in jobs, it would be easier to \n     outline our expectations and track them as well.\n     Ellen, Independence.\n                                  ____\n\n       Studying abroad is an opportunity that any student should \n     be able to take advantage of. This past Spring Semester, I \n     had the chance to study abroad in Pamplona, Spain. Never did \n     I imagine it possible for me to study in Spain had it not \n     been for the financial help provided for me in the form of \n     grants and loans. I entered Spain, expecting to learn a \n     language, when I left I had learned and gained so much more. \n     Coming back to the United States, I not only feel more \n     comfortable in my ability to speak Spanish but in the way I \n     present myself. When studying abroad, language can become a \n     barrier, and one must rely on other things such as tone of \n     voice, hand gestures, and more often relationships to \n     understand the culture to its fullest. Having to conquer the \n     hurdle of language while I was abroad, I learned to depend on \n     other strengths and attributes I never knew I had. I can say \n     honestly, that I have gained much more than the experience of \n     learning a language, moreover the growth of a family. Living \n     in the United States, I take a little piece of Spain with me \n     wherever I go, hoping to influence others with my experience.\n     Mary, Oshkosh.\n                                  ____\n\n       This past summer I completed an internship on the Tibetan \n     Plateau in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China. It was \n     coordinated through UW--River Falls and the China Exploration \n     and Research Society (CERS). The mission of CERS is to \n     conserve the cultural and natural environments of remote \n     China. I aided in this mission by helping to develop eco-\n     tourism plans for one of their current projects. This \n     involved designing nature trails, septic systems, and \n     composting toilets.\n       Living in a developing country really puts the world into \n     perspective. I now look at my day-to-day life differently \n     than before. It is hard to put into words, but I feel much \n     more content with my decisions and myself. Seeing the lives \n     of the rural Chinese and Tibetan people has shown me how \n     other people live and sustain themselves on very limited \n     resources. They get things done with the tools around them \n     and are patient to let things unfold naturally. When time is \n     taken to look at all the options for solving a problem and \n     all the consequences have been laid out, the likelihood of \n     success based on common sense is far greater.\n\n[[Page S14279]]\n\n       Studying abroad is a great opportunity and a true life-\n     altering event. It challenges a person right down to their \n     core and really builds character on a newly formed \n     understanding of the world.\n     Nick, River Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I had a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to study abroad in \n     the Wisconsin in Scotland program in the spring of 2006. This \n     experience changed my life. It not only helped me realize \n     what I wanted to do in my life, and gave me the desire to \n     travel, it also changed the way I looked at every aspect of \n     the world. This biggest thing I took away from the program is \n     my view of other cultures. I was naive when I first left to \n     study abroad thinking that any culture that wasn't as \n     ``advanced'' or ``sophisticated'' as the U.S. was simply just \n     not wealthy enough to be up to our ``standards.'' I now am \n     adamant that this is not the case. I live by the phrase \n     ``different isn't bad, scary, or wrong, it is just \n     different.'' This experience also helped me realize what I \n     wanted to do with my life. I intend to become a theatre \n     professor, and I want to teach somewhere in the UK. I loved \n     every single aspect of my study abroad experience and cannot \n     wait to go back. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I \n     learned something about myself that I would not have learned \n     anywhere else besides in another study abroad experience. I \n     learned my own personal strength. I learned what I was \n     capable of. When I was on holiday in Milan I missed my \n     flight, and it was up to me, not my professor, or my parents, \n     to figure out what to do. I never realized what it was like \n     to be a real adult until I had to take care of myself. It was \n     scary, and it was hard, but I did it. I now have this inner \n     strength of knowing what I accomplished by myself, in a land \n     where no one spoke my native language, and I got myself \n     through it. I will be forever grateful to the University of \n     Wisconsin--Superior and their Wisconsin in Scotland study \n     abroad program for turning me into the strong, well-\n     educated, and open-mined woman that I am today.\n     Nicole, Superior.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was fortunate enough to study in another country. At \n     first, when my friends told me about the study abroad \n     program, I was hesitant to sign up for the experience. In the \n     end I had made a decision that would change my life forever. \n     I had decided to study in the Wisconsin in Scotland program. \n     Before that time I had never even been in an airport much \n     less fly to another country. When I was in Scotland, I \n     learned far more about culture than any one could experience \n     from a class or text book. I was place in a foreign world and \n     had to deal with the changes. This is what made me feel more \n     confident about my independence as a person. Soon after my \n     return, my communication and people skills flew through the \n     roof. Thanks to the study abroad program for helping me \n     become the successful person I am today.\n     Aaron, Menomonie.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin--\n     River Falls. Last semester, spring 2007, I was a participant \n     in the ``Wisconsin in Scotland Program.'' It was an amazing \n     experience to be a part of. Not only were we able to enroll \n     in courses which would transfer credit back to our home \n     university, but we could fully absorb a different culture by \n     living in it. One of my friends said it best--you learn more \n     from traveling, especially studying abroad, than you could \n     from years in a classroom with text books. Although Scotland \n     is relatively similar to Wisconsin, volunteering in the \n     community of Dalkeith, visiting with host families, and \n     traveling with new friends offers new challenges. When we \n     flew back in May, I think we all had a new sense of \n     independence, a different look on the influence of the United \n     States on other countries, and an appreciation for what we \n     have at home. Being able to have the opportunity to study \n     abroad is an important, valuable experience.\n     Gena, River Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin--River Falls. \n     Two years ago, I spent a semester of my academic career \n     studying Spanish in Queretaro, Mexico. I lived with a host \n     family while I attended the Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios \n     Superiores de Monterrey, and I had an absolutely phenomenal \n     experience. Yes, I developed my language skills \n     significantly, but even more so, I developed an appreciation \n     for the Mexican culture and an understanding of the social \n     and educational problems that cause so many of the Mexican \n     people to emigrate to the United States. My study abroad \n     experience impacted me so greatly that I changed my major \n     from Elementary Education to Spanish Education with a minor \n     in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) \n     so that I might work with the growing immigrant \n     population.\n     Theresa, River Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       From September 2005 until September 2006 I was on a \n     sabbatical leave from UW--Whitewater in Oman as a senior \n     Fulbright program scholar. I taught business and economics \n     courses at Modern College of Business and Science, which is \n     located in Muscat. In addition, I assisted the College \n     administration and owners in preparing their college for \n     academic accreditation. I participated in English language \n     training of Omani judges (in collaboration with the U.S. \n     Embassy and the Ministry of Justice). My family and I have \n     met many interesting people from different ways of life and \n     had many opportunities to travel throughout the region.\n       Promoting American values in the Middle East today is very \n     difficult. I believe that my solid work particularly with \n     college students will enhance good will and will bring \n     tangible benefits in the future by developing bilateral \n     business and educational linkages.\n     Tom, Whitewater.\n                                  ____\n\n       UWM's Fulbright-Hayes summer program offered an opportunity \n     to nurture an interest I've had in the Middle East and North \n     Africa since I was a freshman in college (over a decade now). \n     Like many Americans, I had reservations about traveling to a \n     part of the world that seems hostile to us. My experience \n     with my Moroccan host family proved this perception false. I \n     learned that the legendary warmth and hospitality of the Arab \n     world are not myths. Indeed, my host family gave the \n     impression that their primary enjoyment of material comforts \n     came from sharing them with me, a stranger with strange ways \n     to whom they had opened their home. They eagerly shared their \n     culture with me, and were infinitely patient as a I learned \n     the finer points of Moroccan manners, such as eating with my \n     right hand and remembering to take my shoes off when I walked \n     on a carpet.\n       After my experiences in Morocco, I find myself having a lot \n     to say when I hear another American declare that Arabs or, \n     more broadly, people in the Muslim world, hate us. Hearing \n     this is frustrating, knowing what I know now, especially when \n     people use it to justify an unjust action on the part of the \n     United States toward countries in the Muslim world. The \n     Moroccans I met went out of their way to distinguish between \n     the U.S. government and the American people when expressing \n     dislike of a particular U.S. government policy or action \n     against a country in their region. They feel that their side \n     of the story is not heard or understood. Since I've been \n     back, I find myself seeking out news coverage of the Middle \n     East and North Africa, waiting to hear those perspectives my \n     Moroccan friends and family shared with me. Their absence \n     only seems to reinforce the ``well, they hate us,'' attitude, \n     since they are often preempted by more extreme viewpoints.\n       I think that programs like our summer trip to Morocco can \n     expose both sides to new ways of seeing the conflicts that \n     exist between us and that can be a positive first step to \n     better relations.\n     Valerie, Ripon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was selected to participate in the Training of Writers \n     program offered by the National Council on Economic Education \n     (NCEE). This program is part of the Cooperative Education \n     Exchange Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Education, \n     Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and carried out in \n     coordination with the U.S. Department of State.\n       Briefly, the week I spent in Bucharest was amazing and \n     exceeded all of my expectations! On a professional level, I \n     benefited from the formal goal of the program: creating a \n     pool of qualified economic curriculum writers which provided \n     insights into NCEE curriculum materials, voluntary national \n     content standards in economics, and active learning \n     strategies. This program has already improved my teaching as \n     I re-focus my lessons on meaningful and relevant economics \n     content. (Hence, the reason why I am swamped as I am making \n     adjustments and improvements in my classroom.) On a personal \n     level, the experience of working with international educators \n     was invaluable. We worked as partners in collegial teams \n     creating active, meaningful economic lessons which could be \n     implemented in K-12 classrooms worldwide. The collaboration \n     allowed me to learn about economic education in various \n     countries and build an international network of fellow \n     educators. I will continue to work on this program over the \n     coming months as I refine my lesson with feedback from the \n     U.S. faculty, field-test the lesson in classrooms here in \n     Wisconsin, and finally submit my final lesson to NCEE with \n     revisions based on feedback from teachers involved in the \n     field-testing.\n       My international experiences through opportunities provided \n     by the NCEE have shown me the importance of working in \n     partnership with people in other countries and building \n     positive collaborative relationships.\n     Ann, New Richmond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14279-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14279-S14280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      100TH BIRTHDAY OF GRACE DODD\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, November 9, 2007, was a very special \nday for me and my whole family. On that day, my mother, Grace Dodd, \nwould have turned 100 years old. She has been gone for many, many years \nnow; but not a day goes by without her memory. I would like to take \nthis chance to call back those memories and speak about what made her \nso special.\n  I have never known a more infectious optimist. More than anything, \nthat is what comes back: her unshakeable confidence that no matter how \nbad the problem, she could fix it; her lifelong dedication to the \nbright side; a smile that could turn even the grumpiest person \npleasant.\n\n[[Page S14280]]\n\n  Some kinds of optimism are bought cheaply: they come from sheltering \nyourself from the world. But the much more valuable, much more lasting \nkind of optimism comes from embracing the world--and that was my \nmother's kind. She was a dedicated Latin student, a bundle of energy, a \nbasketball star in high school and at Trinity College in Washington, \nDC. Her nickname--``the adhesive guard''--testifies, I think, to her \npersistence on the court and everywhere else.\n  Born Mary Grace Murphy, she married my father Tom Dodd in 1934, loved \nhim deeply, and gave him six children, of which I was the second-to-\nlast. When my father left home to serve as a prosecutor at the \nNuremberg Trials in 1945, he wrote home to his ``dearest Grace'' every \nday--sometimes twice a day. His letters are filled with descriptions of \nthe Nazi war criminals, ravaged, postwar Germany, growing conflict \nbetween the Americans and the Russians; but above all, they are filled \nwith how much he missed his Grace. Being away from her, he wrote, was \nthe hardest thing he had to do.\n  I can't help thinking that my mother had an even harder job--raising \nall of us! But as full as her hands were, raising four boys and two \ngirls, she found time to give herself fully to her community, as well. \nShe served on the local school board, was an early advocate for public \nkindergarten, and wrote a column in the Hartford newspaper. And with \nall that, she still had time left over to read avidly, travel widely, \nand study Spanish.\n  But my sister Martha said that her greatest talent was something much \nsimpler, something that I think was at the root of everything else in \nher full life: the ability to take a walk. Not a modern, calorie-\nburning power-walk; but simply the skill for consciously forgetting the \nturmoil and bustle of life and taking time to reflect. My mother loved \nwalks--and I think that they are what kept her smile bright and her \noptimism undimmed for so many years.\n  I know a great story about that optimism. When I moved back to \nConnecticut after graduating law school, the driver of the moving van \nhad a hard time finding my new house. My mother was on hand to make \nsure everything was going smoothly, and as the driver got angrier and \nangrier, she finally climbed into the cab and said, ``I'll show you \nexactly where it is.'' As they drove into the dark, she kept insisting, \n``I can just see it! I can just see it!''--for 4 miles. But she knew \nexactly where they were going, she calmed the driver's nerves, and she \ngot him there, just as she promised.\n  Grace Dodd did the same for all of us. Whenever times were tough and \nthe road ahead of us seemed dark, there she was by our side, saying, \n``I can just see it!'' What we are, we owe to her; and on her 100th \nbirthday, the best words we say in response are, ``Thank you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14280-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DONALD J. MULVIHILL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I speak in memory of the life of \nDonald J. Mulvihill, a distinguished lawyer, a proud public servant, \nand an honored friend of the Dodd family. He recently died at the age \nof 76.\n  Donald gave nearly a half century--more than half of his life--to his \nlaw firm, Cahill Gordon & Reindel, and the length of his service \ntestifies to his dedication and consummate skill as an attorney. For \nmore than four decades, he managed his firm's Washington office, where \nhe gained a reputation as one of America's leading authorities on \nfederal business regulations.\n  Donald would tell you, though, that his most successful day at the \noffice came when he was fresh out of law school and assigned to the \nsame office as Grace Conroy, one of Cahill's first female lawyers. ``He \nthought he was getting demoted because they put a woman in his \noffice,'' Grace would later joke. But Donald's attitude soon changed--\nhe and Grace were married 3 years later, and they spent 45 years \ntogether.\n  Donald's skill in the law led President Johnson to tap him in 1968 to \ndirect a task force on individual acts of violence for the National \nCommission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, a council convened \nin the wake of the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Along \nwith Princeton sociologist Mel Tumin, Donald wrote three volumes of the \ncommittee's final report, clearly detailing the link between \ndeteriorating urban conditions and a swell in violent crime.\n  In 1970, he wrote with great insight and penetration on what it means \nto feel the seductive draw of crime in the inner city, ``to be young, \npoor, male and Negro, to want what the open society claims is \navailable, but mostly to others; to see illegitimate and often violent \nmethods of obtaining material success, and to observe others using \nthese means successfully.''\n  For Donald, that was no mere academic conclusion; with the Eisenhower \nFoundation, he spent years working to put his recommendations into \npractice, giving as much energy to the revitalization of urban America \nas he did to his work in the law.\n  His example still reminds us: An open society is justly measured by \nthe gap between what it claims is available, and what it provides--\nbetween what it promises, and what it delivers.\n  For his services, Donald Mulvihill will be remembered as a public-\nspirited leader who combined, in equal proportion, private success and \ncivic duty. But I confess that all of those accomplishments mean \ncomparatively little to me, next to what he did during a few months in \n1967.\n  I was 23, but I can still recall as if it were yesterday the Senate's \ncensure hearings of my father, Senator Tom Dodd. What a painful time \nthat was for my family--but it gave me strength to know that sitting at \nmy father's side, through the whole ordeal, was a talented young lawyer \nnamed Donald Mulvihill. I know how thankful my father was for Donald's \ngood counsel.\n  It was the rare case that Donald didn't win; but still, he won my \nfather's sincere and lasting gratitude. And though Tom Dodd is long \ngone, my family and I have kept his gratitude alive.\n  Now Donald is beyond our thanks. But I pledge to remember him, to \nkeep alive his good name, and to hold up his example of a life well \nlived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14280-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14280-S14281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHIEF RALPH STURGES\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to mark the passing of a true \nConnecticut leader and a great benefactor of his people: Ralph Sturges, \nchief of the Mohegan Indian tribe. Chief Sturges was 88.\n  At various times in his long life, Ralph was a deliveryman, a public \nrelations director, a Civilian Conservation Corps worker, a noted \nmarble sculptor, and a World War II Bronze Star winner--but he found \nhis greatest purpose late in life, leading and reviving Connecticut's \nMohegan tribe.\n  Ralph's work on behalf of the Mohegans--who have called New England \nhome for more than four centuries--was unflagging and successful at \nlong last. When he first sought Federal recognition for the tribe, the \nGovernment replied that the Mohegans had ceased to exist in the 1940s. \nThat rang clearly false to Ralph, who knew firsthand that the Mohegan \nidentity was still alive; and under his leadership, the tribe pushed \nuntil it was finally recognized in 1994.\n  The Mohegans were only the ninth tribe ever to be recognized on the \nbasis of documentary evidence--evidence which Ralph and other Mohegan \nleaders were tireless in collecting. The chairman of the neighboring \nMashantucket Pequot tribe called his efforts ``an inspiration to native \npeoples everywhere.'' The Mohegans honored Ralph by naming him chief \nfor life.\n  But Ralph was more than a cultural guardian; he was also a shrewd \nbusinessman. He understood that a prosperous tribe was more likely to \nsurvive into his children's and grandchildren's generations, and \nbeyond; and so he negotiated to build the Mohegan Sun casino on tribal \nland.\n  Its popularity testifies to Ralph's economic leadership, and its \nprofits pay for health care and college tuition for all Mohegans. Ralph \nwas proud of the casino's success and spoke plainly\n\n[[Page S14281]]\n\nabout the incentive it created for Mohegans to maintain their cultural \nidentity: ``Because Indians are making money, now it's a privilege to \nbe one.''\n  The casino offered the means; but the end was always clear, and it \nwas the end to which Ralph dedicated decades of his life: bringing back \na people that had seemed on the verge of fading away. Ralph dealt \ncannily with Wall Street investors--but took more pleasure in spending \nafternoons raking the leaves from his tribe's ancient burial ground.\n  He was a proud product of two cultures, Indian and Western, \ncomfortable in either, taking the best from both. ``What probably \nhappened is my father's people were rowing ashore on the Mayflower and \nmy mother's people were probably on the shore throwing stones,'' Ralph \nonce joked.\n  He will be remembered as an artist, a businessman, and a wise chief, \npresiding over his tribe with a feathered talking-stick in one hand and \na gavel in the other. The cultures he represented in either hand--and \nour whole State of Connecticut--are united in honoring Chief Ralph \nSturges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14281-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF LAS CRUCES\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I celebrate the 100th \nbirthday of Las Cruces, NM. Being the second largest city in New \nMexico, Las Cruces has a lot to be proud of and a lot to celebrate.\n  Before New Mexico became a State, Las Cruces was making its mark on \nthe world. When it was founded in 1907 as a small railroad town, no one \ncould have foreseen what a major metropolitan area it would become in \nthe southern part of my State. Being sheltered by the Organ Mountains \nto the east, and the Rio Grande River on the west, Las Cruces boasts \n350 days of sunshine a year making it one of AARP's Top 5 Places To \nRetire. The city also has continued to receive the title of Best Small \nMetro Area for Business Careers from the Forbes/Milken Institute.\n  Las Cruces, English translation is ``the crosses,'' is home to the \nsecond largest university in New Mexico, New Mexico State University, \nwith a student population of 26,000. NMSU continues to grow and improve \nupon the various programs and degrees they offer. This university is \nvital to the strength of Las Cruces. The Dona Ana Community College is \nlocated here as well. Their student population is over 4,000 strong. \nLas Cruces also hosts the nationally acclaimed annual Whole Enchilada \nFestival. The festival attracts over 40,000 visitors each year. Because \nof this annual event, Las Cruces holds the Guinness Book of World \nRecords for the world's largest flat enchilada.\n  Las Cruces has seen a giant explosion in population over the last \ndecade. They have grown from just over 74,000 residents in 2000 to \naround 87,000 residents in 2006. And the boom in population shows no \nsigns of stopping in the near future. Small and large industries \ncontinue to see this budding town as a great place to do business. \nWhile it is hard to point to just one industry that has caused the \nextreme growth, Las Cruces continues to do what it does best, be \nconsistent in its offerings.\n  To celebrate their 100th birthday, Las Cruces has planned to serve a \npiece of cake to every resident. They might also make the Guinness Book \nof World Records for the largest sheet cake after the celebration! The \ncity is planning on cutting this cake at the culmination of an all-day \nfestival at the Downtown Mall.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Rev. \nEdwin ``Doc'' Edmonds, a retired pastor and civil rights leader from \nNew Haven who passed away Tuesday, November 6. Reverend Edmonds, or \n``Doc,'' as his friends called him, was one of the smartest, warmest, \nand most effective people I have ever had the pleasure to know, and led \na truly inspirational life.\n  Born and raised in Texas, Edwin Edmonds was an excellent student, \ngraduating high school at 15 years of age. In college he began losing \nhis eyesight until he was legally blind. Despite having much difficulty \nreading and writing his assignments, he prevailed and graduated from \nMorehouse College in 1938, only 1 year later than expected. He would \nthen go on to earn a bachelor's of sacred theology and a doctorate in \nsocial ethics from Boston University. In 1950, he was ordained in the \nMethodist Church.\n  While teaching Sociology at Bennett College in Greensboro, NC, \nReverend Edmonds became deeply involved with the civil rights movement, \nwhere he was elected president of the Greensboro chapter of the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1958, he \nmet the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and the two exchanged letters \nuntil Dr. King's tragic death.\n  He also was an adviser to the ``Greensboro Four,'' a group of brave \ncollege students committed to racial equality who would later lead the \nfamous sit-in at a segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth's department \nstore. This courageous protest is widely believed to be the first sit-\nin of the civil rights movement. Many Greensboro historians consider \nReverend Edmonds a pioneer in the fight for equal rights for the city's \nminorities.\n  In 1959, Reverend Edmonds moved to New Haven to become pastor of the \nDixwell Avenue Congregational Church, which is now known as the United \nChurch of Christ. As pastor, Mr. Edmonds soon became a fixture in the \nlocal community and quickly gained a reputation as one who was always \nwilling to help those in need. His youngest daughter, Toni Walker, who \nserves as a representative in the Connecticut General Assembly, recalls \nthat people in need often stayed at their home as guests. ``As long as \nthey needed help, they were able to get it,'' Walker remembers.\n  Reverend Edmonds' congregants all knew that he was around to address \nnot just their spiritual needs, but also everyday needs such as housing \nand jobs. Under his leadership, the church built a housing development \nand a creative arts center for the community. In addition, he was \ninvolved with many community service groups, such as the Urban League, \nthe New Haven Clergy Association, the Amistad Committee and the New \nHaven Inter-Faith Ministerial Alliance. He was also a long-time member \nof the New Haven Board of Education, serving as its chairman from 1979 \nto 1988.\n  Even after retiring from the church in 1994, Mr. Edmonds remained \nactive in his community. In 2000, after a meeting with single mothers \nwho had to defer going to school to raise their children, he helped to \nestablish Edwin R. and Maye B. Edmonds Scholarship Fund for single \nparents.\n  I bid farewell to ``Doc'' Edmonds and will keep his friends and \nfamily in my thoughts and prayers. I take solace in knowing that he \nwill live on in all the people he helped to inspire to serve their \ncommunity. As Clifton Graves, an activist and professor in New Haven \nwho has known and looked up to Reverend Edmonds since he was a boy, \nsaid of his death: ``We mourn this loss, but we celebrate his life and \nthe contributions he made not only to New Haven but to Connecticut and \nindeed, around the country.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14281-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14281-S14282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO FATHER BONIFACE HARDIN AND SISTER JANE SCHILLING\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to two Hoosiers \nwho have touched the Indianapolis community and the world through their \ntireless leadership and commitment to the positive effect that \neducation can have on both individuals and the communities in which \nthey live. Over the years I have admired Father Boniface Hardin and \nSister Jane Schilling for their dedication to both their religious \ncalling as well as the more temporal needs of our communities as they \nworked to fight racial injustice and poverty through education and \nempowerment.\n  In 1977, Father Hardin and Sister Jane founded Martin University, an \ninstitution dedicated to serving low-income, minority, and adult \nlearners,\n\n[[Page S14282]]\n\nwhile at the same time welcoming students of all backgrounds. In the \nensuing 30 years, Martin University has changed the lives of thousands \nof students. It has grown from a converted church and school to a \nbeautiful campus in the Martindale-Brightwood neighborhood of \nIndianapolis that serves as a tremendous resource to both faculty and \nstudents as well as the surrounding community.\n  As Father Hardin and Sister Jane step down as president and vice \npresident of Martin University, I am hopeful that you will join me, the \nboard of trustees, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends of the \nuniversity in congratulating them on their many years of service to the \npeople of Indianapolis. I wish them both every continuing success as \nthey pursue new and exciting opportunities to offer important service \nto many more of the people they have dedicated their lives to \nhelping.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14282-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING JACOBY ELLSBURY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, on behalf of all Oregonians, \nI recognize the recent accomplishments of Madras, Oregon's own Jacoby \nEllsbury of the World Champion Boston Red Sox.\n  As a child growing up, I followed the Boston Red Sox closer than any \nother team. I recall my father telling me stories of the four west \ncoast boys who were members of the Boston Red Sox in the 1940s. He told \nme about how they put their baseball careers on hold to defend our \nNation at war. Two of those west coast boys, Johnny Pesky and Hall of \nFamer Bobby Doerr, had connections to Oregon and the Pacific Coast \nLeague. The story of these four young men from the west coast who \nbecame members of the Boston Red Sox was highlighted in the late David \nHalberstam's book ``The Teammates--A Portrait of Friendship.'' For the \nfour friends, Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky and Dominic \nDiMaggio, it was about more than baseball. Their story is about the \nAmerican dream and the bonds of friendship.\n  I recall Williams, Pesky, Doerr, and DiMaggio when I see Jacoby \nEllsbury on the field with his teammates: Dustin Pedroia and Jon \nLester. Dustin, the Red Sox second baseman, hails from California and \nArizona State University and pitcher Jon Lester grew up in Tacoma, WA. \nJacoby hails from the small town of Madras, OR, in the central part of \nthe State and was a first team All-American at Oregon State University \nin 2005 when he led his team to the College World Series for the first \ntime since 1952. Jacoby's career has blossomed on and off the field \nsince joining the Boston Red Sox organization, and he is considered by \nmany to be one of the game's future superstars.\n  Jacoby exhibits many of the qualities a young man should emulate. It \nis apparent that his work ethic, sportsmanship, and dedication to the \ngame he loves have propelled him to the top of the baseball world. I \npraise his Mom and Dad, Margie and Jim, for a job well done. Oregonians \nand the Red Sox Nation are very proud of Jacoby Ellsbury.\n  Finally, I wish to note how proud I am to recognize Jacoby, not only \nas an American and an Oregonian representing the Boston Red Sox so \nproudly, but I am equally proud to recognize him as a man of Native \nAmerican descent, particularly the first of Navajo descent to play in \nthe Major Leagues. The members of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm \nSprings in Oregon should be extremely proud of Jacoby.\n  I congratulate Jacoby Ellsbury and his teammates on winning the 2007 \nWorld Series and wish him the best of luck as he continues his \nprofessional career in Boston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14282-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 8, 2007, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3043.

A bill to withhold 10 percent of the Federal funding \napportioned for highway construction and maintenance from States that \nissue driver's licenses to individuals without verifying the legal \nstatus of such individuals; read the first time.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today \nto discuss the issue of giving legal government documents to people who \nare in the United States illegally.\n  There is no question our immigration process is broken. People who \nattempt to enter the United States legally--to work, to join their \nfamilies--well, they often face bureaucratic redtape and incredible \ndelays. Legal entry into the United States has become more difficult as \na result of the events of September 11, 2001. There is no question that \nshould be the case.\n  Unfortunately, illegal entry remains a significant problem. It is \nestimated that between 13 million and 20 million people are illegally \nin the United States. The fact that the estimates are so far apart \nshould in and of itself give us all cause for concern.\n  What should also give us concern is that there are efforts in the \nUnited States today to provide driver's licenses to those in this \ncountry illegally. I believe such efforts are inappropriate and are a \nserious threat to our national security.\n  There is no question that legally issuing driver's licenses or other \ngovernment documents to people who are here illegally puts our entire \nNation at risk. I am troubled by those who argue that we will be safer \nif we provide official government papers to those who have come to our \ncountry illegally. I believe this is the wrong path. It is the wrong \npath for us to take, and it is contrary to the lessons we should have \nlearned from the events of September 11.\n  To receive a driver's license, any State used to require proof that \nsomeone could drive and proof of identity through a legally issued \ngovernment document. This was often done through a notarized birth \ncertificate or a passport. Over time, criminals have found ways to \nforge these documents, and they made it easier for individuals to \nillegally acquire identification, such as a driver's license.\n  Some of the 9/11 hijackers had acquired identification documents \nthrough forged papers. It should be a wake-up call to all of us. More \nmust be done to prevent this from happening in the future.\n  This past year, in the Wyoming State Senate, I worked with \nRepresentative Pete Illoway to pass legislation making it a crime to \nuse false documents to conceal a person's identity, to conceal a \nperson's citizenship, or to conceal their resident alien status in \norder to obtain public resources or public services. We specifically \nidentified driver's licenses in the law in Wyoming because of the \nsignificance that document plays in allowing individuals to freely move \nabout the country. The bill was passed by the legislature and was \nsigned into law. The value of legally issued driver's licenses cannot \nbe underestimated in\n\n[[Page S14288]]\n\nmaintaining our national security. In Wyoming, we get it.\n  I, along with many people in America, cannot understand the arguments \nsupporting the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. To \nme, giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants will compromise our \nnational security.\n  We have an immediate situation before us where illegal immigrants in \ncertain parts of the country will be provided government documents that \nwill allow them to freely travel all across our great Nation. It is \ninconceivable to me that this will make our Nation safer.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to secure our borders and \nto secure the interior of the United States. Though that effort has \ncome up short over the years, it does not mean we should throw up our \nhands and do nothing. I believe we must take action--aggressive \naction--to address this issue.\n  Today, I am introducing a straightforward legislative proposal. It is \nS. 2334. It is a straightforward legislative proposal to deal with \nStates that provide driver's licenses to those who are in our Nation \nillegally. Simply stated, my legislation would require States to verify \nlawful presence in the United States before granting a driver's \nlicense. States that refuse would lose a part of their Federal \ntransportation funds, and those Federal transportation funds would then \nbe redistributed to the States that do follow the law.\n  I do not know if this is a perfect solution. I do know that issuing \ndriver's licenses to illegal immigrants is wrong. Rewarding illegal \nimmigrants--people who have broken into our country--with a driver's \nlicense is a flawed idea. It is an idea that deserves Congress's \nimmediate attention. We cannot allow our country to go down this path. \nThe time for action is today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2335. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to provide adequate case management services; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, almost a year ago, we passed a Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill. Included in that very large piece of \nlegislation was a small provision that probably went beneath most \npeople's notice.\n  Section 426 of that bill allows Federal funding to provide case \nmanagement services after a disaster. That has been a tragically absent \ncomponent to our circumstances in Louisiana. Educated people struggle \nto find their way through the Byzantine morass that is FEMA individual \nassistance program, the Small Business Administration's loan program, \nthe Road Home program and their own insurance company's requirements. \nThink of how all of this seems to working people who are encountering \nFederal bureaucracy for the first time.\n  So, we need case management badly. Unfortunately, Section 426 fails \nthe people of my State in two important ways. First, and this predates \nthe change in Congressional leadership, it allows for case management \nservices--but only for future disasters. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today makes Section 426 retroactive to 2005 and will now \ncover Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, as well as succeeding disasters.\n  Two years after the disaster, we only distributed half of the Road \nHome grants. It is obvious that we will need case management services \nfor years to come in Louisiana. It is only common sense to direct these \nresources to the Gulf Coast today, where they are direly needed.\n  However, an equally important failing of Section 426 comes from its \nimplementation. In New Orleans and throughout the Gulf Coast, the \nenergy for the recovery effort has truly come from America's faith \ncommunity. You can see their good work in neighborhoods that are \nreturning in my hometown. You can see them with hammers and nails in \nthe Gulf Coast towns of Mississippi, and you can find them helping \nthousands of victims of Katrina and Rita to navigate the bureaucratic \nhurdles between them, and rebuilding their lives.\n  As we have not had the benefit of Government supported case \nmanagement, nonprofits and the faith-based community have stepped in to \nfill the obvious void. Unfortunately, the same community that has been \nsuch a lifeline to the people of the Gulf Coast has been barred from \ncompeting for Federal funding under Section 426.\n  This is a shocking turnaround for an administration that has put so \nmuch emphasis on including the faith-based community in Government \nprogramming. I believe that the instinct to incorporate programs that \nare organic to the community, and are already working, was a good one. \nIt is clear to me that case management services are prime examples of \nprograms that should incorporate the faith-based community.\n  So, as you can see, circumstances have compelled me to clarify \nCongressional intent. The bill I am introducing today does two things. \nFirst, it makes Section 426 retroactive to 2005, so that it may cover \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Secondly, it strikes the phrase \n``qualified private organizations'' which has been misinterpreted to \nexclude the faith-based community. That phrase has been replaced with \n``nonprofit or faith-based organization with experience in case \nmanagement services.'' It is unfortunate that we have arrived at the \npoint where a legislative solution is needed. But nevertheless, I \nbelieve that this legislation resolves the problem, and will give \ncomfort to the people of the Gulf Coast that Federal monies are being \nspent wisely, and given to those that have shown themselves capable and \nwilling to help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These practices proved invaluable in the aftermath \n     of Hurricane Katrina when, as one of the founding members of \n     the Katrina Aid Today (KAT) coalition, UMCOR played a vital \n     role in helping nearly 200,000 individuals rebuild their \n     lives. UMCOR also served as the KAT's fiscal agent, \n     overseeing the administration of over $70 million in federal \n     funding and an addition contribution of over $70 million in \n     private dollars to Hurricane Katrina's victims.\n       The broad language currently contained within the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act offers \n     federal funding to ``qualified private organizations'' to \n     provide case management services to individuals affected by \n     major disasters. Unfortunately, this language does not \n     recognize the extent to which organizations such as UMCOR \n     have efficiently and effectively provided these services in \n     the past. Through the Case Management Services Improvement \n     Act of 2007, you recognize and highlight the value of the \n     disaster-related case management services provided by \n     mission-driven, faith-based or non-profit organizations, \n     value that can not be duplicated by less-experienced, profit-\n     driven private companies.\n       Please let me know if the United Methodist Committee on \n     Relief, or the other members of Katrina Aid Today, can be of \n     any\n\n[[Page S14289]]\n\n     assistance as you proceed in getting this important \n     legislation passed.

This legislation is of great \n     importance to all individuals affected by major disasters, as \n     it will allow them to receive case management services from \n     the non-profit and faith-based organizations that have a long \n     and successful history of carrying out these activities.\n       Katrina Aid Today (KAT) is a consortium of 10 social \n     service and voluntary organizations, dedicated to helping \n     survivors navigate the system as they recovered from this \n     tragic disruption of their lives. Member organizations \n     include Catholic Charities USA, Lutheran Disaster Response, \n     Episcopal Relief & Development, the United Methodist \n     Committee on Relief, and the Salvation Army, among others. \n     Following Hurricane Katrina, KAT administered over $70 \n     million in federal funding for disaster case management, \n     helping nearly 200,000 individuals rebuild their lives. \n     Additionally, the partner organizations within KAT matched \n     this federal funding with another $70 million in private \n     dollars, providing a comprehensive continuum of care that \n     addressed the needs of each survivor.\n       Currently, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act overlooks the valuable work of the \n     faith-based organizations that have effectively provided \n     these services in the past, by broadly allowing ``qualified \n     private organizations'' to provide case management services \n     to individuals affected by major disasters. In the Case \n     Management Services Improvement Act of 2007, you recognize \n     the value in having disaster-related case management services \n     provided by mission-driven, faith-based or non-profit \n     organizations such as KAT, rather than leaving these vital \n     responsibilities to less-experienced private companies that \n     must answer to shareholders.\n       Please let us know if any of the members of Katrina Aid \n     Today can be of any assistance as you proceed in passing the \n     Case Management Services Improvement Act of 2007.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nlong-term care insurance to be offered under cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements and to provide additional consumer \nprotections for long-term care insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Saturday, November 10, marked the last \nday of Long-Term Care Awareness Week--this was a week where our Nation \nrecognized that now more than ever, Americans need to pay attention to \nlong-term care issues. My colleagues Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Stabenow, \nSmith and I couldn't think of a better way to cap off the Week than by \nintroducing the Long-Term Care Affordability and Security Act of 2007.\n  Our Nation is graying. Research shows that the elderly population \nwill nearly double by 2030. By 2050, the population of those aged 85 \nand older will have grown by more than 300 percent. Research also shows \nthat the average age at which individuals need long-term care services, \nsuch as home health care or a private room at a nursing home, is 75. \nCurrently, the average annual cost for a private room at a nursing home \nis more than $75,000. This cost is expected to be in excess of $140,000 \nby 2030.\n  Based on these facts, we can see that our Nation needs to prepare its \ncitizens for the challenges they may face in old age. One way to \nprepare for these challenges is by encouraging more Americans to obtain \nlong-term care insurance coverage. To date, only 10 percent of seniors \nhave long-term care insurance policies, and only 7 percent of all \nprivate-sector employees are offered long-term care insurance as a \nvoluntary benefit.\n  Under current law, employees may pay for certain health-related \nbenefits, which may include health insurance premiums, co-pays, and \ndisability or life insurance, on a pre-tax basis under cafeteria plans \nand flexible spending arrangements, FSAs. Essentially, an employee may \nelect to reduce his or her annual salary to pay for these benefits, and \nthe employee doesn't pay taxes on the amounts used to pay these costs. \nEmployees, however, are explicitly prohibited from paying for the cost \nof long-term care insurance coverage tax-free.\n  Our bill would allow employers, for the first time, to offer \nqualified long-term care insurance to employees under FSAs and \ncafeteria plans. This means employees would be permitted to pay for \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums on a tax-free basis. This \nwould make it easier for employees to purchase long-term care \ninsurance, which many find unaffordable. This should also encourage \nyounger individuals to purchase long-term care insurance. The younger \nthe person is at the time the long-care insurance contract is \npurchased, the lower the insurance premium.\n  An aging Nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, \nand the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than \never. I look forward to working with Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Stabenow, \nSmith and\n\n[[Page S14290]]\n\nall of our Senate colleagues toward enacting the Long-Term Care \nAffordability and Security Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Dodd):\n  S. 2338. An original bill to modernize and update the National \nHousing Act and enable the Federal Housing Administration to more \neffectively reach underserved borrowers, and for other purposes; from \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; placed on the \ncalendar.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to report the FHA \nModernization Act of 2007. This is vitally important legislation, and I \nwant to take a moment to express my thanks to Senator Martinez for his \nvery close collaboration and support in putting this legislation \ntogether. This is an original bill produced by the Senate Banking \nCommittee, and as such, the rules prohibit us from obtaining \ncosponsors. However, I would like to recognize Senators Reed, Schumer, \nBayh, Menendez, Brown, Kerry, Murray, Whitehouse, Martinez, Voinovich, \nCornyn, and Coleman for their support of this bill and for their offers \nof cosponsorship.\n  The mortgage markets--particularly the subprime market--are in the \nmidst of a meltdown. Historically high default and foreclosure rates \ngenerated, in significant part, by abusive and predatory lending \npractices, are threatening millions of American families with the loss \nof their most significant financial asset--their homes--at a cost of \nover $160 billion in home equity, according to testimony presented \nbefore the Banking Committee.\n  While these problems are addressed, we need to make sure that credit \nis available, including for subprime borrowers, on fair terms so that \nthe people of this country have an opportunity to build wealth for the \nfuture.\n  A revitalized, strengthened, and modernized FHA can be and, under \nthis legislation, will be a source of this constructive, wealth-\nbuilding credit, both\n\n[[Page S14291]]\n\nfor new homeowners and for people who are seeking a way out of the \nabusive loans in which they are currently trapped.\n  In short, by providing low-cost credit, without prepayment penalties, \nwithout teaser rates, and without other deceptive terms, FHA is a part \nof the solution to the predatory lending crisis we are experiencing.\n  Moreover, FHA has traditionally been an important tool for creating \nnew minority homeowners, and for lower-, moderate-, and middle-income \nfamilies to become homeowners. By modernizing FHA, we will help \nmillions of families achieve their American Dream. FHA is in a strong \nposition to play this role: an independent audit report indicates that \nFHA has a record $22 billion in capital, and a capital ratio, 6.82 \npercent, that is more than three times higher the mandated level of 2 \npercent.\n  The bill passed by the Committee, and which is being filed today does \na number of important things: it raises FHA loan limits so that the \nprogram can reach many more people; it lowers downpayment requirements, \nwhile still ensuring that people will have a real stake in their new \nhomes; it expands the reverse mortgage program for elderly homeowners \nby both raising the loan limit and removing the current cap on the \nnumber of these mortgages FHA can insure. I know Senators Reed, Crapo, \nand Allard strongly support this program; it reduces the origination \nfee that elderly homeowners can be charged for these mortgages by one-\nquarter, from 2 percent to 1.5 percent making it more affordable for \nseniors to take out these loans; and, it includes a major overhaul of \nFHA's manufactured housing program, authored by our colleagues Senators \nBayh and Allard.\n  Taken together, these changes will help make FHA a more relevant and \neffective program. This legislation is supported by the Mortgage \nBankers Association, the National Association of Home Builders, the \nNational Association of Realtors, AARP, the Manufactured Housing \nAssociation, the Manufactured Housing Institute, and others. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Individual Development Accounts to support \nfoster youths who are transitioning from the foster care system; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, youth aging out of foster care \nconstitute one of our Nation's most vulnerable populations. Not only do \nthese young people carry wih them histories of child abuse and neglect, \nbut they are also often unsupported in their transition from foster \ncare to independent living. Today, I am pleased to introduce the \nFocusing Investments and Resources for a Safe Transition Act or FIRST \nAct, a piece of legislation that will offer much needed financial \nassistance to young adults as they exit the child welfare system.\n  Research shows that youth aging out of foster care fare worse than \ntheir counterparts in the general population on a variety of social, \neducational, and health indicators. These youth report significantly \nlower levels of education and are more likely to be unemployed or \nhomeless. Research also shows that, as they prepare to exit foster \ncare, these young adults do not receive the independent living services \nnecessary to support them through their transition. When it comes to \nguidance on educational opportunities and employment, money management \nand housing, resources for foster youth are simply inadequate.\n  These young people need our help, and they need it now. According to \nthe most recent Federal data, over 20,000 youth age out of the foster \ncare system each year. We must intervene in order to prevent them from \nexperiencing the unfavorable outcomes described in the research. The \nFIRST Act meets this task head on by addressing the financial status of \nyouth exiting foster care. Specifically, the legislation supports \nstates in setting up Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs, for \nthose preparing to age out of the child welfare system. The accounts \nwill contain a Federal deposit on behalf of foster youth matched by \npublic and private community partners.\n  Upon transitioning from foster care, and after completing money \nmanagement training, the legislation permits youths to withdraw their \nsavings to pay for necessities such as educational opportunities, \nvocational training, and housing--elements critical to achieving self-\nsufficiency. In short, with these funds, youth aging out of the child \nwelfare system will have a financial base on which they can build self-\nsustaining, goal-oriented, independent lives.\n  A similar program is currently being piloted in my State of New York. \nThis summer, Mayor Mike Bloomberg announced that 450 New York City \nfoster youths will be provided IDAs through a program called Youth \nFinancial Empowerment. Similarly, the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities \nPassport program has experienced success in offering IDAs to foster \nyouth in several cities.\n  For years I have been encouraging Congress to take action regarding \nthe needs of foster youth. In 2002 I introduced the Opportunity \nPassport Act, which, among other provisions, called for the \nestablishment of IDAs for those aging out of the child welfare system. \nSince that time we have failed to make progress on this issue while \nyouth continue to exit foster care without the resources they need. It \nis under these circumstances that I come forward again today to present \nthe needs of this vulnerable group of young people. It is my hope that \nyou will join me in putting foster youth FIRST and support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2343. A bill to amend the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act to \nrequire mortgage originators to make their fees more transparent; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Real Estate \nTransparency Act of 2007. This bill would amend the\n\n[[Page S14299]]\n\nReal Estate Settlement Practices Act of 1974 to improve the early loan \ndisclosures given to those applying for a mortgage, ensure binding and \ntransparent payment agreements between mortgage originators and \nborrowers, and require that a borrower be given a copy of their final \nsettlement statement at least one business day before settlement so \nthat it can be thoroughly examined before closing.\n  As we are all too aware, current Good Faith Estimates do not provide \nenough useful information to help borrowers truly make informed lending \ndecisions. We have heard too many stories of borrowers not \nunderstanding the terms of their loan or not being told about \nunexpectedly high settlement fees until they are at the closing table. \nThis lack of early and appropriate disclosures regarding the terms of a \nmortgage loan and the costs of closing on that loan hinders a family's \nability to shop for the best loan product for the purchase of a home, \nand also has allowed families to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous \nbrokers and lenders.\n  First and foremost, the Real Estate Transparency Act would replace \nthe current Good Faith Estimate with an early written settlement \nstatement of all of the costs to be charged to that person at or before \nsettlement of the loan. It would require that this early settlement \nstatement be in the same form as the final settlement statement, \ncurrently known as the HUD 1. The borrower would not be liable for any \nfees which are not disclosed on this early settlement statement, except \nfor third party fees within 10 percent of the cost listed on the early \nsettlement statement, or fees for bona fide and reasonable expenses not \nanticipated by the mortgage originator for an inspection, appraisal, \nsurvey, or flood certification. This early written settlement statement \nshould allow consumers to compare the costs associated with different \nloan products from different mortgage originators and shop around for \nthe best product for them early in the process.\n  Second, this legislation would require for the first time that the \nHUD 1 or final settlement statement be provided to the borrower at \nleast one business day before settlement. If this final settlement \nstatement is not provided to the borrower, then lenders will be subject \nto statutory damages.\n  Third, this bill would require mortgage originators to provide \nborrowers with a written agreement itemizing all of the fees they may \ncharge the borrower, including any origination fees, underwriting fees, \nbroker fees, or other fees to be charged at or before settlement of \nsuch loan to be paid to the lender, the broker, or affiliates of the \nlender or broker. In addition, this written agreement would have to set \nout and explain three possible methods of payment for such fees: \npayment in cash before or at settlement; adding such fees into the loan \namount to be borrowed; and increasing the interest rate of the loan. \nThe borrower also could choose to both pay in cash and incorporate some \nof the fees into the loan amount. This written agreement regarding \nmortgage origination fees would have to be provided to the borrower \nwithin three days of application and be signed before the borrower is \nobligated to pay any of these fees. Not only should this provide \ngreater transparency regarding what fees are going to be charged by the \nmortgage originator, consumers also can decide not to sign on the \ndotted line if they do not like the costs associated with the loan.\n  Finally, the bill subjects mortgage originators to statutory damages \nfor violations of these disclosure provisions equal to the sum of the \nborrower's actual damages plus $5,000 for each instance such instance \nof noncompliance.\n  Congress needs to take many steps to address the subprime mortgage \ncrisis and to reinstate confidence among our nation's homeowners and \nthose we hope will become homeowners. I believe that giving consumers \nthe information they need regarding their loan costs is a vital part of \nimproving this complicated and often overwhelming process. Borrowers \nneed to better understand the financial ramifications of choosing a \ncertain loan product from a certain mortgage originator early in this \nprocess, and before they actually consummate the loan.

which \nwas referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S. Res. 375\n\n       Whereas the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States (referred to in this Resolution as the ``9/\n     11 Commission'') conducted a lengthy review of the facts and \n     circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, including those relating to the intelligence \n     community, law enforcement agencies, and the role of \n     congressional oversight and resource allocation;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that \n     congressional oversight of the intelligence activities of the \n     United States is dysfunctional;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that under the rules of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in effect at the time the report was \n     completed, the committees of Congress charged with oversight \n     of the intelligence activities lacked the power, influence, \n     and sustained capability to meet the daunting challenges \n     faced by the intelligence community of the United States;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that as long as such oversight is governed by such \n     rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the \n     people of the United States will not get the security they \n     want and need;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that a strong, stable, and capable congressional \n     committee structure is needed to give the intelligence \n     community of the United States appropriate oversight, \n     support, and leadership;\n       Whereas in its final report, the 9/11 Commission further \n     found that the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission in \n     its final report will not succeed if congressional oversight \n     of the intelligence community in the United States is not \n     changed;\n       Whereas the 9/11 Commission recommended structural changes \n     to Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence \n     activities;\n       Whereas the 9/11 Commission recommended that the \n     authorizing authorities and appropriating authorities with \n     respect to intelligence activities in each house of Congress \n     be combined into a single committee in each house of \n     Congress;\n       Whereas Congress has enacted some of the recommendations \n     made by the 9/11 Commission and is considering implementing \n     additional recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; and\n       Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 445 in the \n     108th Congress to address some of the intelligence oversight \n     recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by abolishing term \n     limits for the members of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, clarifying jurisdiction for intelligence-\n     related nominations, and streamlining procedures for the \n     referral of intelligence-related legislation, but other \n     aspects of the 9/11 Commission recommendations regarding \n     intelligence oversight have not been implemented: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this resolution are--\n       (1) to improve congressional oversight of the intelligence \n     activities of the United States;\n       (2) to provide a strong, stable, and capable congressional \n     committee structure to provide the intelligence community \n     appropriate oversight, support, and leadership;\n       (3) to implement a key recommendation of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the \n     ``9/11 Commission'') that structural changes be made to \n     Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence activities; \n     and\n       (4) to provide vigilant legislative oversight over the \n     intelligence activities of the United States to assure that \n     such activities are in conformity with the Constitution and \n     laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. ___3.

In any covered civil action--\n       ``(A) if the plaintiff is the Federal Government or a State \n     government, the burden of proof shall be on the defendant or \n     defendants to establish by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that the merger, acquisition, or transaction at issue will \n     not--\n       ``(i) substantially lessen competition; or\n       ``(ii) tend to create a monopoly in 1 or more geographic \n     markets; and\n       ``(B) for any other plaintiff, if the plaintiff \n     demonstrates that the parties to the merger, acquisition, or \n     other transaction have a combined market share of not less \n     than 20 percent in any relevant market, the burden of proof \n     shall be on the defendant or defendants to establish by a \n     preponderance of the evidence that the merger, acquisition, \n     or transaction at issue will not--\n       ``(i) substantially lessen competition; or\n       ``(ii) tend to create a monopoly in 1 or more geographic \n     markets.''.\n       (2) Agricultural Guidelines.--\n       (A) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (i) The effective enforcement of the antitrust laws in \n     agriculture requires that the antitrust enforcement agencies \n     have guidelines with respect to mergers and other \n     anticompetitive conduct that are properly adapted to the \n     special circumstances of agricultural commodity markets.\n       (ii) There has been a substantial increase in concentration \n     in the markets in which agricultural commodities are sold, \n     with the result that buyers of agricultural commodities often \n     possess regional dominance in the form of oligopsony or \n     monopsony relative to sellers of such commodities. A \n     substantial part of this increase in market concentration is \n     the direct result of mergers and acquisitions that the \n     antitrust enforcement agencies did not challenge, in large \n     part because of the lack of appropriate guidelines \n     identifying particular structural characteristics in the \n     agricultural industry and the adverse competitive effects \n     that such acquisitions and mergers would create.\n       (iii) The cost of transportation, impact on quality, and \n     delay in sales of agricultural commodities if they are to be \n     transported to more distant buyers result in narrow \n     geographic markets with respect to buyer power.\n       (iv) Buyers have no economic incentive to bid up the price \n     of agricultural commodities in the absence of effective \n     competition. Further, the nature of buying makes it feasible \n     for larger numbers of buyers to engage in tacit or overt \n     collusion to restrain price competition.\n       (v) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have \n     incentives to engage in unfair, exploitive, discriminatory,\n\n[[Page S14330]]\n\n     and exclusionary acts that cause producers of agricultural \n     commodities to receive less than a competitive price for \n     their goods, transfer economic risks to sellers without \n     reasonable compensation, and exclude sellers from access to \n     the market.\n       (vi) Markets for agricultural commodities often involve \n     contexts in which many producers have relatively limited \n     information and no bargaining power with respect to the sale \n     of their commodities. These conditions invite buyers with \n     significant oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power to exercise \n     that power in ways that involve discrimination, exploitation, \n     and undue differentiation among sellers.\n       (vii) Some Federal courts have incorrectly required a \n     plaintiff to show harm to competition generally, in addition \n     to harm to the producer of agricultural commodities when \n     making a determination that an unfair, unjustly \n     discriminatory, deceptive, or preferential act exists. Those \n     same courts have also incorrectly held that it is a complete \n     defense if a defendant can show any nonharmful justification \n     for an act or practice, even though such conduct was not \n     essential to the business activities of the defendant or \n     there were less harmful ways to achieve a reasonably \n     comparable result with respect to the legitimate and \n     necessary interests of the defendant.\n       (B) Issuance of guidelines.--The Assistant Attorney General \n     and the Chairman, in consultation with the Special Counsel, \n     shall issue agricultural guidelines informed and guided by \n     the findings under subparagraph (A) that--\n       (i) facilitate a fair, open, accessible, transparent, and \n     efficient market system for agricultural products;\n       (ii) reflect the national public interest in preserving a \n     substantial and diverse family farm and ranch sector;\n       (iii) recognize that increasing competition in the purchase \n     of agricultural products by highly concentrated firms from a \n     sector in perfect competition is entirely consistent with the \n     objective of the antitrust laws to protect consumers and \n     enhance consumer benefits from competition; and\n       (iv) prevent any merger or acquisition in the agricultural \n     industry, if the effect of that merger or acquisition may be \n     to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a \n     monopoly.\n       (C) Contents.--The agricultural guidelines issued under \n     subparagraph (B) shall consist of merger guidelines relating \n     to existing and potential competition and vertical \n     integration that--\n       (i) establish appropriate methodologies for determining the \n     geographic and product markets for mergers affecting \n     agricultural commodity markets;\n       (ii) establish thresholds of increased concentration that \n     raise a presumption that the merger will have an adverse \n     effect on competition in the affected agricultural \n     commodities markets;\n       (iii) identify potential adverse competitive effects of \n     mergers in agricultural commodities markets in a nonexclusive \n     manner; and\n       (iv) identify the factors that would permit an enforcement \n     agency to determine when a merger in the agricultural \n     commodities market might avoid liability because it is not \n     likely to have an adverse effect on competition.\n       (3) Agriculture Competition Task Force Working Group on \n     Buying Power.--\n       (A) In general.--In issuing agricultural guidelines under \n     this subsection, the Chairman and the Assistant Attorney \n     General shall consult with the working group on buyer power \n     of the Task Force established under subsection (c)(4) and may \n     incorporate and implement the recommendations of that working \n     group.\n       (B) Explanation.--If the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General do not incorporate any recommendation of the \n     working group on buyer power of the Task Force established \n     under subsection (c)(4) in the agricultural guidelines issued \n     under this subsection, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report regarding \n     the reasons for not adopting that recommendation.\n       (4) Completion.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) issue agricultural guidelines under this subsection; \n     and\n       (B) submit to Congress the agricultural guidelines issued \n     under this subsection.\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Assistant \n     Attorney General shall jointly submit a report to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the House of Representatives regarding the \n     issuing of agricultural guidelines under this subsection.\n       (f) Post-Merger Review of Agricultural Transactions.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 5 years after the date of a \n     covered merger or acquisition, the Assistant Attorney General \n     or the Chairman, as the case may be, shall conduct a post-\n     merger review to determine whether the effect of that covered \n     merger or acquisition tended to substantially reduce \n     competition in the agricultural industry.\n       (2) Sharing of results.--\n       (A) In general.--The Assistant Attorney General and the \n     Chairman shall each submit to Congress an annual report \n     regarding the results of any post-merger review under \n     paragraph (1), for its consideration in examining problems in \n     agricultural competition.\n       (B) Protection of information.--The Assistant Attorney \n     General or the Chairman, as the case may be, shall ensure \n     that confidential or proprietary information is adequately \n     protected in submitting each report required under \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``covered \n     merger or acquisition'' means a merger or acquisition--\n       (A) in the agricultural industry;\n       (B) that is subject to the notification requirements under \n     section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a);\n       (C) for which the Assistant Attorney General or the \n     Chairman, as the case may be, required the submission of \n     additional information or documentary material under section \n     7A(e)(1)(A) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a(e)(1)(A)); and\n       (D) for which, after review under that section, the \n     Assistant Attorney General or the Chairman, as the case may \n     be--\n       (i) did not institute a proceeding or action under the \n     antitrust laws; or\n       (ii) instituted a proceeding or action under the antitrust \n     laws that was resolved through a settlement agreement or \n     consent decree.\n       (g) Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition.--\n       (1) In general.--The Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 \n     U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is amended--\n       (A) by striking the title I heading and all that follows \n     through ``This Act'' and inserting the following:\n\n                     ``TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                       ``Subtitle A--Definitions\n\n     ``SEC. 1.

FISHERY FAILURE OF THE NORTHEAST GROUNDFISH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Secretary of Commerce may provide fishery disaster \n     assistance under section 312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)) \n     if the Secretary determines that there is a commercial \n     fishery failure due to a fishery resource disaster as a \n     result of--\n       (A) natural causes;\n       (B) man-made causes beyond the control of fishery managers \n     to mitigate through conservation and management measures, \n     including regulatory restrictions imposed to protect human \n     health or the marine environment; or\n       (C) undetermined causes.\n       (2) The Secretary of Commerce has not proposed or \n     promulgated regulations to implement such section 312(a).\n       (3) During 2007, the Governors of each of the Commonwealth \n     of Massachusetts, the State of Maine, and the State of Rhode \n     Island requested that the Secretary of Commerce declare a \n     commercial fishery failure for the groundfish fishery under \n     such section 312(a) and the Governor of the State of New \n     Hampshire has indicated his intention of submitting a similar \n     request.\n       (4) Since 1996, the Secretary of Commerce has had \n     regulations in place that require significant restrictions \n     and reductions on the catch and days-at-sea of New England \n     fishermen in the groundfish fishery.\n       (5) New England fishermen in the groundfish fishery have \n     endured additional restrictions and reductions under \n     Framework 42, which has resulted in many fishermen having \n     just 24 days to fish during a season.\n       (6) Framework 42 and other Federal fishing restrictions \n     have had a great impact on small-boat fishermen, many of whom \n     cannot safely fish beyond the inshore areas. As of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, each day-at-sea a fisherman \n     spends in an inshore area reduces that fisherman's number of \n     available days-at-sea by 2 days.\n       (7) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has provided \n     information to the Secretary of Commerce demonstrating that--\n       (A) between 1994 and 2006, overall conditions of groundfish \n     stocks have not improved and that spawning stock biomass is \n     near record lows for most major groundfish stocks; and\n       (B) between 2005 and 2006, total Massachusetts commercial \n     groundfish vessel revenues (landings) decreased by 18 percent \n     and there was a loss for related industries and communities \n     estimated at $22,000,000.\n       (8) The State of Maine has provided information to the \n     Secretary of Commerce indicating that--\n       (A) since 1994, the impact of groundfish regulations has \n     eliminated 50 percent of Maine's groundfish fleet, leaving \n     just 110 active groundfish fishermen;\n       (B) between 1996 and 2006, there was a 58 percent decrease \n     in groundfish landings in\n\n[[Page S14347]]\n\n     Maine and a 45 percent decrease in groundfish revenue, from \n     approximately $27,000,000 to $15,000,000; and\n       (C) between 2005 and 2006, groundfish revenues decreased 25 \n     percent.\n       (9) The State of Rhode Island has provided information to \n     the Secretary of Commerce indicating that--\n       (A) since 1994, there has been a 66 percent drop in Rhode \n     Island's groundfish fishery landings; and\n       (B) between 1995 and 2007, groundfish revenue decreased 20 \n     percent from approximately $7,500,000 to $6,000,000.\n       (10) The Secretary of Commerce rejected requests from \n     Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island to declare a \n     commercial fishery failure prior to establishing any \n     appropriate standard to implement section 312(a) of the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n       (11) For centuries, growth in New England's commercial \n     fishing industry has been intertwined with the history and \n     economic growth of the New England States and has created \n     thousands of jobs in both fishing and fishing-related \n     industries for generations of New England residents.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Commerce should--\n       (1) reconsider the October 22, 2007 decision to deny the \n     requests of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of \n     Maine, and the State of Rhode Island for a groundfish fishery \n     failure declaration;\n       (2) look favorably upon the request of the State of New \n     Hampshire for a groundfish fishery failure declaration; and\n       (3) immediately propose regulations to implement section \n     312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3650.

Mr. President, we have been working very diligently on \nboth sides of the aisle today to put together a list of amendments we \ncould agree with each other would be the maximum number and substance \nof amendments that would be offered on the farm bill. Senator Reid, \nSenator McConnell, Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, and myself have all \nbeen engaged in different conversations today about these amendments. \nAt the end of the day, the lists we have come up with are very long on \nboth sides. I think the total number exceeds 275.\n  As we all know, on bills of this magnitude, an overwhelming number of \nthose amendments will ultimately disappear. We will dispose of them by \neither bringing them to the floor by accepting them or by the authors \nand proponents of those amendments agreeing at the end of the day that \nthey simply don't want to do anything other than talk about their \namendments.\n  We are not able to enter into a unanimous consent agreement on this \nright now. I understand the leadership is going to wait until in the \nmorning to do that. But by starting first thing in the morning, I think \nwe do have the opportunity to move through a significant number of \nthese amendments, and I encourage the proponents of the amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle to think seriously about whether you want to \nsee a farm bill completed, and if you do, then come down, agree to a \nminimal amount of time we can use for debate and discussion on the \namendments, and let's move through these amendments with as much haste \nas we possibly can.\n  I do regret that--we are here ready to agree to a unanimous consent \nthat this will be the complete list and we will begin working and we \nlook forward to being here tomorrow in that same frame of mind, to \nagree to the list of amendments as proposed on both sides of the aisle. \nWe are not happy with some of their amendments and I understand they \nare not happy with some of the amendments coming from this side. Again, \nthat is the way this body has always worked, and I hope in the morning \nwe are ready to proceed and we can move toward debate, discussion, and \nvoting on these various amendments, and that we can conclude this as \nsoon as possible, whether that is before we leave this week--it may be \nimpossible--but in any event, we will begin work on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while my friend is on the floor and my \nfriend from South Dakota is on the floor, through the Chair to my \nfriend from Georgia, looking at these two lists kind of puts a smile on \nyour face, because it is quite a list. There is a multitude of tax \nissues and a lot of things totally not relevant to this farm bill.\n  But I would say through the Chair to my friend that I am going to \ntake a look at this--I have had some good meetings with my staff and \nSenator Harkin today--and make a decision about what we should do on \nthis tomorrow. But the question I have of my friend from Georgia is how \nlong do we have to work on this, work our way through these amendments? \nThere are about 280 or 290 amendments. I sit here today and I say \nagain, I have no doubt that the vast majority of the Democrats--with a \nsignificant majority of Democrats, with a handful of help from the \nRepublicans, cloture would be invoked on this bill.\n  So I say to my friend, how long do you think we should play around \nwith all of these amendments? Is there a magic number we need to have \nvotes on some of them? When should I file cloture? If farm State \nSenators and if other Senators want a farm bill, time is wasting. We \nhave a few more days left in this work period before Thanksgiving, and \nwhen we come back after Thanksgiving we have a very short 3 weeks to \nget all of the Federal Government's work done that has to be done \nbefore the calendar year ends. So I don't expect my friend to answer \nthe question without talking to my counterpart on the other side, but I \nwant him to think about how much longer do we do this little gesture we \nare going through here? We have wasted a lot of time. The question the \nRepublicans have to make a decision on is do they want a farm bill? We \nwant one. We want a farm bill. We will take the bill that came out of \ncommittee--the vast majority of us--but we know there are some \namendments we need to do. I think it is important we do the Dorgan \namendment. I think it is important we do the Lugar amendment. I do \nthink the substitute and the payment limits are something we need to \ndo, but I don't know how much more of this we should be concerned \nabout.\n  I will have some meetings in the morning and we will report back to \nthe ranking member of this very important committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader I \nappreciate his comments. Obviously, I don't have the answer to the \nquestion as to how long we should consider the amendments before we \nfile cloture. That is a decision for the majority leader to make on his \nown, hopefully in consultation with the leadership on this side. But \nwhat I would say is we started this process last week. There were \nprocedural issues that had to be resolved last week. We sat around for \na couple of days without being able to bring up amendments. Here we are \nagain. We have sat around today, again, without having the opportunity \nto bring them up. After having served 8 years in the House, I have an \nappreciation of the Senate as I have never had before. It is a \ndeliberative body that our forefathers decided it should be, and I have \nseen no better example of that deliberation than I have on this \nparticular bill.\n\n  That being said, we won't know when it is the right time to file \ncloture until we begin the work, and if we begin the work on this \ntomorrow, I know from our side of the aisle--and I will make the \ncommitment--we will move these amendments as quickly as possible. There \nis the great likelihood that a number of these amendments won't be \ncalled up, but we won't know until we get into the process.\n  My farmers and ranchers want a farm bill. They like the one we have, \nbut this bill, in my opinion, improves ag policy for the next 5 years. \nIf we should not be able to get a farm bill, then an extension of the \ncurrent farm bill is one of the options that is out there.\n  I have said all along that I think we could improve that product and \nthis farm bill does that. So I hope we can come here in the morning \nwith the idea that we are going to take up these amendments and we will \ntake the Grassley and Dorgan amendment as the first one. That is on \npayment limits. I am opposed to the amendment and I will have a lot to \nsay about it during the debate, but we are ready to talk about it and \nwe are ready to begin the process. I hope that with all of the counsel \navailable to the majority leader, he will be prepared with us to begin \nthe debate and vote on these amendments in the morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/13/senate-section/article/S14350-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14350-S14351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 589\n\n  Mr. REID.
