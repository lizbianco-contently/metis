Vimoto\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise because a soldier from my home \nState of Kentucky has fallen. On June 5, 2007, PFC Timothy R. Vimoto \nwas tragically killed while on patrol in the Korengal Valley in \nAfghanistan. Private First Class Vimoto, who called the town of Fort \nCampbell, KY, his home, was 19 years old.\n  For bravery in service to his country, Private First Class Vimoto \nreceived several awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze \nStar Medal.\n  Private First Class Vimoto's Kentucky story may be more circuitous \nthan most; yet I am proud to stand here and say we both hail from the \nBluegrass State. Born in Hawaii, Tim's father is CSM Isaia T. Vimoto. \nBeing from a military family, Tim followed his father to Army postings \nas a child.\n  This led Tim to Fort Campbell, KY, home to thousands of our brave \nsoldiers and the 101st Airborne Division. Command Sergeant Major Vimoto \nwas a senior advisor to the commander of the 101st. Tim attended Fort \nCampbell High School, where he made many friends and was part of the \nschool's football team.\n  ``Tim was known throughout the school as the kid with the biggest and \nbest smile,'' says Shawn Berner, Tim's high school football coach. ``He \nwas always smiling and willing to help anyone in the school. . . . He \nwas a very caring and generous person that touched a lot of people's \nlives in a positive manner.''\n  ``He's one of our babies,'' says Kesha Ladd, one of Tim's old \nteachers at Fort Campbell High. ``When you teach on post, it's like you \nhelp raise these children when their parents are deployed.''\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\n  ``Tim was liked by everyone,'' Shawn Berner adds.\n  After graduating high school in 2006, Tim chose to follow in his \nfather's footsteps and enlist in the Army.\n  He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd \nAirborne Brigade Combat Team, based in Camp Ederle, Italy. In fact, he \nwas at the same posting as his father at that time, and as Isaia Vimoto \nwas the brigade's most senior enlisted soldier, Tim actually fell under \nhis command.\n  Fellow soldiers remembered the influence Tim's father had on him and \nhow it shaped him into the model soldier he became.\n  ``He saw the transformation from being a son to being a soldier,'' \nsays SGT Andy Short. And ``no matter what Vimoto was doing, he had a \nsmile on his face.''\n  ``Throughout his childhood, [Tim] watched his father train, deploy, \nre-deploy and develop into one of the strongest leaders in the Army,'' \nsays another fellow soldier, CPT Matthew Heimerle.\n  Command Sergeant Major Vimoto himself, currently stationed in Italy, \nsays his son was ``a very talented young man with lots of potential.''\n  Tim's family and fellow soldiers held a memorial service for him in \nItaly, and hundreds of friends who wanted to say goodbye packed the \nchapel. We are thinking today of all those who mourn his loss.\n  Our thoughts are with his parents, Isaia and Misimua Vimoto; his \nbrothers, Isaia Jr. and Nephi; his sisters, Sabrina and Ariel; and many \nother loved ones.\n  Mr. President, the Vimoto family's loss of their beloved son and \nbrother--while serving alongside the father who raised and inspired \nhim, no less--cannot be measured. But neither can this U.S. Senate's \nimmense pride and reverence for his service and his sacrifice.\n  Our Nation honors him as a soldier and a patriot. And we thank the \nVimoto family for giving their country such a hero.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7710-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2035, which the \nclerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 2035) to maintain the \n     free flow of information to the public by providing \n     conditions for the federally compelled disclosure of \n     information by certain persons connected with the news media.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour prior to \nthe cloture vote will be equally divided and controlled by the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each, with the final 20 minutes under the control of the two \nleaders, with the majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes \nprior to the vote, and with 10 minutes of the majority time under the \ncontrol of Senator Leahy of Vermont.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 2035, \nthe Free Flow of Information Act.\n  This legislation is truly a product of bipartisan effort during this \nCongress. Senator Specter and I have worked closely together to craft a \ncareful bill that protects both the freedom of the press and the safety \nof our citizens.\n  In a free and democratic country, we should be able to do both, and \nthis bill does.\n  Other Senators--including Senators Lugar, Dodd, and Graham--have been \ninstrumental in moving the bill to this point, and I wanted to thank \nour chair, Senator Leahy, for being not only a sponsor of the bill but \nsomebody who helped bring it to the floor.\n  S. 2035--a product of lengthy compromise and negotiation--is ripe for \npassage. In fact, it is long overdue.\n  There is now overwhelming support for a Federal law that gives a \nqualified--I repeat, qualified--privilege to allow journalists to honor \npromises of confidentiality to their sources unless a judge finds that \ncompelling disclosure better serves the public interest.\n  How widespread is support for this legislation?\n  The presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee, Barack Obama, \nsupports this bill. The presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain, \nsupports this bill. Forty-two State attorneys general--both Democratic \nand Republican--support this bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee, as \nevidenced by a vote of 15 to 4, supports this bill. The House of \nRepresentatives, as evidenced by a vote of 398 to 21, supports a \nsimilar bill. And, of course, over 100 newspaper editorials support \nthis bill.\n  Conservative voices, such as former Solicitor General Ted Olson and \nthe editorial page of the Washington Times, support this bill, as well \nas the Washington Post. So it does have broad support.\n  Given some of the ill-founded handwringing by the current \nadministration over this bill, it is worth listening to what former \nJustice officials such as Mr. Olson say. Here is what Ted Olson \nrecently wrote:\n\n       A free society depends on access to information and on a \n     free and robust press willing to dig out the truth. This \n     requires some ability to deal from time to time with sources \n     who require the capacity to speak freely but anonymously. . . \n     . [The Free Flow of Information Act] is well balanced and \n     long overdue, and it should be enacted.\n\n  That is Ted Olson, so it is surprising the administration is opposed \nto the bill. There is similar support from both liberal and \nconservative sides.\n  Here is how the conservative Washington Times put it:\n\n       A sound shield law guards not ``the media'' but something \n     much more vital--the public's right to know . . . A measured \n     law would not shield sources who perpetrate demonstrable and \n     articulable harm to the country's national security \n     interests. But it would rightly shield most others. Such a \n     bill awaits Senate action now. It should be passed.\n\n  That is from an editorial of July 25, 2008.\n  Unfortunately, given the broad and bipartisan support of this \nlegislation, a minority of critics have taken to attacks that are \noverwrought and overstated.\n  Every criticism is either wrong or is effectively addressed in the \nsubstitute bill, which I spoke about last night on the floor and is in \nthe Record as of last night, so my colleagues can see it. Senator \nSpecter and Senator Lugar and I have worked to meet every one of these \nobjections.\n  Fundamentally, critics have suggested the bill would represent a \nradical change in the law. Nothing is further from the truth. It even \ntracks this Justice Department's own guidelines. All we are saying is \nthat given recent events and Government actions, a judge should be the \nfinal arbiter when it comes to subpoenas to journalists for sensitive \ninformation. It is not an absolute law. It doesn't say ``never.'' It \ndoesn't say ``always.'' Some on the press side wanted ``always.'' Some \non the administration side wanted ``never.'' It is a careful, balancing \ntest. Moreover, a majority of Federal circuits now recognize some \nprivileges for journalists in, of course, 49 States, plus the District \nof Columbia recognizes those protections.\n\n  However, because of some of the recent comments about the bill, \nSenator Specter and I have undertaken to address a series of other \nconcerns, and should we move to proceed, the substitute measure will be \non the floor. I outlined last night on the floor the changes that I \nthink meet the concerns of the critics in two places in particular: \none, making sure classified information does not get out and is \nprotected, and, two, the definition of who is a journalist so we make \nsure that those who just casually criticize or whatever do not get the \nprotection, as would professional journalists.\n  So the text of the substitute is here, and I hope my colleagues--I \nhope we will move to this. I know we have disputes on other issues, but \nthis is the Senate working: broad, bipartisan, carefully thought out \nlegislation that can move forward with an overwhelming vote. I hope we \nwill move forward today.\n  On the other bill coming before us, the extenders bill, just one \npoint before I yield the floor.\n  If you care about reducing gasoline prices, the bill on the floor \ntoday, with tax incentives for alternative energy,\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nwill do far more than any amount of drilling to free our dependence on \nforeign oil and to reduce prices. I hope my colleagues will support \nthat bill as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom New York on the so-called media shield bill. Let me address those \nbriefly before I talk for a moment about the extenders, and then what I \nwish to spend most of my time on is the subject we have been talking \nabout but, frankly, not doing enough about during the last 2 weeks; \nthat is, bringing down the price of gasoline at the pump for the \nAmerican people.\n  The problem that I continue to have, as the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer knows as a member of the Judiciary Committee, we discussed in \nthe Judiciary Committee whether it is appropriate for the Congress to \ndesignate members of the media who would be the beneficiaries of a \nmedia shield while saying that there are other people who are engaged \nin the free flow of public information, such as bloggers, who would \nnot.\n  I remember when William Safire, the distinguished journalist, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee and someone asked him about \nbloggers. He said he considers them the new pamphleteers, modern-day \npamphleteers. In other words, they could be writing things just as \nimportantly as Thomas Payne might have written at the time of the \ncountry's founding, and yet the legislation the Senator from New York \ntalked about would do nothing to provide them the benefits of a media \nshield, and there would be--in effect, Congress would be deciding who \nis a legitimate journalist and who is not. I, for one, am not \ncomfortable with the Federal Government in essence licensing \njournalists and ignoring the new media, which is the source of a lot of \ninformation, and treating them in a discriminatory manner.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  With regard to the extenders package, there are many, if not most, of \nus here in this Senate who would love to see the extenders package, or \nsome form of it, passed. Renewable sources of energy such as solar and \nwind are very important in my State. We are No. 1 in the production of \nwind energy in Texas. Of course, T. Boone Pickens, one of my \nconstituents, has been up here talking rather visibly about his \nadvocacy of generating more electricity from wind and using natural gas \nto power vehicles and thus reducing our dependency on imported oil from \nthe Middle East.\n  However, the fact is that I believe we will probably vote against \nmoving off of the energy issue generally because, frankly, we shouldn't \nbe changing the subject at a time when we are very close to being able \nto have a vote on producing more American energy and relying less on \nimported energy and oil from the Middle East and abroad. Why it is that \nour colleagues in the majority are trying so hard--putting up cloture \nvote after cloture vote--to try to change the subject rather than \nallowing us to stay focused on and actually do something on bringing \ndown the price of gasoline is, frankly, beyond me.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, would my colleague from Texas be willing to \nanswer a couple of questions I would like to pose to him?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first question I have for my colleague is \nthis: The Senator from Texas and I both serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee, which considered this so-called media shield legislation \nsome months back.\n\n  Does my colleague recall that when the bill was brought to the \ncommittee, it was brought with the suggestion that it was pretty \nperfect as written and that we shouldn't change a comma of it or we \nwould be roundly criticized by editorial boards around the country? In \npoint of fact, I was.\n  Does my colleague recall--and maybe you can refresh my recollection. \nMy recollection is that we adopted 10 or 12 pretty serious amendments \nto that legislation in an effort to try to improve it and that most of \nthe amendments that were adopted were overwhelmingly in their support. \nIs my recollection correct on that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Arizona is \ncorrect. There was a lot of activity at the Judiciary Committee level \nto try to improve this bill on a bipartisan basis. I believe his \nrecollection is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the second question: When we passed that bill \nout of the committee, there were explicit assurances that we would \ncontinue to work on it because of the recognition that it was not, in \nmy words, ready for prime time, but it was clearly in need of \nadditional work. It is complicated. We would continue to work on it, A; \nand B, is it also correct that the Senator from Texas, as well as \nothers, including my staff and myself, have been engaged in a lot of \ndiscussions since then, including, as the Senator from Texas noted, \ntrying to figure out how to define who is a journalist and who would be \nprotected?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct again. This has \nbeen a challenging issue because, frankly, the very nature of \ncommunications has changed dramatically. I mentioned the bloggers, \nwhich are sort of a new innovation. There is nothing in this bill that \nwould prevent someone--let's say a jihadist or someone let's say from \nal-Jazeera or those who pretend to promote some of the activities that \nare directed against our own citizens or against our allies--from \nposing as a journalist and thus gaining the protection against \ntestifying or cooperating with a grand jury that any average citizen in \nthe country would have to do. So there remain problems we have not been \nable to work through.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could just pose two other quick \nquestions.\n  So would my colleague from Texas agree that at such point in time as \nthis legislation is brought to the Senate floor, we are going to need \nto continue to make improvements on it that will, first, necessitate \ndebate and amendments? Also, would my colleague agree that it would be \na huge mistake to try to bring this bill to the floor under a scenario \nin which we are pushed up against the recess, we are trying to do an \nenergy bill, we are trying to do a tax extender bill, and that it would \ntake far too much time in terms of amendments; that presumably, if \ncloture were invoked and this bill were to be brought up, the \nparliamentary procedure would be such that we wouldn't be able to offer \nany amendments, and that would be a mistake in the way this bill would \nbe considered? Would my colleague agree with that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona. My \nunderstanding is that because of the delays, because the majority \nleader has basically refused to allow us to go to the energy package we \nproposed which we believe will actually bring down the price of \ngasoline at the pump, we find ourselves up against an adjournment on \nFriday, which I believe the majority leader has addressed, with two \nvery important issues we need to address: lowering gas prices at the \npump and then the tax extenders bill. The tax extenders would provide \ntax credits and support for things such as renewable energy and the \nlike, which I support and which I hope we will pass as well. So I don't \nknow how we can do justice to the media shield bill and give it the \nkind of debate and the amendment process it deserves in this compressed \ntimetable.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, just one final quick question. Is my \ncolleague from Texas also aware of an editorial in the USA Today \nmagazine on Monday, July 28, by the DNI--the Director of National \nIntelligence, Mike McConnell--who joined with the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and, as he put it, every senior intelligence \ncommunity leader in expressing his strong belief that this bill will \ngreatly damage our ability to protect national security information?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I did read that op-ed piece with great \ninterest myself when it was published in USA Today, and I hope we can \nmake that part of the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if my colleague will indulge me for another \n10 seconds, I hope that on the basis of this information, our \ncolleagues would agree that whatever the view on the energy \nlegislation, we should not be turning to the media shield legislation,\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nand, in point of fact, if we are going to do something about gas \nprices, we need to keep our eye on that ball and get that work done \nbefore we leave here on Friday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the op-ed piece I \nreferred to printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 28, 2008]\n\n Bill Wrongly Shields Press; Those Who Leak Classified Data Should Be \n                                Punished\n\n                          (By Mike McConnell)\n\n       The Senate is considering a proposal that would bestow a \n     ``privilege'' on reporters, shielding them from revealing \n     confidential sources of important national security \n     information, even when their sources have broken the law by \n     disclosing classified information. The intelligence community \n     recognizes the critical role that the news media plays in our \n     democratic society. However, this bill would upset the \n     balance established by current law, crippling the \n     government's ability to investigate and prosecute those who \n     harm national security.\n       I have joined the attorney general, the secretaries of \n     Defense, Energy, Homeland Security and Treasury, and every \n     senior intelligence community leader in expressing the \n     belief, based on decades of experience, that this bill will \n     gravely damage our ability to protect national security \n     information. Unauthorized disclosure of classified \n     information disrupts our efforts to track terrorists, \n     jeopardizes the lives of intelligence and military personnel \n     and inhibits international cooperation critical to detecting \n     and preventing threats. Those who illegally disclose \n     information recklessly risk our national security and breach \n     a sacred public trust.\n       It is a delicate balance to protect national security \n     information from improper disclosure, while respecting the \n     rights of the press to publish information it deems of public \n     interest. This legislation upsets that balance by shielding \n     those who illegally leak national security information and \n     increasing the likelihood of destructive revelations in the \n     future. The bill forces the government to meet ill-defined \n     standards that require the disclosure of additional sensitive \n     information. It also cedes critical judgments about harm to \n     national security from national security professionals, \n     charged with protecting the country, to the subjective \n     determination of individual judges.\n       We do not see the problem that this bill is meant to \n     address. All evidence indicates that the free flow of \n     information has continued unabated in the absence of a \n     federal reporter's privilege. Indeed, prosecutions in this \n     area are exceedingly rare, and the longstanding policy of the \n     Department of Justice strictly limits circumstances in which \n     prosecutors may seek information from journalists. We must \n     retain the ability to bring to justice those who break the \n     law and cause irreparable harm to the United States and its \n     citizens.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much more time I have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 11 minutes 11 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I wish to clarify \nthe remaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The final 20 minutes of the debate \nhas been reserved for the two leaders. The time preceding that, the \nminority now has 10 minutes 50 seconds. Of the majority time, 10 \nminutes is reserved for the Senator from Vermont. The remaining 4 \nminutes 44 seconds is available.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that during the remaining time, \nthe Senator from Montana be allocated the remainder of that 5 minutes \non the majority side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Texas, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is a lot about the tax extenders \npackage that I support. The State and local sales tax deduction--Texas \ndoesn't have an income tax, thank goodness. I don't believe we ever \nwill. We do have a sales tax, and we would hope to be treated in a \nnondiscriminatory way by the Federal Government in providing a \ndeduction for sales tax. We have had the ability to do that, which has \nexpired, but it saves over $1 billion for Texans in tax relief each \nyear. Of course, I support the research and development tax incentives, \nthe temporary AMT, or alternative minimum tax, relief, as well as the \nother renewable energy tax incentives, including those for solar and \nwind.\n  However, I do not understand the insistence of the majority leader of \nfiling repetitive motions to proceed to something other than an energy \nbill that would actually generate more American production of oil and \ngas here at home and cause us to rely less on imported sources. Why \nthere is this repeated insistence time and time again with these \nrepetitive votes to take us off of the only bill that has been \noffered--the only legislation that has been offered that would actually \nincrease American energy resources and require us to rely less on \nimported oil is beyond me.\n  As I said, I support the renewable energy provisions that would \ncontinue to encourage the production of solar and wind power. I believe \nthat conservation is a very important part of what we need to do as \nwell.\n  My colleagues have seen this chart before. We have said that what we \nneed to do is find more and use less. Yet the majority leader has \nconsistently, so far, refused to allow us the opportunity to introduce \namendments and to have debate and votes on something that would \nactually have an impact on the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  We think we need a balanced and comprehensive approach to deal with \nthis problem. Since the majority leader became the majority leader--on \nJanuary 4, 2007, the price of gas was $2.33 a gallon. It has been as \nhigh as $4.11 a gallon. Now, thank goodness, the average price is $3.93 \na gallon.\n  The fact is, we have a supply problem and we have a demand problem. \nThe supply problem is that for some reason, for the last 30 years or \nso, Congress has placed 85 percent of our domestic oil and gas reserves \nout of bounds. We passed annual bans in the form of a moratorium on \nappropriations riders that prevent the production of oil and gas that \nwe know is there in the Outer Continental Shelf or the submerged lands \nalong the coastlines of the United States, as well as up in Alaska \nwhere we know there are huge volumes of gas and oil. And there is a \npipeline conveniently close by that could actually deliver that for use \nin the lower 48 States.\n\n  We know there are as much as 2 million additional barrels of oil a \nday out in Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado in the form of oil shale, which \nnow the technology exists to be able to produce that. Can you imagine \nhow much different things would be if, instead of importing those 3 \nmillion barrels of oil a day from countries such as Saudi Arabia and \norganizations like OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, and people such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela--can you imagine \nwhat it would be like if we actually produced 3 million more barrels of \noil in the United States so we didn't have to import that from abroad?\n  I don't know anybody who has done a better job of capturing the \npublic's imagination on that than my constituent, T. Boone Pickens. He \nhas been an oilman all his life, but now he is perhaps the most visible \nand forceful advocate for wind energy and for natural gas to use to \npower cars. His main focus is because he wants to reduce the $700 \nbillion of American money we send each year abroad to pay for oil and \nimport that into this country. He has a plan that he thinks can bring \nthat down by about 38 percent.\n  We all know that, at best, additional supply is a partial answer. \nThat is why we say we need to find more and use less. Conservation is \nan important part of this, as are things such as biofuels. We know we \nhave challenges dealing with corn ethanol because, frankly, using food \nfor fuel has backfired on us somewhat, causing food prices to go up, \nand feed for livestock, which has caused grave hardship in my State, \nwhich is a huge cattle producer, as well as a poultry producer. It has \ncaused the price of food to go up, so we need to continue to research \nthe use of cellulosic ethanol, which doesn't compete with the food \nsupply for our energy sources.\n  So far, we have been met with a brick wall from the majority leader \nwhen it comes to our attempt to try to find more American oil, as we \ntransition to a clean energy future. What I mean by that is one where \nwe are going to be less and less reliant on oil for our transportation \nneeds, our aviation needs.\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n  Let me mention a couple of examples on the horizon that are very \nexciting. In 2010, most of the major car manufacturers are going to be \nproducing plug-in hybrid cars, which actually will be running on \nbatteries. You can plug it into the wall socket at night and charge the \nbattery, and it will go 40 or more miles a day before plugging it back \nin at night. Obviously, that will displace the internal combustion \nengine and avoid the need to provide oil and gasoline for \ntransportation needs. It is going to take some time to transition as we \nresearch things such as hydrogen fuel cells and other alternatives for \nour basic transportation needs.\n  I think that holds great promise in the future, as does additional \nresearch in things such as coal-to-liquids technology. We have in this \ncountry about a 300-year supply of coal. We know that coal has a \nproblem because of pollution. But we have the ingenuity and expertise \nto be able to use coal--to find a way to use it in a way that will not \nonly provide things such as aviation fuel and transportation fuel, but \nI believe we can come up with a way to sequester the carbon dioxide \nbyproduct of coal-to-liquids technology in a way that will allow us to \ndisplace oil, gas, diesel, and regular aviation fuel from our demand \nside.\n  As a matter of fact, the coal-to-liquids technology has existed a \nlong time. Adolf Hitler, back in World War II, when he was worried \nabout getting cut off his supply of oil and gas that was necessary to \nfuel the Third Reich, developed a coal-to-liquids technology. Today, \nthe Air Force is using coal to liquids to power B-1 bombers and B-52 \nbombers for aviation fuel. So we know we can rely on good, old-\nfashioned American research and technology and ingenuity to come up \nwith a way to deal with this problem.\n  We are not going to get it done until the majority leader allows us \nthe opportunity to debate and vote on this important imperative to \ndevelop more American energy here at home. It is not enough to rely on \nsolar and wind. Those are important, but it is not a complete answer. \nWe need--I believe we should insist, and we are--a right to vote on \nsome production in the Outer Continental Shelf, in the oil shale out \nWest, and up in the Arctic.\n  Frankly, I don't understand the reluctance on the part of the \nmajority leader to allow that vote to go forward. I am encouraged by \nsome indications that there are some negotiations. I hope they are \nsuccessful. I don't think we should leave here this week for a month-\nlong recess until we have dealt with the single most important problem \nfacing the American people today and our economy, which is high \ngasoline and high diesel prices. We can have an immediate impact on the \nfutures markets where those contracts for the future delivery of oil \nand gas are sold if we will act and say that Congress will be part of \nthe solution and not continue to be part of the problem.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I remind my good friend from Texas that \nthere are a lot of things he favors and I think we all favor. He \nmentioned plug-in hybrid automobiles and clean coal technologies, and \nthey are in this bill. Frankly, I believe most Senators want to pass \nthis bill. I urge Senators on both sides to vote for it. We can, \nfrankly, pass it and send it back over to the House and be done with \nit. The American people want us to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the great writer William Faulkner said of the artist:\n\n       Only what he creates is important, since there is nothing \n     new to be said.\n\n  Writers could say much the same about us. What is important is not \nwhat we say, but what we create. What is important here is not the \nspeeches, but the laws that we pass.\n  Today, we have a chance to do something important. Today, we can \nchoose to legislate.\n  We can proceed to a bill that addresses what's important. It is a \nbill about jobs. It is a bill about energy. It is a bill about \nfamilies.\n  I am speaking of S. 3335, the Jobs, Energy, Families, and Disaster \nRelief Act of 2008--what some call the tax extenders bill. Today, we \ncan choose to do something important. We can move to this bill.\n  This bill would do something to create jobs.\n  This bill would extend the research and development credit. This \ncredit encourages businesses to invest in research. It helps to keep \nAmerica competitive in the global economy.\n  America accounts for one-third of the world's spending on scientific \nresearch and development, ranking first among all countries. Relative \nto the size of our economy, however, America stands in sixth place.\n  Our R tax credit expired on December 31 of last year. American \ncorporations are at a competitive disadvantage. They are unsure if they \nwill be able to obtain the benefit of the credit this year. They need \nto plan for the future.\n  About 70 percent of R spending goes to salaries. That helps to \ncreate jobs. These are jobs that help America stay in the forefront of \nseveral global industries.\n  We can do something today to create high-paying R jobs, with this \nbill.\n  This bill would also create jobs in infrastructure, by repairing a \nshortfall in the highway trust fund. The highway trust fund relies on \nfuel taxes for 90 percent of its revenues. And as fuel prices have \nrisen to record highs, Americans are driving less and buying fewer \ngallons of gas.\n  As a result, fuel tax receipts are down sharply. The Department of \nTransportation reported that Americans drove 9\\1/2\\ billion fewer miles \nin May than they did a year before. And OMB projects a highway trust \nfund deficit for 2009 of more than $3 billion.\n  We have a problem with highway trust fund finances. And that \nfinancing problem is a jobs problem.\n  Failing to fix the highway trust fund's shortfall will cause Federal \ntransportation funding cuts of more than a third. Industry experts have \ncalculated that funding cuts of this magnitude would result in the loss \nof about 380,000 jobs.\n  We can do something today to create well-paid infrastructure jobs, \nwith this bill.\n  This bill would do something about energy.\n  This bill would take real action to break America's dependence on \noil. Gasoline is more than $4 a gallon across the country. Americans \nwant Congress to steer away from foreign oil. They want us to turn \ntoward alternative and renewable energies.\n  This bill has the right energy incentives to help America to turn the \ncorner. It would support renewable electricity from wind, water, \nbiomass, and other sources. It would boost biodiesel and solar energy. \nIt would reward energy-efficiency, and push for cleaner coal plants.\n  It would even provide a brand new tax credit for plug-in electric \ncars, so that Americans could choose vehicles that use less fossil fuel \nor none at all.\n  Mr. President, do you know what. If every time a car went up to the \ngas pump and filled up and the vehicle also had electric power, with a \nbattery in the car, and it would go 50 miles on that electric power, \nguess what. Crude oil imports in this country would fall by 50 \npercent--It would be cut in half if every time a car would drive up to \nthe pump and, when it fills up, 50 miles that that car drives is on \nelectric energy--a battery. It would cut oil imports by 50 percent--\nsomething as simple as that.\n  I ask that I be notified 30 seconds before my time expires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. With gas at $4 a gallon, why would we wait another minute \nto get these energy technologies moving?\n  We can do something today to create alternative sources of energy, \nwith this bill.\n  This bill would do something for American families.\n  This bill would keep the alternative minimum tax from ensnaring new \ntaxpayers. Without this legislation, 21 million additional taxpayers \nwould have to pay the AMT.\n  We can do something today to protect families from the AMT, with this \nbill.\n  This bill would help teachers who have taken it upon themselves to \nspend\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\nmoney from their own pockets on classroom supplies. The average \nteacher's salary is about $38,000 a year. But in 2005 alone, 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion families took the teacher expense deduction.\n  We can do something today to help teachers' families, with this bill.\n  This bill would help families with tuition expenses. The average \ntuition and fees at a 4-year private college in New England is now more \nthan $30,000 a year. Four and a half million families took the \nqualified tuition deduction in 2005. But the provision expired at the \nend of 2007.\n  We can do something today to help families paying for college, with \nthis bill.\n  This bill would help families with the State and local sales tax \ndeduction. This deduction gives a tax benefit to taxpayers who live in \nStates without an income tax, including Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming. In 2005, this deduction \nbenefitted more than 11 million families.\n  This bill would expand the child tax credit. Current law bars about 6 \nmillion working families from receiving any relief under the child tax \ncredit. Families with 10 million children receive a partial credit. \nWith this bill, the families of nearly 3 million more children would be \neligible for this tax relief.\n  We can do something today to help working families with kids, with \nthis bill.\n  This bill would also help improve health care for countless families \ndealing with mental illness. It includes the mental-health-parity \nlegislation advanced by Senators Ted Kennedy, Pete Domenici, and the \nlate Paul Wellstone.\n  This bill would require private insurance plans that offer mental \nhealth benefits as part of their coverage to offer the same level of \nbenefits as they offer for medical-surgical benefits.\n  Mental illness is a disease like any other. We should treat it that \nway. We can do something about it, today.\n  This bill would provide much-needed relief to families who have \nsuffered from natural disasters. This bill contains a package of \ndisaster relief provisions developed to address all Federally-declared \ndisaster areas with immediate, reliable, and robust tax relief.\n  We can do something today to help families struck by disasters, with \nthis bill.\n  I say to my Colleagues: If you want to do something about creating \njobs before you go back home, then vote for this bill.\n  If you want to do something about energy before you go back home, \nthen vote for this bill.\n  If you want to do something to provide tax relief for American \nfamilies before you go back home, then vote for this bill.\n  What's important is not what we say. What is important is the laws \nthat we pass.\n  Let us pass a law that creates jobs. Let us pass a law that fosters \nnew forms of energy. Let us pass a law that helps the American family.\n  Today, let us do something important. Today, let us choose to \nlegislate. And today, let us move to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of supporters of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following organizations and companies have expressed \n     their support for passage of Baucus-authored tax extenders \n     legislation for jobs, energy, and families.\n       Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Air Products and Chemicals, \n     Inc.; Alliance for Children & Families WI; American \n     Association of Homes & Services for the Aging DC; American \n     Association of Museums DC; American Bible Society MO; \n     American Farm Bureau Federation; American Foundation for the \n     Blind NY; American Friends Service Committee PA; American \n     Heart Association TX; American Kidney Foundation MD; \n     Americans for the Arts DC; America's Second Harvest IL; \n     American Trucking Associations; Appalachian College; Applied \n     Materials, Inc.; Association for the Blind and Visually \n     Impaired NY; and Avance, Inc TX.\n       BAE Systems, Inc.; BASF Corporation; Benchmark Asset \n     Managers, LLC; Benedictine Mission House NE; Big Brothers and \n     Big Sisters of America HI; Big Brothers and Big Sisters of \n     America PA; Blue Summit Financial Group; Boston Common Asset \n     Management, LLC; Boy Scouts of America VA; California Public \n     Employees' Retirement System; California State Teachers' \n     Retirement System; California State Controller; California \n     State Treasurer; Camp Fire USA Wathana Council MI; Capricorn \n     Investment Group; Caterpillar Inc; Carbon County Museum \n     Foundation WY; Carroll College MT; Rosalynn Carter; Catholic \n     Youth Organization MI; Cedarhurst Center CA; and Center for \n     Effective Philanthropy MA.\n       Central Louisiana Community Foundation LA; Christopher \n     Reynolds Foundation; Cisco Systems, Inc.; Cleveland \n     Foundation OH; Colorado Nonprofit Association CO; Community \n     Foundation of St Joseph County IN; Compass Point Nonprofit \n     Services CA; Compton Foundation; Corning-Elmira Musical Arts, \n     Inc NY; Council for Advancement and Support of Education DC; \n     Cumberland Trails United Way KY; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation \n     MD; Deere & Company; Discovery Communications, LLC; DuPont \n     Company; Easter Seals of Arkansas AR; EMC Corporation; F \n     Management Ltd.; Falk Foundation PA; Family Means MN; Family \n     Service Inc.

Mr. President, the Free Flow of Information Act is a \nbipartisan bill that goes a long way towards protecting the freedom of \nthe press and the public's right to information without compromising \nnational security or the work of law enforcement. It strikes the right \nbalance between these competing priorities, and it deserves this body's \nsupport. I want to commend Senator Specter and Senator Schumer, the \nauthors of this legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor.\n  During the last 30 years, many of our most important news stories \nwere revealed to us by reporters who obtained their information from \nconfidential sources. Often, these stories exposed government and \ncorporate waste, fraud and abuse. Let me give you a few examples of \nwhat these confidential sources enabled journalists to report to the \npublic: the President's warrantless surveillance program; the unsafe \nand deteriorating conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; the \ntreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib; the Enron accounting fraud \nscandal; the rampant abuse of steroids in major league baseball; and \nthe government's misleading statements to the American people about the \nVietnam war, as documented in the Pentagon Papers.\n  These and other major stories led to important reforms in the \ngovernment and in industry. If confidential sources had not trusted \nreporters and come forward with this information, these stories would \nnot have come to light when they did. We are a better and stronger \ncountry because of these stories.\n  Unfortunately, the relationship of trust between reporters and \nconfidential sources has come under attack since September 11.\n  Increasingly, Federal prosecutors, special prosecutors and civil \nlitigants are issuing subpoenas to reporters for their confidential \nsources.\n  In the last 4 years alone, journalists have received at least 35 \nFederal subpoenas for confidential information. During this period, \nFederal courts have held 13 journalists in contempt for refusing to \ndisclose their confidential sources.\n  Since 2000, four journalists--Judith Miller, Jim Taricani, Josh Wolf \nand Vanessa Leggett--have been imprisoned for 19 months in total for \nrefusing to disclose their confidential sources.\n  Earlier this year, a Federal judge ordered a reporter to disclose a \nconfidential source and threatened her with fines of $5,000 per day if \nshe did not.\n  This has created a chilling effect on the flow of information between \nconfidential sources and reporters.\n  The media shield bill would address this problem by creating a \nFederal qualified privilege for communications between confidential \nsources and reporters.\n  It allows the government and private litigants to compel the \ndisclosure of confidential information only if they persuade a Federal \njudge that: they have exhausted the alternative sources of that \ninformation; the information is essential to their case; and \nnondisclosure would on balance be contrary to the public interest.\n  The bill makes it easier for the government to overcome the privilege \nin criminal cases.\n  It also creates sensible exceptions that ensure that this qualified \nprivilege does not compromise national security or the work of law \nenforcement agencies. In particular, the privilege does not apply to: \nconfidential information that relates to criminal conduct by a \njournalist; confidential information that is necessary to stop or \nprevent an act of terrorism, death or substantial bodily harm, a \nkidnapping, or an act that involves child pornography or the sexual \nexploitation of a child; or confidential information that would harm \nnational security.\n  The qualified privilege and the exceptions for national security and \nlaw enforcement concerns reflect the serious and careful effort by \nSenators Specter and Schumer to take into account the perspectives of \njournalists on the one hand and law enforcement on the other. The \nproduct is a bill that strikes the right balance.\n  I am pleased that the managers' amendment includes language that I \nauthored on who should be protected by the privilege. In the fast-\nchanging media world, the notion of who qualifies as a journalist is \nevolving quickly. Journalists are no longer just the reporters who work \nfor newspapers, magazines or television or radio stations. It is \nincreasingly common for Internet bloggers and citizen-journalists to \nreport breaking news stories that shape our Nation's most important \ndebates. However, not everyone with a laptop and an internet connection \nshould be protected by the important privilege created by this bill.\n  The privilege will now apply to reporters who are regularly engaged \nin investigative journalism. It will protect reporters who are in a \nposition to develop and rely on confidential sources for their stories, \nwhether they report in the television, radio, print or online world.\n  Specifically, it will cover journalists who regularly: report on \nlocal, national or international events of public importance; do the \nthings that constitute good investigative journalism, meaning \nconducting interviews, collecting information and making observations \non the scene of an event, or collecting original documents and \nstatements; and collect this information for the purpose of bringing it \nto the public's attention.\n  This definition, like the rest of the bill, protects the relationship \nbetween reporters and confidential sources, but ensures that Federal \nagencies are able to get the information they need to prevent harm to \nnational security and advance urgent law enforcement investigations. In \nshort, it strikes the right balance between journalistic integrity and \nthe public's right to seek justice.\n  Forty-nine States and the District of Columbia give journalists at \nleast a partial shield against compulsory disclosures. This bill fills \nthe gap at the federal level and gives investigative journalists a \nqualified shield in federal court. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Free Flow of \nInformation Act. This bill would protect journalists from being forced \nto reveal their confidential sources not as an end in itself but as a \nmeans to a well-informed public.\n  I applaud the tireless efforts of those who have made this possible, \nincluding our colleagues in the other body who have shown their strong \ncommitment to this issue. As far back as 2004, I introduced similar \nlegislation which was called the Free Speech Protection Act. Since that \ntime, I have worked closely with the senior Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nLugar, and earlier this Congress we introduced legislation that would \nhave provided more protection to journalists. Companion legislation \npassed the House 398 to 21.\n  I was also pleased to cosponsor Senators Specter and Schumer's \nlegislation, which passed the Judiciary Committee earlier this \nCongress. Over the last several months, we have worked to\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nbring this important issue to the attention of Congress and the Nation.\n  And while this bill does not include everything I had hoped for, I \nrecognize that in this body, we do not get to write or pass these bills \nby ourselves. We have to reach out and work together that is how we \nadvance or in this case protect our more cherished principles. I thank \nboth of my colleagues for their diligence and commitment to the first \namendment.\n  Indeed, though I recognize this fight will not likely be over today, \nin the 4 years we have been working together on this legislation, we \nare closer than ever to acting on this bill.\n  I hardly have to recite the litany of abuses that have been exposed \nbecause journalists called the powerful to account nor must I remind my \ncolleagues how many of those exposures relied on confidential sources.\n  Without confidential sources, would we still know about the abuse of \npower in the Watergate era?\n  Without confidential sources, would Enron still be profiting from \ndefrauding its investors?\n  How long would torture at Abu Ghraib have persisted, if proof of \nthese abhorrent crimes had not been provided to the press?\n  The most meaningful check on abuses such as these is the free flow of \ninformation. Thomas Jefferson said it best: If I had to make a choice, \nto choose the government without the press or to have the press but \nwithout the government, I will select the latter without hesitation. \nJefferson clearly understood that a free government cannot possibly \nlast in the absence of a free press.\n  But today, we find this cornerstone of self-governance facing a new \nthreat--one that comes not from the dictates of a dangerous government, \nbut for the best of intentions.\n  As we have heard time and again in recent years, in a spate of cases, \nprosecutors have used subpoenas, fines, and jail time to compel \njournalists to reveal their anonymous sources.\n  Judith Miller of the New York Times was famously jailed for 85 days \nfor refusing to reveal a source.\n  Two San Francisco Chronicle reporters were found in contempt of court \nfor refusing to identify sources and hand over material related to the \nBALCO steroids investigation.\n  A Rhode Island journalist was sentenced to home arrest on similar \ncharges.\n  In 2005, some two dozen reporters were subpoenaed or questioned about \nconfidential sources.\n  Their offense, Mr. President? Journalism.\n  As one prominent magazine editor told Congress because of what has \nhappened: ``Valuable sources have insisted that they no longer trusted \nthe magazine and that they would no longer cooperate on stories. The \nchilling effect is obvious.''\n  Experience has shown us that the most effective constraint on free \nspeech need not be blatant censorship. It only takes a few cases like \nMs. Miller's and the San Francisco Chronicle's before the news begins \ncensoring itself. We can only speculate as to how many editors and \npublishers put the brakes on a story out of fear that one of their \nreporters could be caught in a spider web of subpoenas, charges of \ncontempt, and prison.\n  When we minimize the impact of confidential sources, serious \njournalism is crippled. We will find our papers full of stories more \nand more palatable to the powerful and secretive. No one argues that \nthat is the intention of those prosecuting these cases I think \nprosecutors simply want to do their jobs. But few deny that it could, \nin time, be the effect.\n  When journalists are hauled into court and threatened with \nimprisonment if they don't divulge their sources, we enter dangerous \nterritory for a democracy. The information we need to remain sovereign \nwill be tarnished and the public's right to know will be threatened. \nAnd I would submit to you that the liberties we hold dear will be \nthreatened as well.\n  That is exactly why we need a Federal reporter shield. Forty-nine \nStates as well as the District of Columbia have already adopted shield \nlaws or other legal protections for reporters trying to safeguard their \nsources. The Free Flow of Information Act simply extends that widely \nrecognized protection to the federal courts.\n  This bill will allow journalists the opportunity to argue before a \ncourt that they should not have to reveal sources and this can include \nbloggers. This is an important step the Federal Government can take to \nensure that the free flow of information is protected.\n  That is why I have such a difficult time understanding our Director \nof National Intelligence's recent comments regarding this bill. In an \nopinion piece in USA Today earlier this week, Admiral McConnell writes:\n\n       The intelligence community recognizes the critical role \n     that the news media plays in our democratic society. However, \n     this bill would upset the balance established by current law, \n     crippling the government's ability to investigate and \n     prosecute those who harm national security.\n\n  I find that very hard to believe. Every time the Congress seeks to \nbalance the need for security with our rights as Americans, this \nadministration says ``we can't have both--it's one or the other. You \neither can be safe or give up rights.''\n  As I have said before--it is a false choice.\n  And it is a mischaracterization of what this bill does. The reporter \nshield is not absolute--nor should it be. The public's need to know \nmust and will be weighed against other goods, which is precisely why \nthe bill establishes a balancing test that will weigh the Government's \ninterest in disclosure and the public interest in gathering news and \nmaintaining the free flow of information.\n  In other words, we are balancing our right to know with our need for \nsecurity, whether physical or economic.\n  This bill makes clear that secrecy is as necessary in extreme \ncircumstances as it is dangerous on the whole.\n  Ultimately, it comes down to what makes us most secure in the long \nrun. As men and women on both sides of the aisle understand, a \nprosecution, whatever its individual merits, sacrifices something \nhigher when it turns on reporters--and so those merits must be balanced \nagainst the broader harms such a prosecution can work.\n  If a free press inexorably creates a free government, as Jefferson \nsuggested, then the agents of that free government--prosecutors \nincluded--owe a high debt to journalism. When prosecutors threaten \njournalism, they have begun to renege on that debt.\n  So, Mr. President, I am proud to support this valuable legislation--\nit is a critical first step toward rebalancing the pursuit of justice \nand the diffusion of truth. I thank my colleagues again for their \nleadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 10 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 \nminutes 10 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The American people rightly wonder why these popular \nexpiring tax relief provisions can't be passed by the Senate on their \nmerits alone. Why can't we get there and ``get 'er done''? Part of the \nproblem is that the committee and floor process have been disregarded \nby the Senate Democratic leadership. The debate and exchange of ideas, \nwhich is the essence of the Senate, has been bottled up. The Senate \nprocess is being truncated.\n  For the first time in this decade, since 2001, the Finance Committee \nmembers have not been allowed to exercise their right in committee \nmarkup with respect to these issues. With one exception--the 2002 \nstimulus bill--for the first time in this decade, Senate Members have \nnot had the opportunity to debate and amend the extenders in a real \nSenate floor process. For the first time in this decade, Senators in \nthe minority are being presented with a top-down deal, crafted in the \ndark corners of Democratic leaders' offices of the House and Senate.\n  The irony of all of this is compelling. Almost 2 years ago today, we \nfaced an attempt to end run the natural order of the committee and \nfloor process by the bicameral Republican leadership of the House and \nSenate. I referred to it at that time as a wrongheaded effort that was \ndoomed to fail--even when it came\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nfrom my own party. It envisioned a unicameral tax writing committee \nthat ignored the rights and privileges of Members of both parties. I \nused sharp words and directed them at my side's leadership in the House \nand Senate. I am sure some on my side thought I had gone a bit \noverboard in criticizing the Republican leadership at that time.\n  Then the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions chairman, Senator \nEnzi, stood with me. Some of my friends on the Democratic side spoke up \nabout the harm the leadership was doing to the rights of the Members of \nthe Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I have 1 more minute?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ironically, today we find the Democratic leadership \nattempting to do much the same thing. Like the failed trifecta jam to \nwhich I referred, today's jam will not work.\n  It is part of a larger problem with the Senate because we are not \ngoing through the regular order at the committee and the floor level. \nIssues are building up, tempers are flaring, and, most importantly, \nnothing is getting done. The Senate is constipated. This legislative \nbody needs a function, a laxative. Legislation needs to circulate \nthrough this body in the usual form like food through your body. We \nneed real debate, real amendments, and we need an informal bipartisan \nprocess that leads to an agreement that can pass the House and the \nSenate.\n  I have my pencil sharpened, my notepad out. I am ready to engage in \nour usual bipartisan process with my Democratic friend, Chairman \nBaucus. I am hopeful that the Democratic leadership will relieve the \nconstipation on the tax extenders legislation. The Finance Committee \nand the Senate need to function just like our intestinal system \nfunctions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, voting for cloture on this bill will \ntake us off the single most important issue in America. The American \npeople are clamoring for legislation that will bring down the price of \ngas at the pump. They expect their representatives in Washington to do \nsomething about this crisis and to do something about this crisis right \nnow.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership has already tried to take us \noff the subject, to take us away from this issue a full four times in \nthe last 5 days. About 8 in 10 Americans disagree with them. Eight out \nof ten Americans disagree with the decision to try to move us off \nlegislation dealing with the No. 1 issue in America. The American \npeople think $4-a-gallon gasoline is a crisis that ought to be dealt \nwith now; not in September, now. Dealing with this issue should not \nhave to wait until even next year, as some have suggested. The high \nprice of gas at the pump is the most important domestic issue in \nAmerica. I am not even sure at this point what is in second place, but \nwe all know what is in first place.\n  I will vote that we stay on the Energy bill, and we ought to stay on \nit until we get a solution for the American people. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against moving off the subject of lowering the price \nof gas at the pump. Let's finish the job. This is only July. We have \nplenty of time left this year to do other things that are confronting \nour country. But let's focus on the No. 1 issue confronting the \nAmerican people: the price of gas at the pump. The way to do that is to \nstay on the subject and vote to stay on the subject, vote to avoid \ngoing to some other issue. While it may be important, it is not as \nimportant as this one.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time is \nreserved for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes has been reserved.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I said on the Senate floor yesterday that I support \nthe Free Flow of Information Act, S. 2035. Senator Specter, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, was exactly \nright when he said in his remarks last night that ``this bill is long \npast due.'' After months and months of needless delay by the Senate \nminority, I hope we will finally be permitted to consider this \nimportant legislative effort this morning. This is legislation that \npassed overwhelmingly in the other body. If the Republicans would allow \nit, it would pass overwhelmingly in this body.\n  The Senate minority's delay tactics are nothing new. Since the \nbeginning of this Congress, we have witnessed all manner of \nobstructionism by a minority of Republican Senators using filibuster \nafter filibuster, the most ever in the history of this country for that \nperiod of time. They use these filibusters to thwart the will of the \nmajority of the Senate to conduct the business of the American people.\n  Republican filibusters prevented Senate majorities from passing the \nclimate change bill. Republicans blocked us from passing the Employee \nFree Choice Act. Republicans blocked the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. \nRepublicans blocked the DC Voting Rights Act. Republicans blocked the \nRenewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of \n2007. Republicans blocked the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of \n2008. Republicans blocked the Medicare Improvements for Patients and \nProviders Act of 2008. Republicans blocked the Consumer-First Energy \nAct. Most recently, Republicans blocked the Warm in Winter and Cool in \nSummer Act. That was designed to bring much needed relief to poor \nfamilies who struggle to heat and cool their homes in times of soaring \ngas prices, matters that have become literally life or death for some \nof these people.\n  Republican filibusters blocked the Advancing American's Priorities \nAct which includes 35 stalled legislative matters including--and these \nwere blocked by the Republicans--the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrime Act, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and Republicans blocked \nseveral bills to help law enforcement cope with mentally ill offenders \nand to protect our children from the scourge of drugs, child \npornography, and child exploitation. Republicans blocked all those \nbills. It would be a lot more if we also list all those bills President \nBush has vetoed since the beginning of this Congress.\n  Here are the measures blocked by the Republicans and the President: \nlegislation to fund stem cell research and fight deadly and \ndebilitating diseases. Republicans blocked to extend and expand the \nsuccessful State Children's Health Insurance Program. Republicans \nblocked a program that would have provided health insurance to more of \nthe millions of American children without it. They blocked setting a \ntimetable for bringing American troops home from Iraq. They blocked an \nattempt to ban waterboarding and help restore America as a beacon for \nthe rule of law.\n  The Free Flow of Information Act should not be added to the long list \nof legislative victims of Republican obstructionism. It is time for \nSenate Republicans to climb down from the barricades and work with us \nto improve the lives of the American people.\n  Time is running short in this Congress. It is past time to end the \npartisan gamesmanship and to make progress. That is what I have been \ntrying to do throughout this Congress. I hope, after 18 months of \nunnecessary obstruction, all Senators are finally ready to join us in \ngetting our work done. We have a historic window of opportunity to \nenact a Federal statutory shield law to protect Americans' right to \nknow.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid for his willingness to bring the matter \nbefore the Senate. I worked with him to find an opportunity for Senate \naction since the Judiciary Committee reported this bill last October, \nand I appreciate his support.\n  Senator Specter and I wrote to him and the Republican leader in March \nurging consideration of this bipartisan measure. Before that, I had \nwritten and spoken with the majority leader about this legislation.\n  Our bill has 20 Senate cosponsors. The claim made yesterday by a \nRepublican Senator that this bill is not ready for the Senate's \nconsideration is simply unfounded. The Judiciary Committee has been \nworking on a bipartisan basis for the past year to reach\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\nconsensus on Federal shield legislation. In addition, the Judiciary \nCommittee held three separate hearings on this bill during the 109th \nCongress. I hope that the Republican cosponsors of this bill will join \nus in moving to the bill and that they will bring along the seven or \neight Republicans needed to defeat another Republican filibuster and \nallow us to make progress.\n  A free and vibrant press is essential to a free society in our \ncountry or any country. That has been demonstrated over and over again \nduring the past 8 years. That is why I cosponsored the Senate version \nof this bill and worked hard for a meaningful reporters' shield law \nthis year. That is why I made sure that for the first time ever, for \nthe first time in history, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a \nmedia shield law to protect the public's right to know. I was glad to \nsee that this bill was favorably reported by a strong bipartisan 15-to-\n4 vote.\n  I thank the leaders in the Senate who worked hard on the Federal \nreporters' shield law--Senators Schumer, Specter, Dodd, and Lugar as \nwell as the dozens of media groups that support this measure.\n  All of us, whether Republican, Democratic, or Independent, have an \ninterest in enacting a balanced and meaningful shield bill to ensure \nthe free flow of information to the American people. Forty-nine States \nand the District of Columbia currently have codified or common law \nprocedures to protect confidential information sources. But even with \nthese State law protections, the press remains the first stop, rather \nthan the stop of last resort, for our government and private litigants \nwhen it comes to seeking information.\n  Our time to act is now. Our opportunity to act is now. The Washington \nTimes editorialized on July 25, ``[a] sound shield law guards not `the \nmedia' but something much more vital--the public's right to know.''\n  I urge that all Senators do the right thing and end this unnecessary \nand counterproductive filibuster.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington \nTimes editorial in support of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 25, 2008]\n\n                           The right To Know\n\n       The great swinging pendulum of press liberty and government \n     secrecy has lurched too far in one direction. It is time for \n     a correction. Congress should pass and President Bush should \n     sign a reasonable, measured shield law to push the pendulum \n     back in the direction of the First Amendment and the \n     legitimate powers of the Fourth Estate.\n       A sound shield law guards not ``the media'' but something \n     much more vital--the public's right to know. Guarding that \n     right often requires confidential sources deep inside \n     government. A measured law would not shield sources who \n     perpetrate demonstrable and articulable harm to the country's \n     national-security interests. But it would rightly shield most \n     others. Such a bill awaits Senate action now. It should be \n     passed.\n       We endorse the Free Flow of Information Act in full \n     knowledge of the genuine conflicts between national security \n     and press freedoms in the toughest cases. We are also among \n     the first to note it when media outlets abuse their \n     privileges. We regarded the New York Times revelation of \n     federal terrorist surveillance, for instance, as a wanton act \n     of damage to a vital and completely legal national security \n     program. But no realist and no proponent of limited \n     government can watch the epidemic of American journalists \n     subpoenaed, questioned, held in contempt or jailed--more than \n     40 in recent years--without wondering when the slow march of \n     the Fourth Estate into an investigative arm of government \n     reaches its ugly apotheosis. It is possible to have both \n     liberty and security--indeed, that is the American way. Part \n     of the answer lies in assuring sources who risk all to convey \n     information vital to the public interest that the newsman who \n     offers confidentiality will not be forced to divulge--unless \n     a high crime with real national-security import has been \n     committed.\n       The simple, constitutionalist reading of the First \n     Amendment--``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \n     freedom of speech, or of the press''--does not countenance \n     the stripping of the core functions of the free press. It \n     must end.\n       Yesterday, reporter Bill Gertz of The Washington Times \n     appeared before a federal judge in California expecting to \n     face questions he should not have to answer. U.S. District \n     Judge Cormac Carney, a Bush appointee, declined to force Mr. \n     Gertz to divulge his sources in a 2-year-old Chinese \n     espionage story. ``Today's ruling is an important victory for \n     our entire industry, the first in a long time to recognize a \n     reporter's rights to keep confidential sources,'' said \n     Executive Editor John Solomon. Press reports had indicated an \n     intent to probe Mr. Gertz on the notoriously amorphous \n     subject of newsworthiness. The subtext: What details of the \n     story did Mr. Gertz consider newsworthy, and when did he \n     consider them? On sources' identities: What promises of \n     confidentiality did he make, and why did he make them? This \n     would have been extremely chilling.\n       The truth is that not all classified information is created \n     equally. We live in an era of gross overclassification of \n     government data--much of which belongs rightfully to the \n     public but is kept secret for reasons of bureaucracy, \n     territoriality, undue risk aversion or sheer inertia. \n     Responsible media outlets can--and do--exercise discretion. \n     More than three-quarters of the nation's attorneys general \n     have called for the passage of a federal shield law. Attorney \n     General Michael Mukasey opposes it on national security \n     grounds. Mr. Bush has previously threatened a veto. It is \n     time to let this pendulum swing back.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have found, especially in this \nadministration, time and again that when crimes have been committed, \nwhen scandals have erupted, it is not because the Congress found them \nout, it is because the press found them out.\n  Abu Ghraib, one of the worst scandals in the history of this country, \nsomething that hurt us throughout the world--we didn't find out about \nit because questions were asked in this body or the other body; we \nfound out because the press found it out. We found out through the \npress and subsequently through our own investigations the scandals of \npoliticizing law enforcement by this administration through the \nprosecutors' offices.\n  If we do not have the ability for our press to seek out these things, \nthen we are all hurt. Any administration, Republican or Democratic, is \ngoing to be perfectly willing to give us all the press releases in the \nworld saying all the wonderful things they have done. What I have \nfound--and I have been through six administrations--is that they rarely \nwant to talk about when they make a mistake. That is what we need a \nfree press for.\n  My parents had a small newspaper in Waterbury, VT. I grew up in a \nfamily who revered the first amendment, revered it for the right to \nknow, for the public's right to know. What has set this Nation apart \nfrom virtually any other nation on Earth is that our press is free, our \npress is open, our press can ask questions, and our press can point out \nmistakes--whether it is mistakes of Members of Congress or mistakes of \nthe administration.\n  We need this shield law. Let's not use any more excuses for one more \nfilibuster. If you really believe in having the shield law, vote for \nit. If you are against it, vote against it. But don't hide behind some \nparliamentary maneuver of a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on this side of the aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes 47 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am using this time even though my \nposition differs from what I believe will be the Republican caucus \nposition, and I have asked for only 3 minutes. I will support cloture \non this issue because I am a prime sponsor of the bill. I do not like \ndisplacing the pending legislation on the oil speculators bill, but I \nbelieve if we are to move forward on that measure, we will do so in any \nevent regardless of what happens here.\n  I have supported the Republican caucus position in opposing advancing \nlegislation where we have been denied the opportunity to offer \namendments, but that is not an issue on a motion to proceed.\n  I believe this bill is of enormous importance, and if we do not act \non it now, it will not be acted on for the balance of the Congress, and \nwho knows what will happen next year.\n  I spoke at length on the merits of this subject yesterday, and the \nessence of my position is that reporters have been intimidated--a \nchilling effect--by the subpoenas which have been issued. The record \nshows a tremendous number of subpoenas have been issued, and\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\nthere have been incarcerations of reporters. I will put in the record \nthe details of one of those involved, Judith Miller of the New York \nTimes, who spent 85 days in jail and whom I personally visited.\n  There is no doubt about the extremely high value in our society of a \nfree press and an investigative press for the disclosure of corruption, \nmalfeasance, and wrongdoing at all levels in public life and in private \nlife. I think Jefferson expressed it best when he said if he had to \nchoose between government without newspapers or newspapers without \ngovernment, he would choose newspapers without government. So I believe \nthis is a very important matter to go forward.\n  I didn't want to use time on Senator McConnell's watch, if anybody \nobjected to it, but there is no other Republican on the floor, and I \nhave used only 3 minutes, leaving the remaining 4 minutes and some \nseconds to anybody else who chooses to speak.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand there are no further \nRepublican speakers, so I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, have the Republicans yielded back their \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, not long ago I had a meeting with \nrepresentatives from the San Francisco Chronicle. Among those at the \nmeeting was a sportswriter named Lance Williams. Lance Williams covered \nfootball games and baseball games and basketball games. Some of them \nwere high school level. He was not an investigative reporter. But one \nday this young reporter was contacted by a man who said: I can give you \none of the biggest stories this country has seen in a long time, but \nyou have to give me your word that you are not going to give them my \nname. I can give you a lot of places to go, I can even give you some \ngrand jury testimony, but you have to protect me because I could be in \ndanger, my physical well-being.\n  So Lance Williams talked to his people at the paper, his bosses, \nbecause that was his obligation, and overnight Lance Williams became an \ninvestigative reporter, not a sports reporter. In his investigation he \nfound that these leads took him down a very disturbing road, a road \nthat ended with evidence and a book that was published, ``The Game of \nShadows,'' which exposed the rampant use of steroids in sports that we \nnow know so much about, including such sports names as Barry Bonds.\n  After he released this information, he was subpoenaed by the \nGovernment to release the identity of his informant who had leaked to \nhim a lot of things, including, as I mentioned, grand jury testimony. \nWell, this was an interesting day for him because Lance had never been \nin a predicament like this before. Again, as I said, he had covered \nball games. Nothing like this before. He suddenly was faced with the \nknowledge that he may have to go to jail for stories he had written and \ninformation he had released. But he decided not to release the name. He \nthought it was the right thing to do. He had given his word. He said he \nwould sooner go to prison than release the name of that confidential \ninformant.\n  On the same day I met him, I met with his lawyer, the lawyer for the \nSan Francisco Chronicle. The lawyer told me that although the Lance \nWilliams controversy had been the most famous in recent cases she had \ndealt with, in the last 3 years that newspaper had been served with 207 \nsubpoenas by Federal, State, and local prosecutors requiring \nconfidential information about sources. That uncertainty--207 subpoenas \nto the Hearst Communications Company--puts the media in a very \ndifficult position and places a burden on them and reduces the \nlikelihood that whistleblowers will come forward with information.\n  Forty-nine States and the District of Columbia already have laws to \nprotect the relationship between journalists and their sources, so it \nis long past the age when the Federal Government should follow suit.\n  The first amendment we have in our constitution, the right to a free \npress, a press able to pursue charges of wrongdoing in our government \nand society and basically to write whatever they want to write, is a \ncritical pillar of our democracy. The first amendment separates us from \nother nations and governments. The State attorneys general of 41 States \ncalled upon Congress to pass a national media shield law, and today we \nhave the opportunity to proceed to act in that regard by voting to \nproceed to the Free Flow of Information Act.\n  Mr. President, the National Association of Attorneys General sent a \nletter, which says, among other things, in the last paragraph:\n\n       By exposing confidences protected under State law to \n     discovery in Federal courts, the lack of a corresponding \n     Federal reporter's privilege law frustrates the purposes of \n     the State recognized privileges and undercuts the benefit to \n     the public that the States have sought to bestow through \n     their shield laws. As the States' chief legal officers, \n     attorneys general have had significant experience with the \n     operation of these State law privileges; that experience \n     demonstrates that recognition of such a privilege does not \n     unduly impair the task of law enforcement or unnecessarily \n     interfere with the truth-seeking function of the courts. The \n     sponsors of S. 2035 have sensibly sought to strike a \n     reasonable balance between these important interests, as the \n     States have done, and we are confident that the legitimate \n     concerns for national security and law enforcement can be \n     addressed in the court procedures for evaluating a claim of \n     privilege. We urge you to support the Flee Flow of \n     Information Act.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full content of the letter from which I have just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We, the undersigned \n     Attorneys General, write to express our support for the Free \n     Flow of Information Act (S. 2035). The proposed legislation \n     would recognize a qualified reporter's privilege, bringing \n     federal law in line with the laws of 49 states and the \n     District of Columbia, which already recognize such a \n     privilege. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported S. 2035 \n     favorably on October 4, 2007, by a vote of 15-4. The House \n     passed a similar reporter's privilege bill, H.R. 2102, by a \n     vote of 398-21.\n       Justice Brandeis famously referred to the important \n     function the states perform in our federal system as \n     laboratories for democracy, testing policy innovations. See \n     New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) \n     (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Reporter shield laws, which have \n     been adopted--through either legislation or judicial \n     decision--by every state but one, must now be viewed as a \n     policy experiment that has been thoroughly validated through \n     successful implementation at the state level.\n       The reporter's privilege that is recognized by the laws of \n     50 United States jurisdictions rests on a determination that \n     an informed citizenry and the preservation of news \n     information sources are vitally important to a free society. \n     By affording some degree of protection against the compelled \n     disclosure of a reporter's confidential sources, these state \n     laws advance a public policy favoring the free flow of \n     information to the public. An overwhelming consensus has \n     developed among the states in support of this public policy, \n     and United States Justice Department guidelines, on which the \n     current legislation is largely modeled, likewise recognize \n     the interest in protecting the news media from civil or \n     criminal compulsory process that might impair the news \n     gathering function. Nevertheless, the federal courts are \n     divided on the existence and scope of a reporter's privilege, \n     producing inconsistency and uncertainty for reporters and the \n     confidential sources upon whom they rely.\n       By exposing confidences protected under state law to \n     discovery in federal courts, the lack of a corresponding \n     federal reporter's privilege law frustrates the purposes of \n     the state-recognized privileges and undercuts the benefit to \n     the public that the states have sought to bestow through \n     their shield laws. As the states' chief legal officers, \n     Attorneys General have had significant experience with the \n     operation of these state-law privileges; that experience \n     demonstrates that recognition of such a privilege does not \n     unduly impair the task of law enforcement or unnecessarily \n     interfere with the truth-seeking function of the courts. The \n     sponsors of S. 2035 have sensibly sought to strike a \n     reasonable balance between these important interests, as the \n     states have done, and we are confident that the legitimate \n     concerns for national security and law enforcement can be \n     addressed in the court procedures for evaluating a claim of \n     privilege.\n       We urge you to support the Free Flow of Information Act and \n     to enact legislation\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\n     harmonizing federal law with state law on this important \n     subject.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Douglas Gansler, Attorney General of Maryland; Rob \n           McKenna, Attorney General of Washington; Terry Goddard, \n           Attorney General of Arizona; Dustin McDaniel, Attorney \n           General of Arkansas; Edmund G.

Mr. President, for all of those who are, as I am, concerned \nwith providing law enforcement with the tools they need to keep us \nsafe, it is important to note that this legislation strikes the \nappropriate balance between the public's right to know and law \nenforcement's need for information. It is based largely upon existing \ninternal Department of Justice guidelines and provides for a qualified \nprivilege for journalists who are subpoenaed to testify about their \nconfidential sources, unless the government can show there is no \nreasonable alternative source of the information and the information is \ncritical to the case.\n  This legislation includes exceptions for harm to national security, \nacts of terrorism, death, kidnapping, or other bodily harm. This is a \nbalanced piece of legislation, and it carefully considers the needs of \nthe media and law enforcement. It is bipartisan and provides what both \nsides want most of all: clear guidelines and certainty.\n  In doing so, it offers us the opportunity to strengthen our public \nsafety and national security while firmly defending the right to a free \nand open press.\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard Republicans expend a tremendous amount \nof words and energy talking about energy. Today, Democrats offer them \nyet another chance to stop the talking and actually do something to \nsolve the problem. We have already offered Senate Republicans three \nopportunities to pass the so-called tax extenders. Today, they have a \nfourth opportunity.\n  This tax extender legislation provides tax incentives to private \nsector innovators who are discovering new ways to harness the power of \nthe wind, the Sun, geothermal, and other sources of clean renewable \nenergy all over America--from the State of Nebraska, the State of \nNevada, and other places around the country.\n  I see the Senator from the State of Texas, where T. Boone Pickens is \na resident. He is moving forward big time on alternative energy. But \nthe people who are doing the big projects in Nebraska and in Nevada \nneed tax credits. It is important. It is part of the process.\n  Mr. President, this is something we need to do. This tax extender \nlegislation provides tax incentives that are so very important. If they \nsucceed, these innovators--and with our help they will--immediately we \nwill find the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs--not tens of \nthousands but hundreds of thousands of jobs, real jobs, high-paying \njobs, construction jobs. It will be good for the economy and it will be \ngood for the environment. These are American jobs. These are jobs you \ncan't take overseas.\n  Chairman Baucus has done a tremendous job with this legislation. If \nanyone in this Senate knows how to bring all sides to the table and \nbring common ground, Max Baucus does, and this bill is no exception. \nHaving heard Republican criticism of the previous version of the tax \nextender legislation, Chairman Baucus set out to make this bill be one \nthat would satisfy a significant number of Senators. Not only did \nChairman Baucus address previous Republican concerns about the tax \nextender package, this new legislation also does other things that are \nvery important.\n  For example, there are provisions which will provide for much needed \nassistance not only to flood victims in the Midwest but also victims of \nnatural disasters in Nevada, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Colorado, \nMississippi, and a significant number of other States.\n  This bill also transfers funds to the highway trust fund, which, in \nstreet parlance, is upside down. It is out of money. There is a \nprojected shortfall of $3 billion next year. This proposal is \noverwhelmingly supported on a bipartisan basis and passed the House by \na vote of 387 to 37.\n  Also in this legislation is something that is long overdue. Paul \nWellstone was a great Senator, and his No. 1 issue was mental health \nparity. He believed people who are sick emotionally or mentally deserve \nthe same attention as people who are sick physically. He worked with \nSenators Domenici, Kennedy, and others to get this passed.\n  Unfortunately, Paul was killed in a plane crash, but now is the time \nto move forward on this legislation. This simply says that mental \nhealth is considered just as serious and legitimate a medical concern \nas physical health, and those who suffer should receive equal access to \nthe health care they need to get well.\n  We have made some compromises in the current version of the \nlegislation that we would rather not have made, but we made them in an \neffort to pick up help from the other side of the aisle. We did so \nbecause we understand that compromise is essential to legislate, and we \nacted in good faith in responding to Republican concerns. I hope our \nRepublican colleagues will see this--as we do--as an opportunity for a \nbipartisan solution to the energy crisis.\n  This is just one piece of the puzzle, but it is an important piece, \nthe most important piece, and one that can make a difference in energy \nprices now--immediately. So we hope Republicans will decide to take yes \nfor an answer.\n  Legislating requires the participation and cooperation of both sides \nof the aisle. We can't do this by ourselves. Surely the American people \nare tired of Republicans delaying and rejecting every effort Democrats \nmake to solve our Nation's problems. We don't need every Republican to \nagree. Perhaps today is the day that we will get enough Republicans to \nreject the politics of delay and inaction and embrace the path of \nprogress.\n  Mr. President, if Republicans don't vote to move forward on this \nlegislation, we will continue to be on the motion to proceed to this \nlegislation--the tax extenders. We are not going to be in a position to \nlegislate anymore, it appears, on the speculation bill. That is too \nbad. I spoke with the president, as I have said on the Senate floor on \na number of occasions, of United Airlines, and he is convinced the \nprice of oil has gone down because we are talking about speculation.\n  So it appears that the Republicans have rejected our offers to do \nsomething on the tax extenders package that we have just talked about. \nThe Republican leader said: Have Senator Baucus deal with Senator \nGrassley and compromise. Well, that was a total waste of time because, \nagain, all the Republicans want to do is not pay for anything, and we \nknow the House will not accept that--and rightfully so. This is really \nunfortunate. So we are going to be on this matter to proceed to the tax \nextenders.\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\n  We are willing to complete the most important legislation. The \nConsumer Product Safety conference report has been completed. The \nhigher education conference report has been completed. We will be happy \nto work with that. It should take a short period of time. We hope we \nwould not have to have cloture on those but around here it appears, \nwith 90 filibusters, they may even filibuster something that has \noverwhelming bipartisan support again.\n  We are also, before we leave here, going to have a vote on a motion \nto proceed to the Defense Authorization bill that Senators Warner and \nLevin have worked so hard on.\n  If the Republicans decide they want to negotiate in good faith on \nthis matter that is before the Senate and this does not pass, that is \nthe extenders, Senator Baucus is standing by ready to do that--but it \nhas to be in good faith. It has to be in an effort to get something \naccomplished, not to say we want to pay for nothing, more red ink, more \nred ink. We know the deficit now is approaching half a trillion dollars \nthis year because of the programs we have seen President Bush initiate \nand not initiate.\n  We are willing to move forward on these tax extenders. We think the \nmatter should be paid for, as does the House. We have a letter signed \nby 220-odd House Members saying don't bother to send anything back that \nis not paid for. We will not pass it.\n  We have tried to be as reasonable as we can be. We hope the \nRepublicans will join with us and move forward on energy legislation, \nthat is the tax extenders, that will actually help the country.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3268\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 3268, energy \nspeculation, not be displaced and that it remain the pending business \nnotwithstanding the Senate adopting the motion to proceed to a calendar \nitem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving right to object, this side of \nthe aisle believes we need to dispose of the pending Energy bill to \nhelp bring down the price of gas at the pump first, before turning to \nother matters, so for that reason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nis waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 2035, a bill to maintain the free flow of \ninformation to the public by providing conditions for the federally \ncompelled disclosure of information by certain persons connected with \nthe news media shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote the yeas are 51, the nays are 43. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the media shield bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. For the knowledge of all Members here now, we are now still \non the motion to proceed to the media shield bill; the one that cloture \nwas not invoked on. So that is what we are going to be on for the \nforeseeable future.\n  We have a couple matters that are possible that we can move forward \non. That will be up to the minority as to when and where we will do \nthat. We have the consumer product safety bill, we have also the work \nthat has been done on the higher education bill.\n  I am going to file cloture before we leave on the motion to proceed \nto the Defense authorization bill. As I told the distinguished \nRepublican leader today, if there is some serious negotiations on the \nextenders, Senator Baucus is ready to do this.\n  But as a notice to everyone, as I said in my statement before the \nvote, there is a new sheriff in town by the name of Pelosi. The House \nwill not allow matters to be passed without being paid for. I agree \nwith her. We have far too long not paid for things.\n  We have a situation now where we have had 8 years of buying red ink \nby the trainload. We have now a situation where the deficit this year \nwill be about half a trillion dollars. The only thing we have heard, \nand Senator Baucus heard yesterday on the tax extenders, is what the \nRepublicans want to do: We want to have some more things, but we do not \nwant to pay for any of it.\n  The Speaker has sent a letter to me signed by 220 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, saying these matters have to be paid for. \nWhat we did in this work done by Senator Baucus, there were matters \nthat rightfully should not be paid for, such as disaster assistance.\n  As we have indicated in the past, even though the House does not like \nit, and we do not particularly like it, the AMT in this bill is not \npaid for. So other than that, things are paid for and paid for in a \nvery responsible way.\n  The tax extender package includes some things that would change \nenergy in this country as we have known it for 100 years.\n  It would change from a situation now where everything is done with \nfossil fuel to a situation that T. Boone Pickens and others envision, \nwhere we would be depending on the Sun, the wind, geothermal, biomass. \nThis is real. There are people during the last 4 months who have been \nlaid off, working on these alternative energy projects, renewable \nenergy projects. There are people who could go to work tomorrow on \nthese projects. Remember, these are all American jobs, jobs that can't \nbe exported anyplace else.\n  As I said to the Republican leader today, the August schedule is in \nhis hands. I have told those assembled here\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\ntoday what we have to do. I told Senators what we have to do. I am \ntremendously disappointed that the tax extenders were not passed. I was \njust given a note by the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee about something that also is in this bill that would create \nlots of jobs, at least 150,000 high-paying jobs, and that is to \nreplenish the money from the highway trust funds. Those moneys are not \ngoing to be there, which will cause people not only to not have jobs, \nbut it will stop projects from going forward that are already in \nprogress.\n  The schedule in August is up to the Republican leader. As I have said \nbefore on a number of occasions, we basically have finished what we \nhave to do this work period. We have tried mightily during the last 18, \n19 months to get things done. We have had to deal with about 90 \nfilibusters. Whatever the number is, we increased it by one today. We \nwill see what happens on the legislation dealing with higher education \nand see what is going to happen with the Republicans as it relates to \nthe consumer product safety legislation. That may add two more \nfilibusters. Of course, we have the Defense authorization bill to which \nwe wish to proceed. We will have a vote on that on Friday. It is up to \nthe minority to determine what we will do on that.\n  As I have indicated on a number of occasions, we have the conventions \ncoming up in August, which is important to every Senator. We have other \nimportant items we have been working on that need to be done at home. \nWe can't do them in Washington. But we await word from Republicans, if \nthey are going to negotiate seriously on the tax extenders. Other than \nthat, I have stated, I believe pretty clearly, where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I wish to note that the energy tax extenders would have been \nlaw as of 7 a.m. this morning if they had not been taken out of the \nhousing bill by the Democratic majority. We should be aware of the fact \nthat one of the reasons why this issue remains is the strategy from the \nmajority on the housing bill.\n  Mr. REID. Understand, though, that is the whole problem. They don't \nwant to pay for anything. The bill that is before the Senate is paid \nfor. What he is talking about is the flimflam where you pass all these \nthings and don't pay for them. That is why we have a staggering deficit \nthat during this administration has gone up more than $3 trillion. When \nGeorge Bush took office, over 10 years there was a surplus of about $10 \ntrillion. That is long since gone. I appreciate very much the statement \nof my friend from Arizona, but the fact is, that is what we are talking \nabout here. They don't want to pay for anything. The tax extenders in \nour package are paid for, as they should be. The American people should \nnot be burdened and leave a legacy looking forward of their children, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren buried by Bush deficits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I note that 88 Senators voted in favor of that approach \ndealing with this subject.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the statement of my friend from Arizona. I \nbelieve in these extenders so strongly that even though I would much \nrather have them paid for, we all know the debt has to stop someplace. \nAs I indicated, the House of Representatives, to their credit, will not \naccept these not being paid for. That is the way it should be. We \nshould not be running up massive deficits that the Bush \nadministration--first year, second year, third year, fourth year, fifth \nyear, seventh year, and now in the eighth year--is willing to accept. \nThe war in Iraq, $5,000 a second; it doesn't matter.\n  We are where we are, but I am very disappointed that we are where we \nare. As I said, my Senators are waiting to hear from the Republican \nleader what he wants to do the rest of this week and into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7722-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JOBS, ENERGY, FAMILIES, AND DISASTER RELIEF ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this vote that was cast is something \nAmerica should not miss. This was about an energy program for America, \nand it was defeated. It was defeated because only four Republicans--\nmaybe five--managed to cross the aisle and help us.\n\n[[Page S7723]]\n\nThis is 2 days running that the Republicans--who have given us speech \nafter speech about why we need an energy policy--have voted no. That is \nall they do: vote no.\n  What did this proposal include? It included energy tax credits \ndesperately needed by America. This morning, Senator Stabenow gathered \ntogether Governors, leaders in business and leaders in labor and they \nall told us the same thing: Pass the energy tax credits, and pass it \nnow. Jobs are at stake across America.\n  I had a major company in Chicago that came in--the CEO came in to see \nSenator Reid and myself last week--facing bankruptcy because we cannot \npass this bill. Why? Because the Tax Code was written year to year, \ncreating incentives for investment in wind power. That is the power \nthat does not pollute but creates electricity. Wind turbines all over \nmy State and all over the country are doing the right thing for our \nfuture. They will not continue without these tax credits, and the \nRepublicans consistently vote no. And then--hang on--after lunch they \nwill be on the floor saying we desperately need an energy policy.\n  Where were they when we needed them? That was not the only thing in \nthis bill. This bill also put $8 billion in the highway trust fund that \nhas gone broke. Across America, we are losing jobs, at a time when we \nneed good-paying jobs right here at home, because Republicans refuse to \ndo this. They will not vote for it.\n  There was another provision or two in there equally important, but I \nwish to focus on those two. Let me explain to you why they would not \nvote for it. They would not vote for it because on the Democratic side \nwe insisted that if you are going to have tax credits given, we pay for \nthem so that, ultimately, it does not add to our national deficit.\n  This President inherited a surplus from President Clinton and has now \ntaken the gold, the silver, and the bronze medals for the biggest \ndeficits--top three deficits--in the history of the United States in \nhis 8 years. We are saying this has to end. We cannot broker America's \nfuture for our children. So we want to pay for these tax credits. We do \nit in a way that even the business community says: That is reasonable. \nWe can live with it. But not the Republicans. Only four or five will \ncross the aisle to help us.\n  A minute ago, I met in my office with the CEO of American Airlines, \nGerard Arpey. This poor man is struggling to keep one of the major \nairlines in America out of bankruptcy. He is cutting back on schedule, \nreducing the number of employees because, unfortunately, when oil is \n$125, $135 a barrel, the cost of jet fuel is bankrupting his airline. \nHe is begging me--begging me--the United States and the Congress to \nshow some leadership.\n  Now, what can we do? First, we can get some Republicans to join us \nfor this energy policy. If they want to produce more energy in America, \nhave them vote for it, not give more speeches with their ``produce \nmore, use less'' slogans on the floor. Produce some votes for us. A few \nless speeches and a few more votes and we would have an energy policy. \nThat is the reality.\n  There is something that can be done immediately, though, and it is \nsomething this President can do and does not need to wait on Congress, \nand he ought to do it today. President Bush should announce he is going \nto start selling off oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring \nthe price of a barrel of oil down to $100 a barrel. That is our target \nprice for America. That will turn this economy on. That will give the \nairlines a chance. That will put the truckers back to work. That will \ngive the farmers a break.\n  The President can do it without any congressional approval. His \nfather did it. It is not a radical idea. Seven hundred million barrels \nof oil--if the President released and sold 10 percent of that, saying: \nMy goal is to get to $100 a barrel, that oil on the market would start \nthe price coming down.\n\n  All this discussion on the Republican side and from the President \nabout drilling--if we decided today to start drilling certain acreage, \nyou would not see the first drop of oil for 8 to 14 years. You would \nhave to wait 8 to 14 hours for the President's announcement about \nreleasing oil from SPR to see an impact on the market.\n  It is time for Presidential leadership. The fact that the President \ncomes out of the oil industry and the Vice President does as well, they \nunderstand it. And the oil industry has never done better.\n  Now it is time for the President to show leadership. He can do it. We \nshould call on him in Congress, on a bipartisan basis: Release this oil \nfrom the SPR, bring down the price of a barrel of oil, give American \nfamilies a fighting chance when they go to the gas station, and give \nthese companies a chance to create more good-paying jobs in America. \nThat is what is at stake.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple \nquestions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First of all, Mr. President, I have known my friend from \nIllinois, the senior Senator from Illinois, for many years. We served \nin the House together. He is one of the most collegial Members of the \nSenate. I say to the Senator, I do not think I have ever seen you quite \nas upset and angry as you are.\n  I wish to ask my friend--because he touched on this--as to the real \nimpact on America's families that he started to discuss. As chair of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, I know, as he does, we have \nto fund our highway program. I know my colleague from Michigan and my \ncolleague from Minnesota both are going to talk about the need for safe \nand sound infrastructure and the fact that with it comes good jobs.\n  But here is where we are at this point. Because of the no, no, no \nvotes by that side--what they said no to today was making sure we can \npay for the highway projects we have already authorized, we have \nalready told the States to go ahead and start constructing.\n  I say to the Senator, $8 billion was in this bill that they just said \nno to, again--$8 billion to replenish the highway trust fund. That \ntranslates to--and hold on to your hats, folks--400,000 good-paying \njobs that will be lost if we do not replenish this fund, not to mention \nthe jobs that are already being lost because they refuse to renew these \ntax credits for solar, wind, and geothermal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In my State, we have a horrible housing crisis. It is \nterrible. Construction is down. What has been keeping us afloat, I say \nto my colleagues, is the renewable energy industry. Four hundred solar \ncompanies have moved in. They are taking these workers. So how could we \nhave--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 1 \nmore minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I say to my friend, this Republican Party here, they \nare the recession party. They stand for recession and moving into \ndepression with their votes, does my friend not agree, with their votes \ntoday?\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is the second time in 24 hours we have given the \nRepublicans a chance to show whether they are for an energy policy \nwhich will produce more clean energy and more jobs for America, and \nfour of them came forward to support us--only four. There are 49 of \nthose Senators, and 4 voted with us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And the trust fund.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the trust fund, of course--a critical point--which \ncan create 400,000 jobs across America.\n  Middle-income families are struggling to survive. We need more good-\npaying jobs right here in this country. How can they come down here and \nconsistently vote no and say they want an energy policy?\n  The President should release oil from SPR this week. Our goal should \nbe $100-a-barrel oil. The President doesn't need Congress. Let him show \nsome leadership in this energy crisis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority control the time until 12:30, the Republicans control the next \n30 minutes, the majority control the next 30 minutes, and the time \nuntil 6 p.m. be controlled in 30 minute blocks in an alternating \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          America's Priorities\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, our \nassistant majority leader from Illinois\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\nand the Senator from California, for speaking today, because we are \nquite astounded, I have to tell my colleagues. Coming from the great \nState of Michigan where we care about jobs--and I know the Presiding \nOfficer does, coming from the great State of Pennsylvania--our folks \nare desperate for good-paying jobs, middle-class jobs that allow them \nto pay that mortgage and pay those outrageous gas prices and to be able \nto keep their families afloat and put food on the table.\n  What we had happen in front of us today was an effort to once again \nblock the future of alternative energy jobs and block today, by \nstopping it, an investment in the highway trust fund that would keep \n400,000 jobs going in our country. That is a lot of jobs--400,000 jobs.\n  Now, why would they do that? When you look around, since this \nPresident and Vice President have taken office, gas prices have \ntripled. Oil prices are four times higher. Families and businesses are \nbeing squeezed on every side. Why can't we get action? Who benefits? I \nwonder who would like this picture.\n  Well, let's look at who would like this picture. I only pick on one \ncompany because they happen to be the ones showing the highest profits. \nDuring this time that families and truckers on the road are trying to \nmake a living, and businesses, small and large, are trying to hold it \ntogether, during this time of crisis, $185 billion profit since our \nPresident and the Vice President--two oilmen from Texas--took office. \nMr. President, $185 billion in profits. What we have here is an oil \nagenda. We have had an oil company agenda since they took office on \nevery step of the way.\n  The bill that was turned down today--it wasn't just turned down \ntoday; it was, in fact, turned down on June 10 of this year, June 17 of \nthis year, July 29, and today. This isn't the only time. We have gone \nback as far as last year, a year ago. Tax incentives in the Energy bill \nwere blocked twice by Republican colleagues on behalf of big oil on \nJune 21, 2007, and December 13, 2007. We can go on. February 7 of this \nyear, Republicans blocked adding critical energy production tax \nincentives to the stimulus that was passed. They are willing to give \neverybody a little bit of a check, a little bit of a rebate check, but \nwhen we are talking about creating jobs and investing in competition \nwith the oil companies, oh, no. Oh, no.\n  Who wouldn't want that competition? Let me see. Maybe these folks \nwouldn't want that competition. Maybe they were the ones who said: No, \nno, we don't want to be focusing on electric vehicles and investing in \nbattery technology or consumer credits for new vehicles. No, no, we \ndon't want to be investing in solar and wind and geothermal. No, no. \nGetting off of oil? No, no, no, no. This is the oil administration. We \ndon't want to get off of oil; we want to embrace it. We want to \ncontinue it.\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened.\n  Record profits. The total combined net profits of the big five oil \ncompanies since our President took office are upwards of $556 billion. \nIf I sound a little upset, I am because I have folks in my State who \nare just struggling to try to make it. Are they investing here at home \nwith that $556 billion? The oil companies spent $188 billion buying \nback their own stock in the last 5 years. Exporting. A record 1.6 \nmillion barrels a day were exported, 33 percent higher than before.\n\n  We are in a global economy. Unfortunately, even though I think it is \nimportant to have a domestic oil supply, it is in a global economy. It \nis not necessarily going to stay here. The drill-only, the drill-\nforever crowd, that is the oil agenda. It is the oil profits agenda in \na global economy.\n  Let me share for a moment some folks who are suffering under the oil \nagenda of this President and Vice President and the Republicans who \nhave been in charge.\n  In South Haven, MI, a beautiful little town along Lake Michigan, this \nwas in the paper. Early last month, Jeanne Fair, who is 62 years old, \ngot her first hot meals delivered to her home in this little lake \ncommunity in the rural southwestern part of the State. After two \ndeliveries of meals, they stopped because the volunteers couldn't \nafford the gas to get her the food. ``They called and said I was \noutside of the delivery area,'' said Mrs. Fair, who is homebound and \nhasn't been able to use her left arm since a stroke in 1997.\n  Faced with soaring gasoline prices, agencies around the country that \nprovide services to the elderly say they are having to cut back on \nprograms such as Meals on Wheels, transportation assistance, and home \ncare, especially in rural areas that depend on volunteers to provide \ntheir own gas. In a recent survey by the National Association of Area \nAgencies on Aging, more than half said they already cut back on \nprograms because of gas prices. Ninety percent say they are expected to \ncut them back in 2009.\n  This is the United States of America, and we have volunteers who have \nto stop giving meals to people in rural Michigan so these folks can \nkeep up this agenda here: $185 billion profit since George Bush took \noffice. And our folks can't afford gas.\n  Let me share something else, a letter from a gentleman:\n\n       As my family's only breadwinner, I drive over an hour each \n     day to my job at LifeWays in Jackson . . . The reason I drive \n     over an hour each way is because jobs for professionals are \n     extremely rare in Hillsdale County where I live. Over 16 car \n     industry-related plants have closed in Hillsdale County in \n     the past 10 years, leaving the unemployment rate sky high and \n     wages extremely low. The newest hit is the high prices for \n     energy which are hurting me and my family. Not even looking \n     at the 55-cent increase per gallon of propane we were just \n     notified of, my commute costs me $28 a day and I drive a \n     midsized car. I urge Congress to act immediately.\n\n  Mr. President, we had a chance to act immediately today to do \nsomething that would make a difference, a real difference, and Congress \ndidn't do it.\n  I also have one other letter from a 17-year-old high school student \nwho has a job. She says: I make $7.15 an hour and put in about 20 hours \na week. My job sometimes interferes with my education because I am \ntrying to make money that I need. My job affects school because I need \nto work. It makes it difficult for me. I am paid every 2 weeks and \nspend about $100 a week on gas to get back and forth to school and \nwork. She says: Even during school time, I ride the bus to try to save \nmoney, but now I probably won't be riding the bus because school \ndistricts are cutting back on transportation to school. They are doing \nthis because they don't have enough money to fill up the buses' gas \ntanks.\n  What is going on? What is going on here? We are fighting for the \npeople of this country who expect to be able to put gas in the \nschoolbus, who expect to be able to have seniors get Meals on Wheels, \nwho expect to be able to drive to work. That is what this is about. It \nis about time we change the agenda of this country and who decisions \nare being made for. The reality is--I think it is, unfortunately, way \ntoo simple, but it is true--we have had 8 years of two oilmen in the \nWhite House and it has gotten us paying $4-a-gallon gasoline, maybe a \nlittle less, maybe a little more. That is the reality. We have seen \nover and over not only efforts on this floor to block what we are doing \nbut on top of that, to add insult to injury, a free ride for the oil \ncompanies.\n  In January of 2006, the New York Times reported that the Bush \nadministration was allowing oil and gas companies to forgo royalty \npayments--forgo royalty payments--on leases in Federal waters, public \nwaters in the Gulf of Mexico. It would cost American taxpayers more \nthan $60 billion. Sixty billion dollars would equal 38 days of free gas \nfor every American. How about that. So not only are they blocking us \nfrom creating alternatives, not only are they blocking us from taking \ntaxpayer money--the same people I just read about are subsidizing the \noil companies because we can't stop these subsidies going to the most \nprofitable companies in the world--the world. We can't get that stopped \nwhen we are trying to say: Take those dollars and move them over to the \nfuture, which is alternative energy that will allow gas prices to go \ndown, that will free us from foreign oil, get us off of a policy that \ndepends on those around the world who aren't exactly our friends, and \nmake us stronger in terms of national security. We can't get that done. \nThen, to add insult to injury, they waive oil and gas leases--$60 \nbillion. I would love to have been able to waive some house payments. I \nwould love to have been able to say to folks who were trying to\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\nmake it and not lose their house in foreclosure: We will give you 90 \ndays, don't worry about it, because we care about families and we want \nto make sure you keep your house.\n  We finally have a housing bill. It is too late for many people, but \nwe finally have one, thank goodness, that the President would sign.\n  Where are the priorities of this country? Who are we making decisions \nfor? That is the question. Who are we making decisions for?\n  So I have extreme concern about the direction in which we are going. \nI have to tell my colleagues, as somebody who comes from a State where \nthere is such a little bit of support right now, it would give us a \nwhole lot more impact in the short run if we were to invest--and I know \nthat. I am so grateful to our Senate leadership for supporting our \nefforts to retool our auto plants, to keep jobs in America for new \nvehicles. We are now focusing our talk so many times on this floor on \nwhat we are doing to support the advanced battery research and \ndevelopment so we are making those new batteries in America, not only \nfor automobiles but for energy storage, and making sure we are the \nenergy producers and creating the jobs of the future. A few investments \nwe can do immediately within the next couple of years would \ntremendously impact us.\n  I know my time is up. Let me just indicate that it is time to change \nthe agenda. The American people have had enough. This big-oil agenda \nwhich has been driving the train here on the Senate floor and which has \nbeen driving the train in the White House has to stop.\n  We have to take away their track and turn this thing around, so that \nwe are focusing on what the American people want us to focus on to help \nthem and their families in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussion we \nare having on our Nation's energy situation and to point out that it is \na discussion, it is not action.\n  I point out that the other side of the aisle could be called the \n``great pretenders.'' They are pretending to be interested in energy, \nbut they are not doing anything about energy. The only thing we have \nbeen allowed to debate on this has been the bill on speculators. I have \ntalked about speculators and the role they have and what the \npossibilities are for them to skew the market. It is the blame game. \nFor every person who gains a dollar, a person loses a dollar.\n  Our airlines rely on the speculation, rely on those markets to hedge \ntheir prices, and we call it speculation. It has allowed them to lock \nin a reasonable price some of the time.\n  So it is the great pretender package, because it doesn't solve \nenergy. If we don't find some ways to use less and find more, we are \nnot going to be able to make the transition to renewable energies. We \nare being blocked from doing that.\n  What we are doing is ``gotcha'' politics. We have been doing it for \nseveral months now, and it is wrong. How can you tell when it is \n``gotcha'' politics? When a bill doesn't go through the regular \nprocess, when it doesn't go to committee so that there can be extensive \ndebate among the people who are expert in that area, so that the people \nin that specific committee have a chance to make amendments. That is \nwhere a lot of the legislating happens. By the time it gets to the \nfloor, it is kind of take it or leave it--maybe a few amendments but \nnot many are ever allowed. On this one, the most we have been allowed \nis four amendments, which have been written by the other side of the \naisle.\n  That is unconscionable. It has never been done in the history of the \nUnited States. And then they demand a 60-vote margin on those. It will \nnot happen, and neither is anything else, until we do something about \nenergy because it is the No. 1 concern of people in America now. There \nis good reason for that. I know trucking firms that are going out of \nbusiness. People want to take vacations, and they are either having to \nreduce the distance they are going or eliminate the vacation \naltogether. I know people who are having trouble getting to work.\n  We can put quick solutions, medium, and long-range solutions, in \nthere that would resolve the energy problem for America. The world is \nbecoming more energy oriented. The world understands energy. China \nunderstands energy. China is buying up every source of energy it can \nfind around the world, because it grows their economy. They are using \nsome of the worst stuff they can possibly use. That is why housing at \nthe Olympic village isn't going to be able to used for the athletes, \nbecause they won't be able to breathe properly--even though they have \nbought clean Wyoming coal, and they tried to buy an oil company in the \nUnited States so they could take that oil to China. India is also \ncompeting for energy. That competition is driving up the prices.\n  Unless we find more and use less and transition into renewables, we \nare going to have a long problem in the economy of this country. As \nlong as we keep bringing bills to the floor that have not been through \ncommittee, where people with disagreements can move off to the side and \nwork that out and bring it in, it is not going to work. We are going to \nhave a higher education bill this week, and that will make a difference \nto students throughout the United States--in high school, going to \ncollege, and those in college continuing with college. That went \nthrough the whole process. That has been through the committees in both \nthe House and the Senate. A lot of changes were made. That has been \npassed in the Senate and passed in the House on the floor, and changes \nwere made. Now it has been conferenced. Last night, it took us all of \nan hour and a half to work out the differences and finish the bill. \nThat will be a privileged motion that will come here. So we will finish \nup a major bill in about an hour and a half because it went through the \nprocess.\n  You cannot take something such as energy, put out a phony bill, \nexpect it to pass, and check off the box on energy. It is not going to \nwork. We are not going to do that. That has never been the way we have \ndone work in the Senate. We take a bill to committee, get it worked \nout, bring it to the floor, and let people make amendments. That is the \nway we do things here. It takes time, but it doesn't take nearly as \nmuch time as forcing all of these filibusters by putting up bills that \nthe tree will be filled on, which means nobody can do any amendments--a \ntake-it-or-leave-it bill.\n  As long as we are doing take-it-or-leave-it bills, nothing is going \nto happen. It makes good publicity because they will run ads in Wyoming \nthat will say Senator Enzi voted against this and that. And you know, I \nthink the people in Wyoming kind of have it figured out. They know we \nare actually trying to get something done. They know what a crisis it \nis on energy. We have to make a difference there.\n\n  So, remember, if a bill hasn't been to committee, it is a ``gotcha'' \nbill, designed by one party. Several times there have been negotiations \nstarted between the two parties, such as on the tax extenders bill. But \nthinking that would be a good ``gotcha'' vote, we had the package that \nyou saw earlier that didn't make it through cloture. That could be \nnegotiated out. That could make it through the process. It needs to \nmake it through the process. But it is not going to make it through the \nprocess if one side says let's put this out there, and the other side \nwill have a lot of trouble voting for this, and we can claim they don't \nlike tax extenders. I don't think that has been the history of the \ncountry. I know it hasn't been the history of the Senate.\n  Energy is so important. Energy impacts every part of our lives. When \ngasoline and diesel fuel are more expensive, you pay more to fill up \nyour vehicle at the pump. So do truckers who transport the items we \nneed, such as food. In turn, you pay more at the grocery store. You pay \nmore for gifts you buy for loved ones. The high cost of fuel makes it \nharder for families to fill up their gas tanks. They are canceling \nvacations or they are picking ones closer to home. Because they are \nforced to cancel vacations, main street shops are closing down because \nthey don't have consumers to buy their products.\n  Low energy costs make it possible for our economy to flourish, and at \na time of economic concern, we should be doing everything we can to \nimprove\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\nour Nation's energy situation as opposed to hindering it. The ``energy \nbill'' we are debating ignores this fact because it only deals with a \nsmall part of our energy situation--energy speculation.\n  I have noticed that whenever a situation gets bad, Congress plays the \nblame game. In this instance, the price of gas is making you angry. It \nmakes me angry, too. I am sick of paying $4 a gallon to fill my gas \ntank. I want action. Instead of action, the majority has given us the \nlegislation to punish speculators. Never mind that speculators are \npension funds, airlines, and other consumers who are looking for \ncertainty in an uncertain market. They have given us a bill that clamps \ndown on speculators even though the Chairman of the Federal Reserve has \nsaid there is no evidence that speculation is impacting the market.\n  As I mentioned in my statements last week, this speculation bill \nmight even have negative consequences on the market. I spoke at length \nregarding the possible unintended consequences of the majority leader's \nbill on institutional investors, including pension funds, and their \nability to access and participate in our markets. Since I made those \nstatements, I received two letters from The Committee on Investment of \nEmployee Benefit Assets, and from a group of 10 associations that \nrepresents pension funds, companies, and their investment managers and \nfiduciaries, expressing their concern about the majority leader's bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Committee on Investment\n\n\n                                   of Employee Benefit Assets,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, July 25, 2008.\n     Re energy speculation legislation (S. 3268) erodes core ERISA \n         principle of investment flexibility.\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pension, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Kennedy and Baucus and Ranking Members Enzi \n     and Grassley: I am writing today on behalf of the Committee \n     on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (``CIEBA'') to \n     express our concerns regarding S. 3268, the Stop Excessive \n     Energy Speculation Act. This legislation would erode a \n     central principle of the legal regime governing our voluntary \n     pension system. We share the sentiments expressed in the \n     letter of concern regarding S. 3268 sent to the Senate \n     earlier today by ten trade associations active in the pension \n     arena but wished to write separately to highlight our \n     particular concerns about potential erosion of one of the \n     core principles of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act (ERISA).\n       CIEBA is a group of over 115 private pension funds that \n     manage more than $1.5 trillion in defined benefit and defined \n     contribution plan assets on behalf of more than 17 million \n     plan participants and beneficiaries. As you know, our \n     nation's voluntary employer-sponsored pension system has \n     served Americans well for over half a century and tens of \n     millions of workers and retirees rely on defined benefit and \n     defined contribution retirement plans as a critical element \n     of their retirement security.\n       CIEBA is concerned about the possible unintended \n     consequences of S. 3268. While we understand and share the \n     concerns regarding the rising costs of energy, severely \n     restricting investment in energy commodities markets, as S. \n     3268 would do, endangers the financial well-being of the \n     pension system and the American families who rely on this \n     system.\n       CIEBA has been working actively to highlight the pension \n     implications of restrictions on commodities investing and \n     warn against the adverse effects of such restrictions on \n     pension participants and beneficiaries. I testified on June \n     24, 2008, before the Senate Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee on these issues, and the \n     chairman of CIEBA's defined benefit subcommittee, Robin \n     Diamonte, testified before the House Agriculture Committee on \n     July 10, 2008. In our testimony, we made clear that while \n     commodities are only a modest component of a pension fund's \n     total investment portfolio, they are nonetheless quite \n     important because commodity returns are uncorrelated with \n     stock and bond returns and commodities provide a critical \n     hedge against inflation. We further testified that efforts to \n     restrict the ability of pension plans to invest in \n     commodities markets, whether through outright prohibitions or \n     severe limitations, is short-sighted and counterproductive. \n     Such restrictions would make it difficult for pension plans \n     to adequately diversify investments to hedge against market \n     volatility and inflation. Consequently, they would put at \n     risk the retirement funds and benefits of the very workers \n     the legislative proposals are intended to help.\n       As leaders of the Senate committees with pension \n     jurisdiction, we hope you share our concern about adopting \n     energy legislation with such major implications for the \n     pension system, particularly when your committees of \n     jurisdiction have not had an opportunity to consider these \n     issues. Congress has long recognized that direct government \n     regulation regarding specific pension plan investments is \n     ill-conceived, and ERISA very consciously avoids such an \n     approach. As you know, ERISA imposes rigorous fiduciary \n     responsibilities on those who manage pension plan assets. \n     These rules require plan fiduciaries to act prudently, and to \n     diversify plan investments so as to minimize the risk of \n     large losses. Moreover, ERISA requires fiduciaries to act \n     solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries \n     and for the exclusive purpose of providing participant \n     benefits. Accomplishment of these participant-focused \n     objectives can best be achieved by broad fiduciary discretion \n     to select appropriate investments and asset classes and this \n     is precisely the regime adopted in ERISA. Fiduciaries cannot \n     faithfully execute their obligations and respond to market \n     conditions if restrictions are imposed on important \n     investment approaches and asset classes. Unfortunately, this \n     is precisely what S. 3268 would do. Its restrictions would \n     erode fiduciaries' critical investment discretion and thereby \n     undermine one of ERISA's core principles.\n       The experience of other nations has shown that efforts to \n     impose investment restrictions and/or investment requirements \n     on pension plans impairs performance and thereby harms the \n     interests of pension plan participants and beneficiaries. \n     This has been the European experience, and we fear current \n     efforts to restrict investments in commodities could be the \n     beginning of a counter-productive movement in this direction \n     in the U.S. We hope to work with you and your Senate \n     colleagues to ensure that this will not be the case. Instead, \n     we must ensure that our existing ERISA structure--imposition \n     of demanding fiduciary obligations paired with broad \n     investment flexibility--is preserved.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this \n     important issue. We would be happy to provide further input \n     on this legislation to ensure the health of a secure \n     retirement system that will continue to serve the interests \n     of the tens of millions of pension plan participants and \n     beneficiaries.\n     Sincerely,\n                                                 William F. Quinn,\n     CIEBA Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 25, 2008.\n     Re adverse retirement plan implications of energy speculation \n         legislation (S. 3268).\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     We are writing today to express concerns about the \n     implications of S. 3268, the ``Stop Excessive Energy \n     Speculation Act of 2008'', on employer-sponsored retirement \n     plans and the tens of millions of American workers and \n     retirees who rely on these plans for their retirement \n     security. We represent organizations that assist employers of \n     all sizes, and their service providers, in providing \n     retirement benefits to employees.\n       We are very concerned that the serious implications of S. \n     3268 on retirement plans and retirement plan participants \n     have not been sufficiently evaluated. We are also concerned \n     that this legislation relating to energy policy could \n     unintentionally harm the long-term financial security of \n     American workers and their families.\n       Employer-sponsored defined benefit plans invest for the \n     long-term and do so in a wide range of asset classes in order \n     to diversify plan investments and reduce to the greatest \n     extent possible the risk of large losses. These strategies \n     are central to employers' fiduciary obligations to act \n     prudently and solely in the interest of the plan's \n     participants and beneficiaries. Plan fiduciaries are subject \n     to extremely demanding legal obligations under the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). ERISA was drafted to \n     preserve the fiduciary's flexibility to select the \n     investments that will allow them to carry out their mission \n     of providing retirement benefits to employees. Commodities \n     are one of a broad range of asset classes upon which \n     fiduciaries rely. Commodities serve as a modest but important \n     element of the investments held by employer-sponsored defined \n     benefit pensions because commodity returns are uncorrelated \n     with stocks and bonds and because they provide an important \n     protection against inflation.\n       For the same reasons, commodities are used in many of the \n     diversified ``single fund'' solutions (lifecycle funds, \n     target retirement date funds) that have been developed to \n     simplify investing for the tens of millions of\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\n     Americans participating in defined contribution plans such as \n     401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457 plans. These single fund \n     solutions, which policymakers have encouraged through \n     legislation and regulation, make investing easier while \n     giving workers access to professionally managed, diversified \n     portfolios.\n       The restrictions imposed on commodities investing under S. \n     3268 would greatly limit the ability of employer-sponsored \n     defined benefit and defined contribution plans to use this \n     important asset class. The result will be less ability to \n     diversify investments, manage investment volatility and \n     provide a buffer against inflation. Unfortunately, it is the \n     employees and retirees who depend on employer retirement \n     plans for their income in retirement who will ultimately \n     suffer. We hope, with this in mind, that the implications for \n     retirement plans and plan participants will be examined more \n     fully before S. 3268 is considered further.\n       We sincerely appreciate your consideration of our views on \n     this important matter. Please let us know if we can provide \n     additional information or address any questions you may have.\n     Sincerely,\n     American Bankers Association.\n     American Benefits Council.\n     American Council of Life Insurers.\n     The ERISA Industry Committee.\n     The Financial Services Roundtable.\n     Investment Company Institute.\n     Managed Funds Association.\n     Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America.\n     Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.\n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. While the majority has given us someone to blame, they have \nnot given us a comprehensive bill that will get us out of this energy \nmess. They have not given us a proposal that addresses the heart of the \nproblem--the problem of supply and demand. We need to find more \nAmerican oil from American soil at the same time that we use less. We \nneed to quit shipping those dollars overseas to countries that would \nlike to do us harm. We need to do something with renewables. But there \nare also things we can do with the coal resources we have. My State has \nmore coal than the Btus of oil in the Middle East. I have a lot of \nfaith in our young people. When I was going to junior high, Russia put \nup Sputnik, and we panicked. We discovered--even in junior high we \nrealized this--we were now behind Russia, and it was a crisis. We \ndidn't want to be there. Education changed, parents changed, and \nteachers changed. We began inventing. We not only solved the problem of \nspace, we sent a man to the Moon. We have sent vehicles to Mars and \nother planets. That was the rocket generation.\n  Then we went to the computer generation. We have people with \nextraordinary minds, because of the freedom we have in the United \nStates, who came up with great inventions for computers. I remember \nwhen they said that 640K would be the maximum memory you could ever use \nin a computer. Nobody even knows what that is anymore, it is so small.\n  Then we went to communications, and we said there ought to be better \nways to communicate. Then we began the cell phone generation.\n  Now we are in the energy generation. There are young people out there \nwho can invent clean ways to do what we need to do, who can change \nthings that we never considered to be energy. I have a lot of faith in \nthem. I have challenged them. I do the inventors conference every \nwinter in Wyoming, and I have asked the young people to come up with \ninventions--and they don't have to be difficult, but they should \npertain to a pertinent problem so they can be marketed. We got more \nthan 250 inventions as a result of it.\n  Now I am pressing for energy inventions. We have not built a new \nrefinery in the United States for 40 years. Part of it is the \npermitting process and part is a fear of lawsuits. We permitted a new \nrefinery in Douglas, WY. It will turn out diesel fuel. That is one of \nthe biggest needs we have in our country, because of how much we rely \non trucking in the United States, including trucking to be able to mine \nthe coal.\n  By producing American energy, we reduce our Nation's dependence upon \nforeign oil sources and, at the same time, we work to develop new \ntechnologies that will make it so we don't need oil in the future. We \ncan safely produce more American energy off of the coasts of States \nthat want exploration to take place. We can produce nearly a million \nbarrels of American energy each day from the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, in an environmentally sensitive manner, from an area smaller \nthan Dulles Airport. In fact, it is smaller than the Casper, WY \nairport. A million barrels a day will bring down the price at least $20 \na barrel. We can improve the permitting process to allow some of the \nleases that the other side claims are not in production to be drilled \nby restricting the amount of times we let radical environmental groups \nfile frivolous lawsuits. They have to file all of their objections at \nthe same time, so they can be done consecutively instead of \nsequentially. Most of the original leases are by small investors. It \ncosts about $1,500 an acre. It is 5 or 6 years before they can even use \nthe lease. We hear all of these acres of leases that are not being \ndrilled, and it is because they are tied up in the courts. As soon as \nthey can be drilled, they are. There is a tremendous investment. They \ndon't know if they are going to hit oil, but the cost of a well now is \nabout $8 million.\n  Instead of relying on oil from Hugo Chavez, in Venezuela, or other \nnations that wish us harm, instead of playing the blame game, we can do \nsomething to bring down the price of gas. That is what my constituents \nare begging us to do.\n  Unfortunately, we are not having a real debate on the bill. The \nSenate is oftentimes called the most deliberative body in the world. \nYet we are not allowed to debate the issue that is most important to \nthe American people. Why, you might ask? The majority leader has used a \nprocedural tactic to prohibit us from offering amendments. He has used \na procedural tactic to prevent votes on amendments. No votes, just a \nspeculation bill, bills that haven't gone through committee. He has \nprevented a vote on amendments I have cosponsored to produce more \nAmerican energy. He prevented a vote on my amendments to make the \nspeculation bill more reasonable. He is preventing a vote on an \namendment of which I am a cosponsor that would encourage production of \ndiesel and jet fuel from America's most abundant energy source--coal.\n\n  It is the wrong way to legislate and will not help you when you go to \nfill your gas tank. It will not help you when you get your electricity \nbill, your heating bill this winter.\n  What we need is legislation that encourages us to find more American \nenergy as we use less. I am the cosponsor of legislation to do that. \nThe Gas Price Reduction Act, which is cosponsored by 43 of my \nRepublican colleagues, includes a provision to open coastal waters in \nStates where they want energy production. It ends the ban on the \ndevelopment of promising oil shale in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, oil \nshale that can provide as much as 2 trillion barrels of oil. At the \nsame time, the Gas Price Reduction Act encourages increases in the \nsupply of American energy, it promotes the development of better \ntechnology so we use less energy.\n  Thus far, we haven't had a vote on those issues. We have been told by \nthe majority leader we can have limited amendments with limits as to \nhow those amendments can be debated. That is not right, and it needs to \nstop. If it doesn't, we will not address this issue and the American \npeople will continue to suffer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we finished a fourth vote on the tax \nextenders bill. As the great baseball philosopher, Yogi Berra, said: \n``It's deja vu all over again.''\n  Here we are getting ready to vote and just finishing a vote for the \nfourth time on the motion to proceed to the House tax extenders bill. \nAs I said, it is deja vu all over again and yet again.\n  The vote, I believe, was 51 to 43, so very short of what it takes to \nget business done in the Senate, which is to work a bipartisan \nagreement so we have more than 60 votes to get business done. This is a \nno-brainer, in this particular instance, to get an extenders bill and \nthe AMT.\n  The futility of this exercise, which is motivated purely by partisan \npolitics, makes this vote as silly as a ``Three Stooges'' episode. \nInstead of wasting time on such a silly exercise, the Senate Democratic \nleadership should be working on negotiating a bipartisan deal with \nSenate Republicans that can be signed into law by the President. The \nAmerican people do not want another futile vote on tax extenders.\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\nThey want a bill that will be signed into law. That would provide the \nAmerican people with the tax relief that is needed.\n  The extenders vote we had has already failed before. Albert Einstein \nfamously stated the definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same thing \nover and over and expecting different results. The Senate Democratic \nleadership has already done the same thing too many times and, of \ncourse, today sought to do it again. This is a waste of everyone's \ntime. Everyone can see through the Democratic leadership's strategy for \nwhat it is: a partisan political exercise, designed solely to get 30-\nsecond sound bites for political ads.\n  Let's stop this nonsense. Let's work out a bipartisan compromise on \nthe tax extenders bill. Let's reach agreement in a form that can be \nsigned into law by the President. The President made it very clear \ntoday that he is not willing to sign what we had before us a few \nminutes ago into law. Of course, what I am asking is that the Senate \nRepublican leadership has been trying to urge the Senate majority to \nmove in this direction.\n  The Senate Republican leadership has made numerous offers to the \nSenate Democratic leadership to try to find a way to break the logjam \non tax extenders. So far, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave been unwilling to enter into a bipartisan agreement on a tax \nextenders bill that even attempts to address legitimate concerns of the \nminority party in this body.\n  As the Senate Democratic leadership engages in pure partisan politics \nby bringing up the tax extenders bill for yet another vote, the \nchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is probably \ngrinning like a Cheshire cat, thinking of all the 30-second campaign \nads they will be able to make. However, the people of New York are not \ngrinning because they are not getting the benefit of any of these tax \nrelief provisions. All the tax relief provisions that are very \nimportant to the American people, including even to the people of New \nYork, are being held hostage as part of the political game of the \nDemocratic Senate leadership having vote after vote on cloture to stop \ndebate for whatever reason.\n  Some of these important tax relief provisions are the alternative \nminimum tax patch, the deduction for the State and local sales tax, the \ndeduction of tuition expenses, and the deduction for expenses of school \nteachers. How is anybody going to find fault with the fact that these \nprovisions should have been done a long time ago? In fact, the AMT \npatch should have been done because, since the first of the year, \ntaxpayers who have had to file quarterly tax payments have been \nviolating the law if they haven't taken into consideration that there \nare 24 million American families right now hit by the alternative \nminimum tax. That figure would include 3.1 million New York families. \nThe provision for the State and local sales tax would help almost 11 \nmillion families. Also, the deduction for expenses for tuition and fees \nwould help over 4.6 million families. In addition, the deduction for \nexpenses of school teachers would help 3.4 million Americans. These \nhard-working taxpayers are more important than a 30-second sound bite \nto be used in the next campaign because of political games that are \nbeing played.\n  The bottom line is, when we have 24 million people being hit by AMT, \n4.6 million people on the deduction of college expenses, and 3.4 \nmillion people hit by increased taxes because school teachers will not \nbe able to deduct supplies from their income taxes, real Americans are \nbeing hurt while political games are being played, when everybody in \nthis body knows the only way we get things done is in a bipartisan way.\n  The biggest divide between Republicans and Democrats regarding tax \nextenders relates to the issue of offsets, also known as revenue \nraisers, or I think we ought to be more intellectually honest and call \nthese tax increases. In other words, tax increases on Americans \ngenerally to provide the extension of some policy that has been on the \nbooks for decades.\n  My party's position has been clear on this issue. We are perfectly \nwilling to use offsets that make sense from a tax policy perspective to \npay for new tax policy. However, tax relief provided by extending \nexisting tax policy or expiring provisions, or somebody may call these \nsunset provisions, we do not feel they should have to be offset. We \nshould not be raising taxes in order to pay for the extension of \nexisting tax policy.\n  One reason I care about this issue is that there is currently a bias \nin favor of using this as an excuse to bring in more money to increase \nthe size of Government. The pay-as-you-go rules apply to expiring tax \nprovisions which are not built into the revenue base. On the other \nhand, if you have sunset of appropriations, these are built into the \nspending baseline. Therefore, in order to extend expiring tax \nprovisions, the pay-go rules require an offset, and that happens to be \na big tax increase. Whereas, if you have extensions of expiring \nappropriations provisions--in other words, spending provisions--they do \nnot need to be paid for by decreased spending in other areas because \nthey are assumed in the spending baseline. Therefore, pay-as-you-go \nrules apply to the extension of expiring tax provisions, but in an \nintellectually, inconsistent way do not apply to the extension of \nexpiring spending provisions.\n  This inconsistent treatment makes no sense--\nintellectually inconsistent; I say to the taxpayers of America, \nintellectually dishonest. It is biased to create ever larger \nGovernment. The money the American people earn, after all, is their \nmoney. We should only take the money from them that it truly takes to \nrun the Government. We should not be using sunset tax provisions as an \nexcuse to increase taxes, and that is all it is.\n\n  In addition, the Democrats' desire to use permanent offsets to pay \nfor an extension of temporary tax provisions is extremely problematic. \nIt creates a situation where the permanent offsets that can be agreed \nto on a bipartisan basis--in other words, the low-hanging fruit all \ngets used to pay for the extension of temporary tax provisions.\n  Under the Democrats' tax side only, pay-go obsession, once all the \nlow-hanging fruit is used--and we are rapidly approaching that point--\nthen the choice becomes much uglier for them and much uglier for the \nAmerican taxpayers. The choice becomes whether to extend existing tax \npolicy that has broad support by increasing taxes in areas that will \nhurt Americans.\n  Nobody advocates the inconsistency of the pay-as-you-go rules more \nthan the famed House of Representatives Blue Dogs, and they are all \nDemocrats. The Blue Dogs portray themselves as fiscal conservatives. We \nagree with the Blue Dogs' goals of fiscal responsibility. They will \nhave allies all over my side of the aisle if they want to control \nspending. The problem is the Blue Dogs are pursuing the same old tax-\nand-spend game under the cloak of fiscal responsibility. The Blue Dogs \nwill fight tooth and paw over any tax relief that is not offset with a \ncorresponding tax increase.\n  However, the same self-described fiscally conservative Blue Dogs are \nnot willing to fight tooth and paw to seek the same equality for the \ntaxpayers on the spending side of the ledger. They have a big appetite \nfor spending. The Blue Dogs generally do not seek to offset spending \nincreases with spending cuts in other areas. But in taxes, it is a \nwhole different story. In fact, the Blue Dogs do not even seek to curb \nthe amount of spending increases for which they hunger.\n  By portraying themselves as fiscal conservatives, while in reality \nplaying the same old tax-and-spend game, the Blue Dogs remind me of the \nland shark character played by Chevy Chase on ``Saturday Night Live.'' \nThis was many years ago, so maybe some of you will not remember. But we \nhave a picture of the land shark skit with the theme from ``Jaws'' \nplaying in the background.\n  The land shark knocks on a person's door. With the door still closed, \nthe person would ask: Who is at the door?\n  The land shark would reply: Flower delivery.\n  The person answering the door then said: You are that clever shark, \naren't you?\n  And in response, the land shark said: Candygram.\n  If you don't know how the skit ended, the person eventually let the \nland shark in the door because that person believed the land shark when \nthe land shark said he was a dolphin. And, yes, the land shark ate that \nperson.\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\n  The moral of the land shark story is, don't let yourself be fooled \nthat the Blue Dogs are fiscal conservatives because they are pursuing \nthe same old tax-and-spend Washington game. Don't let the House of \nRepresentatives Blue Dogs' insatiable appetite for spending swallow the \nmuch-needed tax relief contained in the tax extenders.\n  I recommend that folks take a look at the cover story of the June 14, \n2008, edition of the National Journal magazine about the Blue Dogs. It \nis very enlightening.\n  In trying to reach a bipartisan agreement on tax extenders, my \nparty's leadership has made several offers to the other side's \nleadership. One of these offers is to pay for some new tax policy using \noffsets that make good tax policy sense. This is not simply a vague \npromise to look for such offsets. For instance, I have suggested we use \nthe offset that closes the loophole that allows hedge fund managers to \ndefer compensation for tax haven jurisdictions.\n  My time is up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  So we have offered something like closing a loophole that allows \nhedge fund managers to defer compensation in tax haven jurisdictions. \nHowever, we need to remove the huge charitable loophole that is \ncontained in both the Democratic House and Senate extenders bill.\n  Let me try to explain something that is not explainable. I would be \nembarrassed if I had this in one of my bills. This charitable loophole \nallows hedge fund managers to deduct 100 percent of their deferred \ncompensation that is donated to charity. In contrast, the ordinary \nAmerican is only permitted to deduct charitable contributions of up to \n50 percent of his or her income for that year. Everyone is obviously in \nfavor of charity, but treating wealthy hedge fund managers better than \nthe average American taxpayer makes no sense from a tax policy \nstandpoint.\n  Also, the Senate Republican leadership suggested that some of the \nother new tax policy could be paid for by decreasing the scheduled \nincrease in new spending, but that was not taken into consideration, \neven considering the fact that the present budget authorizes an \nincrease greater than $350 billion over the next 10 years, and none of \nthat is offset.\n  This extra $350 billion is like an extra checkbook that Congress is \ncarrying around in addition to its already fat checkbook. This \ncheckbook covers nondiscretionary spending and current levels of \ndiscretionary spending. We simply asked that they take a few checks out \nof this extra checkbook--not all of it, just a small part of it--to pay \nfor some of these needed tax relief provisions. However, this \nsuggestion was summarily dismissed.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are unwilling to even \nconsider decreasing their increased nondefense discretionary spending \nthat is above the President's budget. If the Blue Dogs of the other \nbody are fiscal conservatives, they should come out and say they are \nwilling to decrease this increase in the new extra nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. Instead, the Blue Dogs' position has been that \nall of the tax relief provided in the tax extenders package, even the \nextension of the existing tax policy, must be offset by an equal amount \nof tax increases on every other American. Why not look at curbing this \nnew excess spending to pay for part of the much needed tax relief? So \nlet us get back to square one. I invite my Blue Dog friends who claim \nto be fiscal conservatives to answer that question.\n  Back to where we started today--back to Yogi Berra. He also said: \n``It ain't over 'til it's over.'' This extenders vote failed because \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have refused to negotiate \ntoward a bipartisan bill that can be signed into law. Because of the \nSenate Democratic leadership's doomed plan, this extenders discussion \n``ain't over 'til it's over.'' Let's get this over with. Let's \nnegotiate toward a bipartisan agreement that can become law so the \nAmerican people will benefit. So far, the Senate Democratic leadership \nhas not done that. For that reason alone, people did vote ``no'' on \ncloture, as they previously had.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Ohio \nfor allowing me the additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our half-hour \nbe divided equally, with the first 15 minutes for myself, and Senator \nNelson of Florida the other 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                        Doha Round of WTO Talks\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Doha Round of World Trade \nOrganization--the WTO--talks broke down yesterday. Given the tremendous \nproblem with this Nation's trade policy, I don't know of many Ohioans \nwho are going to be very upset, and I don't know of many of my \ncolleagues who will be too troubled about World Trade Organization \ntrade talks breaking down either.\n  The impasse at the WTO is no different from the pause we are in right \nnow when it comes to trade. Americans are rightly skeptical about the \ncourse we are on when it comes to trade policy, and Congress reflects \nthat skepticism. In the 2006 elections, voters all across the country \ntold those of us in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, that \nthey wanted a timeout on trade; that they wanted to see us go back and \nlook at the success and failures of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement--so-called CAFTA \nand NAFTA--and they want us to look at what PNTR--Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations--with China has meant. They want us to look at \nColombia, and Peru, and Panama, and South Korea, and what those \nagreements might mean to our country.\n  It is pretty clear that Americans are not satisfied with the status \nquo of NAFTA, CAFTA, and WTO-modeled policies. One reason is our \nseverely unbalanced trade relationship with the People's Republic of \nChina. When it comes to competing with China, Ohio workers and \nmanufacturers are playing with one hand tied behind their back. We \nshouldn't be playing under these rules.\n  Athletes at next week's Olympics will not be playing by these rules. \nMaybe there is a lesson there for the Chinese Government, for the \nUnited States Government, and for our trade policy. Workers, like \nathletes, can compete with anyone--good athletes and certainly American \nworkers can compete with anyone where there is a level playing field \nand the rules are not rigged. But manufacturers and workers in Ohio are \nstruggling to compete while our Government too often stands idly by \nwhile China games the system over and over and over.\n  This problem is urgent, as a new report from the Economic Policy \nInstitute shows. This report finds that the United States is \nhemorrhaging manufacturing jobs at an alarming pace. Nothing new there. \nMore than 366,000 jobs were lost last year alone because of our trade \ndeficit with China--366,000 jobs in 1 year because of our trade \nrelationship with one country. In all, EPI counts 2.3 million jobs lost \nto the China trade deficit since China joined the World Trade \nOrganization less than a decade ago.\n  Unless China raises the real value of its currency--the yuan--by at \nleast an additional 30 percent, and lets it float on the international \ncurrency exchanges, as most countries do, the United States trade \ndeficit and job losses will continue to grow.\n  Labor rights are also a factor. The AFL-CIO estimates that repression \nof labor rights by the Chinese Government has lowered manufacturing \nrates by as much as 80 percent. To put it in perspective, my office \nreceives at least two or three TAA certifications a week--trade \nadjustments from the Trade Adjustment Act on workers losing their jobs \nbecause of international trade. We receive from the Labor Department at \nleast two or three TAA certifications a week for Ohio manufacturers. \nEach of these certifications represents, in most cases, hundreds of \nworkers and their families.\n  What happens to a community when there is job loss? Think about a \ncommunity. I was speaking to a gentleman from Tiffin in the last hour. \nThink about the town of Tiffin, or Chillicothe or Wilmington or Finley \nor Mansfield--towns of 15,000, 20,000, 30,000, or 50,000 people. When \nthey lose a plant, a manufacturing installation--or what is\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nhappening with DHL in Wilmington, which is way beyond that--even if \nthey lose a plant with 300 or 400 workers, think about what it does, \nnot just to a worker and his or her family, but what it does to the \ncommunity at large, with the layoffs of police officers and teachers \nand firefighters, because there are significantly fewer jobs in a \ncommunity of that size.\n  Last week, it was Ceva Logistics in Miamisburg that we got a TAA \ncertification about--near Dayton; Acuity Lighting in Newark, and more \nDelphi workers. The same old story with Delphi and what has happened in \nthe last year in Moraine, OH--again, near Dayton.\n  Yesterday, we got a TAA notice about Acklin Stamping Company in \nToledo. The Labor Department certified that an increase in imports \ncaused Acklin to lay off workers.\n\n  That was last week and yesterday. But how about today and how about \ntomorrow? Probably more TAA notices, because we get two or three almost \nevery week. Probably more today, tomorrow, and next week, again because \nof a failed trade policy.\n  On my desk, I have a stack of auction notices from small tool and die \nmanufacturers going out of business in my State and across the country. \nThese notices are going-out-of-business sales. They are notices \noffering the sale of equipment from machine shops not just in my State \nbut all over the country.\n  This week, I spoke with the CEO and the family owners of Norwalk \nFurniture in Norwalk, OH, a community between Cleveland and Toledo. We \nare trying to keep this 105-year-old company in business. Norwalk \nworkers are represented by the Teamsters and United Steelworkers. It is \na company playing by the rules, paying good wages in a small town in \nOhio, with good benefits, trying to stay competitive despite having the \ndeck stacked against it because of our trade policy with China.\n  Again, American companies are playing with one hand tied behind their \nback. China's undervalued currency and weak safety and environmental \nstandards put American furniture manufacturers such as Norwalk at a \nhuge disadvantage. Like many Ohio businesses, Norwalk Furniture can \ncompete with China. It can and has competed with foreign competition. \nThat is not the complaint. The reason manufacturers such as Norwalk \nFurniture are struggling and pleading for a change in trade policy is \nthat they can't compete while the U.S. Government--the Bush Commerce \nDepartment, the Bush U.S. Trade Representative--stands by and allows \nChina to game the system.\n  We see what these plant closings do to communities, which is why not \nonly Norwalk Furniture is fighting back, but Mayor Lesch and others in \nNorwalk are joining them in this struggle. The trade deficit with China \ncosts manufacturing jobs, and not just low-skilled jobs, as is commonly \nthought.\n  One very salient point from the EPI report is that it is not only \napparel jobs we are talking about, and not only relatively low-wage \njobs. We are getting into high-tech products, many integral to our \ndefense industrial base. The report finds that more than a quarter of \nlast year's record trade deficit with China was due to advanced \ntechnology products.\n  Last year, a $68 billion deficit in advanced technology products was \nresponsible for more than 25 percent of the total United States-China \ntrade deficit. Since 2001, the flood of advanced technology imports \nfrom China eliminated 561,000 United States jobs in computer and \nelectronic products. So we are not just talking about textile and \napparel jobs.\n  EPI also counts more than $8,000 in lost income for displaced \nworkers. People who support U.S. trade policy--President Bush, Vice \nPresident Cheney, the Republican leadership in this body--say: Well, \nyes, prices are low as a result of U.S. trade policy, but when \ncompanies such as shoe manufacturers move out of the United States or a \nsteel manufacturer moves out of the United States, I don't see steel or \nshoe prices dropping necessarily. So I don't know if that argument \nholds water.\n  Even if you concede it might affect prices some, EPI counts more than \n$8,000 in lost income per displaced worker. So what does that mean? It \nmeans someone working at American Standard in Tiffin, OH, or someone at \nthe old Westinghouse plant in Mansfield, where I grew up, or a GM \nworker in Dayton or a DHL worker or ABX or ASTAR in Wilmington, when \nthey lose a good-paying job making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, or \n$60,000 a year, the next job they have on the average makes $8,000--if \nthey can find a job--makes $8,000 less than they were used to making. \nAnd lower prices don't give you much of a break when you have a new job \nat $8,000 less than your old job.\n  Proponents of China PNTR or NAFTA like to say that the jobs displaced \nfrom China are replaced with export-oriented jobs that pay better, or \njobs in the service sector that pay better. Again, not true. The truth \nis that wages earned in United States export heavy industry paid 4 \npercent less than the jobs displaced by Chinese imports. So when we \nlose these jobs to Chinese imports, it is costing our workers that \n$8,000 we were talking about. Even if we are exporting some to China, \nthe amount we are exporting to China versus the amount we are bringing \nin obviously is a huge chasm. It is the better paying jobs that are \nmoving offshore or closing because of a flood of Chinese imports.\n  The failure of the WTO talks could, in fact, be a blessing. The DOHA \ntalks long ago became more of a threat than an opportunity to American \nfarmers and to American workers and long ago represented more of a \nthreat than an opportunity for sustainable development abroad for our \ntrading partners.\n  We have an opportunity now, because of the failure of DOHA, to step \naway, to evaluate what is working and what is not working and start \nagain with a new trade model--for New Jersey, the State of the \nPresiding Officer, and for my State. I have introduced legislation, S. \n3083, the TRADE Act, which evaluates our Trade Agreements Program, \nwhich allows for renegotiation and which sets forth principles for \nfuture trade deals.\n  In my State, in the last year and a half, I have held about 110 \nroundtables in 75 of Ohio's 88 counties where I gather a group of 20 or \n25 people, a cross-section of the community, and listen to them talk \nabout their hopes and dreams and what they wish and hope for in their \ncommunity and what they are fighting for, for their families and their \ncommunities. Few issues in these roundtables get workers and \nbusinesses, Democrats and Republicans--and I don't know people's party \naffiliations at these roundtables--few issues get them as worked up as \nour unfair trading relationship with China in deals such as NAFTA and \nCAFTA that protect Wall Street investors but don't protect labor, don't \nprotect safety, don't protect the environment.\n  We have an opportunity, in the coming months and especially next year \nwith the new President, to renew a consensus on trade. I look forward \nto working in my caucus and across the aisle on a better approach to \ntrade policy for our workers, for their families, for our communities, \nand for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday was the 50th \nanniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I \nwant to recall that after the space shuttle Challenger went down 22 \nyears ago, in a Nation that was shocked because the very symbol of \ntechnological prowess had exploded in front of our own eyes on our \ntelevision screens, the President addressed a mourning Nation and noted \nthat even out of that tragedy, we have grown accustomed to wonders in \nthis country. He observed that we had been so accustomed to all of that \ntechnological achievement, it was almost as if it was a Sunday \nafternoon drive in the car. As President Reagan said, it is hard to \ndazzle us. But America's space program has been doing exactly that. Now \nfor 50 years it has been dazzling us, even in times of loss and even in \ntimes of tragedy.\n  Fifty years ago, it was President Eisenhower who signed the National \nAeronautics and Space Act and created\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nNASA. Fifty years ago, in 1958--remember the context of history. The \nSoviets suddenly took the high ground. The Soviets shocked us because \nthey put the first satellite, sputnik, in orbit. Here, time after time, \nwith the old Navy Vanguard rocket, it would explode on the pad. It was \nnot until the President went to a group of Germans--who were here \nbecause we, the United States, had gotten to Peenemunde, Germany, \nbefore the Soviets did and got about two-thirds of those German rocket \nscientists, headed by Wernher von Braun. So years later, the President \ngoes to Wernher von Braun, as America's prestige was on the line \nbecause we couldn't get a rocket off the pad, and Wernher von Braun \nsaid: Give me 6 months. With the Army Redstone rocket, he put up \nAmerica's first satellite--Explorer. It was in that historical context \nthat the Congress wrote this new act that set up NASA.\n  Then, after we had been beaten in space by the Soviets with the first \nsatellite, we were beaten in space by the first human in orbit. As a \nmatter of fact, we didn't even have a rocket that had enough lift \ncapability to get the Mercury capsule into orbit because it was that \nsame Redstone rocket that we put the Mercury capsule on for Alan \nShepard to go into suborbit. It was in that context that President \nKennedy, after we had been shocked again with the Soviets putting up \nGagarin for one orbit and then a few weeks later we put up Alan Shepard \nonly into suborbit, it was at that point that the President, who is the \nonly one who can lead America's space program--that President, in 1961, \nPresident John F. Kennedy, set the goal. He gave the vision. He said we \nare going to the Moon and back in 9 years, before the end of the \ndecade. It was a bold challenge. He did that in front of a joint \nsession of Congress: Send a human to another celestial body. Here we \nhad not even gotten into orbit with John Glenn.\n  It was 10 months later, on an Atlas rocket--which was an ICBM. It was \nnot rated for humans. We knew it had a 20-percent chance of failure \nwhen John Glenn climbed into that Mercury capsule, and then we were off \non that space race. The skeptics did not think it could be done. They \ncertainly didn't think we could go to the Moon. But NASA's Mercury, \nGemini, and Apollo missions were all designed because of that bold \nstroke of leadership and that vision of a young President.\n  Nine years later, on July 20, 1969, the President's dream became a \nreality when Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. Who can ever forget those \nimmortal words: Houston, the Eagle has landed. And who can ever forget \nthose words as the commander of that mission, Neil Armstrong, climbed \ndown the ladder of those spindly spider legs of the Apollo Lander, when \nhe said: That is a small step for man, but that is a giant leap for \nmankind.\n  Since then, we have flown the shuttles, we have built the space \nstation, we have explored Jupiter and Mars, and we have had Rovers all \nover Mars. Indeed, it looks as if there was water on Mars. As we \ncontinue to explore the heavens, if there was water--and when we \neventually get there with humans--with water, was there life? If there \nwas life, how developed was it? If it was developed, was it civilized? \nAnd if that life was civilized, what happened? What can we learn as we \nexplore the heavens in order to be better stewards of our planet, \nprotecting our planet and this civilization that is on this home called \nplanet Earth?\n  I am quite excited, as America celebrates NASA's 50 years of history, \nthat we are now preparing to chart a new course into the cosmos. I am \nexcited about the wonders that await us. There is hope for space \nsettlements and perhaps that discovery of life elsewhere in the \nuniverse. It is going to be a page-1 story when suddenly there is some \nkind of transmission that we intercept that indicates there is \nintelligent life elsewhere in the universe.\n  Mr. President, you and I--our human minds cannot conceive the \nenormousness of the universe. When we look at the size of our solar \nsystem around the Sun and we understand that there are billions of \nother solar systems just in our galaxy and then try to comprehend that \nthere are billions of other galaxies--can you imagine that in a far-\ndistant galaxy, there is another star, similar to our Sun, with planets \nrotating around it, that has created the climatological conditions that \nhave brought forth the life here on this planet? Given the infinite \nexpanse of the universe--it is going to be quite interesting when we \nhave some discovery of an intelligent message from somewhere else in \nthe universe. This is the excitement of the future.\n  As we look back on the accomplishments of 50 years of NASA, we can \nlook with great pride, but excitement, to the future. This is the \npromise of a new President of the United States making a bold \ndeclaration of our understanding and exploration of the heavens.\n  As President Kennedy promised all those years ago, science and \neducation have been greatly enriched by the new knowledge of our \nuniverse and of our environment. Life here on Earth has improved by \nleaps and bounds from the spinoffs of the space technology--the space \ntools, the computers, the miniaturization--all of this which has been \nadapted to our daily lifestyles and to industry and to medicine and to \nour individual homes. America's space effort has created scores of new \nhigh-tech companies and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Simply put, we \nall reap the harvest of gains from our exploration of space. That is \nwhy now, at this watershed point of where NASA is going in the future, \nthat is why we cannot cede our leadership in space or waiver in our \nsupport for our space program.\n  There is another reason we undertake the risk and invest in space \nexploration.\n  It is not the pure science, it is not the technology spinoffs, it is \nnot the high-tech workforce, or it is not that we want to extend human \ncivilization beyond our planet. We do it because it is in our character \nand our nature as a people. We are, as Americans, explorers by nature.\n  In the past, we always have had a frontier. As this Nation developed, \nit was a westward-expanding frontier. Now that expansion is upward. It \nhas been said that there are two fundamental differences between humans \nand other species. As humans, we have souls. As humans, we are curious. \nIt has also been said that the exploration of space is a testament to \nthese differences. Curiosity, which is unique to humans, drives us to \nexplore, and our soul gives us meaning to this endeavor.\n  As we celebrate 50 years of NASA's history, let us continue to be a \nbit overwhelmed. Let us be dazzled again. That concludes my comments on \nNASA. I have some other comments on a different subject unless we are \nin some restriction here on the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. When one of our colleagues comes to the floor, \nI am told that I can continue until that time.\n\n\n                              Samuel Snow\n\n  I want to share with the Senate the tragedy of a fellow named Samuel \nSnow, Samuel Snow, 84 years old, African American. The time is 1944 and \nhe is part of the U.S. forces in a military installation in Seattle, \nWA. It is an installation where there were Italian prisoners of war. \nSomehow a riot breaks out, and in the course of this riot in the \nprisoner of war camp, one of these Italian prisoners of war is lynched, \nand the African-American U.S. soldiers are charged. They are summarily \ndismissed. They are put in jail. For a year, Samuel Snow was put in \njail. He was then dishonorably discharged, all the time maintaining his \ninnocence.\n  As he was discharged dishonorably, he went back to his hometown of \nLeesburg, FL. The only work he could get was that of janitor. Yet he \nwas so respected in his neighborhood he became the neighborhood \nhandyman. He married his high school sweetheart. They had children. He \nraised that family.\n  In 2005, a journalist in Seattle, WA, an investigative journalist, \ndug into this situation and found that Sam Snow had been railroaded and \nshowed he was innocent. Now, you can imagine all of those years after \nthat.\n  Then the Army, the U.S. Army, to its embarrassment, decides it is \ngoing to reverse the dishonorable discharge and give him an honorable \ndischarge. And oh, by the way, out of their generosity of heart, they \ndecide they are going to pay him his annual wage for the year he spent \nin the military prison, so they are going to cut him a check of $725.\n  Well, when this Senator found out about that happening to a \nFloridian,\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\nthis Senator about went into orbit again, and, of course, not only \nwriting to the Pentagon but having direct talks with the Secretary of \nthe Army in front of our committee, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of \nthem came back and said: Well, the law is that we cannot pay any more. \nWe cannot pay even what we were asking for.\n  At least give him the cost-of-living adjustment for those 60 years of \nhis military pay that he was denied. They say: No, we cannot do it. The \nlaw does not allow it.\n  Well, we put it in the Defense authorization bill. It is before the \nSenate. And as soon as the Senate will finally take up the Defense \nauthorization bill, we will pass it out of here. It is already in the \nversion of the House that has passed the House. It will become law.\n  But let me tell you the sad ending to this story. Last Saturday, Sam \nSnow and his son Ray traveled to Seattle for the ceremony conducted by \nthe U.S. Army to give him his papers for his honorable discharge. He \nbecame ill in Seattle before the ceremony. His son went in his place. \nHis son received the honorable discharge, brought it back to his dad, \nand with a big smile on his dad's face, his son read him the honorable \ndischarge from an incident, a terrible mark upon the U.S. Army that had \noccurred 60 years before.\n  I am sad to tell you that 3 hours later, Sam Snow passed away to go \non to be with his Maker. He is still owed that back pay, and he is owed \nmore than some $725. This Senator, when we pass that Defense \nauthorization bill, is looking forward to the day that that sum, \nadjusted, will go to his grieving family.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Clean Boating Act of 2008\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, until another Senator has come \nto the floor to seek recognition, I have another subject I have been \nwaiting patiently to speak on, and we have been so busy on the floor \nthat I have not had a chance to speak on it.\n  This is another good news story. We have finally passed, by the \nSenate working together across the aisle, bipartisan, we have passed a \nbill, we have passed legislation, and it is anticipated that it will be \nsigned shortly by the President into law, averting a total disaster \nwhere the Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to a judge's \ndecision in Federal court on the west coast of the United States, the \nEPA was going to require a permit of every little recreational boat \nowner for any kind of runoff from that boat, whether it be in washing \ndown the deck, whether it be the bilge water, whether it be water \ncoming out of an outboard motor, whether it be trying to scoop out the \nwater filling up in a little motorboat. Whatever it is, they were going \nto require, for the 23 million recreational boat owners, 2 million of \nwhich are in my State of Florida, they were going to require going to \nthe EPA in order to get a permit.\n  By working it out on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan fashion, \nwe were able also to get a delay of an additional 24 months for \ncommercial vessels under 79 feet and all commercial fishing vessels \nregardless of size.\n  All of this came from the decision of a judge who was trying to \nprotect the interests of the United States. Because what happened is \nthese foreign vessels that come in with ballast water in order to weigh \ndown a vessel before it then comes to the United States and takes on \ncargo that weighs down the vessel would then dump this water that was \nthere for ballast in the waters of the United States. The problem was \nthey would take on water elsewhere in the world that was contaminated, \nand a certain kind of snail was one of these contaminants that would \nthen go into any kind of drain under the water and start to clog up the \ndrain. So there was clearly an environmental interest to be protected \nagainst all of these big commercial vessels bringing in this foreign \nballast water that was contaminating our waters.\n  But the fact is, the court's ruling became so expansive that it said \nin incidental runoff from little recreational boats, you are going to \nhave to get an EPA permit as well.\n  Fortunately, common sense prevailed and we have been able to overcome \nthat. We passed it in the House and the Senate. It is on its way to the \nWhite House. Presumably the President will sign this momentarily and it \nwill be law, averting this disaster that was about to occur in \nSeptember where all of these recreational boat owners and the \ncommercial small fishing vessels were going to have to get this EPA \npermit.\n  That is a commonsense story. It is also a good news story. I wanted \nto share that with the Senate. I thank the folks who have worked with \nme on this legislation, particularly the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee, Senator Boxer, and Senator Murkowski of Alaska, who helped \nwork with us with regard to the commercial fishing vessels that were 79 \nfeet and less. I am glad to bring this good news to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             9-1-1 Service\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to clear \nthe decks today with another speech I have been waiting to give. Since \none of our colleagues is not coming, I am going to take advantage of \nthis lull of the Senate and, since a Senator is walking in, I will make \nit short.\n  A tragedy occurred in Florida about 4 years ago, when a child in \nDeltona, FL, which is north of Orlando, started choking. The mom raced \nto the phone and dialed 9-1-1 and then she ran back to the child when \nshe could not get anyone to answer on 9-1-1 to help the child. But it \nwas to no avail. And what we found out was, in fact, this was a voice \nover the Internet telephone conversation and that, in fact, there was \nno emergency 9-1-1. So for the last 3 or 4 years, some of us have been \ntrying to make sure there is a mandate for 9-1-1 service on a telephone \nthat happened to be transmitted over the Internet instead of over the \nnormal telephonic wires. Happily, I can say to the Senate we worked \nthat legislation out. It was comprehensive. We worked out the \ndifferences between the House and Senate. On another happy occasion, \nthe President invited a bunch of us to come down for a signing \nceremony. I'm happy to say that in the future, when anybody runs to a \ntelephone to dial 9-1-1, it is not going to be the technical difference \nof that phone. They are going to know it is hooked up to emergency \nservices. That is my good news story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Rural Gas Crisis\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nfilling in for me while I was caught up in a radio interview.\n  We are here today to talk about a real crisis, a rural America \ncrisis. Rural America is suffering a gas price crisis. Rural America \ndeserves action now to get gas prices down. Rural America knows this \nfundamentally is a problem of not enough supply to meet demand. We need \nto find more oil and use less to bring the real gas price relief rural \nAmerica needs. Families, farmers, truckers across rural Missouri, my \nhome State, are suffering record pain at the pump. At kitchen tables in \nthe farmhouses of rural Missouri, farmers, dairy producers, and \ncattlemen are facing a gas price crisis. Farm costs are higher than \never. Farm fuel to run tractors and farm equipment is at record levels. \nTransportation costs to get goods to the market are at a record level. \nThe ability of consumers to buy products is under record pressure. \nPeople are seeing higher food prices because food has to travel. The \naverage item on the grocery shelf travels 1,300 miles. Record-high\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\ndiesel prices are adding to the price of food goods in the store.\n  All this means real suffering for rural Missouri and its farmers. \nDown country roads of rural Missouri, rural families are facing a gas \nprice crisis. They have to cut budgets hit hard by high gas prices. \nMany of these families live in rural areas because they are of modest \nmeans. Maybe they are looking for cheaper housing than offered in big \ncities. Maybe they are fixed-income retirees staying in their own \nhometowns. Either way, when it comes time to cut the family budget, the \ncuts will go extra deep.\n  What will these rural families cut because of higher gas prices? With \nthe school year coming, they have to get the kids to school. Will a \nrural family give up buying new clothes for their kids? Will struggling \nfixed-income seniors cancel doctors appointments or cut back on \nmedication?\n  Truckers across Missouri are facing a gas price crisis. Many trucking \nfirms are based in rural areas, where land and fuel were cheaper, but \nrecord diesel prices are hammering truckers and trucking companies. \nMom-and-pop trucking firms are laying off drivers. Some are even going \ninto bankruptcy. Many rural families and workers also depend on \nairlines for service and jobs. Airlines are facing record-high jet fuel \nprices. That is forcing airlines to lay off workers and cut back \nservice. Many of the blue-collar workers who moved back to maintain \nplanes and service airports are being affected.\n  American Airlines, for example, is set to eliminate some 6,500 jobs \nbecause of record-high oil prices. Airlines also cut low-volume routes \nto rural areas first. Airlines are trying to manage rising fuel costs \nby using the financial markets to hedge against risk. But their experts \ntell me the main problem is a fear that there will not be a supply \nthere in the future. They say if the U.S. Government would take steps \nto increase supply, it would bring about a huge change in the market \nand bring prices down immediately. Why? Because the current price being \npaid on the hedging market for oil to be delivered in 3 years depends \nupon their expectation of what the demand and supply will be in the \nyears ahead. Right now there is every reason to think that if we do \nnothing, if we are prevented from getting a gas price reduction bill \nthat provides more and allows us to use less through this Senate, the \nprice will not be just $140 a barrel. The price will not just be $185. \nIt will be $200 or $250. So people's retirement plans, such as CalPERS, \nCalifornia Public Employees Retirement System, are bidding up the price \nin the future because they don't expect supply to go up. Bringing that \nprice down will make a difference. It will make a difference in the \nprice of oil today, just as President Bush's ending of the Executive \nmoratorium on offshore drilling brought the price down from $145 to \n$120.\n  Bringing the price down could make a real difference between keeping \njobs and service in rural America and letting go thousands of workers. \nThe suffering of rural Missouri families, farmers, and truckers is why \nwe are fighting so hard to lower gas prices. We are fighting to open \nnew supplies of oil needed to get prices down. Real action to lower gas \nprices is the most important thing we can do to help rural America and \nrural Missouri. Fighting for real action to lower gas prices is the \nmost important thing I could do to help rural Missouri. I have \namendments to force gas prices down by opening new offshore oil \nreserves waiting for us. I filed an amendment to lower gas prices by \nopening access to the 18 billion barrels of oil waiting for us off \nAmerica's Atlantic and Pacific coasts. These reserves could supply \nAmerica with 10 years of additional oil supplies, if we would only \nallow ourselves to use them to change a 30-year policy the Democrats \nhave imposed, that Senator Obama continues to champion, of no drilling, \nno refineries, no nuclear power. The decision to open our offshore oil \nreserves would immediately cause the price of oil to fall.\n  We know that because this happened earlier this month, when President \nBush reversed the Executive ban and brought the price of oil \nimmediately down $10 and, now, $20 a barrel. Nothing hurts speculators \nbidding up the price of oil more than news of additional oil supplies \ncoming in the future. Congress must do our part to lower gas prices \neven further by opening new offshore reserves. However, the Democratic \nParty is blocking the Senate from considering my amendment to tap \noffshore oil reserves, even as I speak. I also cosponsored an amendment \nwith several Senate colleagues to tap offshore oil reserves in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico. There are almost 3 billion barrels of oil in \nthe eastern gulf waiting to help bring gas prices down for rural \nMissouri. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership is also blocking \nconsideration of this amendment.\n  I also agree we must help America use less oil. I have an amendment \nthat would relieve the pressure on gas prices by increasing \nconservation. My amendment would aggressively promote advanced vehicle \nbatteries and their production in the United States for hybrid, plug-in \nhybrid, and electric vehicles. My amendment would provide new funds for \nhybrid battery research and development, battery manufacturing \nequipment and capabilities, and reequipping, expanding or establishing \nU.S. domestic manufacturing facilities for hybrid vehicle batteries. \nU.S. domestic mass production of hybrid batteries would get battery \nprices down, getting the hybrid vehicle prices down. But most \nimportantly, it would give our auto companies access to the batteries \nwe need. Right now many of the batteries have to be brought in from \nAsia. As the demand for more batteries goes up in Asia, I can assure my \ncolleagues that American auto companies will not necessarily be first \nin line to get that production. We need to put American workers to work \nbuilding the batteries, the advanced batteries that will go into the \nelectric cars, the plug-ins, and the hybrid plug-ins. This would not \nonly conserve oil. It would give jobs to blue-collar manufacturing \nworkers and help the environment. It is going to be good for Missouri \nwhen we do it. The question is when.\n  Missouri is a national leader in hybrid car production, in batteries, \nand advanced vehicle batteries. We make traditional batteries across \nthe State because we are the leader in lead. We mine a lot of lead in \nMissouri. When you are talking about environmental dangers, yes, lead \nhas some dangers to it. There is only one simple reason we mine lead in \nMissouri, and that is because we have 90 percent of it in the United \nStates. When people tell me they don't want to drill for natural gas \nbecause they don't like the sight of natural gas wells, but they have \nthe natural gas, I say: If you will trade us your natural gas for our \nlead, I would be happy to let them drill in my backyard.\n  But Missouri, with all the battery specialists, the technical workers \nwe have, the scientists, is on the cutting edge of battery technology, \nwith firms developing safer, stronger lithium ion batteries. We are \nalso home to a hybrid SUV assembly plant in Kansas City. This success \ndoes not have to be limited to Missouri. Communities across America can \nshare in the drive to establish a domestic manufacturing supply base \nfor mass hybrid car construction.\n  Rural communities, especially, can benefit from the good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs that U.S. mass battery production would provide. \nRural school districts would benefit from new tax revenues. Rural \npolice and firefighters would benefit. Unfortunately, as I said, \nDemocrats are blocking Senate consideration.\n  Now, what answers do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave for rural America? Well they propose making things worse by suing \noil-producing countries.\n  Folks back home in my part of rural Missouri may not know much about \nantitrust laws--most folks don't--but anyone with common sense would \nknow, if you sue someone, they would likely take what they have and \nsell it to somebody else.\n  I guess this was an idea cooked up by trial lawyers who are eager to \nsue anybody they can. As you might imagine, there are not too many \ntrial lawyers in rural Missouri.\n  Democrats also proposed raiding our emergency oil supplies in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. Putting aside the fact that these \nemergency reserves are only meant to be used in times supply is cut \noff, such as during a war, this plan would only produce 3\\1/2\\ days of \nadditional oil.\n  So while Republicans are offering rural America 10 years of \nadditional oil\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\nsupplies, Democrats think rural America should get by on only 3\\1/2\\ \ndays of extra supplies. This lack of sympathy for taking real action \nmay be based on the fact that a lot of Democrats are fine with higher \noil prices.\n  After all, the Democratic nominee for President, Senator Obama, said \nthe problem was not that gas prices were so high, the problem was \nmerely that gas prices had risen so quickly. That is akin to telling \npeople it is OK to drown as long as the water rises slowly.\n  Today, in Springfield, MO, the Democratic nominee suggested we all \nmake sure we properly inflate our tires. Big deal. I believe in all \ntires being fully inflated. But, frankly, that is the kind of hot air--\nthis hot air being into tires--that we have been hearing too much of on \nthis floor.\n  Rural Missouri is suffering record pain at the pump, and the best \nthing he can come up with is more hot air--this time for our tires. \nRural Missouri deserves more than the hot air from the Illinois \nSenator.\n  Senator McCain has come out very clearly and strongly in support of \ndrilling, of exploring, of developing nuclear power.\n  We tried last year. Congress passed the largest increase in auto fuel \nefficiency requirements in a generation to bring down gas usage. Well, \nthat did nothing to prevent record-high prices. That is because it will \ntake years before more fuel-efficient cars are required. The Democratic \ncandidate for President must want us to suffer through record-high gas \nprices until those conservation measures kick in.\n  I support increasing conservation, but we must not force a \nprescription of pain on America while we wait years for these \nconservation measures to kick in.\n  The Democratic candidate for President has suggested another stimulus \npackage to help drivers through this price crisis. I am sure Missouri \nrural families would be happy to receive a few hundred dollars more in \nstimulus relief. But what they want is not to get a check from the \nGovernment--after the handful of tanks of gasoline that money could buy \nis spent--they want to bring down the price. They will be right back \nwhere they are, paying the full price of record-high gas prices, and we \nwill do nothing but increase our deficit.\n  Rural Missouri and America deserve more than a prescription of pain \nto address the gas price crisis. We deserve more than half measures \nthat will only produce a few days or months more of additional \nsupplies. Rural Missouri deserves more than a Senate attempting to \nabandon them and this gas price crisis by moving on to other issues.\n  Rural Missouri and the people of America deserve real action now to \nlower gas prices. That means new offshore oil supplies to get prices \ndown, new offshore oil supplies for Missouri families, new offshore oil \nsupplies for Missouri farmers, and new offshore oil supplies for \nMissouri truckers. That is our only real hope for real gas price \nrelief.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to let us act on it and act now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                         Montana National Guard\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to begin by noting that, again, it \nis fire season in Montana.\n  Right now, major wildfires are threatening homes in a small town \ncalled Red Lodge. The Cascade fire has been burning and has burned \nabout 6,000 acres. It is burning uncomfortably close to the Red Lodge \nMountain ski area.\n  The hot, dry weather forecast over the next week means there are \nlikely to be more fires and more acres of rangeland and forest lost.\n  Fire season in Montana officially runs from August until the first \nsnow in fall. So, once again, we are off to an early start.\n  Wildfires are becoming a fact of the West. We accept it. We deal with \nit.\n  The good news is Montana is blessed with outstanding firefighters \nfrom the U.S. Forest Service, Tribal Nations, and the State Department \nof Natural Resources, as well as first responders from local volunteer \nand paid fire departments.\n  When they need reinforcements, they turn to the Montana National \nGuard. Last year, more than 200 guardsmen were mobilized to help fight \nwildfires in Montana. While no guardsmen have been mobilized yet this \nyear, it will happen at some point--just as they are mobilized every \nyear to protect people and homes, dig out fire lines, smother embers, \nand provide all manner of hands-on support to this team effort.\n  There are not too many jobs in this country where the work is as \nvaried as service in our National Guard. This summer we can expect that \nhundreds of National Guardsmen in Montana and throughout the West will \nbe mobilized to help fight wildfires. It has already happened in \nCalifornia, where the Governor called up 200 Guardsmen.\n  This is a vital role in our Nation's homeland security.\n  And just as the Guard answers the call for homeland security \nmissions, they answer the bell when it comes to national security.\n  In 2004 and 2005, more than 1,500 of my State's National Guard \ndeployed to Iraq. They did yeoman's work over there, and we can all be \nvery proud of their service and grateful for it as well. Today, there \nare nearly 23,000 National Guardsmen serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Another 3,000 Guardsmen from all over the country work hard to \nprotect our southern border, helping the Border Patrol get a better \nhandle on securing that border. Four hundred Montana Guardsmen were a \nproud part of that important effort earlier this year.\n  So as the National Guard in Montana prepares for the inevitable \nmobilization fight against wildfires here at home, I think it is \nappropriate we stop to thank the 3,500-strong members of our Montana \nNational Guard for what they do both abroad and here at home.\n  As wildfires continue to threaten Montana's countryside and our \ncommunities, I wish to pay tribute to all the brave men and women who \nput it on the line to fight our fires.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to comment on the energy debate we have been \nhaving in the Senate. Every Tuesday morning, for 2\\1/2\\ hours, I get to \npreside over this great body, and I get to hear folks from both sides \nof the aisle talk about issues of importance.\n\n  The energy debate has been particularly intriguing because I have \nseen folks on the other side of the aisle hold up signs that talk about \ndrilling more and using less.\n  They are quick to support oil production. But on the other hand, they \nwill not support alternative energies or conservation methods. They \ntalk about drilling more as if it is going to change the price of \ngasoline tomorrow.\n  The fact is, the United States has less than 3 percent of the world's \nreserves of oil. We use 25 percent of the supply. As far as drilling \ngoes, we are drilling now like there is no tomorrow. In fact, in \nMontana, you would be hard-pressed to find a drilling rig if you wanted \nto punch a hole.\n  In Montana, we have offered over 3 million acres of leasing since \n2000. We have increased our oil production two and a half-fold. We have \ndrilled 4,870 wells in the last 5 years. Yet we continually see the \nprice of oil go up and up and up. Why? Well, a lot of it has to do with \nthe fact that the major oil companies last year made hundreds of \nbillions of dollars off the consumers' back.\n  What can we do? What can we do to help bring the price of oil down? \nSure, we are going to continue to drill, and I support that effort. But \nwe need additions to our energy portfolio. If we continue to rely on \noil as our chief supplier of energy, we are going to be continuing to \nbe beholden to Saudi Arabia and OPEC forever. That ought not be the \ndirection we go.\n  My good friend, my comrade, Senator Baucus, put forth a tax extenders \nbill earlier today. Yesterday, we had a chance to vote on one from the \nHouse. They were both defeated. They were not allowed to move forward. \nThere was a majority, but there was not 60 votes.\n  What was in that tax extenders bill? One of the things that was in it \nwas a renewable energy tax credit extension, a continuation that would \nput more energy in the marketplace.\n  As shown on this chart, we can see what happens when we have the wind \nenergy tax credit. The yellow bars indicate that. The orange bars \nindicate when it does not happen. If we have the wind energy tax \ncredit, wind energy production goes up, and there is more\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nenergy in the marketplace. When we don't, it does not.\n  Because of the vote that was taken earlier today, you will see a \ndecrease in wind energy production--a big mistake for this country, not \nvery visionary.\n  Because of the vote that took place earlier today, we not only will \nsee wind energy grind to a halt, we will see geothermal--which we have \na tremendous opportunity for throughout the country, particularly in \nMontana--we will see biomass, landfill gas--we have an electrical \ncooperative in northwestern Montana, Flathead Electric Cooperative, \nthat is talking about capturing methane gas off the landfill to produce \nenergy, getting something from nothing--we will not see any of that \nstuff go on because of the defeat of the tax extenders bill.\n  In that tax extenders bill, there were also long-term extensions of \ntax credits for solar energy and fuel cells. Solar energy: getting our \nenergy from the Sun to help replace some of that oil from the Middle \nEast--not going to happen. Folks talk about corn ethanol and how they \ndon't like it. I am not one of them. But I do think we need to get the \nsecond generation of ethanol production, cellulosic ethanol. There was \na credit for property in that tax extenders bill that was not agreed to \nearlier today. That will not happen; a biodiesel tax credit. I have \ntalked about a camelina provision in the farm bill for biodiesel, and \nthere are other opportunities in all sorts of oilseeds out there. The \nbiodiesel tax credit does not happen because we did not pass that bill \nSenator Baucus offered earlier today.\n  Carbon capture and storage technology to make our coal burn cleaner. \nIn Montana, we are the ``Saudi Arabia'' of coal. We have an incredible \nopportunity. But without good technology to capture carbon and store \nit, we will never be all we can be. It would make us more energy \nindependent.\n  Talk about producing more here at home: Drilling is part of the \nequation. But an even bigger part of the equation could have been to \npass that tax extenders bill earlier today.\n  Let's talk about using less.\n  In that tax extenders bill, there were energy efficiency tax credits \nto help make our homes more energy efficient. It is not going to \nhappen. There was a credit to reduce idling for truckers--that we all \nsee happen--to save transportation fuel. It is not going to happen.\n  You want to talk about using less? There was a bicycling tax credit \nfor those folks who want to ride their bicycle to work rather than to \ndrive. It will not happen.\n  There were incentives for geothermal heat pumps in our homes that use \nless energy with more consistency. It is not going to happen.\n  There were energy conservation bonds for States and local school \ndistricts. The list goes on and on and on.\n  I ask myself: Why? Why does it have to be this way? Why aren't we \nlooking to the future? Why are we not talking about more than drilling? \nThe fact is, we are drilling. We are drilling an incredible amount of \nland in this country. It needs to be a bridge. But it needs to be a \nbridge to somewhere this time. If we put forth the renewable energy \ncomponents that are in the tax extenders bill, we will have a future. \nWe will have a future of affordable energy.\n\n  I ask my comrades to pass that tax extenders bill. It is incredibly \nimportant. It is not just because of energy that it is important.\n\n\n                          Secure Rural Schools\n\n  Finally, I wish to talk about the security of rural schools. These \nare payments to Montana's rural communities and forested counties that \nhave an incredible amount of public lands.\n  The Secure Rural Schools dollars are important not only for the \nschool but also for our roads and our rural counties. Montana is rich \nin public lands. Consequently, it puts more pressure on property taxes \nof private property in those counties. With the Secure Rural Schools \nmoney, it gives those rural and forested counties the opportunity to \nmeet the needs of the kids in these rural districts and to meet the \nneeds of the transportation industry in those rural districts. We all \nknow that less money for rural schools means lower teacher pay, bigger \nclassroom size, fewer activities, and students start to fall behind.\n  County road workers right now are being laid off. I spoke with the \nhead of the Montana Association of Counties. He said to the counties: \nTake your budgets and utilize them as if this money is not going to \nhappen because it is not until we pass the tax extenders programs.\n  We had the opportunity in this body today and yesterday to pass a \ngood bill that meets the needs of America's families, small businesses, \nand the economy. It was not passed. There are all sorts of excuses for \nit, but they are simply that: excuses. We need to move forward with \nsome proactive thinking in this body. I hope the next time this bill \nhits this floor, it is passed and passed by a large margin.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfollowing the presentation by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with much \ndismay over the fact that we were not able to pass the energy \nextenders, the tax extenders, the package of important provisions for \nour country's economy because of this obstructionism on the other side.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why this was so important to me. We only \ngot four Republican votes for this package. I think it is outrageous \nwhen you look at what we are dealing with. This week we are going to be \nmemorializing the tragic, tragic, tragic fall of the bridge in the \nmiddle of Minnesota. I am going to speak to that tomorrow and do a \nfitting tribute, along with Senator Coleman, to the victims of that \nbridge collapse and to the first responders who saved so many lives, \nand to the reconstruction work that has gone on thanks to the help of \nthis Senate. I live six blocks from that bridge, so it means a lot to \nme.\n  I said the week the bridge fell down that in America, a bridge \nshouldn't fall down in the middle of the Mississippi River, especially \nnot on an eight-lane highway, especially not on one of the most heavily \ntraveled bridges in the State, especially not at rush hour in the heart \nof a major metropolitan area. Unfortunately, however, it took that \ndisaster to put the issue of infrastructure funding squarely on the \nnational agenda, and it is long overdue. That is why I was so \ndisappointed that in this important bill was $8 billion to replenish \nthe highway trust fund of this country, to replenish that fund. Mr. \nPresident, 400,000 jobs in this country are at stake in that bill that \nwas voted down by the other side.\n  Look what is happening in this country with our infrastructure. Let's \ntake the issue of bridges. Nationwide, bridges are deteriorating far \nfaster than we can repair or replace them. About 78,000 bridges across \nthe Nation are structurally deficient. What does structurally deficient \nmean? When inspectors evaluate a bridge, they examine the bridge's \ndeck, superstructure, and substructure. Each of these components is \nranked on a scale of 0 to 9, with 0 being failed and 9 being excellent. \nIf the deck, superstructure, or substructure is given a 4 or less, the \nbridge is classified as structurally deficient.\n  In June of 2006, the I-35W bridge's superstructure--meaning the \nphysical conditions of all structural members--was rated at a 4. The \nbridge's deck was rated at a 5, and the substructure, comprised of the \npiers, the footings, and other components, was rated as a 6. A bridge \nis shut down if any of its parts are rated at a 2.\n  Then we have another 80,000 bridges across the Nation which are \nfunctionally obsolete. What does functionally obsolete mean? That means \nthey don't meet today's design standards, they don't conform to today's \nsafety standards, and they are handling traffic far beyond their \ndesign. Fully one-quarter of America's 600,000 bridges have aged so \nmuch that their physical condition or their ability to withstand \ncurrent traffic levels is simply inadequate. These bridges require \nimmediate attention.\n  I can tell you since our bridge fell on that summer day on August 1, \nwe have had a number of bridges shut down, close down in our State, \nincluding one\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\nthat handled a lot of traffic in St. Cloud, MN. There was one in \nWinona, MN, that was actually on the Federal stamp from our State that \nwas temporarily closed down and is going to have to be rebuilt.\n  We are seeing this across the country. We are seeing a need for \ninfrastructure funding. At a time when our economy is facing such \ndifficult times, I see this as an investment, not only in the long-term \nviability for our country's transportation system but also in jobs. \nThat is why I am so disappointed that the other side was willing to \nturn their backs on 400,000 existing jobs, much less add new ones, by \nturning down that $8 billion replenishment of the highway trust fund.\n  It was President Kennedy who once said that building a road or \nhighway isn't pretty, but it is something our economy needs to have. I \ncan tell you beyond the bridges in metropolitan areas, nowhere is that \ntruer than in rural America. We are seeing a rejuvenation because of \nthe energy economy right now in rural Minnesota as we are in so much of \nrural America. Senator Tester from Montana talked about this. We are \nseeing biofuels, whether it is biodiesel, ethanol, moving to cellulosic \nethanol; whether it is wind or solar. We are third in the country in \nMinnesota with wind energy--third in the country.\n  I have seen jobs such as in Starbuck, MN, where a group of 10 people \ndecided to quit their jobs and go work for a solar panel factory. They \nwere so proud of their work they had me jump up and down on those solar \npanels to show that they can withstand hail damage, and they did.\n  I can tell you this: We are seeing these jobs and we need courage in \nWashington that matches the courage of these employees in Starbuck, MN, \nor in Pipestone--the courage of these employees who are willing to see \na better energy future, while this body on the other side is willing to \nshoot it down by shooting down those tax extenders for energy. This is \nthe wave of the future. This is the way we are going to be investing in \nhomegrown energy and in the farmers and the workers of the Midwest \ninstead of the oil cartels in the Mideast.\n  So it is about the energy extenders for me in my State and across the \ncountry, but it is also about the transportation funding that came in \nreplenishing that highway trust fund. When you start building this \nenergy economy, with the wind turbines and with the biofuels in the \ntrucks going across these roads, you are going to put more stress on \nthe roads and the rail in rural America. If we are going to move to the \nnext century's economic system, we can't be stuck in the last century's \ntransportation system.\n  I will give some examples. The ethanol plant in Bentsen, MN, now has \nover 525 fully loaded semis hauling the ethanol from their plant every \nweek. This is a 45-million gallon facility. Their production falls \nabout in the middle of our biodiesel facilities in Minnesota.\n\n  SMI Hydraulics is a company in rural southwestern Minnesota that \nmanufactures the bases for the wind towers you see all across our \ncountry. This is a company that started as a barn. The wind towers they \nmanufacture actually come out of the side of the barn as they are \nemploying dozens of people right in this little town. The heavy trucks \nthat bring the steel to the company put a heavy burden on the road as \nthey travel and are putting durability to a test. This truck travel and \nthe need for more rail travel is part of our transportation future, but \nwhen the other side shoots down our ability to even replenish the \nhighway trust fund, we are not going to be moving in the right \ndirection for our economy. We are not going to help these rural people \nto develop the true energy economy they need to develop.\n  In his 1963 ``Memoir for Change,'' President Eisenhower famously \nsaid:\n\n       More than any single action by the government since the end \n     of the war, this one would change the face of America.\n\n  He was talking about the interstate highway system. Its impact on the \nAmerican economy, the jobs it would produce in manufacturing and \nconstruction, the rural areas it would open up were beyond calculation. \nWell, he was right. Just as he was right back in 1963, we know he is \nstill right in 2008. So the gall to turn down the replenishment of that \nhighway trust fund and to stop America as we try to head to the new \nenergy future--other countries are leapfrogging us because they have \ngovernment policies in place that mandate these green jobs and move in \nthe right direction--is plain wrong.\n  The one last thing I wish to say is there is one way--as we look to \njump-starting the economy right now, as we look at solving our oil \ncrisis and our dependency on foreign oil and our spending of $600,000 a \nminute on foreign oil--and that is the President. He doesn't need the \nCongress. He can complain about Congress all he wants, but the \nPresident of the United States can actually release barrels of oil from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He can do it right now. He could do it \nin the next hour. We can look at what has happened in the past: 1990 to \n1991, 11 million barrels were released; 1996 to 1997, 28 million \nbarrels were released to reduce the Federal debt. In 2005, 21 million \nbarrels were released after Katrina. We can look at how full the \npetroleum reserve has been. In 1993, 79 percent full; in 2001, it was \n74 percent full. Well, right now, in 2008, it is 97 percent full. So \nthis President, on his own, could simply release the barrels of oil \nfrom that Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  We are the home of Northwest Airlines in Minnesota. The CEO there, \nDoug Steenland, has spoken with me many times. Tens of thousands of \ncustomers have sent e-mails saying we want to stop this speculation and \nwe want to do something about helping Americans and helping these \ncompanies with oil prices. One way to do this immediately is to release \nsome of the barrels of oil, 97 percent full, from that Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. If you even go down to 90 percent, you could inject \n$6 billion into the American economy and help to bring those oil prices \ndown. This is up to the President. He could do it with one signature on \none document. He doesn't need us passing a bill to have to deal with \nthese guys and their filibuster. He could do it himself.\n  So in addition to passing these tax extenders, to getting our green \nenergy economy going and doing something about that highway trust fund \nso another bridge doesn't fall down in the middle of America, this \nPresident, himself, without even one vote from Congress, could release \nbarrels of oil into the American economy and help not only customers \nbut also help the businesses in this country who are finding it harder \nand harder to compete as we see the price of oil escalate.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                      Remembering Freddie Hutchins\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my condolences to the \nfamily and friends of Mr. Freddie Hutchins who passed away suddenly \nyesterday, on July 29. Freddie served on my staff since my election. He \nmanaged my Roanoke Senate office. He was a tremendous individual with a \ngreat deal of promise. I had selected him from a number of very \ntalented people down in southwest Virginia to run this office. He \npassed away, as I said, suddenly only at the age of 26.\n  Freddie was a product of southwest Virginia. He grew up in Botetourt \nCounty. He was very heavily influenced by his grandfather, who was a \nvery active Democrat and railroad man, a union man down in southwest \nVirginia. He was known for having made himself a business card at the \nage of 13 saying Freddie Hutchins, Democrat. He loved the rich culture \nof southwest Virginia.\n  He represented the values that characterize that region. He loved his \ncountry. He had a great sense of service and a determination to work \nhard. He developed a very early interest in politics. He was a C-SPAN \nenthusiast at a young age. Before joining my office, he had worked for \nState Delegate Onzlee Ware as a legislative aide and had been active in \na number of political campaigns.\n  He was a tireless and vocal advocate for working people in this \ncountry. He was committed to social justice and was someone who was \nalways eager and enthusiastic to help people.\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\n  He was one of the most honorable and friendly individuals I have ever \nhad the pleasure of knowing. He was a mainstay in that community and \nhad a very bright future. I had always assumed that Freddie Hutchins \nwould be running for elective office in the near future. He was a \nfriend to all who knew him.\n  Again, I express my condolences to his mother Karen and the rest of \nhis family and all of those whom he had reached out and done so much \nwith and for over the years. He will be greatly missed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. What is the status of the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 40 seconds remaining for \nthe majority in this block of time.\n  Mr. REID. For how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is alternating 30 minutes between the \nmajority and the Republicans.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to use leader time now, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Democrats' 4 minutes be preserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we over here, the mighty band of Democrats, \nwith the majority of 1--there are 51 of us and 49 of them--trying so \nhard to do something on energy. We have been trying for months now. I \nthink we have done some things that would be good for the American \npeople but for the fact that the Republicans have basically objected to \neverything we have tried to do.\n  What have we tried to do? We introduced S. 3044, called the Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act. It has some tremendously powerful things in it that \nrelate to what the American people's problem is today: high gas prices.\n  In that legislation, we talk about price gouging. Do we have any \nreason to have in a provision of law an element that we can go after \ncompanies that price gouge? Of course. The oil companies, during the \nBush years, have had net profits of $609 billion. So our price-gouging \nprovision was, we thought, very key in doing something about energy.\n  In S. 3044, we had something dealing with the oil subsidies the oil \ncompanies have received, that perhaps they should be cut back. They are \nmaking these huge profits. In this bill, we had a provision that was \nbipartisan and has been pushed by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania--NOPEC is what it was called. It was a proposal \nto have the OPEC cartel be subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. That \nseems reasonable, since these countries have the absolute ability to so \neasily lock in prices and determine what prices are going to be charged \naround the world. Senators Kohl and Specter thought this was good \nlegislation, and so did we. That is why we put it in our legislation.\n  We also had a provision in our legislation dealing with speculation. \nI will talk about that later. We not only had it in S. 3044, we had \nfreestanding legislation dealing with speculation.\n  We also had in S. 3044 something dealing with a windfall profits tax, \nwhich should be part of the law of our country today. The American \nconsumer agrees with that.\n  Mr. President, Senator Bingaman also prepared legislation, which has \nnow been filed at the desk. It is very good legislation. We were asking \nfor help from the Republicans and got none. Senator Bingaman is one of \nthe most astute, hard-working, creative, and smartest Senators we have \never had in this body. In that legislation, S. 5135, we had some really \ngood things. It wasn't ``take it or leave it'' legislation. With the 68 \nmillion acres the oil companies have, it called for due diligence. It \nsaid: With the 68 million acres you have, let's find out what you are \ndoing with it, why you are not drilling in some parts of it, and report \nto the Interior Department and find out what is going on with that \nland. It is typical of Senator Bingaman because it was well thought \nout. Rather than the provision that some were talking about--use it or \nlose it--Senator Bingaman believed that was appropriate, and that is \nwhy he went through the trouble of coming up with this legislation.\n  He also had something in the bill that would be important which deals \nwith building codes, making it so that in the future, when things are \nbuilt, when construction takes place, it deals with the environment. \nThere is so much that can be done to save huge amounts of electricity \nif we had buildings built properly.\n  We also had a provision on which the Senator from Minnesota spoke so \neloquently which said that we want you to take the great resource we \nhave--the more than 700 million barrels of oil we have in our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve--and we want you to announce to the world that we are \ngoing to start using some of that. We are going to start using that to \nbring down the price of oil. We know it works. We know it works because \nthe President's father did it, and it brought down the price of oil. We \nhave asked that this be done on other occasions, but we put it in this \nlegislation Senator Bingaman came up with.\n  The airlines tell us it is important to bring down the prices. The \nairline companies need to have oil, for these companies to be able to \nsucceed, at about $100 a barrel. That is high, but they could succeed \nwith that. Anything over that is a tremendous losing proposition for \nthem. This would bring the price of oil down to at or near that price. \nBut we got no suggestions from the Republicans that they cared about \nthis.\n  Also, I thought what Senator Bingaman did was very important. He said \nthere is about 25 million acres of land that is available now to be \nleased for oil exploration. All the administration has to do is tell \nthe Interior Department to issue leases on it. It has already been \ndetermined that it has tremendous oil potential. Much of it is on- and \noffshore in Alaska. It would add another 25 million acres to the 68 \nmillion acres the oil companies already have.\n  There were other provisions in the Bingaman bill--good pieces of \nlegislation. Again, we had no takers on that from the Republicans.\n  Today, we voted on H.R. 6049, and, of course, that was defeated \nbecause of another cloture motion that was necessary to be filed \nbecause of a Republican filibuster. The same with the Warm in Winter \nand Cool in Summer Act, S. 3186, LIHEAP. It was filibustered, and we \nweren't able to proceed to that. That is really unusually harsh. I have \nheard the Senator from Vermont talk about that on numerous occasions. I \ntold him that more people die from exposure in the summer than in the \nwinter because they become dehydrated. We need to have the ability for \nthe old, disabled, and poor to have air-conditioning. In the winter, of \ncourse, they need heat. But this was rejected by the Republicans.\n  We asked--because it was certainly bipartisan every step of the way, \nthe NOPEC bill, the Specter-Kohl bill--that we move to that alone. That \nwas S. 879. It was rejected. Again, the Republicans refused to let us \ndo that.\n  We had the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act, which we have dealt \nwith for several weeks now. I spoke the night before last to the \nPresident of United Airlines. He said he has no question in his mind \nthat one reason the oil prices have gone down by the barrel in recent \ndays is because we are debating and talking about speculation. This \nwould work. The Republicans have been listening to the monied interests \nof this country and have refused to allow us to do this.\n  Then, of course, today, we had the issue of the so-called extenders \nbill on which Senator Baucus worked so hard. It was rejected. It had \nmany good provisions in it. He worked hard to try to get bipartisan \nsupport. There was disaster relief in it. There was finally something \nin there that we could pass to do the mental health parity, which is so \nlong overdue. We had a provision to reestablish money that has been \ntaken out of the highway trust fund, which is so important--to \nreestablish that. People are losing their jobs.\n  The most significant thing, from my perspective, in that \nlegislation--even though there was much more--was that it would do \nsomething now, today, about taking care of the energy crisis in this \ncountry. It is not Al Gore, former Vice President of the United States, \ntalking; it is T. Boone Pickens--from a different political party and \npersuasion than Al Gore--saying we have to move to renewables. That is \nwhat this legislation is all about, creating hundreds of thousands of \njobs,\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nconstruction jobs and other jobs, that lessen our dependence on foreign \noil. As T. Boone Pickens said, ``You can't drill your way out of this \ncrisis.'' We were blocked on that.\n  Mr. President, in the newspapers all over America and in other parts \nof the world, Thomas Friedman's column is running today. He is a person \nwho has won all kinds of prizes around the world for his writing. He \nhas had three bestselling books. For weeks, his books have been No. 1 \non the New York Times bestseller list. He writes with great \npreciseness, and he is right to the point. Here is what he said today:\n\n       Republicans have become so obsessed with the notion that we \n     can drill our way out of our current energy crisis that \n     reopening our coastal waters to offshore drilling has become \n     their answer for every energy question.\n       Anyone who looks at the growth of middle classes around the \n     world and their rising demands for natural resources, plus \n     the dangers of climate change driven by our addiction to \n     fossil fuels, can see the clean renewable energy--wind, \n     solar, nuclear and stuff we haven't yet invented--is going to \n     be the next great global industry. It has to be if we are \n     going to grow in a stable way.\n       Therefore, the country that most owns the clean power \n     industry is going to most own the next great technology \n     breakthrough--the E.T. revolution, the energy technology \n     revolution--and create millions of jobs and thousands of new \n     businesses, just like the I.T. revolution did.\n       Republicans, by mindlessly repeating their offshore-\n     drilling mantra, focusing on a 19th-century fuel, remind me \n     of someone back in 1980 arguing we should be putting all our \n     money into making more and cheaper IBM Selectric \n     typewriters--and forget about these things called the ``PC'' \n     and ``the Internet.'' It is a strategy for making America a \n     second-rate power and economy.\n\n  Mr. President, earlier this week, on Monday, I offered the \nRepublicans, on the speculation bill, four amendments, and we would \nhave a like number. That was rejected out of hand--offer made and they \nrejected it.\n  Yesterday, right after the Senate opened, Senator McConnell said to \nme: How about six amendments?\n  I said: I am happy to discuss amendments, but I am through discussing \namendments unless we pass the extenders bill.\n  That was clear language. I said it directly, and I meant it. I am \nspeaking for 50 other Democratic Senators. I am speaking for my caucus.\n  So Senator McConnell said: Well, fine, we will have Senator Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Grassley, the ranking \nmember, work on this.\n  I said that Senator Baucus said Senator Grassley has no authority to \ndo anything.\n  He said: Yes, he does. I will instruct him that he has all the \nauthority in the world.\n  They met for 2 hours last night. The only thing Senator Grassley \nwanted to discuss was having all of these extenders not paid for. So we \nare right back where we started. So that is gone. That was turned down \noverwhelmingly. The Republicans didn't support the extenders. So that \nis where we are.\n  My caucus demands that we focus on something to really make a \ndifference: renewables, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs--\nFriedman said millions; I am saying hundreds of thousands within the \nnext few months. It will make a cleaner environment, and it will be \ngood for the economy.\n  Mr. President, that is where it is. That is where it is.\n  Again, as Thomas Friedman wrote:\n\n       Republicans, by mindlessly repeating their offshore-\n     drilling mantra, focusing on a 19th century fuel, remind me \n     of someone back in 1980 arguing that we should be putting all \n     our money into making more and cheaper IBM Selectric \n     typewriters--and forget about these things called the ``PC'' \n     and ``the Internet.'' It is a strategy for making America a \n     second-rate power and economy.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to address a question to the majority leader \nthrough the Chair. I ask the Senator whether yesterday we brought to \nthe floor an opportunity for the Republicans to join us in a bipartisan \nway to come up with a clear package of incentives for renewable energy, \nenergy that we need now and for future generations, and yesterday when \nthat measure came to the floor as it originally passed the House of \nRepresentatives, I ask the majority leader what the support level was \non the Democratic side and whether there were more than four Republican \nSenators who joined us in that effort.\n  Mr. REID. All Democrats supported it, a handful of Republicans, \nmostly those who are in very difficult Senate races, I might add, for \nreelection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is one of the reoccurring themes. When four or five \nRepublicans join us, it is because many of them are facing a tough \nreelection.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, today when we brought this measure \nbefore the Senate again, incentives for renewable energy, we included \nin it $8 billion for the highway trust fund, which can be attributed to \n400,000 good-paying American jobs. We also included the mental health \nparity bill, which has been a bipartisan bill that has been sought by \nthis Senate for maybe a decade. It has certainly been a long time. We \nincluded as well an extension of the exemption for the alternative \nminimum tax so middle-income families would not face higher taxes.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada what kind of support we had from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. If I am not mistaken, only five \nRepublicans, four of whom are up for reelection in November, joined us \nin that vote.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right, absolutely right. I can't \nexpress how the Republican Party, as I have always known it--when I \nwent into politics, I had the idea that the Republicans were the party \nof fiscal responsibility. That has long since gone. We are going to \nhave a deficit this year of about a half trillion dollars, and that \nisn't a fair view of it because they are using the Social Security \ntrust fund to offset and make the deficit look even smaller.\n  But I also will say this: Big oil during the Bush years has made a \n$609 billion profit--$609 billion. The Republicans side with big oil \nevery step of the way. They have done it in all this energy \nlegislation. They are beholden to big oil. Everyone knows that. I think \nit is time we start talking about something that will help; that is, we \nneed to move to have energy created by the Sun, wind, geothermal, and \nwe need to do it as quickly as possible.\n  That is where we are. I have said on a number of occasions--I said it \nearlier today--there was a lot of activity on the Senate floor--\nunderstand, Mr. President, where we are. Because the Republicans have \nblocked everything--they have blocked energy for old people, sick \npeople, disabled people; they have blocked everything we have tried to \ndo here--we have a decision. They can make the decision. We have been \nfortunate enough to finish the Higher Education Act. We have been \nfortunate to finish consumer product safety. Both conference reports \nare finished. We can do those in the next couple of days. We can move \nto the Defense authorization bill. It is up to the Republicans what \nthey want to do. But if they want to be here during August, more power \nto them because we will be here with them. We all have things to do, \nlongstanding obligations during August, but those can be changed. If \npeople want to debate during August the Defense Authorization Act, that \nis fine. They can go out and hold their press conferences that they \nwould rather be doing something on drilling, drilling, drilling. They \ncan continue to do that, or we can come back in September--there is \ngoing to be a bipartisan summit on energy prices, and maybe by the \nAugust recess, maybe some of my friends will be more willing to do some \nactual compromise.\n  Legislation is the art of compromise. If the art of compromise is not \npresent, we cannot get the business done. There simply has been no \ncompromise from my friends. That is why we have faced almost 90 \nfilibusters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am joined on the Senate floor by my \ncolleague from Wyoming. I ask unanimous consent that we may engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cost of Energy\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I had an opportunity to speak on the floor \nthis past week a number of times and speak in committee about the cost \nof energy, about pain at the pump. I am of the view that we need to act \nnow.\n  My position on energy has always been that we should not take \nanything off the table; that is, we need renewable energy, we need to \nhave energy\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nfrom whatever source we can derive--oil and gas, nuclear energy. We \nneed to concentrate on our efforts to try to produce more energy. We \nneed more. That is not the entire solution. We also need to consume \nless. We need to encourage conservation everywhere we can.\n  That is why I have signed onto bills such as the Gas Price Reduction \nAct of 2008. This bill says we begin to open deep sea exploration, \nwhere we go out more than 50 miles from the coast, and that we begin to \ndrill in those areas and share the revenues with the States that are \ninvolved. Under our proposal the Governor petitions to allow \nexploration, and he does that with the concurrence of the State \nlegislature. A portion of funds generated would even go to the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund in addition to States, with other funds going \nto the general fund.\n  Also, in the particular legislation I mentioned, we talk about \nWestern State oil shale exploration. This resource would provide more \nthan three times the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia, this oil shale is \nfound in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado.\n  The legislation I have signed onto says we also look at ways of \ntrying to create conservation, such as electric cars and trucks, and \nfocus our attention on better batteries so we can create an electrical \nsupplement to the use of liquid fuel, whether it is a truck or car, and \ncreate some efficiencies on the highway. In the case of cars, as much \nas 60, 70 miles to the gallon with an augmentation from an electrical \nsource. For these efficiencies to happen batteries are a key \ntechnological advancement that has to occur, and it has to occur at a \nprice that consumers can afford. In this bill, we put our efforts into \ncoming up with that type of a battery.\n  In addition, we try to do what we can to strengthen U.S. futures \nmarkets. That means increased funding for staff to the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and it directs the present working group to \nstudy the international regulation of commodity markets. Remember, on \ncommodity markets, it is not just an American market, it is \ninternational. We have to be careful how we disrupt the markets as we \ndo that. If we are not careful we can create a real disadvantage to \nAmericans and not really help in the supply of energy.\n  These are the types of actions that will make a difference in the \nprice of oil and gas because we increase the supply. That is our \nproblem; we don't have enough to meet worldwide demand. Because of high \nglobal demand we need to work not only in this country but also in \nother countries to spread the idea of conservation.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, the suggestion from the majority \nleader that somehow if we just stand on the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about more rules and regulations on the commodity markets, somehow \nthat is going to bring down the price of gas, I happen to think that \njust talking doesn't bring about action. But I do happen to believe \nthat action does create a reduction in the price of oil at the gas \npump.\n  I credit most of the recent price reduction to the President because \nhe actually took action, which was to take the moratorium off the Outer \nContinental Shelf. This took us closer to allowing for exploration for \nmore energy sources out in the deep ocean. Because of that, the markets \ndid respond. I don't believe it was the debate on the Senate floor \nwhere we just talked, because the markets looked and said the President \ntook real action to repeal a regulation, making it easier for us to \nextract energy out of the ground.\n\n  That is the kind of action in which this Congress needs to \nparticipate. It is action that needs to happen now, not 30 days from \nnow, not a week, not a day. The sooner we act, the better it is because \npeople every day are feeling the impact on their daily lives of high \nenergy costs.\n  I recently participated in a press conference where we had people who \nare involved with supportive programs for the poor. They said because \nof the high cost of food, it is making it difficult for them to meet \ntheir goals and objectives and to keep their budgets within what they \nallocated at the first of the year. They are having all sorts of supply \nissues when it comes to feeding the poor and the disadvantaged in this \ncountry. We heard from all aspects of the various agencies and \nreligious groups that make it part of their mission to provide for the \nhungry in this country.\n  We heard from truckdrivers today. I was at a press conference where \nwe heard from truckers. When you think about it, renewable energy \nobviously works pretty good if you are talking about power lines. What \nkind of renewable source do they use in trucks? Ethanol, perhaps, might \nhave some uses for trucks, but basically they are locked in with one \nsource of energy right and that is diesel.\n  The only way we are going to bring down the price of fuels to the \ntruckers who provide medical supplies, who provide food to Americans--\nthey transport all sorts of produce around the country. They haul \naround all sorts of manufacturing. They deliver our mail. I am trying \nto think of one commodity that at some point in time does not spend \nsome time on a truck. It is very important that we keep the total \nprospect. There is not a simple solution. It is not a one-issue \nsolution where we can say: We are just going to focus on renewable \nenergy and the heck with everything else. We need to look at all \nalternatives. We are having supply problems. We can't take anything off \nthe table. That is what I want to comment on.\n  I have on the floor with me a Senator from Wyoming, a good friend of \nmine who is new to the Senate, one of our newest Members, doing a \ntremendous job for the State of Wyoming. I know that in Wyoming, for \nexample, they have lots of energy. One of the sources of energy they \nhave is coal. The western part of the United States has hard coal, \nwhich is very unique. Frequently, it is mixed with soft coal so \ncommunities and towns on the east coast can meet their pollution \nrequirements.\n  In our discussions, there was some talk about the various alternative \nsources we could look at for clean coal, for example. I was hoping that \nperhaps maybe my colleague who is on the Senate floor with me can talk \na little bit about energy in Wyoming and how their economy is being \nimpacted with the high cost of gas and diesel and what energy potential \nis in their State.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Wyoming to talk a little bit \nabout Wyoming. We are neighbors. We have very similar environments and \nvery similar natural resources. Senator Barrasso.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. He \nis absolutely right, Wyoming is a State which has been very blessed--\nblessed with abundant sources of energy, and certainly coal, natural \ngas, oil, uranium for our nuclear power, and also wind, a renewable \nsource of energy. So we have lots of different resources with which we \nhave been blessed.\n  But in terms of coal--and we know half the electricity in the United \nStates comes from coal--what we know is that there is enough coal in \nWyoming to power this country for centuries--not decades but centuries. \nThere is that much coal in Wyoming. Coal is available, affordable, \nreliable, and a secure source of energy for our Nation.\n  To me, this is about being self-sufficient in terms of our own \nenergy. We are sending so much of the wealth of this great country \noverseas. Every time we buy another barrel of oil overseas. Whether it \nis $120, $130, $140 per barrel, that is a transfer of the wealth of our \nNation to people who are not necessarily our friends.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The figure I have seen is more than $700 billion in 1 \nyear's time. That is a whale of a lot of money to be sending overseas, \nto our enemies potentially.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. And we have the source of energy here, with the coal, \nand the technology is incredible. There are ways to use the coal to \nconvert it to electricity and there are other ways to use the coal to \nconvert it to liquids. Aviation fuel. The military uses an incredible \namount of fuel. I have amendments I have introduced and am trying to \nhave debated on this floor that deal specifically with converting coal \nto liquids, to allow us to use that liquid for our aviation.\n  There is another technology, coal to gas. There is a true visionary \nin Wyoming. His name is John Wold, 91 years old, and he is here today \nto visit. His granddaughter works in my office. I\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nhave talked to him for years about the technology of coal to gas, and \nit is ready to go and available in Wyoming. It is being done in other \nplaces around the world, but not yet here. So it is incredible in terms \nof the available resources we have. But it is not only one source of \nenergy. We need it all. We need the coal, we need the natural gas, we \nneed the uranium, we need the oil, and certainly we need to be more \nefficient, as my colleague from Colorado has talked about. We need to \nbe energy efficient, but we need the renewables. So we need the \ntransmission lines, but we have plenty of wind in Wyoming.\n  Look at oil shale. The Senator from Colorado is familiar with that, \nbecause Colorado, as well as Wyoming, as well as Utah, is blessed with \noil shale. Perhaps I could ask my colleague from Colorado to discuss \nsome of the issues related to that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would be delighted to talk about oil shale. First, I \nwant to address the issue where the majority leader tried to imply that \nRepublicans are interested in only one issue, and that is extraction of \noil and gas from the ground. Republicans I talk to on this Senate \nfloor, in my party, understand we need to have a balanced approach. We \nneed to go after all sources of energy. The problem is that on the \nDemocratic side, they only want to go after renewable sources.\n  I helped to found the Renewable Energy Caucus, and so I understand \nhow important renewable energy is to our future. But we need something \nto bridge us over, and that is where I think the comments of my \ncolleague from Wyoming are so important, when we are talking about \nconverting oil to liquids or to natural gas. It helps create that \nbridge. We need to create that bridge by having an opportunity to go \nand explore for oil and gas in the ground.\n  One source of fuel in the ground is oil shale, and I think it is \nimportant that my colleagues here on the floor understand that oil \nshale is a huge resource in this country. We have oil shale in the \nState of Wyoming to a lesser amount than we have in Utah and Colorado, \nbut we have lots of oil shale in Colorado. In fact, most of it is in \nColorado. There is a fair amount in Utah, and then a smaller amount in \nWyoming. We have different types of oil shale in Utah and Wyoming, and \nthe extraction proposal out of those two States is a little different.\n  We need to move forward with oil shale, and that is why I am working \nso hard to get the moratorium off of oil shale because Shell Oil \nCompany and other companies have developed a technique where extraction \nis environmentally friendly. Utah's oil shale is closer to the surface. \nIt is a higher quality shale which contains lots of oil in one small \nchunk of rock. What they do is they go ahead and grind it up, heat it, \nand they extract a heavy type of oil out of that product.\n  In Colorado, what we are talking about in Mesa and Garfield Counties, \nfor example, is a deeper oil shale. It is a good quality oil shale--not \nquite as good quality as we see in Utah--and we have a new technology \nthat is being developed there that takes the ground and freezes a \nperimeter around the section of ground and then heat the middle of it. \nBasically what you have is a refinery in the ground. So what you \nextract out is basically a jet fuel that contains sulfur and nitrogen. \nObviously, the sulfur and nitrogen has to be refined out, but it is a \nvery good, high-quality product. It is a jet fuel. Then the heavy tarry \nstuff is left in the ground.\n  There is no disruption of the surface of the ground other than the \nfact that you run some pipes in the ground, and you need some water. \nThey have taken out water rights in that part of Colorado to make sure \nthey have water. It is the type of water that can be recycled and \nreused. So there are lots of conservation aspects to this new \ntechnology that is being developed for oil shale. That is why I had the \nsupport for the provision that was provided for in the Gas Price \nReduction Act of 2008, removing the moratorium we have on oil shale.\n  The current law says you can't move forward with the regulatory \nprocess on oil shale, so it has stopped it dead in its tracks. In the \nmeantime, up to 2 trillion barrels of oil in the form of oil shale is \nin the ground, and we think, with today's technology, that between 800 \nbillion and 1 trillion barrels is what can be economically extracted \nout of the ground and made available to us. That is three times all of \nthe oil reserves of Saudi Arabia.\n  Oil shale is a huge resource, but we need to remove the moratorium \nthat says we can't even go ahead and layout the rules and regulations. \nNow, why is that important? Because they tell the oil companies what \nthe rules of the game are going to be, what they can expect the \nroyalties to be, what they can expect the price of leasing the public \nlands to be, and also what remediation requirements are there for \ncleaning up the environment. When the President removed the moratorium \non going after our natural resources through the floor of the ocean, he \nsent a significant message that he is willing to provide more supply \nfor oil and gas, and that had a positive impact on the market. We need \nto continue that sincerity the President showed to the American people \nby taking some real action here on the floor of the Senate, and we need \nto do that by removing an additional moratorium on drilling off the \ncoast and we need to relieve or take off the moratorium on oil shale so \nthat resource can be developed.\n  The technology is not going to be developed until about 3 years from \nnow, so it would be around 2011 or later before it is ready to go. But \nyou need to put in place the rules and regulations first. We need that \nnow. Some of the reasons for objecting that I have heard is people will \nsay: Well, it is going to take 10 years to develop. Maybe so. But 10 \nyears from now, are you going to say now is the time? It will still \ntake 10 years.\n  My point is that the sooner you put this in place, you can begin to \nprepare this bridge we need to have for today's energy sources to get \nus to future energy sources, which are the renewables--the Sun, or \nphotovoltaic cells, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen. That is what we are \ntalking about, and that is what this particular piece of legislation \nprovides for.\n  Citizens in Colorado are being dramatically impacted by high fuel \nprices. We talked before about the agricultural sector and the trucking \nsector. Trucking is more heavily impacted than any other area, because \nin the West, we are big States and we have lots of land to cover to \nprovide our goods and services. I don't know whether the Senator from \nWyoming has anything to say about how his citizens in his State are \nfeeling the impact of high fuel prices, but certainly they are being \nfelt in the State of Colorado, and it wouldn't surprise me if they \naren't very similar in the State of Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The people in Wyoming clearly are affected the same way \nfolks in Colorado are in terms of the large distances they have to \ndrive, whether going to see the doctor, or taking the kids to school, \nor going to shop for groceries. I think statistically, when they look \nat how many miles on average people drive a year, Wyoming is No. 1 in \nterms of the longest distances. So when the price of fuel goes up, the \nprice of gas at the pump, the people of Wyoming feel it the greatest \nbecause they are driving that many more miles. Many of them have pickup \ntrucks or utility vehicles, because when you are that far away from \nhome during the winter, you need to have those higher profile, larger \nvehicles. It is a matter of personal safety. It is what we want our \nkids to be in as well.\n\n  So the inflation is there at the pump, but it is not only that. There \nwas an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week about a woman \nin Casper, WY, who runs a bakery. It is a great bakery, down on First \nStreet, and sheoes a nice job. But the supplies, the cooking things she \nbuys to put in the bagels--whether it is the canned apples or the \nsugar--everything is up pricewise because it has to be shipped in to be \nused. So it is the fuel we use in our own vehicles but it is also the \nfuel that is being used to ship products.\n  The people of Wyoming are smart. At all these town meetings I have, \nthey get it. They understand there is going to be a change in the \nenergy we use in this Nation, a change in the different sources of \nenergy. The people in Wyoming know we would be wise to be conserving, \nand we are, and they know we would be wise to be using the renewables \nthat we have a lot of, but they are also wise in knowing we do need to \nfind more and use less; that it is a matter of supply and demand. And \nuntil\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nyou can deal with both sides of that equation--not just one side but \ndeal with both sides--people are going to continue to feel the pain not \nonly at the pump but also at the grocery store. So the people of \nWyoming get it. They know the importance of the work we are doing here \nin trying to find solutions that will help America become energy self-\nsufficient by developing American coal, American oil, American natural \ngas, American uranium, and American renewable energy sources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is very key. We need to be less dependent on foreign \nsources of oil, not only for our own economic well-being but also for \nthe security of this country. If we have to rely on our enemies, or \npossible enemies, to provide us with fuel, that creates all sorts of \nsecurity problems for this country. So we have to make sure we have \nplenty of sources for us to meet our military needs throughout the \nworld if we are going to be the Nation's and this world's peacekeepers.\n  I note that the Senator has a very busy corridor that goes through \nthe southern part of Wyoming, and it is a big trucking corridor. I \nthink nearly every truck going east to west has to go through Wyoming. \nThey like to avoid the high mountains passes in Colorado, so they find \nit easier driving through Wyoming, and I expect you see quite an impact \nthere in your State.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Interstate 80, which runs west to east across the lower \npart of the State of Wyoming, is a national transportation route where \npeople are taking products from the coastal areas, the ports in \nCalifornia or Oregon, and they come to a pinch point in Utah and then \nthey all get onto I-80, west of the Wyoming border at Evanston, and \nthey come all the way across the State. Fuel prices are high, and the \nmiles are long. People who talk about a 55-mile-an-hour speed limit in \nthis body clearly have not driven across I-80, where a speed limit like \nthat didn't work before when they tried it, and it won't work now.\n  I served in the State Senate in Wyoming, a great place. On the third \nfloor of the capital building, there is a large mural on the wall which \nsort of depicts the State of Wyoming. There is a part of the bottom \nwhere I-80 is running across it. Even back when this was painted, years \nago, if you count the vehicles on the mural, half of them are trucks. \nHalf of them. And I think the proportion now is even greater than half \nof them being trucks.\n  Think about all the product that is being moved east and west on I-\n80, and I am sure you are seeing it in Colorado as well, with people \nawaiting the delivery of those products across this Nation and paying \nhigher prices for those products because of the fuel it takes to fill \nthe trucks in order for them to deliver the product. So we are seeing \nthat not just at the pump but also in the pockets of consumers.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I don't see any solution on the Democratic side. They are \ntalking about more taxes on oil and gas production; they are talking \nabout more rules and regulations. I don't see any proposal that says we \nneed to increase the supply, as we do on the Republican proposal, where \nwe want to turn to oil shale, and to the Outer Continental Shelf, and \nwe turn to the futures market to try to put more enforcement there, and \nwe also work on the conservation side with the electric car.\n  Truckers are small business people, I attended a press conference \ntoday with truckers, I was struck by how conscious they were in trying \nto conserve. They were maintaining their trucks. They had great safety \nrecords. They were making sure the air in their tires was optimal so \nthey could improve the mileage on it. The trucker I heard this morning, \nhe was saying that about a year ago he was spending somewhere around \n$1,200 to $1,300 to make a trip from Virginia to Texas. There are no \nhigh mountain ranges such as we are used to in the West but a \nrelatively flat trip. This year it is up around $2,500, $2,600 to make \nthat same trip. It is getting close to double what he was paying last \nyear. That has to have an impact on the goods and services that are \nprovided in this country.\n\n  We need to be looking at real solutions. That is the point of this \ncolloquy. That is the point the Republicans are trying to make. Just \nstanding here debating on the floor of the Senate doesn't make a \ndifference. We need to have an opportunity where Republican Senators \ncan put their ideas forward. These need to be in the form of \namendments.\n  We need to pick our own amendments. The majority leader should not be \npicking our amendments. It happens he wants to dictate that process. \nThis is the Senate. This is where we should have open and free debate. \nI think if we had an opportunity to debate these amendments on the \nfloor we could change the direction of this country. I think we could \nchange the type of legislation that is being proposed as a solution.\n  Deep down I believe most Members of this Senate understand this is a \nsupply-and-demand problem and we need to produce more supply and we \nalso need to encourage more conservation. My hope is we will have an \nopportunity to make amendments to achieve this. I have made some of \nthose amendments in committee and found I had bipartisan support and \nhad commitments from both Democrats and Republicans that would help \nsupport my position on taking the moratorium off oil shale and similar \nmoratoria.\n  We are simply cutting off supplies to this country and we are \nbecoming more and more dependent on foreign oil. We are sending more \nthan $700 billion overseas to potentially our enemies--countries such \nas Iran and Venezuela, for example, and many of the Arab countries \nwhich are marginal friends. We have to admit, they are there one day \nand gone the next.\n  We will need to make sure we have the security we need in this \ncountry, both economically and from a military standpoint. That means \nwe need more oil and gas and not less. We need to have more energy from \nall over the energy spectrum and encourage the American people to \nconserve.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming for his contribution to this colloquy. \nI think he is doing a great job and Wyoming should be proud of him.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we started talking a little bit about \ncoal. I wish to say it is not just Wyoming and Montana, coal is \nabundant throughout the United States. Whether it is Pennsylvania--I \nsee our colleague from Pennsylvania is here. Actually, the whole region \nof Pennsylvania is called the coal region. He made mention of that. But \nin West Virginia and Illinois, coal is abundant, it is affordable, it \nis reliable and secure.\n  I appreciate the efforts my colleague from Colorado is engaged in, in \nterms of oil shale--another abundant source of energy that is not being \nutilized. It is American energy that can be used for the betterment and \nfuture of our great Nation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NUTRITION AND HUMAN \n                                 NEEDS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 40th anniversary of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. Today we \nrecognize the contributions of two members of that original committee, \nthe Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, Democratic \nSenator George McGovern of South Dakota and Republican Senator Bob Dole \nof Kansas. Both made and continue to make contributions in the war on \nhunger.\n  It was 40 years ago that CBS television aired a landmark documentary \nentitled, ``Hunger in America.'' This documentary exposed the magnitude \nof hunger that existed all across the Nation. For the first time, \nAmericans got a closeup look at the true faces of hunger--pregnant \nwomen and children who were malnourished, infants dying of starvation, \nstarving tenant farmers living just miles from this Nation's Capitol. \nTheir stories and their faces moved the Congress to try to end hunger.\n  It was just last month that I was privileged to have the opportunity \nto sit down with Senator McGovern to talk about the challenge of \ncombating hunger still today. As we were sitting talking, he related to \nme a story, 40 years later, that still has had a profound effect on him \nall these years later. The evening of that CBS television documentary \nbroadcast I spoke of, the evening that was on, Senator\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\nMcGovern and his family were gathered around the television set \nwatching the documentary. Senator McGovern still vividly remembers the \neffect one particular image from this documentary had on him at that \ntime.\n  The image was that of a school-age boy leaning against a wall while \nmost of his classmates ate lunch. The interviewer in the documentary \nasked the boy how he felt standing there, day after day, watching the \nother children eat.\n  His answer was not that he was angry or bitter but, rather, that he \nwas ashamed.\n  At that moment, Senator McGovern recalls telling his family that he, \nGeorge McGovern, as a Senator, and not that boy was the one who should \nhave been ashamed. I think what that shows is the humility and decency \nof George McGovern, first of all. But I think what he tried to convey \nto me in our conversation was that young person's response in that \ndocumentary--a person who was a victim of not having enough to eat--\nthat response had such a profound effect on Senator George McGovern \nthat he returned to the Senate the very next day and began working on a \nresolution to establish a committee to address hunger in this country. \nForty years ago today, that resolution was, indeed, enacted, \nestablishing the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs.\n  Senator McGovern chaired the committee from the time of its inception \nin 1968 until 1977, when the committee was absorbed into the \nAgriculture Committee, the committee we know today as the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, chaired by Senator Tom Harkin.\n  Senator McGovern was committed to exposing the failure of Federal \nfood assistance programs at that time and making reforms to ensure that \nthese programs were reaching those most in need. But knowing this was a \ngoal he could not achieve on his own, he reached across the aisle to \nform a key partnership with Senator Bob Dole, a partnership and an \nabiding friendship, I might add, that continues to this very day. \nDespite their differences, both these men share the conviction that \nending hunger is a moral imperative. Working together, Senators \nMcGovern and Dole set out to end hunger in America. Their work helped \neducate the Congress, the Federal Government, and the Nation at large \nabout the sheer magnitude of hunger in the United States. Over the next \ndecade, they and other members of this unique Senate committee \ndeveloped a bipartisan response to hunger and laid the foundation of \nour current food assistance programs.\n  Among their chief successes was reforming the Food Stamp Program, \nculminating in the passage of the Food Stamp Reform Act of 1977. This \nact made the program more efficient and more accessible to those most \nin need by finally eliminating the requirement that Americans pay for a \nportion of their own food stamps.\n  They expanded the National School Lunch Program and made the School \nBreakfast Program, the Childcare Food Program, and the Summer Food \nService Program permanent programs in our Government; and they \nestablished the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants \nand Children, better known today by the acronym WIC.\n  Forty years later, the programs that Senators McGovern and Dole \nchampioned and shepherded through the Senate have succeeded in \neliminating the most serious chronic malnutrition in the United States. \nToday, nearly 28 million Americans receive food stamps, more than 17.5 \nmillion low-income children receive free or reduced school meals, and \nmore than 8 million women and children receive WIC benefits.\n  The legacy of Senators McGovern and Dole is truly a testament to what \ncan be achieved when we work in a bipartisan fashion on shared \npriorities that address the basic needs of the American people.\n\n  These two men came from vastly different ends of the political \nspectrum and vehemently disagreed on many other issues, but they came \ntogether and both agreed that hunger was and is an issue that \ntranscends partisan politics. The bipartisan spirit with which these \ntwo men collaborated to fight hunger has certainly served as a model \nand a inspiration to me and I know to many others in Congress.\n  Following their example of bipartisanship, this year on the farm bill \nwe were able to provide a record level of nutrition funding to reform \nand strengthen Federal nutrition programs. We were able to make key \nimprovements to the Food Stamp Program itself, and we were able to \nstrengthen the domestic food assistance safety net by providing \nsignificant increased funding to increase commodity purchases for local \narea food banks.\n  But we all know the war on hunger requires constant vigilance and we \nmust recognize that unmet needs still exist in America. Despite the \nexistence of Federal food programs, hunger continues to be a serious \nproblem plaguing more than 35.5 million Americans, including 12.6 \nmillion children.\n  Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of hunger. Even \nmild malnutrition can have adverse impacts on health, development, \nbehavior, school attendance and performance and self-esteem as well. In \nthe coming year, we will have an opportunity to have a direct impact on \ncombating child hunger with reauthorization of the National School \nLunch Act. This legislation, which is set to expire September 30, 2009, \nauthorizes all Federal child nutrition programs.\n  One of the most important reforms that can be enacted is to expand \nthe school breakfast program. With 30 million children a day \nparticipating in the school lunch program, only one-third or 10 million \nchildren receive a school breakfast. We must find innovative ways to \nreach more of these children to get them breakfast.\n  There is a direct link between school breakfast and academic \nachievement, and if the United States is going to compete effectively \nin a new world economy, we must educate our children and to do that we \nmust provide the best possible nutrition at school.\n  We must also recognize that many low-income working parents with \nchildren are struggling to afford even the low fees charged for \nreduced-price school meals. According to the School Nutrition \nAssociation, approximately 1 million children in this country are \neligible for reduced-price meals and yet are not participating in the \nprogram due to the cost barrier. We must devise ways to ensure these \nchildren, too, are receiving proper nutritional assistance at school \nand do not fall through the cracks.\n  But providing adequate nutrition to the children during the school \nyear is only part of the answer. Congress also needs to implement \nchanges to ensure that the millions of children who rely upon school \nmeals are not left behind during the summer. Currently, only 2 in 10 \nchildren who benefit from school meals also receive meals during the \nsummer months. We must find ways to make programs such as the Summer \nFood Service Program more accessible to children, not only in metro \nareas but in rural areas as well.\n  Data from the USDA's Economic Research Service shows that as far back \nas at least 1970, the percentage of children living in poverty in rural \nareas consistently exceeds that of children in metro or urban areas.\n  A bill I have introduced with Senator Specter, my colleague from \nPennsylvania, S. 1755, the Summer Food Service Rural Explanation Act, \nwould lower the threshold for feeding sites in rural areas to qualify \nfor this program.\n  We hope to help to ensure the availability of summer meals for more \nof these children living in poverty who happen to live in rural areas. \nWe know that hunger itself does not take a vacation, and we owe it to \nthese children to ensure that the Food Assistance Program does not take \na vacation either.\n  Finally, Congress must continue to improve the quality of all \nnutrition assistance programs. One of the great ironies of the current \nchallenge is to recognize that hunger and obesity can exist at the same \ntime.\n  While we recognize we are facing huge Federal deficits, we must \nrefuse to let funding challenges serve as an impediment to these \ncritical changes. There is not a more important domestic social \nobjective facing us in the coming years than to provide adequate \nnutrition to children across America.\n  Finally, Senators Dole and McGovern blazed a path 40 years ago when \nthey joined to help fight the war on hunger. They put aside \npartisanship to bring light to the darkness of hunger. Now is\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\ntime for a new generation of leaders to pick up that mantra on behalf \nof the more than 35.5 million faces of American hunger.\n  I therefore call upon my friends in Congress, both Chambers, both \nsides of the aisle, to join me and millions of advocates across this \ncountry in a mission to end hunger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy comments Senator Bennett be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Casey, to support July 30, 2008, as the 40th \nanniversary of the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on \nNutrition and Human Needs.\n  Forty years ago there was a significant awakening in this country \nabout the issue of hunger and its impact on Americans. As the \nresolution states, the CBS award-winning documentary ``Hunger in \nAmerica'' was an important impetus to putting a human face on this \nsituation.\n  Like many Americans, Senators George McGovern of South Dakota and \nRobert Dole of Kansas were moved by this documentary, and thus into \naction. The first step was the creation of the Senate Select Committee \non Nutrition and Human Needs. The committee focused on the magnitude of \nhunger within our borders as well as shortcomings of existing domestic \nnutrition assistance programs.\n  For example, the Food Stamp Program required participants to purchase \na portion of their food stamp allotment which left many Americans \nunable to receive any benefit because they could not afford to buy \nstamps.\n  The work of the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs and the \nMcGovern-Dole partnership led to many improvements in our country's \nnutrition assistance safety net. Today, domestic food assistance \nprograms touch one in five Americans each year. The Food Stamp Program, \nwhich was recently renamed in the farm bill the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, is the cornerstone of this safety net by assisting \nover 27 million Americans each month.\n  The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and \nChildren, or WIC, serves 8.5 million Americans and provides expecting \nmothers and their young children with the nutrition needed for a \nhealthy start in life.\n  The National School Lunch Program provides over 31 million lunches \neach day and nourishes schoolchildren with balanced and healthy meals. \nAs a husband and father of public schoolteachers, I particularly know \nthe direct correlation between healthy, nutritious meals and the \nability of a child to learn.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program assists food banks all across \nthe country in meeting families' food needs in times of sudden \nhardship. I am very proud to serve as ranking member on the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. This committee ties \nthe important role of production agriculture to the necessity of \nensuring that all Americans have a safe, nutritious, and affordable \nfood supply.\n  The select committee we are honoring today is the predecessor of the \ncommittee's Subcommittee on Nutrition and Food Assistance, and the \nissues before it receive significant attention.\n  My colleagues on the committee and I share the determination to \nprovide an effective nutrition safety net, and we continue the \nbipartisan approach established by Senators McGovern and Dole. This is \nproven in the recently enacted 2008 farm bill, in which funding for \ndomestic nutrition assistance was substantially increased. Now, 73 \npercent of the total spending in the 2008 farm bill is allocated to \ndomestic nutrition assistance programs. Given rising food prices, we \nworked to lend a hand to those citizens in both rural and urban America \nwho are struggling to feed their families.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the fight against \nhunger.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate the yielding of the floor to me, but I \nunderstand Senator Lincoln was going to speak on this same subject. If \nshe is available, I would be happy to yield to her. I understand she \nwill be coming later so I will proceed.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, we have had a lot of debate, a lot of discussion that \ndoes not qualify as debate, over the last week or two with respect to \nenergy. I simply want to make a few comments of my own with regard to \nthat issue. The energy crisis we face is a worldwide crisis. It cannot \nbe solved with a national solution. But it is a national crisis as \nwell, and we need to do what we can as Americans toward finding the \nsolution. We need to help build a bridge, a bridge that can be a \nworldwide bridge to the long-term vision we have.\n  As we talk about that bridge, let's ask ourselves what is at the \nother end of the bridge? The vision people have at the other end of the \nbridge is a world that does not depend as heavily on fossil fuels as we \ndo today. It is a world that has nuclear power, it is a world that has \nwind power, and solar power, geothermal power, biomass, hydropower, and \none that I am particularly enthusiastic about is tidal power--the \nrising and falling of the tides being harnessed in generating \nelectricity.\n  All of those possibilities are there, and all of those possibilities \nshould be embraced, because all of them can contribute to the world we \nwant to be in 10, 15, 20 years from now.\n  We need to build a bridge to that world because that world is not \navailable now. There are wind farms, but they are producing a tiny \nfraction of the amount of electricity we use. There are solar panels \nthat are basically demonstrating the technology, but not producing \nanything like the kind of volume we would need. There are studies about \ntidal power. There are experiments going on with biomass. There are \nexplorations with geothermal. But all of those are in the future, 10 \nyears away, 15, 20, 30 years away. That is where we want to be, but we \nneed to build a bridge to get there.\n\n  Now, who is going to build it? I want Americans to be in the driver's \nseat of building the bridge and solving the problem. I want Americans \nto take the lead in figuring out what we need to do as a world to get \nto the other side of the bridge I have described.\n  I want Americans to once again achieve their ability to influence \nworld energy prices. There was a time when the Americans could \ndetermine the world price of oil simply by determining whether they \nwould drill another well in East Texas.\n  When the price of oil seemed to be too high, we could open up \nadditional areas of East Texas to exploration. East Texas was full of \noil and at the time, we led the world in oil production. Now that \nleadership is gone. It left the shores in the 1970s. It lies now with \nthe Saudi royal family.\n  If we are talking about building the bridge, I want the Americans to \nbe the ones to build the bridge. I want Americans to bring back to this \ncontinent our ability to affect the world's price of fossil fuels.\n  And how do we do that? Well, we do it simply by increasing the number \nof American sources of fossil fuels. That is how we were in charge of \nthe price of oil at one time, and that is how we can be in charge \nagain. A lot of people do not realize that America, though, is the \nthird largest oil-producing country in the world. Saudi Arabia is No. \n1, Russia is No. 2, America is No. 3. We used to be No. 1; we are now \nNo. 3.\n  If we can increase our ability to produce energy, we can control the \nbuilding of the bridge to the long-term future when we are no longer as \ndependent on fossil fuels as we are now. If we want to get to \nrenewables, we have to build a bridge to get there.\n  The material we will use to build that bridge will be American \nenergy. We have almost limitless sources to which we can turn to find \nthat American energy.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act, which I have cosponsored along with a \nnumber of my colleagues, outlines two of the areas where we can \nincrease American sources of energy and thus help build that bridge and \ncontrol, influence, and impact world energy prices.\n  The first one has to do with taking oil out of the Outer Continental \nShelf.\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nSince the early 1980s, we have prohibited drilling in 85 percent of our \nOuter Continental Shelf waters. It is interesting that this prohibition \ncame about the time that pricing power left the United States and went \ninto the hands of the Saudi royal family. It will not bring it back \nautomatically, but it will certainly make a major impact if we can now \nmake that 85 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf available for \nexploration and the delivery of oil.\n  We now know in a way we did not in the 1980s that it is safe because \nHurricane Katrina brutally told us that oil rigs can withstand \nvirtually any kind of pressure from the weather. It is not a lesson we \nwanted to learn in that way, but it is a lesson that we now know.\n  The other area in the Gas Price Reduction Act where we can find more \noil hits closer to my home in Utah. It would allow us to extract oil \nfrom oil shale. In eastern Utah, western Colorado and southern Wyoming, \nthere is more oil than there is in all of Saudi Arabia by a factor of \nthree. People say: ``But we do not have it yet. It is unproven \ntechnology,'' although oil shale is being turned into oil in other \ncountries of the world, just not this one. ``But new technology is \nbeing tried out. Well, it is 10 or 15 years away. It will be \nexpensive.''\n  I take you back to the proposition of the bridge. The world where we \ndrastically decrease our dependence on fossil fuels is far more than 10 \nyears away or even 15 years away. We cannot wish it into existence \nimmediately. It is hypocritical to say we are strongly for wind power \nand solar power and geothermal and biomass as the solution to our \nproblems, but we are opposed to oil shale and Outer Continental Shelf \ndrilling because they take years to develop.\n  If one is 20 years or 30 years away, and the other is only 10 years \naway, we should be working on the one that is only 10 years away at the \nsame time we are working on the one that is 30 or 40 years away.\n  America has fossil fuels that are abundant, available, and \naffordable, and that can be used as the source of building the bridge \nto the world of less dependence on fossil fuels. Our economy runs on \nenergy. The world economy runs on energy.\n  We cannot, while hoping that the land we dream of is available at \nsome point, refuse to build the bridge with America's available \nbuilding materials.\n  I hope as we wind down this debate and finally decide to do something \nabout it, we will be focused on taking the assets we already have and \nusing them as the material to build the bridge to get to the place \nwhere we want to go. If we do that, then our constituents will see the \nprice of gas come down at the pump. They will see movement in the right \ndirection as to where we want to be. They will say to us: You have \nfinally started to do your job in the way we sent you to Washington to \ndo it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about my support and \nencourage my colleagues to join me in revisiting and passing what we \ntried to do earlier today, and that was supporting the Jobs, Energy, \nFamilies, and Disaster Relief Act of 2008 on which we had a procedural \nmotion. I find this bill, in these last couple of days of our working \nperiod before we leave to return to our States, one of the most \nimportant things we can do. Is it everything we can do? No, it is not. \nWe can't do everything in one fell swoop. But there are a lot of things \nwe can do to get started.\n  I applaud the hard work that was put into this package by the Finance \nCommittee chairman, Senator Baucus. I also congratulate our \ncounterparts in the House Ways and Means Committee for their tremendous \nefforts in putting together this very important piece of legislation \nthat puts us off on a very sound footing and a good beginning, heading \nin the right direction of where we need to go.\n  The vote we took earlier today was the third time we have attempted \nto proceed to this very important package of tax incentives, the so-\ncalled tax extenders package, this year. Unfortunately, we do it every \nyear. Unfortunately, we patch over every year the opportunity we try to \nhave put forward by the Government, the incentives we need to create an \nenvironment. That is what government does. Government creates an \nenvironment where businesses, families, industries, and States can be \nsuccessful. That is exactly what this bill does. It is what we tried to \ndo earlier today. I hope we will continue to push forward in creating \nan environment where people and businesses can do for themselves in an \nenvironment that government has created, to take care of their issues, \nwhether they be disasters or a competitive nature across this globe, \nbut to use that environment to strengthen themselves, to build their \nbusinesses, their families, their communities in a way that has been \nconsistent with the American spirit through generations of great \nAmericans.\n  We tried three times, and I had so hoped that the third time would be \nthe charm. Maybe it is the fourth time. Maybe it is the fifth. I very \nmuch believe this is something we have to do, and we should do it \nbefore we leave to head home to our States for the break. During the \npast few months I have talked extensively about this extenders package \nand some of the things I think are so important. There are many \nbenefits here that working families will see, benefits for working \nfamilies, communities, businesses, so many of which are so needed at \nthis time. Under this legislation, some 1 million additional children \nwill be covered by the child tax credit and more than 27,000 American \nbusinesses will be able to remain globally competitive through the use \nof research and development tax credits. We are talking about a time \nwhen gas prices are high. Food prices are high. People are finding that \nthe dollars they are earning are not going as far. Yet they are still \ntrying hard to keep their body and soul and their families together. \nThey are still trying to do for their children and aging parents the \nthings that need to be done. One million additional children would have \nbeen covered in this bill with the child tax credit. These are \nextremely important policy initiatives we need to be providing, now \nmore than ever, for our American taxpayers.\n  In addition, there is almost $20 billion in incentives included in \nthis package to move us toward energy independence. We have heard all \nof our colleagues coming down here talking about energy independence, \ntalking about the dire straits working families are in. My State ranks \n48 in the low-income category of hard-working Americans. I know because \nin recent studies we have seen back in May, on average Arkansans were \npaying 8 percent of their income toward gasoline and in some other, \nmore desperate counties, they were paying up to 11 percent of their \nincome for fuel, particularly for gasoline. They are being hit hard.\n  There are some things we can do. This package will provide long-term \nextension of our renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits so \nwe can provide some certainty in these very important new industries \nthat are job creators but also the hope for the future of where we go \nin terms of energy needs. It creates a tax credit for consumers who \npurchase new technology, highly fuel-efficient vehicles. It also \ncontinues our commitment of moving toward alternative fuels through the \nextension of the renewable diesel and biodiesel tax credit.\n  We know there are a lot of opportunities we have. Yes, trying to deal \nwith the manipulation of markets by speculation is one route we need to \ntake. Yes, we know that making sure we are taking advantage of new \nresources and old resources that exist in our oil and gas industry is \nimportant. We know there are multiple things we can do in renewable \nfuels and a host of other areas where we can turn to that we never \nbelieved we could get fuel from, everything from biomass to algae, a \nwhole host of new technologies coming out, research that is proving to \nus that there is a whole new world out there of energy and energy \nsources. These are all initiatives in a bill that should have broad \nbipartisan support. We should enact them as soon as possible.\n  To be sure, there is certainly a lot more, whether it is speculation \nor drilling or other things, that we could be doing. There is more that \ncan be done to deal with our energy crisis. But the almost $20 billion \nin incentives included in this package is quite a downpayment in moving \nus in the right direction. To my friends on the other\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nside of the aisle who have been here on the floor this week arguing for \naction on energy legislation before we leave for August, I agree with \nyou. I think it is so important that we do something. We need to do \nsomething. We have to do something. This package we have seen come \nbefore us earlier today would have been a great first step. It still \ncan be. We need to make sure we are passing an extenders bill, coupled \nwith a host of other things that are essential for us to go home in \nAugust with to tell our constituents that we do hear the message they \nare sending. We could pass it with bipartisan support and get even more \ndone when we come back in September.\n  People know we are not going to do everything at once. They don't \nexpect that of us. But they do expect us to take, step by step, the \nopportunities we have to do something about the energy crisis.\n  We also have in this bill the highway trust fund. The needs in the \nhighway trust fund are tremendous. Come next month, we are going to see \na deficit there. We are going to see a crisis in our highway trust \nfund. We are going to have to deal with that. Why shouldn't we be \ndealing with it today or tomorrow but certainly before we leave?\n\n  Finally and most importantly, the chairman of the Finance Committee \nhas included a package of tax relief for areas all across the country \nhit with horrific weather and declared Federal disaster areas. This \nwill provide vital resources to help in recovery efforts all across the \nNation; in 26 States, to be exact. I am extremely thankful for the \ninclusion of this piece in the bill because Arkansas has suffered from \na string of tornadoes and record-setting floods. The series of natural \ndisasters in my home State this year has been unlike any I have seen in \nmy lifetime. It has left 62 of our 75 counties in Arkansas in need of \nFederal disaster assistance. Wave after wave of storms have rocked the \nresidents of Arkansas and have left many shell shocked.\n  It started on February 5 when a band of tornadoes created a path of \ndestruction, which we can see here, that stretched across 12 counties \nin Arkansas, killing 13 people, injuring 133, and destroying more than \n880 homes. It was the deadliest storm in nearly 10 years. On that day, \none tornado gouged a 123-mile path, hitting the ground, staying on the \nground for that long a period. Along the way, around 5:30 that \nafternoon, it hit a family-owned boat factory in Clinton, AR, where 16 \nemployees were in the factory at the time working late to load a \nshipment of boats on a truck. The F-4 tornado struck. Unfortunately, \nthe life of Thomas Armstrong was lost. The building was totaled. The \n20-year-old business that had produced 550 to 600 boats a year and \nprovided $15,000 a week in salaries to its 45 employees was a complete \nloss. As we can see here, it was completely destroyed.\n  I traveled with Senator Pryor and Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe to \nassess the damage across the State. In Van Buren County in central \nArkansas, 45 homes and countless businesses were destroyed. Conway \nCounty had 140 homes destroyed or that suffered major damage.\n  The hospital in Mountain View got hit as well. Within hours, hospital \nadministrators and personnel, helped by volunteers, reacted swiftly to \nstabilize the area. They were able to use the emergency room for \npersons with serious injuries and evacuated patients with nonlife-\nthreatening conditions to nursing homes and other facilities around the \ncounty. In the town of Highland in north central Arkansas, a facility \nthat housed the equipment for the volunteer fire department was \ncompletely destroyed.\n  A little more than a month later, heavy storms hit Arkansas again. \nThis time they brought rain and more rain and more rain. The result was \nflooding not seen in some areas for over 90 years. Thirty-five Arkansas \ncounties were declared disaster areas from the storm. In the town of \nPocahontas, the Black River crested at 26.5 feet, its highest level \nsince August of 1915, and three breaks in its levees flooded homes and \napartments. This is a scene from the Black River in Pocahontas in \nRandolph County.\n  In Des Arc, where I traveled with Governor Beebe, the White River \ncrested at a little more than 33 feet, almost 9 feet above flood stage. \nFurther up the White River, the community of Oil Trough got hit twice. \nThe first time it was only a few homes. Ten days later, rains came a \nsecond time and flooded the entire city, forcing residents and \nbusinesses to completely evacuate.\n  On April 3, another set of tornadoes hit central Arkansas. Although \nnot as deadly as the ones that hit us in February, four twisters \ntouched down in a five-county area, including some of the counties \nsuffering from those floods. In addition, two more rounds of tornadoes \nhit the State in May, bringing the total to 62 counties affected by \nthese storms that hit this year.\n  All but 13 counties in my State have been declared Federal disaster \nareas, causing millions of dollars in property damage and at least 26 \nknown deaths. While it has been a traumatic few months for thousands of \nArkansans, I have been struck, of course, by the resiliency of my \nState's residents. I have always said the people of Arkansas are our \ngreatest resource, whether it is to the rest of this country and what \nwe have to offer or whether it is to one another. Their ability to \npitch in and help their neighbors has been nothing short of \nextraordinary. But they need help to finish the job.\n  This bill we tried to pass earlier today and in weeks past provides \nneeded assistance. That is why I am so grateful Chairman Baucus has \nincluded this tax incentive package for individuals who have \nexperienced loss from these horrific disasters.\n  This tax relief will help my Arkansas families deal with expenses \nrelated to debris removal, cleanup, and repair. It will allow them to \nadjust their taxable income, taking into account property losses they \nhave suffered. It will allow them to access their own savings they have \ntucked away in IRAs and other retirement plans penalty free. It will \nprovide a credit for small businesses that continue paying their \nemployees while their business is inoperable and being rebuilt. These \nimportant provisions, among others, will do wonders for my Arkansas \nfamilies and businesses impacted by these unbelievable storms and \nflooding.\n  And I am not alone. Many of my neighboring States--Missouri, \nMississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky--experienced the \nsame storms Arkansas did, and they are suffering in the same ways--not \nto mention the floods that impacted individuals in Iowa, Indiana, \nNebraska, and Kansas in recent months, who all would benefit from this.\n  I recognize this package of disaster relief may not be as generous as \nsome may have preferred. But it is a good package. It is a consensus \npackage. If passed, it will provide immediate relief for all of our \nstorm victims.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the value in this package. I urge \nthem to take a close look and recognize the benefits it will bring to \ntheir communities that are suffering so desperately.\n  We should stand together. We should all look around this room and \nunderstand we are here together as a body to represent this great land, \neach of our States, of course, but to recognize as neighbors we all \nhave shared in much disaster. We should stand together to do the right \nthing and enact this package--if we get another opportunity--of broad-\nbased tax relief that will help our working families, our businesses, \nand our damaged communities.\n  There is certainly a great opportunity here if all of us band \ntogether and realize that in the next 2 days before we leave we have \nthis wonderful opportunity to come together to do something for our \nNation. I hope we will. I encourage my colleagues to ask to be able to \ncome back to that relief package as well as that tax incentive package \nthat will do so much.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                            Predator Wolves\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the next few moments, I wish to change \nthe pace of our debate on the floor of the Senate. I am pleased the \nSenator from Montana is now the Presiding Officer in the Senate because \nI want to tell that Senator I am a cosponsor of a piece of legislation \nhe and the Senator from Wyoming have introduced that would provide \ngrants to Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, and to tribes and other States, \nat the discretion of the\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\nSecretary of the Interior, to support landowner actions to prevent \nlivestock predation, and to compensate landowners for a loss of \nlivestock by gray wolves and other predator species.\n  Why would I come to the floor of the Senate and want to talk about \nwolves? Well, let me tell you what happened in the States of Idaho, \nMontana, and Wyoming in 1995.\n  In my opinion, the Secretary of the Interior at that time, Secretary \nBruce Babbitt, Secretary to the administration of Bill Clinton, did \nsomething that I said at the time I believed to be a direct violation \nof Federal law and congressional intent. He allowed the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service to go into Canada, collect Canadian gray wolves, bring \nthem into the lower 48, and in the late fall or early winter of 1995, \nhe dropped 15 of those wolves into a wilderness area in Idaho--\ncertainly satisfying the wishes of a lot of environmental interests, \nbut, in my opinion, directly violating the language of an Interior \nappropriations bill, language that I and the then Senator from Montana, \nMr. Conrad Burns, had put in the bill saying: None of these moneys \nshall be used for the purposes of introducing gray wolves into Idaho, \nMontana, and Wyoming.\n  Well, Bruce Babbitt did it, with great fanfare, with great public \nattention, and with a very large smile on his face.\n  Then, in 1996, he introduced another 20 wolves into central Idaho. \nWhat is the end result of what happened? This was the effort to do what \nwe called the introduction of an experimental number of wolves back \ninto a habitat that wolves once roamed wild in. It was supposed to be a \nlimited experiment of what we called an experimental herd or pack, or \npacks, of wolves, an experimental species, and it was to be limited. We \nsaid at that time that when the number reached a certain number--at \nleast 100 breeding pairs in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming--it would no \nlonger be experimental, and it would no longer be endangered, and the \nextraordinary protection of the Endangered Species Act would come off.\n  That simply did not happen. Today, we literally have thousands of \nwolves roaming the States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Some would \nsay: Oh, isn't that wonderful, and isn't that exciting, and isn't that \nnatural? Well, it may be natural in relation to 1880 or 1890, and it \nmay be wonderful for some who behold the dream of an unoccupied great \nWest. But to those of us who live in the West today, who live in an \noccupied area, where domestic livestock graze, and where the human \nspecies loves to camp, we have a problem. Our problem is quite simple. \nWolves protected have no predator. The human species is the only \npredator. And in the absence of our ability to control them, they \nmultiply very rapidly in an unlimited area with an unlimited feed \nsource. Their feed or food source--their prey base--happens to be what \nwas once the great elk herds of Idaho along with our deer population. \nAnd now, as they have begun to decimate those populations, they are \nbeginning to pick off domestic livestock, both cattle and sheep, that \ngraze on these public lands.\n  This map I have in the Chamber demonstrates, from the 35 wolves that \nwere dumped into Idaho in 1995 and 1996--in approximately this area--\nthe phenomenal spread that has occurred across the entire State of \nIdaho, into Montana, and down into Wyoming, in areas where we believe \nthere could well be more than 3,000 wild roaming wolves.\n  So the Department of Interior then said: It is now time we delist \nthese wolves. We thought that was going to work until again a judge, \nwho probably knows nothing about wolves, listened to a couple \nenvironmental groups, and said: I don't think we ought to allow that to \nhappen. As a result, all of that effort was stopped. But still the \ntaking of domestic livestock--both cattle and sheep--continues to this \nday.\n  I have served on the Appropriations Committee. In the absence of us \ndoing the right and responsible thing, I kept adding money every year \nnot only for the management and the shaping of these wolf populations, \nbut also to offer some compensation to ranchers--both cattle and \nsheep--who were losing their livestock.\n  The Senator from Montana, who is presiding at this moment, the \nSenator from Wyoming and I have joined--they have introduced the \nlegislation; I am a cosponsor--to hopefully bring about a stabilized \nfund to offset the literally hundreds of thousands of dollars our \nranchers are now losing, all in the good name of Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt of the Clinton administration, who had the wonderful dream that \nhe could take a West once unoccupied by the human species and \nrepopulate it with a wolf.\n\n  Need I say more? A wolf is not a kind, sweet, and cuddly little \nanimal. They are large. They are aggressive. They drag down elk, moose, \ndeer. And they are now beginning, as I have said, to take domestic \nlivestock.\n  A week ago, a young man, who was out training his hounds by chasing \nbear, ran into a pack of wolves. The wolves chased the guy off and \nkilled all the hounds. Some of these well-trained hounds are worth \n$4,000 and $5,000 apiece. There was absolutely nothing that gentleman \ncould do. Could he shoot the wolves? No. No, it is against the law, the \nFederal law, that he dare touch them. So he had to watch his beloved \ndogs eaten.\n  That is happening more and more every day in Idaho, as this map grows \nmore and more covered with incidents of packs and individual and \ncollective numbers of wolves. It is true in my State of Idaho. It is \ntrue in the State of the Senator from Montana. It is certainly true in \nWyoming.\n  As we try to bring these wolf populations under control, we have \ninterest groups and a Federal judge who raps his gavel and says: No.\n  The State of Idaho is attempting, under this Secretary of the \nInterior, and others, to take reasonable and responsible control of \nthem, and to once again shape these populations of wolves so wolves can \nonce again be in Idaho and, at the same time, to recognize the need to \nmaintain populations of elk and deer is what we want to do. And it is \nwhat the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Commission and Fish and Wildlife \nagencies were doing in a responsible way--until, once again, a Federal \njudge intervenes, who knows little to nothing about the species itself, \nor probably the law, and says: I guess maybe that environmental group \nis right. Maybe we need more wolves so we get a genetically clear \nbalance. We are more interested in the genetics of the wolf than we are \nthe decimation of the elk herds, the deer populations, and the domestic \nlivestock.\n  I have said with great trepidation, but I say in all sincerity: Do we \nhave to wait until a wolf drags down a human species before there is a \nsense of alarm? Because they have now penetrated all of Idaho. They are \nliterally in our backyards. Yet the romance goes on about this great \ndream of a wild West where you can hear the lonesome wolf howl at \nnight. And they are howling. They are howling loudly right in our \nbackyards. And a blind Federal agency and a blind Federal judge and a \nromantic environmental theory says that is OK.\n  It is tragic for the wolf because, ultimately, these populations will \nhave to be brought under control. It is tragic for Idahoans and folks \nin Montana and Wyoming to see their pets and their domestic livestock \ndragged down and killed, with little if anything they can do about it.\n  I hope my colleagues would support S. 2875, as a minimal stopgap to \nprovide these domestic livestock operators with some compensation for \nthe losses they are now taking because Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the \nInterior under the Clinton administration, had a wonderful and wild \nwestern dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Nine and a half minutes. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, it is no doubt that the American people are engaged on \nthe question of energy, and gasoline prices primarily. But they are \nworried about their country. They are worried about their own budgets. \nThey are worried about the direction the Nation is heading and the fact \nthat we are becoming more and more dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy. It impacts our national security as well as our economy.\n  We know that now $600 billion, perhaps $700 billion a year of \nAmerican wealth is transferred abroad on an annual basis to purchase \nthe 60 percent of\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nimported oil we utilize in America, in our transportation system \nprimarily. That is a wealth transfer the likes of which the world has \nnever seen. It is not good for our economy.\n  The average family--and I have calculated it based on a two-car \nfamily driving 24,000 miles a year--is paying $105 more per month for \ngasoline than they were 1 year ago using the same number of gallons of \ngasoline. This is a big deal. There is no doubt about it. After our \nfamilies pay their taxes, after they pay their Social Security, after \nthey pay their house payment, their insurance, their retirement, and \ntheir other bills, now $105 more every month is hitting them because of \nincreased gas prices, and 60 percent of that money is going abroad to \npurchase the gasoline in a wealth transfer that is adversely affecting \nour economy. This is a national crisis. There is no doubt about it.\n\n  This Nation needs to do something real. We need to take action that \nwill work. I am, frankly, very open to a lot of different ideas that we \nmight be able to adopt. I think both parties have ideas that would \nwork. We need conservation. We need biofuels. We need more production \nof energy at home. All of those things, it seems to me, are quite \npossible. This Government should accelerate it and make it a reality. \nYet we remain here, unable to act in any way it seems.\n  For example, agriculture. Yes, crop prices, commodity prices are up, \nbut the fuel that is utilized on the farm has doubled. Fertilizer \nprices, which come so often from natural gas, have also doubled. Our \nchemical industry, most of it is a worldwide industry. They have \nplants, these big chemical companies do, all over the world. When they \ndecide where they are going to make a new chemical, they ask who has \nthe lowest price for energy. Natural gas is often a component of new \nchemicals and because of prices--we have seen a flat or declining \nchemical industry and an expansion of it in other places where the \nprice of energy is lower.\n  I believe the future of the American economy is at stake. We must \ncarry out conservation efforts. I see my esteemed colleague, Senator \nBingaman, here. He had a hearing a week or so ago and he has had some \nof the best hearings on energy. I am honored to serve on his committee. \nWe had some fabulous hearings with some wonderful witnesses. The \nhearing I refer to included Dr. David Green at the Oak Ridge Center in \nTennessee, a National lab, a Federal lab, as a witness, and he made a \nseries of suggestions for immediate actions on energy. This is just to \nincrease the miles per gallon that we get. His first thing is driver \nbehavior. He contends that the average driver, if they drove better, \ncould save 10 percent. Curb aggressive driving, observe the speed \nlimits, don't carry extra weight in your car, have vehicle maintenance, \nhave realistic speed limits. For every 5 miles per hour over 55, the \nfuel economy, Dr. Green says, declines 7 percent.\n  He talks about heavy trucks. Improved aerodynamics on the truck could \nsave up to 600 gallons per year--just doing that--and other suggestions \nhe made--low-rolling resistance tires. Better tires get better gas \nmileage. Driver training can be a big asset, updating fuel economy \nstandards, the labeling of used cars. When people go out and buy a used \ncar, it wouldn't be hard to have posted the mileage of all used cars so \nthat the person could see what that mileage would be if they bought \nthat particular used vehicle. He goes on with a number of other things.\n  I say that just to point out that he was just one witness in one \narea: automobiles and vehicles. There are many more things we can do to \nconserve fuel and I support this.\n  I believe we ought to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as soon \nas possible. I believe we should get away from them as much as we \npossibly can and reduce our imports. This would include, for me, \nsupporting investment in and promoting hydrogen vehicles and fuel cell \nvehicles. I think natural gas vehicles do have a role to play. Produce \nmore diesel vehicles that get 35 to 40 percent better gas mileage. Half \nthe cars in Europe are diesel; we only have 3 percent. Why is Europe \ndoing that? They get better gas mileage. They tax diesel less in \nEurope; we tax diesel more. We have a new sulfur diesel fuel that is \nextremely clean.\n  All right. I think we are in a position--and I think the Presiding \nOfficer understands this--the American people want us to do something. \nWe need to reach across the aisle and accomplish something.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have to conclude that this is the problem. I don't \nbelieve it is the Democrats I know in Alabama, or I don't believe it is \nall the Democratic Senators and Congressmen I know in Washington, but \nlet me tell my colleagues what is happening and where we are and how we \nhave reached an impasse that has to be broken.\n  Former Vice President Gore, a former Democratic nominee for President \nof the United States, made a speech recently and said that within 10 \nyears, we should generate all of our electricity without any fossil \nfuels. Half of our electricity today is coal. Twenty percent is natural \ngas. He would eliminate all of that and replace it with biofuels, with \nsolar, wind, and the like. That is a radical proposal--a proposal that \nis not within the realm of possibility. It is a stunning idea that \nsimply cannot be achieved that fast. I would favor it as soon as we \ncould, but we have no way of doing that.\n  Senator Obama, the Presidential nominee now, praised that speech. He \ndidn't adopt everything in it, thank goodness, but he did praise Gore \nand his speech. He has indicated he opposes further drilling, and he is \nat best lukewarm, if not unfavorable, to nuclear power.\n  The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said she \nwanted to save the planet. She has been opposing any production through \ndrilling or shale oil or clean coal or offshore production. Our own \nleader, Senator Harry Reid, has said sometimes he favors production, \nbut his only proposal he has brought forth on the floor of the Senate \nis to sue OPEC for not producing enough oil. I would suggest we could \nsue the Congress for not producing enough oil in America. He wanted to \ntax oil companies, which means you certainly would not get any more oil \ndoing that. Now, we have a speculation bill. Not one of those three \npieces of legislation actually would produce any energy.\n  So let's get out of this. This is not a position the Democratic Party \ncan take. It is not a position a majority of Democrats in America \nbelieve in. I am prepared to meet halfway. Let's move to hybrids any \nway we can. Let's do more biofuels. I think that can work. Let's go to \nwind, producing as much and as fast as we can. I am for whatever works \nif it is reasonable and not placing an unfair burden on the American \npeople.\n  All I can say is, we are seeing a position here that is not \nacceptable. It is radical. It is damaging our economy. It is saying we \nwill not do the things necessary to create a bridge to get us to \nnuclear power, clean fuels in the future that can get us off fossil \nfuels.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I heard President Bush's statement at \nthe White House today, and I have to be very blunt. I think the \nPresident must think the American people are stupid. For 7\\1/2\\ years \nwe have had two oilmen in the White House, with Republican majorities \nin Congress for 6 years, and we have seen gas prices go from $1.46 when \nPresident Bush took office to over $4--to about $4 now; it went over $4 \nat one point--per gallon. Now he would have us believe, after that 7\\1/\n2\\ years--Republican majorities for 6 of those 7\\1/2\\ years and having \nthe oil industry write the energy policy with Vice President Cheney in \nthe White House--now he would have us believe, in fact, that we are \nresponsible for this.\n  It is a good lawyer's game. When you don't have the facts on your \nside, when you don't have the law on your side, you pound on the table \nand create a diversion. That is what they have done--tried to create a \ndiversion. The American people are a lot smarter than that.\n  The fact is, Democrats cannot act as we want to on the energy crisis \nbecause the Republican Party simply won't allow us. We have a slim \nmajority in the Senate, and by Senate rules, the\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\nRepublicans can filibuster to require us to get 60 votes for anything. \nThat really means, in essence, for those watching, they have the \nability to block any legislation they want, and they have used that \npower to the hilt. Over 90 times they have used this procedural tactic \nto block much needed legislation. Even though we are in the midst of an \nenergy crisis, they are still blocking everything.\n  At first they said they were blocking us from our work because they \nwanted a vote on opening our shores to oil drilling--something I don't \nsupport--but the majority leader said OK. We will give you a vote on \nopening our shores to oil drilling.\n  Then the Republicans said: Oh, that is not good enough either. \nInstead, they claimed to want to vote on opening the shores to oil \ndrilling, a vote on nuclear power, a vote on oil shale development, a \nvote on their larger package of proposals, and guess what. The majority \nleader said earlier this week: OK, you can have a vote on all of that. \nYet, somehow, every time the majority leader offers the other side \nvotes on exactly what they want, they keep saying that is not good \nenough. They simply won't take yes for an answer.\n  I hear their speeches. They all mention speculation. Well, we have \nhad testimony that, in fact, speculation in the marketplace could raise \noil by $50 per barrel. We even saw a company that was just taken by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission being charged with having \nmanipulated the marketplace--made $1 million in 11 days and increased \ngas and oil prices. Yet they won't let us go to speculation. They say \none thing, they do another.\n  The big issue they keep talking about is production, but the \nRepublicans don't want production. They simply don't want us to have \nprogress. That is their game plan. They have a political equation, and \nit is: Don't let anything be achieved.\n  On five separate occasions, they have had the opportunity to vote for \nenergy production. They have had the opportunity to keep the rapidly \ndeveloping wind and solar industries growing at an accelerated pace, \nbut instead they decide to play politics. The Republican Party doesn't \nseem to take renewable energy seriously. It is true that renewables are \nessential for our environment, essential for our economy. What these \nindustries really represent are an opportunity to produce massive \namounts of domestic energy cheaply and at least 100,000 new high-paying \njobs in America.\n  Now, if you don't think renewables are serious business, just ask \nlandowners in Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, or Wyoming who are, in fact, \nreceiving $3,000 to $5,000 per month for allowing a windmill to be \nsited on their property or ask oilman T. Boone Pickens, who is plowing \nbillions of dollars of his own money into wind energy and a plan to use \nrenewables to end our addiction to oil.\n  Now, somebody who has made a lot of money in oil doesn't all of a \nsudden plow billions of dollars of his own money into renewable energy \nunless he thinks there is going to be a payoff at the end. He \nunderstands.\n  In my home State of New Jersey we have windmills in Atlantic City, \nwhere the casinos are, generating a lot of electricity. Last year we \ninstalled enough turbines to power over 1.5 million homes. The solar \npower industry is growing at over 40 percent a year.\n  These technologies work. They are working now. They are in high \ndemand. They produce an enormous amount of energy. We need to \naccelerate and expand that. If we extend the wind and solar tax credits \nso these industries can continue their rapid growth, we could add 150 \ngigawatts of installed capacity within 10 years. Now, what does that \nmean? That means that we would have enough electricity to power over 37 \nmillion homes. At that rate, by 2030, we could get over 25 percent of \nour Nation's electricity from wind and solar power.\n  The package of tax credits that the Republicans continue to block--\nblocked again today--represents a solution also for the high price of \noil. There is a large tax credit for the purchase of plug-in hybrid \nvehicles--cars, for example, such as the Chevy Volt, which will be able \nto run on electricity for the first 40 miles after being plugged in. \nThat means a full three-quarters of all trips--all trips--driven by \nAmericans would not use a drop of gas. If projections by some of the \nexperts hold true, and half the cars on the road in 2030 are plug-in \nhybrids, we could easily cut our use of oil by 10 percent, and some \nwould suggest that we could even displace much more. And by this time, \nwe would be producing enough renewable energy to power all these cars \nand still have electricity to spare. If we want cheap gasoline and we \nwant to be free from imported oil, we need to pass the tax credit \nextensions, and we need to build plug-in hybrids, solar panels, and \nwinds turbines, to name a few. It is that simple.\n\n  It is time for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stop \nexploiting our energy crisis for big oil's gain and let us vote on the \nthings that will actually produce energy.\n  Instead, they insist on holding up everything for an absurd plan \nthat, according to the Energy Information Agency, will not produce \nenergy at all for 10 years and, in 2030, will only produce enough \nadditional gasoline for the equivalent of a few tablespoons per \nAmerican car.\n  Let me try to put their plan into perspective. Since April of this \nyear, Americans seeing the high cost of gas have actually reduced their \nconsumption by 800,000 barrels of oil a day more than we did year ago. \nThis is the most significant and sudden drop in oil since the 1970s. \nBut what happened, even though we have reduced 800,000 barrels of oil \nevery day? Prices went up.\n  In recent weeks, in response to record oil prices, Saudi Arabia \nproduced an additional half-million barrels of oil more each day. What \nhappened? Prices went up.\n  So how does the Bush-McCain drilling plan compare to these recent \nevents? Well, based upon the Bush administration Energy Information \nAgency's own analysis, if we open all our shores to oil production, the \nfirst drop of oil would not be seen for almost a decade, and offshore \noil production would peak in the year 2030. Then it would peak at only \n200,000 barrels a day.\n  So, in fact, if 800,000 barrels a day in reduced consumption combined \nwith an increase of 500,000 barrels a day in extra production hasn't \nlowered gas prices one bit, it is clear that the production of 200,000 \nversus a combination of 1.3 million barrels in reduced demand or \nincreased production--200,000 barrels in the year 2030--is going to do \nabsolutely nothing about gas prices.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Agency says that adding those 200,000 \nbarrels per day in production in 2030 will lower the price of gasoline \nby less than a penny per gallon.\n  Let me repeat that. The Republican production plan to open all our \nshores to drilling and risk the environmental consequences we saw, for \nexample, in the Gulf of Mexico during Katrina and Rita, with 700,000 \ngallons of oil spilled and 7 million spilled on land by the facilities \nthat bring that oil to the marketplace, would not lower gas prices but \nabout a penny in 2030.\n  Let's compare these numbers with what renewables have to offer. \nRemember, if we pass the renewable energy tax extender credits, we \ncould produce massive amounts of electricity from renewable \ntechnologies. We hear this constantly being discussed by the \nRepublicans, but they don't let us vote on it. Remember that the tax \nextenders will help us rapidly deploy plug-in hybrid technology so we \ncan use this electricity for transportation.\n  By some projections, this means that by 2030, the same time period \nthey are drilling off the shore with the risk that comes to a $200 \nbillion coastal economy, we could replace 2 million to 3 million \nbarrels of oil per day with electricity. Compare 2 million to 3 million \nbarrels to a measly 200,000 barrels per day by the drilling.\n  Some, such as the DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, \nprojected we could actually displace 3 times as much, or 6.5 million \nbarrels per day by 2030 versus 200,000 barrels in this big drill, \ndrill, drill.\n  I don't quite get it. You can save the equivalent of 6.5 million \nbarrels every day in energy by pursuing the renewables that they say \nthey support but don't vote for or you can have 200,000 versus 6.5 \nmillion by virtue of drilling 30 years from now. So this, of course, \nmeans that for us to achieve this, we need to get beyond the Republican \nefforts to stop us from maintaining the\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\ntax incentives we have. It means we actually have to get serious about \nour energy policies and start a serious effort to run our \ntransportation fleet on electricity.\n  That is what voters have to decide on this fall. Do they want to vote \nfor the party of big oil, the party that saw the dramatic increase in \ngas over the administration's lifetime, where they wrote the rules and \nthe law at the White House, sitting with the Vice President of the \nUnited States--do they want to vote for big oil that has record \nprofits, starting with ConocoPhillips? I can't wait for tomorrow, or \nthe day after, when ExxonMobil puts out their record profits. We are \ntalking about billions in record profits. Do they want to vote for big \noil, which concocted a plan that does nothing but enrich the oil \ncompanies?\n  This is about one last grab before the administration goes out of \noffice. They already have 68 million acres in this country that they \nhave access to. Now they say we cannot do this or that. They have 68 \nmillion acres. They have millions of acres in the Outer Continental \nShelf that are not subject to the moratorium. They have areas in the \ngulf they have not pursued.\n  The bottom line is that plenty of drilling can take place, and they \nhave not done it. Even the President of the American Petroleum \nInstitute says we don't have the infrastructure or the resources to do \nit. All this talk about drill, drill, drill, which would only produce \n200,000 barrels in 2030 versus 6.5 million barrels of reduced demand in \noil--that would do something about the gas prices--and not letting us \ntake out the speculation in the marketplace, which would reduce oil $50 \nper barrel, some experts say, but they would not let us vote on that. \nThey would not let us vote on the tax extenders.\n  So this is not about creating production, this is about stopping \nprogress. This is about a Republican game plan that says we will send \nthe Congress home without having done anything about dealing with gas \nprices, and the minority will face the consequences. They are so sadly \nmistaken that the American people will not see through 6.5 years of \nrecord gas prices, record oil profits, unwilling to allow us to deal \nwith speculation or deal with production and what the energy tax \nextenders provide, unwilling to allow us to pursue conservation, \nunwilling to let the American people get the relief they want.\n  That is why I truly believe that if they continue on this course, the \nNation will suffer and consumers will suffer. But they will suffer at \nthe polls come November.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                       Tax Extenders Legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes here on a \nWednesday afternoon. We are not toward the end of the week yet, but as \nmost people know who observe the Congress and Senate in session, once \nyou get to Wednesday afternoon, you sort of have a feel for how much \nyou are going to be able to accomplish during the week.\n  I think it is fair to say we have not been able to accomplish much so \nfar this week. This is sort of a last-ditch effort to encourage us to \ntry to do something constructive before we leave town, before the \nAugust recess.\n  Let me try to put this debate in the general terms that I understand \nit. There are two packages of legislation that relate to our energy \nchallenges which we have been talking about--two notional packages of \nlegislation. One--and this is the one most of the speeches are probably \nabout--relates to the general problem of high gas prices, which is a \nserious problem for all Americans. This set of speeches is not about a \nparticular bill because we don't have a bill that has come out of any \ncommittee in the Senate dealing with this problem of high gas prices. \nThere are bills the Republican leader has introduced on the subject, \nand there is the bill to deal with the part of the problem relating to \nspeculation, which the Democratic leader has introduced, the majority \nleader. We have not been able to move ahead on that. There have been \nrepeated efforts, and we have been blocked at every turn.\n  The other package is the one I wish to talk about. I spoke about it \nbriefly yesterday. I wish to talk about it again because I think it is \nextremely important. It is, in my opinion, the most important \nlegislation we could pass and take action on this week. This relates to \nthe extension of various tax provisions that are currently in the law \nor that have been in the law but expired this last year. I will briefly \ntalk about that.\n\n  Some of those tax provisions relate to energy. Many of them do not. \nMany relate to other items, other matters that are extremely important \nas well. Let me talk about how important this legislation is to our \neconomy, to American jobs, and to our energy challenge as well. First, \nI will talk about the provisions in the tax law that expired at the end \nof last year. These are provisions we need to extend in order that \nAmericans will not face substantially higher taxes when they go to pay \ntheir taxes next spring. I am talking about things such as the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Most Americans don't have to worry about the alternative minimum tax. \nUnfortunately, the way it is written today, unless we pass legislation \nsuch as what I will argue for here, we are going to have millions of \nAmericans have to calculate their taxes pursuant to the AMT and \nactually pay increased taxes because of the alternative minimum tax \nthis next year if we don't pass that legislation.\n  We have a provision for a child tax credit. You would think there \nwould be strong support for maintaining the child tax credit that \nAmericans believe is part of the Tax Code. Unfortunately, it expired at \nthe end of last year. If we don't pass legislation such as what I am \ntalking about, such as what we tried to pass earlier today, the child \ntax credit is not part of the law.\n  The qualified tuition deduction for higher education expenses, again, \nthis is something that is very important to many families in this \ncountry who have children or where one spouse or the other is going to \nschool and they need that tuition deduction for higher education \nexpenses.\n  Also, there are the provisions for retirees to be able to make tax-\nfree IRA rollovers to qualified charitable organizations. These are \nexamples of provisions that Americans think are in the Tax Code--and \nthey are, except they expired at the end of last year. We need to go \nahead and legislate to reestablish those so people can take advantage \nof them when they file their tax returns next year.\n  All of that is contained in this legislation that failed earlier \ntoday on the Senate floor--failed in our efforts even to proceed to \nconsider the legislation, in order to be specific about it.\n  Let me talk about the energy provision. There are also, in the tax \nlaw today, several important provisions to encourage production of \nenergy from alternative sources--production of energy from wind farms, \nwind turbines, from solar concentrating facilities, and production of \nenergy from photovoltaic cells that people put on their homes. This is \nlegislation that was enacted--most of it--in 2005. I was honored to be \npresent in 2005 in my home State of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, when \nPresident Bush traveled there and stood with Senator Domenici and \nmyself and others at the time to announce that he was signing the 2005 \nEnergy bill.\n  There are some who criticize that bill, but I think there were many \ngood provisions in it, and some of those provisions are these I am \ntalking about right now--the production tax credit for wind energy, the \ninvestment tax credit for solar energy. Those provisions, \nunfortunately, were only enacted through the end of 2008, and that is \nabout, as we can all tell by looking at the calendar, 5 months down the \nroad. So companies that are thinking of investing in projects--under \nthe law, the way we wrote those provisions, the project has to be \nactually completed and in operation prior to the expiring of the tax \ncredit in order for them to get the tax benefit.\n  Obviously, companies are now looking at this expiration date of \nDecember 31 coming up and they are saying: Wait a minute, hold off, we \nare not going to build that wind farm, we are not going to construct \nthat concentrating solar power facility, we are not going to put those \nphotovoltaic solar cells in place because we don't know if Congress is \ngoing to extend this provision or not extend this provision.\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n  The vote we had earlier today is not encouraging at all in that \nregard because it is a signal to the business community that, in fact, \nCongress is not going to be able to generate the votes necessary to \nextend that provision.\n  As I understand it, all Democrats who were present voted for \nproceeding to the bill so we could bring it up, debate it, pass it--at \nleast I hope pass it. I believe five of our Republican colleagues \njoined us in that effort. But we need more. We cannot get to the 60-\nvote threshold that is needed without more support from our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  The arguments used against going ahead are numerous, and they are \nchanging all the time. Let me briefly go through these arguments.\n  A main argument is they like the provisions, they support the \nprovisions, they just don't like the so-called offsets. They don't like \nthe idea that we are generating revenue somewhere else to offset the \nlost revenue from extending these provisions. That is the argument.\n  There are variations on that. One variation is, these are temporary \ntax provisions, and we are making changes in the Tax Code of a \npermanent nature in order to offset the loss of revenue. At any rate, \nwe tried to fix that, and I think we have fixed that in the bill \nSenator Baucus offered earlier today.\n  Another argument is these are in current law. We don't want to offset \nanything in current law. We want to extend current law from now on even \nthough we were not able to do it under the original budget we are \noperating under. So that argument is being made.\n  The other argument that is being made, unfortunately, at this point \nis that somehow or other there is a procedural advantage to refusing to \nallow us to deal with this legislation. There is some advantage that is \nbeing argued accrues to the Republican side in their larger debate \nabout drilling offshore; somehow it helps their position that we ought \nto drill offshore if they deny us the right to extend these alternative \nenergy tax provisions, the research and development tax provision, the \nchild tax credit, and a variety of other provisions. I have trouble \nunderstanding that argument, but it is being made, and somehow it seems \nto be persuasive to an awful lot of our colleagues.\n  Let me briefly review the bidding here. As far as I understand, the \nprocedure we have gone through this week is on Monday, the majority \nleader offered debate and votes on domestic production and other \nmatters. I believe the Republican leader at that time indicated he \nwould respond later.\n  On Tuesday, I believe Senator Vitter from Louisiana announced that he \nhad seven amendments on energy that he would like to have considered. \nTuesday afternoon, the Republican leader rejected Senator Reid's offer \nof four amendments on each side. Tuesday afternoon, Senator Reid stated \nthat we would not go forward with amendments on the general subject of \nenergy if we could not go ahead and deal with this extender package. \nThat had to be done first, I think because of his great concern and my \ngreat concern that this is an urgent matter. This has languished too \nlong. We need to act on it.\n  In the last 24 hours, we have had filibusters on this effort to move \nahead with the tax extender package a couple of times. We also, of \ncourse, had a filibuster on the effort to move ahead with the Warm in \nWinter and Cool in Summer Act, which is the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, trying to increase the level of direct assistance \nto low-income families in anticipation of the very high costs they are \ngoing to face this winter.\n  I don't know if there is a way to get the Senate to move ahead. I \ncompliment the majority leader for the heroic effort he has been making \nin trying to do that. Obviously, he has not prevailed as yet.\n  The timeline for trying to get action on this tax extender package, \nor some version of it, is as follows:\n  In June of 2007, we had a bipartisan energy tax package that we \nbrought to the Senate floor, and it got 57 votes. That was not enough \nto allow us to go ahead.\n  On December 13, 2007, we had a bipartisan package that got actually \n59 votes. But, again, 59 votes is not enough to let us proceed in the \nSenate.\n  On April 18, we did pass a package of provisions of this type with no \noffset contained. That was a useful thing to do. We have been told in \nclear and unequivocal terms that we cannot get support to pass such a \nbill through the House. So we are back trying to get some agreement on \nhow we can pass this package of tax extenders, how we can pass this \npackage of tax provisions related to alternative energy production and \nrelated to energy conservation before we leave for the August recess.\n  This is a high priority. Projects are being canceled and delayed as \nwe speak because of our inaction on this matter. I felt it important to \ncome to the Senate floor and try to urge action once again before the \nweek ends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we will soon be adjourning the current \nsession of the Senate, and we have yet to consider any meaningful \nproposals to help relieve the pressure all of our constituents are \nfeeling because of the high cost of energy. Before we return home, we \nshould pass a bill that encourages increased production of energy here \nat home to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Americans have responded to the jump in the price of gasoline by \ndriving less and using less, and the price of oil has decreased \nsignificantly in the last 2 weeks because of this effort.\n  There is a direct link between supply and demand and the price of \noil. In order to pay less for oil, we must have more supply and we must \nhave our own domestic supplies.\n  We have been debating a bill that will not increase supply or \ndecrease demand. The Democrats continue to thwart our efforts on this \nsubject, and we find ourselves in a logjam.\n  Even though oil prices have dropped some, gas prices remain at an \nalltime high. Americans are spending an inordinate amount of their \nhard-earned income on gasoline. My constituents in Mississippi spend \nthe highest amount of their income on gasoline of any State--nearly 8 \npercent--according to the National Resources Defense Council.\n  The status quo is not good enough. We must act. If the price of oil \ncan drop more than $20 a barrel in 2 weeks because of decreased demand, \nimagine what could happen if we could couple that with increased \nsupply.\n  We are very lucky that we have energy resources in America to \nexplore. Many areas offshore are currently off limits, but they hold \ngreat potential, as do the large deposits of oil shale in the Rocky \nMountains. With our abundance of coal, we have the opportunity to \nutilize coal-to-liquids technology as another fuel source. We are not \nlacking in resources. Yet we continue to be beholden to foreign oil \ncartels that are not producing at the rate of current worldwide demand.\n  We should also be making sure nuclear power is available in the \nquantities we need. Companies such as Entergy in Mississippi have made \napplication to build new nuclear plants. We need to ensure that the \npermitting process is rigorous but more expeditious.\n  We have the opportunity today to begin weaning ourselves from our \ndependence on foreign oil, but in spite of the suffering that high gas \nprices are creating across the country, we are not moving fast enough. \nLet's get together and get this job done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct in assuming that I \nhave 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 25 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that time is allotted to \nthe two Senators, the senior Senator from Tennessee and Senator Pete \nDomenici, the old man who is leaving the Senate soon.\n  I wish to tell the Senator from Tennessee, our new chairman of our \nRepublican conference, what a great job\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\nhe has done as we have considered whether we should produce more oil \nfor Americans from American-owned resources. That has been an exciting \n8\\1/2\\ days. What disturbs the Senator from New Mexico is, even with \nthe explanations the Senator from Tennessee and others have made, \npeople the Senator has read about, the things he told us about in terms \nof what we ought to be finding and saving, we ought to be producing and \nconserving, and we ought to use our own resources, we have not been \nable to get meaningful amendments offered in the Senate to have a vote.\n  I have come to the conclusion that there are some--perhaps more than \nI ever imagined--Democrats on the other side of the aisle who don't \nwant to produce more American oil. I really didn't think that was \npossible, but I have come to that conclusion. I am not saying \neverybody. There are some who are working very hard on new ideas on how \nwe can produce. But I believe the majority leader has been bugged, \nbothered, and pursued by those who don't want to let a vote because \nthey don't want to produce any oil on the offshores of America even \nthough there is a lot of it there and it belongs to us.\n  Having said that, I wonder if the Senator will have a comment about \nstatements that have been made by a couple of Democrats on the other \nside of the aisle who have said that there are Republicans who just \nwant to drill, that is all they want to do, is drill for more oil. Do \nyou know of any Republicans--you know the Republicans pretty well; that \nis why you have your job as chairman--do you know of any Republicans \nwhose concern is nothing other than we drill for more oil?\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say that the Senator from New Mexico knows the \nanswer to that.\n  And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nMexico be allowed to proceed through our remaining time in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So the answer is no, to the Senator from New Mexico, \nand I think it is important to go back to when we first started talking \nabout this matter.\n  I think it might be useful to the people who are watching the Senate \nand wondering how we do things--maybe they have been watching C-SPAN \nand thinking: Well, these Senators sure know how to make a lot of fine \nspeeches. And that is what we have been doing for the last 10 days, \nmaking speeches. But we haven't been doing anything more. But that \nisn't what we have wanted to do or what we do want to do now. What we \nwant is a serious debate on legislation to lower gas prices that looks \nat ways to find more and use less.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is exactly right. We understand high \ngasoline prices are the product of a law we learned in economics 101. I \ndon't know how the Senator from New Mexico did in economics 101. I \nimagine pretty well because he is one of our most intelligent Senators. \nBut economics 101 says the price of a commodity, such as oil--or it \nmight be hay or wheat or anything else--is determined by the supply as \nwell as the demand. So what we said in our Republican caucus was that \nwe wanted a balanced approach; that we wanted to increase the supply--\n``find more''--and we wanted to reduce the demand--``use less.''\n  So if I may say just for a moment, we do talk a lot about finding \nmore.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Because that has become the issue between the two \nsides, really. We want to do both, and many of them don't. They want to \nuse less, and we want to use less. But it is hard getting many of our \nDemocratic friends to agree that even in the next 30 or 40 years we \nwill need to use significant amounts of new American energy if we want \nto keep our lights on and drive our cars and heat our houses and have \ngood jobs. It is hard for them to agree with that.\n  But let me be very precise about our using less. Our ``finding more'' \nidea was really offshore drilling and oil shale, and our ``using less'' \nwas plug-in electric vehicles. T. Boone Pickens thinks he has a pretty \ngood plan, and he has bought a lot of television time to advertise it, \nand it is pretty simple: natural gas and windmills. Ours is about as \nsimple: offshore drilling, oil shale, and plug-in cars and trucks.\n  But let's talk about the ``use less'' part. That will do more for us \nthan the ``find more'' part will. That is the Republican proposal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We import, I believe, Senator Domenici, about 12 or 13 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. We use about 20 million barrels a day, or \na quarter of all the oil in the world. So if we could find a way to use \nless, as well as find more, we could affect the price.\n  I had a visit just this afternoon from the utility manager in Austin, \nTX, and we talked about plug-in electric vehicles--our way of using \nless. What I am trying to do is make the point that there is not \nanybody over here on this side of the aisle who just wants to drill \nalone. We know we have to use less.\n  Now, why do we say plug-in cars and trucks? When I first started \ntalking about that, people thought I had been out in the sun too long. \nI was far from the first to talk about it. Senator Hatch has introduced \nlegislation on this issue, and it has been supported by a number of \nDemocratic Senators as well. The director of the Austin, TX, utility \nstarted talking about it with me earlier today, and here is what he \nsays can happen.\n  In Austin, TX, they have about 1 million cars and light trucks in his \nutility district. His judgment is that they can get up to about 10 \npercent of those cars--100,000--on electricity, where you just plug \nthem in at night at home, within about 5 to 8 years without much \ntrouble. He believes it is a reasonable goal in Austin, TX, to get half \nof those million cars and trucks on electricity in 10 to 15 years.\n  Now, Senator Domenici, if we could help the United States take half \nof our 240 million cars and plug them in instead of filling them up \nwith gas, we could cut our import of foreign oil by 4 million barrels a \nday and stop sending money overseas. And that is our way of using less. \nSo we want to use less.\n  We have other ways to do that as well. The problem is, we can't \npersuade our friends on the other side of the aisle to find more \nbecause when we say offshore drilling, they say: No, we can't. If we \nsay oil shale, they say: No, we can't. Even if we say nuclear power for \nplugging in our cars and trucks with clean energy, they say: Sorry, not \na proponent of that.\n  So the answer to your question is, no, we are not just for more \ndrilling--we are all for the demand side and using less. We know that \nmakes a difference. We would just like to have a debate and a bill \nabout both, and we are for both. Unfortunately, our friends on the \nother side are not. It seems to me they are kind of repealing the \nsupply half of the law of supply and demand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for the answer, and I want to \nrepeat that supply and demand clearly is what affects the price. The \ntruth is, anyone who thinks we don't have to use oil for a significant \namount of time--I mean import it--is just not taking into consideration \nthe reality that what we use most of this oil for is cars and trucks \nand airplanes and the like, and we just can't make a change overnight.\n  The Senator just mentioned one great way to lessen that, and Austin \nhas a well-planned idea that would take 15 to 20 years to do half, to \nget rid of half of the automobiles and substitute electric cars. But \nwhat are you going to do during the 15 years or 20? You are going to \nuse cars, today at least, using crude oil. You are going to use \ngasoline.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Then there is the other half of the cars and trucks \nthat are presumably still running on gas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You bet. Just so we make it clear, if there are Members \nof the Senate who don't want to let a vote occur on producing more oil \nbecause they don't think we need to produce more oil--and I can't \nimagine why, but some people just say no more carbon; some people say \nno more oil--they have to understand that we are going to be buying \nmore oil whether we like it or not, unless we just stop driving or shut \ndown America. It is going to continue to bleed us dry.\n  So we didn't come down here after our majority leader offered an \namendment, an amendment that he has been saying had an impact on the \nprice of oil, if you can imagine that. It was an oil speculation bill. \nAs we continue\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nthis debate, the majority leader's solution to an enormous energy \ncrisis facing our Nation--and earlier today the majority leader gave a \nspeech. I don't know if the Senator heard it. In that speech he said \nmany things, but one of the things he said is that oil prices are going \ndown because the Senate is debating--debating--oil speculation.\n  Now, the Senator from Tennessee and I really work hard at legislating \nbecause we think legislation can have an impact. But on such a big \nworld problem, to think that on oil supply and demand that you could \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say in a credible manner that the \nprice of oil has come down because a bill was introduced--and the bill \nwas the speculation bill--you know, people haven't gone to sleep. The \nspeculation bill has been written about, and the best thinkers have \nsaid: First, you don't need one; and, second, this one would not do \nanything.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from New Mexico is right, and you are not \nthe only one who thinks that. I picked up the New York Times a couple \nof days ago, and in their editorial--and they do not always agree with \nthe Republican side of the aisle, I will have to concede--but they \nbasically said the speculation bill is not a solution to high gas \nprices. Warren Buffett, who is a pretty good observer of the American \neconomy, has said it is not speculation, it is supply and demand.\n  I know for people who may be watching the Senate, they may ask: What \nare you hung about up about in the Senate? Why don't you work across \nparty lines and come up with some good ideas about supply and some good \nideas about demand and put them in a piece of legislation and vote on \nit and go home and you will have taken a big step in the right \ndirection?\n  We have said that is what we want to do: oil shale, offshore \ndrilling, and plug-in cars.\n  The problem is, we haven't been able to do that because the \nDemocratic leader, for some reason, is reluctant to do the supply part \nof supply and demand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to also say, Mr. President, I think some of us \nwho work hard in the energy field know why the price of oil has dropped \na little.\n  First, those of us who have worked at it are concerned about the \nsupply and demand problem because we entered an era for a short time \nwhen, obviously, there was no more new supply on hand and the demand \nwas growing. And guess what happened. The United States, the American \npeople, not because we passed a lot of laws but because they felt the \nprice of oil in their pocketbooks, changed the way they behaved, and as \na result they saved enormous amounts of crude oil. We estimate right \nnow that U.S. demand has been decreased by 4.3 percent, and that is \nabout 1 million barrels a day.\n\n  When the Senator just spoke a minute ago, he was right. He gave the \nnumbers, and 5 percent of that number would have been 1, and that is \nwhat we are at--1 million barrels. That came down. That lessened the \ndemand, the world economy had some problems, less money was spent, and \nthe demand came down. That was supply and demand working at its best.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say to the Senator from New Mexico, that is 1 \nmillion barrels a day using less. What we are saying, with plug-in cars \nand trucks, we can cut out another 4 million barrels a day over a few \nyears. But if we use offshore drilling and oil shale, we can add 3 \nmillion. So we can reduce by one-third our imported oil and change the \nprice of gasoline. And I would say to the Senator from New Mexico that \nsome people say: Well, changing the price is way off in the future. I \nthought that today's price is based upon the expected supply.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You bet.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And the expected demand. From the day the world \nthought that we might increase that by a few million barrels a day, or \nreduce that by a few million barrels a day, the prices started going \ndown. Am I wrong about that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, if you say just coming up with the idea would do \nit, then I would say no, the Senator is not right. But if we were to \nhave done that, and it was a matter of law in America that we were \ngoing to find more because it was there--you know, Americans are pretty \ngood at drilling. Americans don't mind using the word ``drill.'' They \nhave told us now in the polls, in answer to the question, that they \nare, by 75 percent, for more drilling if it is on property we own. In \nfact, offshore has been the answer. So they want us to find more, and \nthey also want to use less.\n  It is obvious that if we would have passed that--and anybody who says \nwe could not have because we didn't have time is just trying to pull \nthe wool over the eyes of Americans. How many days would it take to do \nthat if we had the will and we were given 7 days and we made a deal? We \ncan't make a deal on anything else, but if we made one and we were \ngoing to have 7 days to debate this bill, amendments come as they may--\ntake down the thing that the majority leader put up there because he \ndidn't want us to vote--7 full days of debate--we could have produced a \nbill that would have opened the offshore permanently, except for the 15 \npercent that is already open, and we would have adopted the use less, \nfind more provisions you have so eloquently brought to us from some of \nyour experts, the experts you talked to, some of them at your National \nLaboratories.\n  Just think, after we passed that and had a signing ceremony at the \nWhite House to say: Here is what we have done, Americans. You are \nsaving on your own, so you are using less, and we really think that is \ngreat, but we think there is still danger the price will go up, so we \nwant to find more to keep it down--we are having the ceremony where we \nare celebrating both.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator says we could have done that in maybe a \nweek.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You bet.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We could have agreed to a large number of amendments \nand said: Let's have an hour on each amendment and let's have a vote, \nand we might win some or lose some. But may I remind the Senator that \nSenator Reid brought this to the floor nearly 2 weeks ago. Could we not \nhave started on that day to have amendments from the Republicans and \namendments from the Democrats, limiting debate to 1-hour per amendment \nwith all amendments germane to energy? Wouldn't that be a normal way \nfor the Senate to work?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You were here, and we got three energy bills through. \nPeople think we did nothing, but we did. We had a 6-year span here \nwhere we did a lot for energy. We changed the CAFE standards for cars. \nWhat is that going to do? Use less.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is the single most important step Congress could \ntake to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, according to experts at \nthe Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Congress did that last year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And we did it with just one other item. It certainly \ndidn't take as long as we have been down here talking instead of \noffering amendments--because we could not. We passed it, and there it \nis. Everyone knows it is great.\n  People are telling us: Don't worry about the offshore, it takes 10 or \n15 years. Do you know what they told us about the ``use less'' \nprovision that is so important, called new CAFE standards for American \nautomobile fleets, all our cars? They told us that will not be totally \neffective for 20 years. The curve goes like this: you start--you don't \nsave any, you don't save any, and then in the 15th and 20th years, you \nstart to finally save.\n  Should we not have done it because it takes a long time to take \neffect? Of course not. We were told to get started on it because, as \nyou said, it is the single biggest way to save gasoline and diesel fuel \nthat anybody knows of.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It seems as if our job, Senator, the way I always \nremembered it, was to look ahead 5 or 10 years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. What if President Kennedy said we can't go to the Moon \nbecause it might take 10 years or Benjamin Franklin said we can't have \na republic because it might take 50 years? And we also said--you just \nsaid it: From the day we pass legislation that includes oil shale, \noffshore drilling, plug-in cars and trucks--from the day we do that, \nthen the buyers and sellers of oil say: It looks as if there is going \nto be a larger supply and less demand, and maybe we will pay a little \nless for oil.\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to talk to the Senator for a minute about \nwhether we are capable of doing big things that affect the energy \nfield. We had a chance here in the last 7 to 10 days to do something \nrather big. But do you know what we did 4 years ago? I was fortunate. I \nleft the Budget Committee, where I was chairing--it seemed as though I \nwas, at the pleasure of the Republicans, running that thing for so \nlong, they never wanted me to step down. I finally got tired of it, and \nI took the Energy Committee. The first bill we passed addressed an \nissue that is part of this ``find more.'' It addressed the issue of why \nwe did not build a nuclear powerplant for 27 years. We answered it in \nthat legislation, didn't we?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And there has been a remarkable change today just \nbecause of that legislation 4 years ago.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you know how many applications there were when we \npassed that legislation, for all America? Zero. That meant something \nwas awry.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For nuclear powerplants.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We had not built any. You have to apply, and so you go \nthere and look and you see whether there are any applications. As of \ntoday--I just got a briefing--do you know how many full-blown \napplications there are to build, locate, and design? You can put all \nthat in one now. It takes a long time--4 years after you have done it. \nSixteen American companies or consortia of companies, even though it \ntakes a long time and they are going to have to have their money at \nrisk for a long time, put their applications in and said: I want to get \nin line because I want to build, I want to find more energy.\n  We are really grateful; for once, we have one where we don't have to \nargue about pollution, right?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is the only source of large, dependable amounts of \nenergy with no carbon, no sulphur, no mercury, no nitrogen. It is our \ncleanest. And as the price of coal goes up and natural gas goes up, it \nis the least expensive of our reliable forms of energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So, you see, when there is a will, there is a way. The \nproblem is, there was no will on the part of the Democratic leader--and \nperhaps some behind him. I am not going to say all of them, but surely \nthey didn't express any dissatisfaction with what was going on until, \nat the end, we started feeling there was some rumbling going on. Maybe \nthey had some friction. But nobody over on that side seemed to be \nsaying to their leader: We want to get busy here and have some votes. \nThere was not a will, so you can't do it. You couldn't change nuclear \npower without a will.\n  In that same bill we were referring to, we changed a lot of things. I \nwanted to tell you, one thing you have been interested in is the \nelectric grid because you are concerned about how we are going to get \nthe electrical power when we cannot build powerplants. Certainly, it \ntakes a long time to use this nuclear one as the way. It takes a long \ntime. You can build coal fastest, but there are a lot of problems with \nEPA and others on that, right? Then you can build natural gas. That is \npretty much--you and I look upon that as Senators and say: Yes, you can \ndo it, but it sure is risky because we need that natural gas so badly. \nBut that is the only way they built them in the last few years. That \nbothers you, right? Doesn't it? Aren't you worried about that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator has 1 minute 7 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Let me ask the Senator from New Mexico on our last \nminute and 7 seconds, one of the descriptions I like is his description \nof how we need to produce more American energy as our bridge to the \nfuture when we will have a different kind of energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would think, if we could start using these words--we \nneed a bridge to the future--and then we got together and thought about \nthat and then said, What is that? Remember a while ago I told you how \nlong it would take in the city of Austin before you would get all those \ncars that are using oil off the streets?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Ten to fifteen years, half of them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Half of them. And then all the other things we talked \nabout, CAFE, how long it would take going up and then start down--that \napplies to so many things in America that the truth is we are not going \nto be in a position to look to new, brand new generation of energy to \nmove cars and trucks. We can't do that for a decade. So there is a \nbridge taking place, a bridge from now until we do not need oil any \nlonger. But what does the bridge consist of? It is oil. Oil is the \nbridge between now and the time we do not use oil.\n  I regret to tell you, for anyone who thinks there is no bridge--it \njust comes to me now--then they can walk into a canyon and drown in the \nwater underground that is running there because they didn't walk on a \nbridge and they drowned themselves. I do not want to drown our country. \nI want to find new oil so the bridge will be less somebody else's and \nmore ours.\n  I understand the Chair tells us we are out of time. We will behave \nvery well. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                        Refueling Tanker Program\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \njoin my colleague from Washington State to talk about--I actually say \nit is an energy issue. Yes, it is also about the Air Force and \nDepartment of Defense air refueling tanker program, but I believe it \nfits well into this debate today because we are talking about energy \nand the high cost of energy.\n  This week, I am sending a letter to Secretary Gates, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Murray, to make sure the Pentagon is doing its job \nand eliminating the evaluation errors identified by the GAO to make \nsure we have a fair competition and an even playing field when it comes \nto the air refueling tanker program.\n  The fact is, our military's air refueling requirements are already \nwell known. The original requirements were developed with input from \nthe warfighting combatant commanders and approved by the Air Force \nRequirements Oversight Council and the Joint Oversight Requirements \nCouncil. According to the Federal rules, major changes to these \nrequirements cannot be made without going through this process again.\n  I think failing to account for what are full life-cycle costs and \nestimates or changing the requirements in the RFP would be another \ncolossal failure in this long process. This was an evaluation problem, \nnot an RFP problem. I am here to say that if the Pentagon fails to \nlearn the lessons from the GAO decision and changes the requirements \nthat have already been set, then I am sure they will hear from many of \nmy colleagues and myself here in Congress. There may even be another \nGAO protest.\n  The American people do not want to have an amended RFP that will \nresult in a protracted protest rather than the tanker procurement we \nare all seeking. Therefore, the new competition should be based on the \nrequirements that were reflected in the original Request for Proposal \ndated January 29, 2007. The world our warfighters are operating in has \nnot changed since those requirements were set. I see no need for them \nto be changed.\n  We are here on the floor now talking about the high cost of energy. \nThe Boeing Company worked hard to meet the Air Force requirements for \nthe tanker bid process. It picked the 767, the platform that best \nmatched those Air Force requirements. If the Air Force had called for a \nlarger tanker, Boeing could have offered a bigger plane, the 777, with \nfar more fuel capacity. But the plane that Boeing picked, the 767, is a \nmuch better match for us, the American taxpayer, and for our \nenvironment.\n  The Air Force currently uses more fuel than any other branch of the \nmilitary, and the Boeing 767 plane burns 24 percent less fuel than its \ncompetitor and would have saved the taxpayers approximately $30 billion \nover the life of these tanker planes.\n  As my colleagues are talking about what to do about the high cost of \nfuel, I ask them to consider one of the Government's largest users of \nfuel--the Air Force--and whether we should make sure fuel efficiency is \nintegrated into the Air Force's procurement decisions.\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\n  The Air Force uses more than half of all the fuel the U.S. Government \nconsumes each year, and aviation fuel accounts for more than 80 percent \nof the Air Force's total energy budget. In 2006, the service spent more \nthan $5.8 billion for almost 2.6 billion gallons of jet fuel--more than \ntwice what it did in 2007.\n  The American taxpayers obviously cannot afford their own higher fuel \ncosts. I do not see how the American taxpayers can afford the U.S. Air \nForce running up a higher cost energy bill as well.\n  An Air Force Assistant Secretary told the House Armed Services \nCommittee that it wants to leave a greener footprint, with more \nenvironmentally sound energy resources. He testified that the rising \ngas and oil prices had forced the Air Force to take a harder look at \nthe budget to find ways to save money while maintaining a high \noperations tempo in the war on terrorism.\n  Assistant Secretary Bill Anderson said this:\n\n       The increasing cost of energy and the Nation's commitment \n     to reducing its dependence on foreign oil have led to the \n     development of the Air Force energy strategy, to reduce \n     demand, increase the supply and change the culture within the \n     Air Force so that energy is considered in everything that we \n     do.\n\n  I believe the Boeing 767 would have been a much better choice for the \nAir Force in energy savings and fuel efficiency. As I said, it burns 24 \npercent less fuel than the alternative that was put on the table. The \nAir Force did not give full consideration to the national security \nimpact of these fuel efficiency issues when it made its decision on the \ntanker.\n  Given that the Air Force, as I said, uses more than half of all of \nthe fuel the U.S. Government consumes, I hope they are thinking about \nthe big picture issue when it comes to making sure our Nation reduces \nits dependence on foreign oil.\n  This 767 has greater operational flexibility. It can land on shorter \nrunways and it can be based at more locations worldwide with existing \ninfrastructure instead of making us, the taxpayer, pay for more and \nmore infrastructure costs.\n  Boeing's medium-sized 767 tanker makes a lot more sense than the \noversized option that was originally outlined by Northrop Grumman/EADS, \nand its greater operational flexibility.\n  The tanker size was determined in the original requirements. And so \nthe fact this plane, the 767, is more fuel efficient, can land on \nshorter runways, can have more base operations, in fact, over 1,000 \nmore base operations worldwide, and the fact that the other costs to \nthe taxpayers in the long run are lower compared to the other offer the \nAir Force is considering, we must make sure we are doing our job here \non the floor of the Senate to make sure these issues of cost savings to \nthe taxpayer are considered.\n  I want to make sure the Department of Defense takes a hard look at \nthese issues and weighs the loss of critical skills in the U.S. \nmanufacturing base. In this time of challenge, America wants to know it \ncan rely on a workforce and manufacturing base here in the United \nStates for our preparedness for whatever conflict comes in the future.\n  I want to make sure that the problems identified by the Government \nAccountability Office are corrected and that we move forward. But \nfailing to account for lifecycle costs on fuel, on infrastructure, on \nmaintenance would also be another failure in this process.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember this was an evaluation problem, \nnot the RFP. And we hope we will straighten this out as we move \nforward.\n  I see I am joined on the floor by my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Washington. I hope she too can add to the focus of how those high \ncosts are something we should be considering in making sure the Air \nForce moves forward on the appropriations choice to give the men and \nwomen of our country a long overdue air refueling tanker that we \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I come to the floor this afternoon to join my colleague \nfrom Washington State and thank her for her comments and attention on \nthis enormously important issue to our State and to our entire country.\n  As she outlined earlier this month, the Department of Defense took a \nrare step involving a major procurement contract. Defense Secretary \nGates decided the competition to replace the next generation of aerial \nrefueling tanker was so flawed that it should be rebid. He elevated \nthat competition from the Air Force to his office, and he promised to \naddress all of the findings raised last month in a Government \nAccountability Office ruling which determined that the contest was \nskewed in favor of the European company Airbus and against Boeing.\n  I was glad to hear the Defense Secretary had decided to take new bids \nand start over. But I come to the floor today to join with my colleague \nfrom Washington State because I too have very serious concerns about \nthe Pentagon's plans for that new competition. Some Pentagon officials \nare already indicating to us they are considering using this \nopportunity to amend the request for proposals to give greater weight \nto a bigger plane.\n  As a result of those comments, defense experts and analysts are now \nbeginning to predict that as a result of that, the contract will simply \ngo back to Airbus. I brought this up in a meeting this week with Acting \nAir Force Secretary Donley, in which we discussed the history of this \ntanker contract, and we talked about the needs of the Air Force, the \ncriticisms that have been lodged against the latest competition, and \nour concerns about the amendment to that RFP that would tip the scales \nto favor one bidder.\n  I am not saying the Pentagon cannot change the requests for \nproposals. However, I strongly believe that all those changes have to \nbe rooted in the original requirements that were set out by the Air \nForce when it began the process of replacing the military's midsized \ntanker, the KC-135.\n  I recognize the Pentagon's procurement team is very serious about \ngetting this competition right. They want to get the right tanker for \nour warfighters. They want to do it quickly. But I also want to make it \nclear that if the Pentagon moves forward with this effort, officials \nmust take the GAO's findings seriously and ensure that this competition \nis as fair and transparent as it can be.\n  Last month the GAO upheld eight points of protest that were raised by \nBoeing, including that the Air Force changed directions midstream in \nthe process about which criteria were more important. It did not give \nBoeing credit for providing a more capable plane, according to the Air \nForce's description of what it wanted. Yet it gave Airbus extra credit \nfor offering amenities the Air Force did not even ask for. The GAO \nreport said the Air Force deliberately and unreasonably increased \nBoeing's engineering costs. When that mistake was corrected, it was \ndiscovered that the Airbus tanker actually cost tens of millions of \ndollars more than Boeing.\n  The GAO found that the Air Force accepted Airbus's proposal even \nthough Airbus could not meet two of their key contract requirements. \nThey could not meet the contract requirement, Airbus could not, and \nrefused to commit to providing long-term maintenance as was specified \ndirectly in the RFP, even after the Air Force repeatedly asked them for \nit.\n  Secondly, the Air Force could not prove that Airbus could refuel all \nof the military's aircraft according to procedure. This goes to show \nhow there were major flaws that occurred throughout that process.\n  So as it continues with this competition now, the Department of \nDefense must make sure there is no reason to question its motives. If \nthey truly plan to make this a fair contest, Secretary Gates has to \nensure that before the selection team reopens this competition, it goes \nback and addresses each one of those GAO findings. It has to ensure \nthat both companies are on the same footing and it has to prove the \ncompetition is as transparent as possible. Our refueling tankers are \nthe backbone of our global military strength. They are stationed around \nthe world today and they service planes from every branch of our Armed \nForces. This is a contract that is ultimately worth more than $100 \nbillion. We are going to have these planes for decades. We cannot \nafford to make mistakes.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I recognize that Secretary \nGates is very serious about getting this competition right. At the end \nof the\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nday, this is about getting the right equipment for our airmen and \nairwomen who are put in harm's way for our security every day. Our \nservicemembers deserve a plane that will enable them to do their job \nand return home safely.\n  Our taxpayers deserve to have confidence that the errors are going to \nbe fixed in this contract as the GAO outlined. So I come to the floor \ntoday to say, as the Pentagon moves forward with this effort over the \nnext several weeks, I strongly urge our officials to take those GAO \nfindings seriously and ensure this competition is as fair and \ntransparent as it can be.\n\n\n                              Samuel Snow\n\n  While I am on the floor this afternoon, I want to take a moment to \nsay a few words about a different topic; that is, about a gentleman who \nsacrificed very dearly for our country.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, was on the floor earlier \ntoday talking about a veteran named Samuel Snow who traveled from \nFlorida all the way to my home State of Washington, all the way across \nthe country this past week, to finally receive the honorable discharge \nfrom the Army that he deserved to get more than 60 years ago.\n  This man traveled from Florida to Washington to finally get an \nhonorable discharge 60 years later. Samuel Snow was one of 28 African-\nAmerican soldiers who were wrongly prosecuted in a court martial for a \ncrime that occurred in Seattle at Fort Lawton in 1944.\n  Last weekend, 64 years later, the Army finally publicly acknowledged \nthat Mr. Snow and 27 others were unjustly convicted and issued a formal \napology. As my colleague from Florida talked about this morning, Mr. \nSnow came all the way from Florida to Seattle and participated in the \ndinner there with sons and daughters of some of the men he served with \nin prison. But later that evening in Seattle, Mr. Snow checked himself \ninto a hospital, and he missed the next day's ceremony. His son Ray \nSnow went to the ceremony and accepted the honorable discharge on his \nfather's behalf, that honorable discharged he had waited decades to \nreceive, and took it from that ceremony, went to his father's hospital \nbed and was able to hand it to him personally and see the smile in his \ndad's eyes for the first time.\n  Sadly, very sadly, his father, Mr. Snow, passed away shortly after he \nwas handed that honorable discharge. Samuel Snow was a hero for our \ncountry who suffered unjustly. He deserves the thanks of our entire \ncountry for his service and his sacrifice. My thoughts now are with the \nSnow family during this difficult time. I am so glad he was able to \nfinally receive that honorable discharge he waited for so many years \nand to receive it before he died.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                          Research Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my growing alarm \nover the current state of the expired and expiring tax provisions, and \nto express what I see as real problems in getting these important \nprovisions taken care of before Congress adjourns this year.\n  My office is increasingly being contacted by businesses and \nindividual taxpayers, not only from my home State but around the \nNation, who are asking what the delay is in taking care of the so-\ncalled extenders. I am sure this is true of all offices of all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  It is already way past the time when Americans should have been able \nto expect a reasonable Congress to take care of what in prior years has \nbeen a fairly routine issue. While the almost annual rite of passing a \ntax extenders bill has never represented an ideal way of governing, the \nCongress has generally exercised a modicum of responsibility in getting \nthis chore taken care of within a reasonable time. That is, until \nrecently.\n  Over the past several years, Congress's ability to take care of what \nis the least common denominator in our duty to ensure a stable tax \nsystem has eroded. We are now bordering, in my opinion, on gross \nnegligence. No wonder the Congress's approval ratings are so incredibly \nlow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We were doing half-hour segments. We had 11 minutes \nremaining on ours. How long is the Senator planning on speaking?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that we have some reallocation of \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nwill be reallocated.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was told to be here at 5:40. I thank my dear colleague \nfor his kindness and understanding of the situation.\n  Senate leaders on both sides have tried to make progress on the \nextenders bill but have repeatedly failed. The distinguished majority \nleader has chalked up this failure to Republican obstructionism, as he \nhas with almost every other failure of his party to pass legislation \nthis year, or legislation they desire.\n  Contrary to the accusations of our leader on the other side, the \nreasons for Republican opposition to the Democratic extender bill are \ngrounded in principles of solid tax policy and fiscal responsibility. \nUnfortunately, our position has been grossly distorted by many on the \nother side and many Democrats on the outside. The Democratic extenders \nlegislation has failed because it contains fundamental flaws. The other \nside is insisting on raising taxes to pay for the loss in revenue from \nextending the expired tax provisions. Their so-called pay-as-you-go or \npay-go rules call for all revenue losses to be matched with revenue \nincreases or certain spending decreases. While I continue to be a \nstrong believer in fiscal responsibility, there are three basic reasons \nwhy Republicans have rejected the false fiscal responsibility of the \nDemocratic extenders bills.\n  First, it is wrong to raise taxes on one group of taxpayers in order \nto prevent another group of taxpayers from suffering an increase in \ntaxes. Second, it is wrong to offset temporary extensions of current \nlaw with permanent tax increases. Finally, it is wrong to increase \ntaxes at a time when the Federal Government is already collecting more \nrevenue as a percentage of gross domestic product than the 40-year \nhistoric average. This is particularly true at a time of slow or no \neconomic growth. Our friends on the other side are ignoring a solution \nthe Republicans have offered that would finance the tax extenders bill \nin a fiscally responsible way. We believe we should reduce the \nexplosive growth in Federal spending instead of raising taxes in order \nto offset the revenue losses. Just during this Congress, Democrats have \npassed billions of dollars of new spending without bothering at all to \noffset the effect of these increases on the deficit. Billions more of \nnew spending has been approved through the Democratic budget \nresolution.\n  Among the tax provisions that have already expired is one the \nbusiness community relies on to keep products and processes flowing, \ninnovations that are the lifeblood of our economy. Businesses across \nthe country are, once again, anxiously waiting to see if we will \nreinstate this important incentive for innovation, the research tax \ncredit, which I have championed for decades. The purpose of the \nresearch tax credit is to encourage investment in technological \ninnovation. Companies generally cannot fully recover R expenditures, \nthus discouraging companies from investing in innovation. The Federal \nGovernment provides tax incentives in order to support business R, \nand the business community is depending on us to continue to support \nR We cannot wait until the end of this year to commit to this vital \ninvestment, this vital tax policy. The time is now.\n  At a time when we are looking for ways to spur economic growth, I \nknow of no thoughtful person who does not believe research and \ndevelopment is vital to our economy and to our future prosperity. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to create \nridiculous permanent offsets in order to pay for temporarily extending \nthe research tax credit which I argue we cannot afford to lose.\n  Many U.S. companies are looking elsewhere to establish their R \nactivities. Testifying before the House committee on Science and \nTechnology, Dr. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information \nTechnology and Innovation Foundation, testified that ``eight of the top \nten [research and development]-spending companies in the world\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\nhave established R facilities in China.''\n  They could just as easily have been established here. If we are not \ncareful, we will soon not only be dependent on foreign oil but also \ndependent on foreign research and development. The result would be a \ntragic loss of American jobs, economic growth, world leadership, and \nprestige. We simply cannot allow this to happen. Here we have a tax \nincentive that has been around for almost 30 years, which enjoys wide \nacceptance by the business sector, the academic community, economists, \nand which has very broad support from practically every corner of the \npolitical spectrum. Yet this tax credit provision has been allowed to \nexpire 13 times. Each time we play the extension game, Congress seems \nto get a little more cavalier about the expiring or expired provisions \nin general and the research credit in particular. While we play this \nextension game, our business community loses out on chances of \ninnovation that could spur economic growth at a time when we need it to \nbe spurred.\n  Now is not the time to create tax uncertainty for employers. A \nretroactive or, even worse, lapsed research credit will cost American \njobs. There is no way you can avoid it, if we don't get this done. \nSeventy percent of research tax credit dollars are used for wages of \nR employees. It is estimated by the Information Technology \nAssociation of America that the lapse of the research tax credit will \ncost the economy $51 million per day. Are my friends on the other side \nof the aisle willing to risk losing American R jobs and severely \nimpact the already difficult U.S. economy in the name of a perverse and \nwrong-headed sense of fiscal responsibility?\n  We cannot drive our economy into the ground in the name of false \nfiscal notions such as a pay-go rule that is used only to grow \nGovernment and to add more taxes to people. Tax increases are not the \nprescription to what ails our economy. But extending these expiring tax \ncuts and making the research tax credit permanent will help our economy \ngrow. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider \ntheir opposition to spending cuts as a way to responsibly pay for the \ncost of extending the expired and expiring tax provisions. I wish we \ncould make the research tax credit permanent. If we would, it would \nhelp our economy. It would help companies to have some sense of what is \ngoing to happen in the future. It would help them in their planning. It \nwould help create jobs. It would help to create more and more \ninnovation. My gosh, it makes sense. I hope my colleagues will \nreconsider and that we can get this tax extenders bill passed as soon \nas possible.\n  Having said all that, I thank my friend, the majority whip, for his \ngraciousness in allowing me to make this statement, especially since I \nhave been picking on him to a degree, only in good nature but also in \nseriousness. We have to work together. We have to start solving some of \nthese problems. We can't do it by always increasing taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. -Cantwell). The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Senator from Utah is my friend. We \ndisagree on so many things politically. But on a personal basis, we \nhave a very good friendship and relationship. I am hoping the day will \ncome when we find that issue on which he and I can march together arm \nin arm to achieve greatness for the country. I know that day is coming. \nI am an optimist.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will kindly yield, this is the issue. This \nis one we could both march arm in arm on. We both agree. The question \nis, How do you pay for it? Frankly, we are not going to go with the \npay-go rule. We have to find some other way. I would like to make it \npermanent. I would like to get rid of the AMT that is hurting so many, \n24, 25 million people. I believe my colleague wants to do these things \nas well. But we have to find a way of getting together and doing it. I \nthink my good colleague knows where I stand on these issues.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Madam President, we have a deficit. It is terrible. It is a debt \nwhich is growing. It is a mortgage on America. Our children are going \nto be saddled with it. The mortgagor, the bank for America's debt? \nChina, Korea, Japan, the OPEC nations; they are holding our mortgage. \nMany of us believe this isn't fair to our children and grandchildren to \ncontinue to pile on the debt. We came up with a very simple approach. \nIf you want to spend money, you have to pay for it. You either have to \nraise taxes or cut other spending. If you want to cut taxes, you have \nto have some balance; in other words, cut spending or raise another \ntax. When it is all over, we want a zero sum so it doesn't add to the \nnational debt.\n\n  I don't think that is unreasonable because it means we have to make \nchoices. Here is the choice we faced in the last 2 days. We have a \nthriving industry in America for renewable energy. I can't believe what \nis going on in my State of Illinois. I go into parts of downstate \nIllinois and see farm after farm covered with wind turbines. Outside of \nBloomington, IL, is the Twin Groves project, 240 wind turbines \ngenerating enough electricity for cities in Bloomington normal--no \npollution, farmers love it because they get paid for the wind turbines \non their land, and they can plant the corn and soybeans right up next \nto it. So it is a win-win situation, and it is there because we had a \nprovision in the Tax Code which created an incentive to invest in wind \npower, solar power, geothermal, the clean energy solutions that will \ngenerate electricity without causing more global warming.\n  We brought it to the floor. We said to our colleagues: We need to \nrenew this. It is about to expire. If we don't renew it, these \nbusinesses may not reinvest. But giving a tax break takes money out of \nthe Treasury, so we want to balance the books. To balance the books, we \nsuggested raising a business tax to offset the cut in taxes for \nrenewable energy, balance the books. The Republican side, the party of \nso-called fiscal conservatism, rejected this. As my friend from Utah \nsaid, they don't believe we should have to pay for tax cuts.\n  Well, tax cuts, unfortunately, take money out of the Treasury and add \nto the deficit. We think balancing the books is the only way to get \nthis deficit under control. So when the vote came--there are nominally \n51 Democrats, 49 Republicans--there were a few absences on both sides, \nbut we were able to attract 5 Republicans who would join us for the \nrenewable energy tax credits.\n  The others said: There is no way. Forty-one of the forty-nine \nRepublican Senators have signed a letter which I call ``death before \ntaxes.'' It is a letter which says they will never--ever, ever, ever--\nvote to increase a tax, never. That kind of paints you into a corner. \nBecause if you are not willing to increase a tax on someone to cut a \ntax on someone else, you are stuck with a Tax Code that never changes, \nor you are stuck with a deficit which continues to get worse and worse \nas you try to make the Tax Code a generator of economic growth.\n  The Republicans, for the last several weeks, have been on the floor \ntalking about America's energy picture. They should. We have talked \nabout it a lot on our side of the aisle. Their solution is a solution \nwhich is old-time religion: Drill, drill offshore, drill onshore, drill \neverywhere. If we drill and find more oil, we will be fine.\n  They ignore the reality. The reality is, if you look at the entire \npotential supply of oil in the world, the United States has access and \ncontrol of 3 percent of the world's oil. Each year our economy consumes \n25 percent. So let's do the math. If you drilled all the oil available \nin the U.S. offshore/onshore, how long could we sustain our economy \njust by drilling? The answer is, we couldn't. It can't be done.\n  What is the alternative? You can import oil, which we are doing now, \n70 to 80 percent of the oil we use is brought in from overseas, from \nother countries, or you can find another approach--responsible \nexploration and production in America that doesn't violate basic \nenvironmental regulations, doesn't run the risk of contaminating or \npolluting offshore, and then a forward-looking approach to energy, an \napproach which looks for renewable, sustainable sources of energy for \nthe future, that deals with the possibility that we will replace \ncurrent electric power generation with pollution-free generation from \nwind turbines and solar power,\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nmoving toward a new generation of cars and trucks.\n  A few years ago, about 4 or 5 years now, I offered an amendment on \nthe floor to improve CAFE standards. We had not increased fuel \nefficiency in cars for over 20 years. We were stuck with an old number. \nWe were falling backward. People bought heavier trucks and SUVs, and \nthey were not as fuel efficient. So I said: Let's have a new goal, \nmoving toward more fuel-efficient cars. Let's have a challenge to our \nindustry and to our science to find these new cars for the future, safe \ncars, cars that use less fuel and meet our needs. I got beaten badly on \nthe floor when I offered that, but gasoline wasn't $4.50 a gallon then. \nI lost that attempt twice in a row. The votes weren't that good. I am \nnot sure I even had 30 votes out of 100 for the idea of fuel \nefficiency. But someone once said: There is nothing more pregnant than \nan idea whose time has come, and with gasoline at $4 a gallon, the \nidea's time has come. We passed a law to require more fuel efficiency \nin years to come. So we are moving in the right direction there. That \nis the future for us. The future for us is to find ways to conserve, \nfind ways to be more fuel efficient, find ways to generate more \nrenewable energy that doesn't pollute the environment.\n\n  Today's vote was a disappointing vote. We tried to create incentives \nfor renewable energy, and only 5 Republicans out of 49 would come and \nvote with us. Four of the five are up for reelection, some of them \nfacing tough contests in November. They know it is hard to explain \nvoting against this bill. They voted against our bill, which would have \ncreated incentives for biomass and hydropower, incentives for solar \nenergy and microturbines, biodiesel production, renewable projects, \ncoal electricity, advanced coal electricity demonstration projects, \nplug-in electric cars, new batteries that we will need for plug-in \nhybrids, ways to reduce pollution from trucks with idling reduction \nunits, installing more E-85 fuel pumps around America so consumers have \na choice to use a cheaper and more environmentally friendly fuel, home \ncredits, building credits. All of these were incentives to move America \nin the right direction, not the wrong direction, and only 5 of the 49 \nRepublicans would vote for that.\n  Their goal is more drilling. Their agenda is written by the oil \ncompanies. The oil companies have consistently asked for more and more \nand more that they can put in their portfolio of possible areas to \ndrill. However, currently there are 68 million acres of federally owned \nland under lease to the oil companies that they are not using, they are \nnot exploring. They are not bringing oil and gas out. They have ample \nopportunity in that area and others to meet the needs of future \nexploration. They are not doing it. Yet from the Republican side of the \naisle, we hear they need more.\n  This sign shows that the Republicans have engaged in 91 filibusters \nin this session. For most people who are following this debate that \nnumber may not mean much. In the history of the Senate, the largest \nnumber of filibusters in any 2-year period of time was 57 before this \nsession. What is a filibuster? It is an attempt to slow down or stop \nthe Senate from acting. Ninety-one times the Republicans have tried to \nslow down or stop the Senate from acting. Today they did it again. They \nstopped us when we tried to pass this energy policy for America that \ncreates incentives for renewable energy.\n  That isn't all that was in this bill. It wasn't just about energy \nalone. In this bill was protection for working families from the \nalternative minimum tax, creating more tax liability for them in next \nyear's return. That is a good bill as far as I am concerned. We should \nbe protecting working families who are struggling to get by.\n  In this bill as well was $8 million for the highway trust fund. We \nare afraid this highway trust fund will run out of money before the end \nof the year and 400,000 good-paid workers would lose their jobs in \nAmerica. I don't want to see that happen in my State; I don't think any \nSenator does. We tried to protect our economy from that happening in \nthis bill.\n  There was a provision, totally unrelated--and critics of Congress \nsay: Why do you do things like this? Why would you put that provision \nin a bill about energy and jobs? But I will tell you, I would put that \nprovision I am about to describe in any bill. It is called mental \nhealth parity. This bill would require private insurance companies to \nprovide opportunities for people to buy health insurance to cover \nmental illness. We have been fighting for this for as long as I have \nbeen in the Senate. The fight was started by Paul Wellstone of \nMinnesota. What a great man he was. We lost him when he died in a plane \ncrash 6 years ago, and we have tried to pass this bill ever since. I \nthink we should put that amendment on every bill. There are so many \nAmerican families who are affected by mental illness. We put that \nbefore the Senate today and only five Republicans would vote for that. \nI don't understand their thinking. Many have said they really believe \nin it, but they wouldn't vote for it. That is where we are.\n  So their filibuster ended up stopping a bill from moving forward, as \nit did earlier this week. Earlier this week, another Republican \nfilibuster stopped a bill which had 34 or 35 provisions in it to deal \nwith a number of different issues. Some of them were health related: a \nregistry for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease so we can do \nbetter research in finding a cure; efforts for additional research in \nrehabilitation activities at the National Institutes of Health for \nthose suffering from paralysis; a stroke treatment bill, a bipartisan \nbill--all of these bills, incidentally, have passed the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly. The Melanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS \nAct--one I am familiar with--dealing with postpartum depression to try \nto make sure new mothers who are suffering from that depression get the \ntreatment they need. Vision care for kids so that we help the States \npay for more visual screening so kids don't fall behind in the \nclassroom simply because they need eyeglasses.\n  Then we had a number of bills out of our Senate Judiciary Committee: \na bill to reauthorize a program to find runaway and homeless kids. The \nEmmitt Till unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, Senator Dodd and I and \nothers have cosponsored this one. Those responsible for killing civil \nrights workers, no matter how long ago, should be held accountable, and \nthis bill would have moved us in that direction--a bill to deal with \nmental illness and crime, unfortunately, closely linked, and we should \nbe doing something about it; bills dealing with reducing Internet child \npornography.\n  All of the things I have just mentioned--health care and crime \nrelated--were in a package of bills which the Republicans refused to \nsupport. I don't get it. I don't understand it. I don't know how you \ncould go home and explain to the people you represent that you voted \nagainst these bills. Obviously, they think it is easy to do, and maybe \nit is for them. It wouldn't be for me. In the State of Illinois, there \nare too many people affected by these bills.\n  The Republicans consistently--with their filibusters and holding back \ntheir votes--have stopped us from doing the people's work. I understand \nwhen people think of Congress across America, it is not in positive \nterms. They want us to do more. They want us to respond to the issues \nof the day, the things that make a difference. Whether we are dealing \nwith medical issues, of research; whether we are dealing with law \nenforcement; whether we are dealing with the energy picture--these are \nthings on which we should be voting to move forward. However, time and \ntime and time again, the Republicans, through their filibusters, have \nstopped us in the Senate. That is what happens in a 51-to-49 Senate \nwhere it takes 60 votes to do anything significant. They have control \nof the agenda--at least control enough to say no--and they have said no \nrepeatedly on 91 different occasions with their filibusters, breaking \nall the records in the Senate.\n  I wish to get back to this energy policy. I don't want us to go home \nwithout addressing it, but I am afraid the Republicans have closed the \ndoor not just yesterday but again today. Earlier, the leader on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Harry Reid, read from this morning's New York \nTimes, July 30, an article by Tom Friedman entitled ``Drilling in \nAfghanistan.'' What Tom Friedman said about the Republican strategy on \nenergy, I think, really hits the nail on the head. I quote from this \narticle:\n\n       Republicans become so obsessed with the notion that we can \n     drill our way out of the\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\n     current energy crisis that reopening our coastal waters to \n     offshore drilling has become their answer for every energy \n     question. Anyone who looks at the growth of middle classes \n     around the world and the rising demand for natural resources, \n     plus the dangers of climate change driven by our addiction to \n     fossil fuel, can see that clean, renewable energy--wind, \n     solar, nuclear, and stuff we haven't yet invented--is going \n     to be the next great global industry. It has to be if we are \n     going to grow in a stable way--\n\n  Thomas Friedman writes.\n\n       Therefore, the country that most owns the clean power \n     industry is going to most own the next great technology \n     breakthrough: The ET revolution--the energy technology \n     revolution--and create millions of jobs and thousands of \n     new businesses just like the IT revolution did. \n     Republicans, by mindlessly repeating their offshore \n     drilling mantra, focusing on a 19th century fuel, remind \n     me of someone back in 1980 arguing that we should be \n     putting all our money into making more and cheaper IBM \n     Selectric typewriters and forget about those things called \n     the PC and the Internet. It is a strategy for making \n     America a second great power and economy.\n\n  So when it comes to paying for what we do on the floor of the Senate, \nthe Republicans vote no. When it comes to an American energy policy \nthat is forward looking, sadly, the Republicans vote no. When it comes \nto medical research in critical areas, this week the Republicans voted \nno. When it comes to crime provisions to deal with runaway kids and to \ndeal with Internet pornography and children, this week the Republicans \nvoted no.\n  There comes a point where you have to stand for something. We have \ntried our best to bring these issues before the Senate. We will \ncontinue to.\n  The last point I will make is this: There is one thing--one thing--\nthe President can do tomorrow morning that can change the debate on \nenergy in America instantly, and that is an announcement. There is an \nannouncement he could make that the United States--which has a \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve of 700 million barrels of oil that has been \ngathered and protected for our national security--is now going to be \npart of our energy solution. If President Bush announced that he would \nstart releasing oil from that reserve, selling it on the market, with \nthe goal of bringing the price of a barrel of oil down to $100 from its \ncurrent level of about $122, it would do more to breathe life into the \nAmerican economy than any other thing. It would say: The United States \ncan stop being a victim when it comes to energy and can become a player \non the global market. It would send the signal that we are not going to \ntolerate $145-a-barrel oil and the prices it generates at the gasoline \npump and when it comes to jet fuel for our airlines. If the President \nshowed leadership in releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve--if he called in the oil companies and put them on the carpet \nfor the outrageous profits that they continue to report--we could turn \nthis around.\n  Simply suggesting that we have to drill more offshore in the hopes \nthat 8 to 14 years from now there will be additional oil is not going \nto solve our energy problem. It is yesterday's answer. As Senator \nDorgan from North Dakota has said so frequently: When the Republicans \nthink of energy, it is yesterday for everything.\n  Let's think about tomorrow. Let's have an energy policy that looks \nforward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                          Mental Health Parity\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, this afternoon I spoke about how \nimportant it was to pass that extender bill, how important it was for \nmy State and for the rest of the country to promote green jobs, to look \nat this new energy future, to stop spending $600,000 a minute on \nforeign oil. I said this afternoon we only got four Republicans to vote \nwith us on a bill that was paid for, a bill that was the right way to \ngo--only four Republicans.\n  There was something else in that bill that is just as important to me \nand to my State of Minnesota and to the millions of people living in \nthe shadow of mental illness, and that is the Paul Wellstone mental \nhealth parity bill that is included in that package. We have tried to \npass this through the Senate over and over again. Senator Domenici on \nthe other side of the aisle has been one of the biggest supporters and \nsponsors of this bill. Senator Kennedy has worked on it. Senator Durbin \nhas worked on it. There are many people in the House, including Patrick \nKennedy, and one of my favorite Republican Congressman, Jim Ramstad, \nwho is retiring this year, and he doesn't want to leave the House until \nthat bill gets done.\n  For me, the Paul Wellstone mental health parity bill is about Paul \nWellstone. It is about everything he stood for. It is about fighting \nfor the people who don't have a voice. It is about all the people who \nhave come up to me in the Capitol, not the Senators but the secretaries \nand the tram drivers who remember Paul and remember how kind he was to \nthem. This bill is about his brother Stephen who struggled with mental \nillness his whole life. Paul would always talk about how the house they \ngrew up in was always dark because of Stephen's mental illness and how, \nafter Stephen got better and went on to teach, what a difference it \nmade in the family, but it was a lifelong struggle for him.\n  So this bill is for Paul. When Paul was alive, our friends on the \nother side of the aisle said they wanted to pass this bill. And when \nPaul died, they said they wanted to pass this bill. This is the time, \nand it was a part of that package. Senator Kennedy is at home watching \neverything that goes on in this Chamber, and he wants to get that done. \nPaul's son, David, has been here, day after day, walking the halls of \nthe Capitol, knocking on doors to get this done in his father's memory. \nI implore my friends on the other side to get this done.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I served with Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, who \npassed away 6 years ago, just weeks before the election. He and his \nwife Sheila, his daughter, several staff members, and the pilot and \ncopilot were lost in that plane crash. I attended that memorial service \nfor him at the University of Minnesota.\n  Paul had such a passion for so many issues. But the one thing that \nmeant more than anything to him was this mental health parity bill. I \nam saddened that, 6 years later, we still haven't passed it. We only \nhad 5 Republicans join us today and vote for it. I hope the Senator \nfrom Minnesota feels as I do, that we need to pass the Wellstone mental \nhealth parity bill--make no excuses, find no alternatives, other than \nto make sure it is named in his memory, the man who started us down \nthis road and whose journey needs to be finished by us today.\n  I am glad the Senator from Minnesota is here to participate in that. \nIt should be the highest priority before we adjourn this year. Since I \nneed to ask the question, I ask her if she agrees.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator so much for that question. I know \nfrom his family, those he left behind, who miss him so much, this is \nwhat he wanted to get done. I actually remember, I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the last time I saw Paul Wellstone before he went down \nin that tragic plane crash. It was at an event for new citizens. \nSheila, his wife, was supposed to be there, and the two of us were \ntalking about our immigrant families, where they came from and how they \npulled themselves up and funny stories about our families in \nAppalachia. There were about 30 new citizens there and no press, no \ncameras. All of a sudden, by surprise, in walked Paul. You know, it was \n3 or 4 weeks before one of the biggest elections in the country, and he \nwas in that room with the new citizens.\n  I knew there were two reasons: One, he loved Sheila and he wanted to \nsurprise her. Second was he embraced this idea that no matter where you \ncame from, no matter what you have gone through in your life, you could \npull yourself up in this country. That is part of why this mental \nhealth parity bill was so important to him. He had seen in his family \nhow his brother struggled and was able to pull himself up. There was a \nhorrible financial situation for their family. He didn't want that to \nhappen to someone else. He felt that if you can cover physical \nillnesses, you should also cover mental illnesses. This bill is what \nPaul wanted to get done.\n  I know the majority leader and others have said the other side said \nthey would pass it when he was alive and\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nthen when he died. This is their chance.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n\n\n             DETENTION OF GAMBIAN JOURNALIST EBRIMA MANNEH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, America has long been a champion and \nsource of hope around the world for those suffering human rights \nviolations--those holed up in dictators' prisons, those fighting for \npress and political freedoms, those bravely standing up to tyranny or \ninjustice.\n  Many of those who have suffered, such as Vaclav Havel and Nelson \nMandela, or continue to suffer this fate, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, are \nwell-known to us. Sadly, for each one of them, there are many other, \nlesser known heroes being detained or harassed all over the world \nsimply for wanting basic human freedoms.\n  Through our annual human rights reporting at the State Department, \nour diplomacy, and steady public pressure on basic human rights, the \nU.S. has traditionally been a source of hope for those being illegally \ndetained or persecuted.\n  We should never forget what this kind of attention and pressure can \naccomplish and what kind of strength it provides for those being \ndetained.\n  Take for example, Ngawang Sangdrol, a Tibetan nun who was detained \nand tortured for peacefully expressing her belief in Tibetan \nindependence. She was freed after 12 years of imprisonment following \nimmense public pressure. After her release she said,\n\n       I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and \n     support . . . I am deeply touched to learn that many \n     individuals, organizations, and governments . . . have worked \n     towards my release. It is very clear to me that I have been \n     released and allowed to come out to the free world for \n     medical treatment and to enjoy my freedom because of \n     international concern.\n\n  Or Gurbandurdy Durdykuliev, a political activist from Turkmenistan \nwho in 2004 was seized and forced into a psychiatric hospital by the \ncountry's ruling dictator. His crime--requesting permission for a \npeaceful political rally.\n  He was released a few years later, just 10 days after 54 members of \nCongress sent a letter to the Turkmen Government about his case.\n  We should listen and act upon the appeal made by Aung San Suu Kyi, \nwho has remained under house arrest in Burma for most of the last 19 \nyears:\n\n       Those fortunate enough to live in societies where they are \n     entitled to full political rights can reach out to help the \n     less fortunate in other parts of our troubled planet. . . . \n     Please use your liberty to promote ours.\n\n  I realize we must also work to address our own recent shortcomings by \nunequivocally renouncing torture and by closing the detention facility \nin Guantanamo--and we will continue to work toward ending these \nshameful legacies.\n  At the same time, we must continue to speak out in support of those \nimprisoned for advocating basic freedoms around the world.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle have been arguing that \nAmerica's strength resonates not only from its military power but from \nthe power of its ideas and inspiration, the power of its values and \nhope, the power of its generosity and diplomacy--its smart power.\n  Sadly, I worry that a measure of this leadership, of this \ninspiration, and of this uniquely American hope has been lost in recent \nyears.\n  Accordingly, today I want focus the Senate's attention on a tragic \nstory from the small west African Nation of The Gambia.\n  Chief Ebrima Manneh was a reporter for the Gambian newspaper, the \nDaily Observer. He was allegedly detained in July 2006 by plainclothes \npolice officers thought to have been from the Gambian National \nIntelligence Agency after he tried to republish a BBC report critical \nof President Yahya Jammeh.\n  He has been held incommunicado, without charge or trial, for two long \nyears. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience and \nhas called for his immediate release.\n  I agree.\n  Recent reports suggest he is being held at the Fatoto Police Station \nin eastern Gambia. In July 2007, he was also reportedly escorted by the \nmembers of the Gambian Police Intervention Unit to the Royal Victoria \nhospital in the capital for high blood pressure treatment.\n  Despite repeated attempts by Manneh's father and fellow journalists, \nincluding the Committee to Protect Journalists, to seek information on \nMr. Manneh, the Gambian Government continues to deny any involvement in \nhis arrest or knowledge of his whereabouts.\n  My direct request to the Gambian Embassy here in Washington has also \nbeen met with shameful silence.\n  Last month in Nigeria, the Community Court of Justice of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States declared the arrest and detention of \nMr. Manneh illegal and ordered Gambian officials to release him \nimmediately.\n  And yet the Gambian Government ignored this court's ruling as well--\neven though this court has jurisdiction for human rights cases in the \nGambia.\n  Is the Gambian Government so afraid of one of its own reporters that \nit cannot even acknowledge his detention?\n  I say to President Jammeh: Release this reporter. Let him return to \nhis family.\n  Sadly, Mr. Manneh's case is not alone in The Gambia. In December \n2004, a critic of President Jammeh, and press freedom advocate, Deyda \nHydara, was shot and killed. His murder has yet to be solved or \ninvestigated.\n  The government has also enacted laws muzzling the press and imposing \nmandatory prison sentences for media owners if convicted of publishing \ndefamatory or seditious material--all part of a larger deterioration of \nbasic freedoms in The Gambia.\n  Madam President, the United States needs to be a forceful advocate \nfor these kinds of blatant human rights abuses. Doing so is not only \nthe right thing to do, but it is the smart thing to do in terms of our \nengagement abroad and in demonstrating our American values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                             Tax Extenders\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, at 2:42 today on the Senate floor, the \nSenate majority leader made an incorrect statement. In discussing the \nnegotiations last night between the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and this Senator, the Senate majority leader, who was not \npresent at the meeting, stated: ``The only thing that Senator Grassley \nwanted to discuss is having all these extenders not paid for.''\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\n  I will make a statement of why this statement is wrong. Specifically, \nI made three proposals to Chairman Baucus. In all three of the \nproposals, we agreed to use three tax offsets suggested by Chairman \nBaucus and his staff.\n  The first offset I agreed to accept is the offset that closes the \nloophole that allows hedge fund managers to defer compensation in tax \nhaven jurisdictions. However, I mentioned we needed to remove the huge \ncharitable loophole that is contained in both the Democratic House and \nSenate extenders bill. Closing this charitable loophole will raise \nabout $1 billion in extra revenue from hedge fund managers, according \nto the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Let me make clear why that is a very important adjustment. If you, \nthe average taxpayer, want to give the maximum the law allows for a \ncharitable deduction, you can only allow 50 percent of your income to \nbe used for that purpose. But if you are under this provision, if you \nare a hedge fund manager making contributions to a charity, you can \nhave 100 percent deduction. We think that is unfair to the middle-\nincome taxpayer.\n  The second offset I reluctantly agreed to accept was a version of the \nworldwide interest allocation offset. We are still waiting on the \nrevenue estimate for this proposal. This was a compromise on my part. \nThat is what it will take from the other side, as well, to get an \nextenders bill done--some sort of compromise.\n  The third offset I agreed to accept is a permanent offset regarding \nbasis reporting of securities brokers.\n  These three offsets that I agreed to accept could--depending on the \nrevised worldwide interest allocation proposal--raise over $50 billion \nin revenues as offsets.\n  As I mentioned above, I made three proposals to chairman Baucus. I \nalso offered to use all three offsets mentioned above for each of the \nthree separate proposals that I made; therefore, paying for much of the \nrevenue loss generated by the tax extender provisions.\n  In two out of my last three proposals, I proposed using those three \noffsets to offset much of the revenue loss that results from extending \nthese tax extender provisions.\n  So for the majority leader to say that ``the only thing that Senator \nGrassley wanted to discuss is having all these extenders not paid for'' \nis simply not accurate. And it is plain wrong. The majority leader was \nnot in the room, and he must have received a false report from someone \nwho actually was in the room. Chairman Baucus was in the room. So he \nknows the majority leader's statement that the only thing Senator \nGrassley wanted to discuss was having all of these extenders not paid \nfor is untrue. I ask everybody to ask Chairman Baucus.\n\n  To demonstrate in detail that the majority leader's statement is \nincorrect, Chairman Baucus and I discussed a number of issues other \nthan offsets in the media. One of these issues was my disaster tax \nrelief package that is needed for the people of Iowa and the Midwest \nbecause of the gigantic 500-year floods.\n  Three other issues we discussed were the three tax offsets I \ndescribed above. Some other issues that were discussed were provisions \nin the Democratic leadership's extenders bill that we objected to, such \nas the provision regarding the train from Manhattan to JFK Airport that \naccounts for more than 20 percent of the revenue loss in the Democratic \nleader's disaster tax package.\n  In addition, I offered to make all three of my proposals revenue \nneutral by suggesting that we use the three offsets mentioned above and \nalso decrease the amount of new increases in spending that were \napproved in the budget only 2 months ago.\n  Let me be clear, we did not suggest any spending cuts. We suggested \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle consider decreasing the \namount of new unspecified nondefense discretionary spending. The \nnondefense discretionary spending that has been authorized in the \nbudget is $350 billion greater than the President's fiscal year 2009 \nbudget. This extra $350 billion is like an extra checkbook that \nCongress is carrying around in addition to the already fat checkbook. \nThis checkbook covers nondiscretionary spending and current levels of \ndiscretionary spending. We simply ask they take a few checks out of the \nextra checkbook over the next 10 years to help pay for part of the \nneeded tax relief provisions in the tax extenders package.\n  However, this suggestion was summarily dismissed by Chairman Baucus. \nMy colleagues on the other side of the aisle are unwilling to even \nconsider decreasing their increased--and I emphasize ``their \nincreased''--nondefense discretionary spending that is above the \nPresident's budget.\n  In summary, the majority leader's statement at 2:42 this afternoon \nabout my position on our negotiations is flat out wrong, and I cannot \nbe any clearer than that.\n  Folks across the country must wonder why the Senate cannot pass the \npopular expiring tax relief provisions. There is no disagreement \nbetween the parties on the merits alone. Nearly all Members of this \nbody and the other body support the alternative minimum tax fix and \nalso the other parts we refer to as extenders; in other words, tax \nprovisions that have sunsetted. And, of course, because of the good of \nthese provisions, anybody who opposes it would be crazy.\n  The problem is the committee and floor process have been disregarded \nby the Senate Democratic leadership. Debate, exchanges of ideas, up-or-\ndown votes are the essence of how the Senate works. All of that Senate \nprocess is now bottled up. The Senate process is quite truncated.\n  For the first time in this decade--that is, since 2001--the Finance \nCommittee members have not been allowed to exercise their rights in the \ncommittee markup with respect to these issues, with one exception--the \n2002 stimulus bill.\n  For the first time in this decade, Senate Members have not had the \nopportunity to debate and amend extenders in a real Senate floor \nprocess. For the first time in this decade, Senators in the minority \nare being presented with a top-down deal crafted between the Democratic \nleadership of the House and Senate.\n  For me, the irony of all of this is very compelling because I found \nmyself within the last 2 years, when Republicans were in the majority, \ncondemning Republicans for trying to get around letting the Senate work \nits will. Almost 2 years ago today, we faced an attempt to end run the \nnatural order of the committee and floor process by the bicameral \nRepublican leadership of the House and Senate; meaning when we were in \nthe majority. I referred to it at that time as wrongheaded. If it was \nwrongheaded when we had a Republican majority and the Democratic \nmajority is doing it, it is just as wrongheaded, as far as I am \nconcerned, because 2 years ago it was doomed to fail.\n  I don't know how many times I told the Republican leadership: It \nain't going to work. And right now we are faced with it when we have a \nnew majority and that new majority is Democratic. Two years ago, it was \nenvisioned as some sort of unicameral, not a bipartisan, bicameral tax-\nwriting committee process. The unicameral tax-writing committee process \n2 years ago ignored the rights and the privileges of both political \nparties. I used sharp words and directed them at my side's leadership \nof the House and Senate.\n  I am sure some on my side thought my comments were over the top. I \ndon't care. I didn't care then, at least. Then-Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Chairman Enzi stood shoulder to shoulder with me in this \nprocess. My friends on the Democratic side criticized my leadership for \nthe harm it was doing to the rights of the Members of this body that is \nsupposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the entire world of \nany parliamentary bodies.\n  That is why I find today's actions bitterly ironic. I am sorry to say \ntoday we find the Democratic leadership attempting to do much the same \nthing. Like the failed trifecta jam then, today's jam will not work.\n  Let me make clear, when I refer to the ``trifecta jam then,'' I mean \n2 years ago when Republican leaders thought they could stuff something \ndown the throats of Democrats in this body. It failed then, and that \nsort of jam is not working when Democrats are in the leadership \nposition.\n  It is part of a larger problem with the Senate because we are not \ngoing\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\nthrough the regular order at the committee and floor levels. Issues are \nbuilding up, tempers are flaring, and most importantly, nothing is \ngetting done and the people are mad about it. The people back home are \nmad about it.\n  I reiterate what I said this morning. The fourth vote failed. That \nfailed cloture vote had the effect of Kaopectate. It further \nconstipated the Senate. This legislative body needs to function. \nLegislation needs to circulate through this body in the usual form. We \nneed real debate and real amendments. We need a legislative laxative.\n  Another alternative to resolution is an informal bipartisan process. \nEither way, repeated cloture partisan jams do not lead to an agreement \nthat can pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the President. \nAnd don't forget about that because that is an important part of the \nprocess. I think the White House spoke out on some of the AMT and \nextender legislation we have been considering.\n  I have my pencil sharpened, a note pad out. I am ready to engage in \nour bipartisan process with my friend Chairman Baucus. I am hopeful the \nDemocratic leadership will relieve the constipation on the tax \nextenders legislation. The Finance Committee and Senate need to \nfunction.\n  On behalf of Leader McConnell, I am going to propound a unanimous \nconsent request about which I already informed the other side. The \nagreement, if accepted by the majority, would set in motion a process \nthat would lead to resolution of these expired provisions. If accepted \nby the majority, we would have real debate, real votes, and a \nresolution that matters.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the conclusion of \nthe energy speculation bill, the Senate proceed en bloc to the \nconsideration of the Baucus extender bill, S. 3335, and a bill \nintroduced by Senator Grassley on the same subject of extenders; \nprovided further, that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form to run concurrently on both measures; and that following \nthat time, the bills be read a third time, en bloc, and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of S. 3335, followed by a vote on passage of \nthe Grassley bill. I further ask unanimous consent that if either bill \ndoes not receive 60 votes in the affirmative, the bill be returned to \nthe calendar.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what the \nSenator from Iowa proposes is that we pay for these tax extenders for \nenergy by reducing domestic discretionary spending. To put that in \nlayman's terms, for the last 4 years, we have frozen the increases of \nspending at the National Institutes of Health for medical research. \nSenator Grassley would say, let's continue freezing those increases in \nspending for medical research so we don't have to impose taxes on \nAmerican businesses doing business overseas. I disagree with that. It \nis far better that those businesses pay those taxes than we cut back on \nmedical research. I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to correct the Senator on a \ncouple of respects, and he has exercised the right I expected. First, \nwe accept the provisions that were in the Baucus bill for offsets. We \ndid suggest a modification on the provision that the Senator said we \ndon't want. He is wrong on that point. We will accept it. There is a \nslight modification in it that would give an election. We go along with \nthat provision, and I think I made that clear in the remarks I \nproposed.\n  The second place the Senator from Illinois is wrong is we are not \nproposing the cutting of spending. We are proposing the $350 billion \nincrease that their budget has suggested for additional spending be \nreduced by a very small percentage.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if the Senator from Iowa will yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, so any proposal to increase spending at \nthe National Institutes of Health for medical research will be reduced \nby the proposal of the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If my colleague wants to figure that all the $350 \nbillion is going to go to the National Institutes of Health, he is \nright. But all $350 billion, obviously, is not going to go to the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             Cost of Energy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I suspect if people are watching what \nis going on here, they do not have any clue or understanding of what is \ntaking place because, in fact, it is fairly incomprehensible. It is \npretty hard to understand why bill after bill dealing with issues of \nenormous consequence for millions of Americans is being filibustered by \nthe Republicans, which means we have to get 60 votes to end the debate, \nvotes which we obviously don't have. From the beginning of the session, \nthere have been 91 filibusters, which is more than anyone has ever seen \nin the Senate.\n  The reason the Republicans are filibustering today is because they \nwant to pass the so-called Gas Price Reduction Act. That is the title \nof their bill. But I would argue that the title of this bill is a \ncomplete misnomer. The so-called Gas Price Reduction Act will not lower \ngas prices today, which stand at about $4 a gallon.\n  All over this country, people are deeply upset about having to pay \nthese outrageously high gas prices. They are worried about what oil \nprices will be in the winter. They understand the impact of these oil \nprices on food and other aspects of our economy. And the Republican \nlegislation is entitled ``The Gas Price Reduction Act,'' but it is not \ngoing to reduce these gas prices which are so high today. That is not \nmy view, that is President Bush's view. That is the view of everybody \nin the world. That is our Republican friends' view. They are saying, \nquite appropriately and correctly, that if you drill now, maybe in 10, \n15, or 20 years, there will be some impact on prices. Well, maybe there \nwill be and maybe there won't be, but there is no argument that in the \nmidst of a crisis today, what they are proposing will have zero impact \non our economy right now.\n\n  So whatever the merits or lack of merits--and I am not sympathetic to \ndrilling in environmentally sensitive areas in the Outer Continental \nShelf--what we should be clear about is that the Republican proposal \nwill do zero to address the crisis of high energy prices today. And \nagain, that is not just my view. President Bush's own Energy Department \nhas said that increased drilling offshore would have ``no significant \nimpact'' on gas prices until the year 2030, and even then its impact \nwould be negligible. That is what President Bush's own Energy \nDepartment is saying.\n  So perhaps our Republican friends might want to change the title of \ntheir bill from ``The Gas Price Reduction Act'' to the ``No Significant \nImpact on Gas Prices; Maybe By 2030 Act.'' That would at least be a \nmore accurate description of what they are trying to do. Maybe there \nwill be some impact by the year 2030, but let's not fool the American \npeople. The American people are angry, they are frustrated about what \nis going on today. And we could argue whether the Republican policy is \ngood or not good, but let's not kid anybody, it is not going to have \nany impact on gas and oil prices now.\n  For those who think it is okay not to do anything or see any impact \nuntil 2030, I guess they could support what the Republicans are doing. \nBut I know what is going on in Vermont; that is, workers can't afford \n$4 a gallon for gas when they are driving 50 miles to work and 50 miles \nback, and they surely can't afford the price of oil that is coming down \nthe pike next winter. They do not want action in 20 years, they want \naction now. And in my view, Madam President, that is what we should be \ndoing.\n  With the exception of my Republican friends here in Congress, there \nare very few people in this country who believe the oil companies give \none hoot about the well-being of the American people. Our Republican \nfriends are saying that if we just give these huge oil companies more \nacres offshore to drill for oil, they will certainly do the right \nthing, as they always have, for the American people. Let's just trust \nthose big oil companies because they are really staying up day after \nday, night after night, worrying about the well-being of the American \npeople. That is what their full-page ads in the New York Times and all \ntheir ads are telling us.\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\nWell, it is good to see there are at least some people in America who \nbelieve that. I don't, but apparently my Republican colleagues do.\n  Let me just mention to you, Madam President, just how much concern \nthe oil companies have for the American consumer. While the American \npeople have been paying $4 and more for a gallon of gas, ExxonMobil has \nmade more profits than any operation in the history of the world over \nthe past 2 consecutive years, making $40 billion last year alone. Oil \nprices are soaring, and ExxonMobil is making recordbreaking profits. \nBut ExxonMobil, of course, is not alone. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell \nand B.P. have also been making out like bandits. In fact, the five \nlargest oil companies in this country have made over $600 billion in \nprofits since George W. Bush has been President. Yes, they are deeply \nconcerned about the high price of gas and oil. Yes, they really are. It \nis really upsetting to them. Last year, the major oil companies in the \nUnited States made over $155 billion in profits--in just 1 year.\n  Let me tell you, Madam President, big oil companies are so concerned \nabout Americans paying high prices for gas and oil that this is what \nthey are doing with their profits. You see, our Republican friends \nwould suggest that what the oil companies are trying to do is explore \nnew areas, do new drilling, produce more oil, and lower prices. Well, I \ndon't think so, frankly. I will tell you what they are doing with their \nhuge profits.\n  In 2005, ExxonMobil gave its CEO, Lee Raymond, a $398 million \nretirement package--among the richest compensation packages in \ncorporate history. They weren't going out looking for new land to drill \non, they weren't building more refineries, and they weren't working on \nenergy efficiency. They gave their CEO a $398 million retirement \npackage.\n  In 2006, another one of those oil companies that is staying up nights \nworrying about the American people, Occidental Petroleum, gave its CEO, \nRay Irani, over $400 million in total compensation--again, beyond \ncomprehension to ordinary people.\n  In fact, there were articles recently in the press suggesting that \none of the major problems ExxonMobil had is that they had so much cash \nin hand, they literally did not know how to invest it or how to get rid \nof it. That was their major problem.\n  The situation is so absurd and the greed of the oil companies is so \noutrageous that these companies are not only giving their executives \nhuge compensation packages in their lifetimes, but they have also \ncreated a situation, if you can believe it, where these oil companies \nhave carved out huge corporate payments to the heirs of senior \nexecutives if they die in office. I guess this is what happens when you \nhave more money than you know what to do with.\n  In other words, if, according to the Wall Street Journal, the CEO of \nOccidental Petroleum dies in office, his family will get $115 million. \nThe family of the CEO of Nabors Industries, another oil company, would \nreceive $288 million. So it is not only giving out huge compensation \npackages; if the CEO dies in office, the family gets a huge package. \nMadam President, this would be funny if it were not so pathetic in the \nsense of the impact this type of spending has on the American people.\n  Not only are huge oil companies using their recordbreaking profits on \nbig compensation benefits for their CEOs, but they are also spending \nlarge sums of money buying back their own stock. In other words, when \nthey are making these very large profits, they are not going out \ndrilling for more oil, as our Republican friends are suggesting. \nOverall, since 2005--3 years ago--the five largest oil companies have \nmade $345 billion in profit and spent over $250 billion of that $345 \nbillion buying back stock and paying larger dividends to their \nstockholders. That is what they are doing with their money. They are \nnot going out and saying: Gee, how can we do more drilling? Gee, how \ncan we lower the price of oil? They are buying up stock and increasing \nthe benefits to their shareholders.\n  Last year, ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in our country, spent \n850 percent more buying back its own stock than it did on capital \nexpenditures in the United States. And that is a fact.\n  Let's not kid ourselves. The big oil companies--and I know we are not \nsupposed to talk about this too much in the Senate, but anyone who \ndoesn't believe these oil companies have huge political influence over \nwhat goes on here in Washington is surely kidding themselves. Since \n1998, the oil and gas industry has spent over $616 million on lobbying. \nIn a 10-year period, they have spent over $616 million in lobbying. \nNow, what does that mean? It means they hire the best law firms in \ntown, they hire former leading Republicans and Democrats--anybody can \ncome in and work with Members of Congress--to get their way. That is \none of the reasons why, among many other reasons, this Congress, in \nrecent years, has decided to give some $18 billion in tax breaks to oil \ncompanies despite their recordbreaking profits. Over $616 million in \nthe last 10 years on lobbying, and since 1990 they have made over $213 \nmillion in campaign contributions. And that is a simple fact.\n  Lo and behold, what we are hearing today--just coincidentally, no \ndoubt--is that the most important thing we can do in terms of the \nenergy crisis is to provide more land offshore for the oil companies to \ndrill at a time when they already have some 68 million acres of leased \nland, which they are not drilling on today.\n  The American people want action, and there are some things we can \ndo--not in 15 or 20 years but that we can do right now. Not only do we \nneed to impose, in my view, a windfall profits tax on these extremely \npowerful oil corporations, but we have to address what I perceive is a \ngrowing understanding that Wall Street investment banks, such as \nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and hedge fund managers \nare driving up the price of oil in the unregulated energy futures \nmarket. In other words, they are speculating on energy futures and \ndriving up prices.\n\n  There are estimates that 25 to 50 percent of the cost of a barrel of \noil is attributable to unregulated speculation on oil futures. I know \nthe Presiding Officer's committee has had hearings on this issue and \nother committees have had hearings on this issue. We have heard from \nsome leading energy economists, and we have heard from people in the \noil industry themselves who tell us that 25 to 50 percent of the cost \nof a barrel of oil today is not due to supply and demand or the cost of \nproduction but is due to manipulation of markets and excessive \nspeculation. In essence, Wall Street firms are making billions as they \nartificially drive up oil prices by buying, holding, and selling huge \namounts of oil on dark unregulated markets.\n  Some of my Republican friends claim that the increase in the price of \noil has nothing to do with speculation, but it is interesting to me \nthat we have had executives of major oil companies--major oil \ncompanies--who have come before Congress and who are saying, ``Why is \noil $125, $130, and $140 a barrel?'' Do you know what they say? The CEO \nof Royal Dutch Shell testified before Congress and said:\n\n       The oil fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  This is not some radical economist. It is not some leftwinger. This \nis a guy who is the head of Royal Dutch Shell.\n  The CEO of Marathon Oil recently said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  I know my Republican friends have a lot of respect for the oil \nindustry, a great competence in them. They love them and give them huge \ntax breaks. So maybe they should listen to what some of these guys are \nsaying in terms of oil speculation.\n  Some people have suggested or implied that those of us--including \npeople in the oil industry--who believe speculation is driving up \nprices are into some kind of conspiracy theory, that we just want to \ndemonize Wall Street or big investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and \nMorgan Stanley. Well, I would like to briefly read an excerpt from a \nresearch paper done by Goldman Sachs US Economic Research dated June 2, \n2008. This is what they say, and I find this interesting:\n\n       Lawmakers and regulators have begun to respond to these \n     concerns--\n\n  Concerns about high oil prices--\n\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\n\n     but we still think it is unlikely that there will be any \n     significant legislative changes enacted this year. In fact, \n     it is entirely possible that Congress will adjourn for the \n     year without enacting any further legislation focused on \n     commodity speculation.\n\n  And then this is the interesting thing they say:\n\n       However, the debate itself could break the rise in energy \n     prices for a brief period until there is greater certainty \n     regarding the legislative and regulatory outcome.\n\n  In other words, what Goldman Sachs is saying is that even the debate \non speculation in the oil industry could have an impact on slowing down \noil prices, and it may well be that is the case. We have seen that in \nthe last 2 weeks or so.\n  Let's talk a little bit about recent history and speculation and \nmarket manipulation in terms of the energy market.\n  In 2000 and 2001, our friends at Enron successfully manipulated the \nelectricity market, and the results, of course, were that in California \nand on the west coast electric rates went up by 300 percent. It is \ninteresting to remember--and I remember this--what Enron was saying at \nthat time. They were saying don't blame us, it is a supply and demand \nissue.\n\n  I gather those Enron officials, who may be in jail today, are perhaps \nstill saying that, but we know a little bit differently.\n  We also know that BP artificially increased prices on the propane gas \nmarket. They were fined for that over $300 million. We also know \nAmaranth, a hedge fund, manipulated prices on the natural gas market. \nIn fact, in 2006, Amaranth cornered the natural gas market by \ncontrolling 75 percent of all the natural gas futures contracts in a \nsingle month.\n  In other words, the idea of manipulation and speculation and control \nof a market is not a new idea. We have seen three instances in the last \n8 years, with Enron, BP, and Amaranth doing just that.\n  Given that reality, why would we think it is so shocking that is \ntaking place right now in terms of oil?\n  Let me conclude by saying it is imperative that we move now in terms \nof addressing the energy crisis. People all over this country are \nhurting. They want us to act, and we must act. To my mind, one of the \nthings we have to do is to move this country aggressively forward in \nterms of energy efficiency and in terms of sustainable energy.\n  Our Republican friends talk about wanting to grow more energy, \nincrease energy supplies. Let me inform them the Sun does that, the \nwind does that, geothermal does that, biomass does that. It is \nincomprehensible to me that time after time legislation has come before \nthis body--including today--which will simply extend the tax credits \nthat have been given for sustainable energy, and we cannot even do \nthat.\n  There are huge economic gains, not to mention moving forward in terms \nof global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions if we do that. \nYet we cannot even get the votes to do that.\n  We can move forward in terms of a windfall profits tax. We can move \nforward in speculation. We can move forward in terms of energy \nefficiency. We can move forward in terms of encouraging the growth of \nsustainable energy. Those are the things that we can do now. I believe \nthose are the things the American people want us to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to speak tonight on the issue \nof energy as well. We are very fortunate that the Senate is debating \nthe issue of energy. It is the No. 1 issue to the people of this \ncountry. Frankly, I find myself very concerned about where this debate \nis going.\n  In early July, I asked my fellow Idahoans to contact me and tell me \nwhat the high prices of fuel mean in their lives. In fact, I asked them \nnot only to tell me what it meant in their lives but what they thought \nwe ought to do in this country--Congress as well as the rest of the \ncountry--what we ought to do about these high prices of fuel.\n  The stories that came in were remarkable. Overnight I had 400 to 600 \ne-mails, and we now have over 1,200 e-mails in our office from citizens \nof the State of Idaho who are feeling the impact of these high prices. \nIt is not just a minor inconvenience in their lives. The stories they \ntell are poignant. They are disturbing.\n  One lady wrote in that at the end of the month she and her husband \njust had enough money left in their budget to either fill their gas \ntank or to buy their food. They made a choice to fill their gas tank \nbecause they had to have the fuel to get to work and keep their jobs. \nIn her response she said she didn't know exactly how they were going to \ndeal with the issue of food.\n  Others talked about the fact that they were not able to pay for \nneeded medicines. The pressure of fuel versus food versus medicine gets \ndown to the basics in our society. This is not a question of whether to \ncall off a long-planned vacation. It is not a question of whether we \nhave to adjust to some minor inconveniences. We have already done that \nin our society. This is an issue of changing the quality of life in \nAmerica that will probably not be able to be fixed or reclaimed if we \ndo not respond to it properly now.\n  As I said, I also asked my constituents to tell me what they thought \nwe ought to do. The responses were remarkable. I think the people of \nIdaho have a tremendous amount of common sense. I brag on them all the \ntime. They have come through with all kinds of suggestions about how we \nought to deal with this problem, everything from the need to conserve \nmore, to the need to use wind and solar and other renewable and \nalternative fuels, to the need to get more production of oil. They get \nit. They understand the solution to this problem is not just one thing.\n  Another remarkable thing came across in their responses to me. They \nare angry. They are angry that Congress is not dealing with the issue \nbecause they blame Congress that we are in this problem. I said before, \nsometimes it is kind of a national pastime to blame Congress for \nwhatever the problem of the day is, but in this case my constituents in \nIdaho and the rest of the public in this country are right. It is the \nresponsibility of Congress to have established a rational, \ncomprehensive, national energy policy for this country that can help us \nto be independent and strong in terms of our energy. Congress has \nfailed to do so.\n  America now needs to move forward. America is too dependent on \npetroleum as our major source of energy. For that petroleum, we are too \ndependent on foreign sources. America needs to treat our energy policy \nlike we would treat an investment portfolio. We need to diversify. We \nneed to be as conservative and as careful in the utilization of our \nenergy as possible. We need to be as efficient as we possibly can in \nterms of the utilization of that energy. And we need to have broad and \ndiverse resources of energy.\n  At the same time that we are doing that and diversifying--and I hope \nwe could diversify, we here in this Congress, help to establish a broad \ndiversified energy policy--while we are doing that we can't simply say \nthat petroleum is evil and we will no longer ever try to utilize \nproduction of oil in this country. It will take us a significant amount \nof time to transition to an economy that is less dependent and less \nheld hostage to petroleum. While we are doing that, frankly, we need to \nrecognize that we need more production of oil in the United States.\n  So where are we today in the Senate? We have before us a bill that \ndoes one thing: it addresses the futures market, the speculation that \nthe Senator from Vermont, who spoke before me, just talked about. It \ndoes nothing else. It seeks to find a solution to our national energy \nproblems in one way; that is, to establish a very aggressive new \nregulatory regime for the futures market in our country. It does not do \nso in a very good way. I will talk about that in a few minutes. In \nfact, it does so in a way that will actually harm our economy and harm \nour energy security.\n  The point is, it does only one thing. As it seeks to solve the \nproblem, it tells the American people that we have a rifleshot \nsolution, that we can simply pass this law and we will then fix the \nproblems with energy prices because we will force those markets to have \nbetter prices. The solution? A new Government system of regulation that \nwill, hopefully, control prices. Like I say, it is not going to do \nthat, and I will talk about that in a minute.\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\n  We are trying to debate this issue and bring other issues forward, \nand we have been stopped so far. The process in the Senate is not \nworking. Historically, the Senate has been a place of great debate \nwhere those with ideas about how to solve pressing problems in our \ncountry can bring them forward and those who have different and \ncompeting ideas can bring their ideas forward as amendments. And, as we \nmove forward, we would have votes on the floor of the Senate where the \nmajority could prevail and we could craft legislation and craft policy \nfor this Nation in the way that those who established this great \ncountry--and those who live in this great country--thought it should be \ndone.\n  But that is not how it is being done on this bill. We are being \npresented with a bill that we have now been on for, I think, 8 days. \nYet we have had zero votes on any alternative ideas because the \nmajority will not allow amendments to be brought forward in a fair and \nreasonable way.\n  This chart shows what was done in previous debates in the Senate on \nthe energy issue. When the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was considered, we \nspent 10 days on the Senate floor. We had 19 rollcall votes on \namendments, 23 total rollcall votes on the bill, there were 235 \namendments that were proposed to that bill, and 57 of those amendments \nwere agreed to either by vote or by unanimous consent. At that time the \naverage price of gas was just $2.26.\n  In 2007 when we debated the Energy Independence and Security Act, we \nspent 15 days on the Senate floor, 16 rollcall votes on amendments, and \n22 rollcall votes on the bill. There were 331 total amendments proposed \nduring debate on that bill, 49 total amendments agreed to in that \ndebate, and the Senate acted its will.\n  Again, what are we doing today? For 8 days we have been trying to \nbring amendments forward to present some alternative ideas, additional \nideas about how we should deal with energy policy in our country, and \nwe are told no. We are told: We may allow you to have a few votes on a \nfew selected amendments that we pick, but we will not allow a full, \nrobust debate on amendments.\n  We must get beyond the parameters of this bill. It has been argued \nthat the speculation in the futures market is controlling or is driving \nup the price of fuel. The fact is, that is simply not the case. The \nproblem is one of supply and demand.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the supply of energy, of global \ncrude from 2000 to 2008. You can see, starting in about 2004, primarily \nthrough decisions in the OPEC nations, the supply of crude oil has \nleveled out. Because of a decision to curtail supply, those nations \nthat are engaging in producing the global crude are able to impact the \nsupply and demand curves. Yet demand at that same time has not leveled \nout. China and India in particular are increasing their demand for fuel \ndramatically.\n  The problem we face is, as the supply curve levels out and as the \ndemand continues to grow, we see unbelievable pressures on the price of \nfuel. There are those who will say that is not really the way it is and \nreally speculators in the market are driving up the price. It is \npossible to impact a market in a way that is abusive, and we have \norganizations that help us on that. But let's look what has happened so \nfar in the speculation, the futures market, trading in NYMEX in the \nUnited States.\n  In the speculation in the derivative markets, in the futures market, \nevery buy must be mirrored by a sell. The theory there has been this \nimmense new pressure for speculation in the futures market creates the \nimpression that there have been all of these purchases that have driven \nup the price. But as you see from this chart, every time there was \nsomeone who thought the price was going to go up, there was someone who \nhad to believe the price was not, who had to be the buyer or seller in \nthat transaction.\n  When you have the long sells and the short sells virtually mirroring \neach other, it indicates there is a reasonably effective functioning \nmarket.\n  It has been said on the floor of the Senate that the experts say that \nspeculation is driving up the price of fuel by 20 to 50 percent.\n  The reality is the vast majority of experts are saying that simply is \nnot the case; that we can evaluate what is happening in the futures \nmarkets and determine whether there is being manipulation.\n  And what is the determination that is being made? A recent report by \nour Government agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and Energy \nDepartment, found that speculative trades in oil contracts had little \nto no effect on the rising prices over the last 5 years.\n  The Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets' preliminary \nassessment is that current oil prices and the increase in oil prices \nbetween January 2003 and June 2008 are largely due to fundamental \nsupply and demand factors.\n  During the same time period, activity on the crude oils futures \nmarket, as measured by the number of contracts outstanding, the trading \nactivity and the number of traders, has increased significantly. The \namount of trading in these markets has increased significantly. But \nwhile these increases broadly coincided with the runup in crude prices, \nthe task force's analysis is that to this date there is no support for \nthe proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven \nchanges in those oil prices.\n  In fact, according to the report, if a group of market participants \nhad systematically driven up prices, detailed daily position data \nshould show the group's position changes preceded the price changes. \nBut the task force data indicates the changes in futures markets \nparticipation by speculators have not preceded the price changes. In \nfact, on the contrary, most speculation traders typically alter their \nposition following a price change, suggesting that they are responding \nto the supply and demand dynamics, just as one would see in an \nefficiently operating market.\n  Furthermore, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets has \nalso weighed in on this debate. They state:\n\n       To date, the PWG has not found valid evidence to suggest \n     that high crude oil prices over the long term are a direct \n     result of speculation or systematic market manipulation by \n     traders. Rather, the prices appear to be reflecting tight \n     global supplies and the growing world demand for oil, \n     particularly in emerging economies. As a result, Congress \n     should proceed cautiously before drastically changing the \n     regulation of energy markets.\n\n  Other experts are saying the same thing. In fact, the amount of \nexperts who are weighing in on this today from all perspectives is \noverwhelming, to the point that there are very few now who are \ncontinuing this mantra that somehow we can solve all of our problems by \ncontrolling the futures markets better.\n  The International Energy Agency states:\n\n       There is little evidence that large investment flows into \n     the futures markets are causing an imbalance between supply \n     and demand.\n\n  They go on to state, and this is something I think Americans need to \nhear:\n\n       Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking \n     the necessary steps to improve supply-side access and \n     investment or to implement measures to improve energy \n     efficiency.\n\n  Others are respected in market analysis. Warren Buffett recently \nsaid:\n\n       It is not speculation, it is supply and demand. We do not \n     have an excess capacity of oil in the world any more, and \n     that is what you are seeing in oil prices.\n\n  Frankly, one of the more critical aspects of this is that investors \nin these markets actually provide liquidity to our oil industry. \nInvestors play a very valuable role in the futures market by \ntransferring risks from commercial participants such as farmers and \nairlines, and providing liquidity, reducing volatility, and \ncontributing to the price discovery process.\n  One example is Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines provides a \npowerful example of how investors can help companies mitigate their \nrisk. It is called hedging, which is made possible by the participation \nof investors in trading oil futures. That has saved Southwest Airlines \n$3.5 billion since 1999.\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\n  How does this work? Let's take an example of an oil producer, \nsomebody who wants to go out and invest some money in a new oil rig or \na new refinery, to engage in some production of some further resources, \nenergy resources for the United States, and they want to get a loan for \n$5 billion. There is probably no source in the world that would loan \nthem $5 billion to go out and engage in this new investment unless they \nwere able to hedge that loan, meaning they need to go into the futures \nmarket and sell the first 3 to 5 years of production of this facility \nso they can show the bank or the financing institution that is going to \nloan them the money that they have a source of capital or cash to repay \nthe loan.\n  If they are not able to go into a market and make that hedge, they \nwill not be able to get that loan. They will then not make the \ninvestment and we will not then see the production. And if there are \nnot those who are willing to invest in that futures market, on the \nother side of the transaction, those who are called speculators, then \nwe do not have the liquidity in the market for that loan to be \nadequately hedged.\n  It is very important for the risk management in our economy that we \ndo not impact our futures markets in ways that will disturb the proper \nfunctioning of a true market.\n  Congress has enacted various tax incentives for renewable energy \nwhich also can be impacted negatively by harmful regulation of the \nfutures market. In the same way as the example I gave with regard to \nthose who might want to invest in an oil facility, if there cannot be \nadequate hedging of investments in wind and solar and other facilities \nsuch as that for which we have enacted tax incentives to try to move \ninto renewable energy, then those investments as well without a futures \nmarket will not be able to flourish as they should.\n  These kind of impacts, these kind of dynamics that could occur in our \neconomy from improper regulation of the market are real. Again, some \nsay: Well, you know, the oil companies or someone has been out there, \nspeculators have been manipulating the futures market.\n  Commodity prices have shot up not just in oil but across the board. \nThis chart shows a number of commodities, from wheat to corn, to steel, \nto iron ore, nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, all the way along, \nincluding oil. This is the line for the WTI oil, that is the futures \nmarket in oil right here.\n  As you will see, there are many commodities that have risen in price \nover the past few years, from 2006 to 2008, even more so than oil. The \npoint there is, some of these commodities are regulated or traded on \nfutures markets and some are not. The same dynamics of supply and \ndemand are hitting us in other commodities as they are in oil.\n  According to Robert Samuelson, an economist and Washington Post \ncolumnist, the price of corn has increased 70 percent from 2002 to \n2007; copper has increased 300 percent during the same time; steel, 117 \npercent. And interestingly, steel is one of those that is not traded in \nthe commodities market. Neither is iron ore, the cost of which has \nrecently increased by 85 percent in Chinese markets.\n  The point here is that supply and demand, not investors, is what is \ndriving up the prices in commodities. How else can you explain the fact \nthat raw materials that are not traded on commodity exchanges are \nincreasing at the same rapid pace?\n  Let's look specifically at the crude oil issue in the next chart. \nThose who say it is the futures market which is driving up the price of \noil would tell you this market right here, the one in red, for West \nTexas Intermediate, where the futures in oil are traded, is where some \nnot normal increases are being forced, where market speculation is \nmanipulating the price.\n  Yet if we look at other physical crude oil grades, the West Texas \nSour, Light Louisiana Sweet, the Mars, the Dated Brent, and the Dubai, \nthey have all gone up actually higher than the West Texas Intermediate.\n  Now, I know this is getting down into the weeds a little bit, but the \npoint here is, every one of those other types of oil is a physical \ncrude oil that is not traded in futures markets. There are no \nspeculators driving up these prices or causing these prices to occur. \nThese prices are occurring at the spot where those who produce the oil \nare selling it to those who use the oil.\n\n  One more indication that in market after market after market, not \njust the futures market, but in every market, the price of oil is going \nup. And again the reason is because supply and demand is out of \nbalance.\n  Let me give you another example. Onions. In 1958 Congress had a \nsimilar issue to the one we have today. They responded to a sharp \nincrease in onion prices by passing legislation to ban all futures \ntrading in onions. And that law, by the way, is still law today.\n  But there has been no stabilizing effect on the price of onions. In \nfact, the price of onions soared 400 percent in late 2006 and 2007, \nonly to drop by 96 percent thereafter, and then increase another 300 \npercent a month later.\n  The point is that wide volatile swings in price occur in an \nunregulated market or in a market where there is not a futures system \nwhere speculators can invest and provide more stability. The onion \nmarket is a perfect example. Many of the experts who are now weighing \nin on the oil issue are stating that if we take the opportunity for \nspeculation in the futures markets out of the equation, then we can \nexpect to see wider fluctuations in the price of oil.\n  Now, is that to say there is nothing we should do in the Senate with \nregard to futures markets or that there can never be any manipulation \nor there is no reason to pay attention to this issue? No. It is \npossible. It is not easy, but it is possible for very concerted efforts \nto be undertaken to manipulate markets.\n  That is why we have groups such as the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission that are basically our cops on the beat to make sure they \npay attention to what is happening in these markets and stop efforts to \nmanipulate before they occur.\n  So what should we do? What should we be doing in the context of this \npiece of the equation with regard to our securities, our futures \nmarkets? We need to be strengthening the CFTC. The CFTC has not had a \nsignificant staffing increase level since--well, let's put it this way. \nTheir staffing levels at the CFTC are at a 33-year low.\n  In one of the amendments we wish to bring forward, we would provide \nthe resources for the CFTC to hire 100 new employees, enough staff so \nthey can even more aggressively and effectively monitor what is \nhappening in these markets, and make sure there is no effort to cause a \nmanipulation in any significant way.\n  In addition, before this Senate, as we speak, we have nominations for \nthree members of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission who still \nlanguish on our docket: Walt Lukken, Bart Chilton, and Scott O'Malia. \nThey should have been confirmed by this Senate to the CFTC months and \nmonths ago, but they languish because of partisan politics. They need \nto be moved forward promptly. If we are serious about wanting to \noversee these futures markets effectively, then we need to put those in \nplace who are tasked to do so, and to make sure they have the staff to \nbe able to do so effectively.\n  The CFTC has undertaken a number of steps recently to improve the \noversight and transparency of energy futures markets, and we need to \ngive them the resources to get the job done well.\n  The underlying legislation is based on the premise that we can simply \nreach our hand in, as the heavy hand of Government and change the price \nof oil. The reality is the opposite.\n  I said earlier we need a broad-based approach. Yes, let us strengthen \nthe CFTC, but let's open the floor of this Senate, and let's allow the \nSenate to debate other ideas. What are some of the other ideas we need \nto be pursuing?\n  For one, we need an aggressive perspective on energy efficiency and \nconservation. With energy and gas prices spiraling upward, America can \nno longer consume energy as we have in the past. In fact, energy \nefficiency is often called the fifth fuel because every gallon of gas \nnot consumed and every kilowatt hour not utilized is the equivalent of \none produced. The numbers are stark. If you look at the amount we have \nsaved since 1973 through efficiency and energy conservation efforts, it \nis the greatest source of energy we have. It outstrips petroleum, coal, \nnatural gas, nuclear power, and all others.\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nWe still have tremendous potential for strides forward. The estimates \nwe have before us are that the United States can cost-effectively \nreduce energy consumption by an additional 25 to 30 percent or more \nover the course of the next 20 to 25 years. That is a significant fact. \nThat should be a significant part of our national energy policy. The \nkinds of things we need to do there are the kinds of things we need to \nbe debating and voting on and incentivizing in the Senate.\n  The Alliance to Save Energy estimates that if the proper energy \nefficiency measures across the industrial, residential generation and \ntransportation sectors were put into place, we could save $312 billion \na year. The savings in the residential sector alone total $145 billion \na year or $500 for every citizen over a 10-year period. An example: The \nnew fluorescent light bulbs use one-fifth the electricity of a \nconventional light bulb and can save $50 apiece over the lifespan of \njust one light bulb. Other ways include greater appliance efficiency \nstandards, smart grid technologies, as well as weatherization. Research \nand technology are key to this. In fact, one of the things we can do in \nour transportation sector to reduce our reliance on petroleum is to \nmove to low-energy vehicles. Battery research is well underway, and we \ncould move to plug-in hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles relatively \nsoon, if this Congress would get engaged and incentivize and strengthen \nour commitment to that technology effort.\n  We already have implemented new CAFE standards, which was a proper \nand positive step forward. My point is this: One of the first things we \nneed to do in our rational comprehensive energy policy is to engage in \nconservation and efficiencies. It is our fifth source of fuel and one \nof our most significant potential sources.\n  We also need to move into renewable and alternative energy sources. \nWe have listed a sampling of them here: Hydropower, nuclear, biomass, \nsolar, wind, geothermal, and tidal. Some of them are not at the stage \nwhere they can economically survive without support or incentives. \nFrankly, as a government, we need to be working in every one of those \nareas to do the research, the technology, and to provide incentive \nsupport for us to move aggressively into those areas.\n  Let me give a couple examples of what we could do. Nuclear power is \nthe only reliable base load generation that emits no carbon or other \nair pollutants. To supply our growing electrical generation needs, the \nEIA estimates at least 60 new nuclear plants are needed in the next 25 \nyears to supplant new fossil-fuel generation. But no new plant has been \nbuilt in the last 30 years. The main reason for this is the facilities \nare expensive to site and to build. They require enormous amounts of \ncapital for design and construction before any profits can be realized, \nand our current regulatory process challenges this whole system and \nextends just the permitting process so long that it makes it hard \nfinancially to make it pan out. Congress could fix that. We need to be \nas aggressive as we possibly can to incentivize, strengthen, and expand \nour nuclear energy industry.\n  Geothermal: An MIT study concluded it would be affordable to generate \nover 100 gigawatts of geothermal electricity by 2050 in the United \nStates alone for an investment of $1 billion in research and \ndevelopment over 15 years. To give perspective, that would replace 100 \ncoal plants.\n  Wind: Idaho is ranked 13th in the Nation for wind energy, and global \nwind power currently stands at 94 gigawatts per year. China has a plan \nto equal that itself by the year 2020.\n  Biofuels and ethanol: I support this diverse energy portfolio, and \nbiomass and biofuels, conventional and cellulosic ethanol, as well as \nbiodiesel, are one part of the solution. As concerns about the rising \nprice of corn mount, the need for commercial cellulosic ethanol \nproduction becomes more apparent. It is estimated that 1.3 billion dry \ntons of biomass can be harvested annually from U.S. forests and \nagricultural land without negatively impacting food, feed or export \ndemands. What that translates into is enough ethanol to replace 30 \npercent of the current U.S. petroleum consumption.\n  Hydropower produces 7 percent of the U.S. electricity supply and \nalmost 70 percent in my part of the world. It also accounts for 80 \npercent of the Nation's total renewable electricity generation, making \nit the Nation's leading renewable energy source. Hydropower turbines \nare capable of converting 90 percent of the available energy into \nelectricity, which makes them more efficient than any other form of \ngeneration.\n  The point is the United States can make great gains to, No. 1, become \nless dependent on petroleum and, No. 2, to generate much more energy \nsupply, if we will get aggressive about focusing on renewable and \nalternative energy sources. I have gone through a few in this sampling.\n  Having said all that, that we can do what we need to, to effectively \nmonitor and control and manage our futures markets, that we need to \nfocus on renewable and alternative energy sources, that we need to have \nan aggressive efficiency and conservation effort, does that mean we can \nsimply ignore the price of oil? The answer is no. Let's go to the next \nchart. Even if we were to agree today and the President were to sign \ninto law all these new incentives and the many things we could be doing \nin terms of conservation, renewable and alternative fuels and the like, \nit still would take several decades to transition away from being a \npurely almost totally petroleum-based economy. During that transition \ntime, we still need oil. Oil is going to be key to our energy future \nnow and for years in the future. While we transition away, we have to \nrecognize that. But today, based on Energy Information Administration \nestimates, the United States is expected to spend $570 billion on \nimported foreign oil in 2008.\n  If you have been watching the T. Boone Pickens ads and the \ninformation that comes on those, the estimates are even higher, as high \nas $700 billion. That is $500 to $700 billion that flows right out of \nthe U.S. economy to other nations. What does a transfer of that kind of \nwealth mean? Every year that we send $500 to $700 billion outside the \nUnited States for other countries to produce oil and sell it to us, we \nerode our national security through loss of physical control over our \nown resources. We certainly lose jobs. Imagine the number of jobs we \ncould have in the United States if we were engaged in production of our \nown oil. We increase foreign holdings of U.S. dollars that are out of \nour control. We have increased foreign holdings of American debt. We \nhave a loss of domestic investment in huge amounts. Overall, we have a \nweakened U.S. dollar. We are sending our wealth overseas because we are \ntoo dependent on foreign sources of petroleum.\n\n  Do we have the opportunity to change that? Can we do any different? \nOr are we in a situation where the United States does not have access \nto oil resources? The world is using more oil, but U.S. production has \nfallen to its lowest levels in 60 years. The IEA projects that global \noil consumption is going to grow by 37 percent in 2030; whereas, annual \noil production will need to be 13.5 billion barrels higher today to \nmeet that increase in demand. What kind of potential do we have in the \nUnited States? Let's go to the next chart.\n  There are a number of things we can do. The United States must be \nrecognized as one of the strongest and most energy-rich nations, when \nyou think about oil in the world. There has been a lot of debate about \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. The projected OCS resources would equal \nalmost 50 years of imports from OPEC. Think about that. Let's go to the \nnext chart. Our OCS is estimated to have over 100 billion barrels of \noil. We yearly import a little over 2 billion from OPEC nations. Simply \nturning to the Outer Continental Shelf instead of sending all the money \nwe now send to OPEC nations, we could generate that oil ourselves \nsimply on the OCS in the United States.\n  We have Western shale oil resources. These are phenomenal. Proven \nAmerican oil shale resources could provide our country with 800 billion \nbarrels of oil, which is more than three times the reserves of Saudi \nArabia. This chart shows some very interesting information. Over here \nis the world's proven oil reserves. I think that is 1.7 trillion \nbarrels of oil. This is the Saudi Arabia proven portion of that. This \nis the U.S. proven oil shale reserve. Remember oil shale is not \nconsidered to be the same\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\nas oil. So if we were to take the oil shale and then produce it into \noil, what could we start doing in comparison to the oil available in \nthe world? This is what we know we have: U.S. proven oil shale \nreserves, 800 billion barrels. But there are estimates that the 800 \nbillion barrels is low and that we actually have up to 2 trillion \nbarrels of oil available in our oil shale reserves. Yet we send dollars \noverseas to get our oil.\n  So we have the OCS and the oil shale reserves. We have the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, and we have debated this in the Senate and \nHouse for years. But projected resources in ANWR would equal over 17 \nyears of our imports from OPEC. Again, another major source of oil that \nthe United States can access.\n  The reason I am going through this is to show that the United States \ndoes not have to be dependent on foreign nations for our oil. We have \nother resources. The U.S. onshore resources--and that is not the Outer \nContinental Shelf but what we have right here onshore--are shown here \nat basically 35.5 billion barrels of oil. The yellow part NWR; the red \nis all the rest. Again, the comparison there is to OPEC. Yet the United \nStates has allowed itself to become so dependent on OPEC that we \ntransport $570 billion a year to other nations. They are not all OPEC \nnations, but the vast majority of it goes to OPEC nations.\n  Another source is coal to liquids. The United States has 496 billion \ntons of demonstrated coal reserves, which is equivalent to almost 1 \ntrillion barrels of oil, over 30 percent larger than the known Middle \nEast reserves of crude oil. In fact, the United States is often called \nthe Saudi Arabia of coal. But that may actually be an understatement, \naccording to the American Coal Foundation, because domestic coal \nreserves contain more energy than that of all the world's oil reserves \ncombined. Again, the United States has a phenomenal resource here that \nwe are not taking advantage of.\n\n  These are groups that are starting to now come forward--and this is, \nagain, a sampling of the list--coming forward and saying the United \nStates must get engaged in its own oil production.\n  I know my time is running out, but the response that has been made to \nthis is that: Well, we can't get this oil for another 10 years. In \nfact, some say we can't get it for another 20 years. Well, depending on \nthe source or the specific location, whether it is the Outer \nContinental Shelf or the onshore sources or the oil shale, it will take \n5, 10, to 15 years to bring this resource into production. My first \nanswer to those who say: Well, this will take 10 years to get on line \nis that is what you said 10 years ago. In fact, it was what was said 15 \nyears ago; it was what was said 20 years ago. We need to make the step \nnow to begin making the United States less dependent on foreign sources \nof oil.\n  It is also said we have 68 million acres of lease land that is not \nbeing produced right now. Well, let's take another look at what that \nmeans. That assumes somebody is basically hoarding acreage on leased \nland. The success rates for new onshore and offshore oil leases are not \n100 percent; in other words, not every lease the United States issues \nresults in oil being produced commercially. The reason is there is not \noil underneath all the land. The companies that have to make the \ninvestment to go out and explore for it and then ultimately produce it \ndon't know for sure whether there is oil under there when they purchase \nthe lease. So it takes about 10 years of time from the purchase of the \nlease to go through the exploration process, and then if there is oil \nfound, the permitting process, and then they move forward.\n  Most of the obvious places have already been leased out. The new \nleases are generating onshore about 10 percent success; offshore, 20 \npercent; and then in the shallow offshore, 33 percent success. The \npoint being it is far too easy to simply say: Well, we have 68 million \nacres of leases out there; let's rely on those. Those leases are all in \nthe process of either being explored or being returned because they are \nnot being produced.\n  Let's look at the next chart. This chart shows what the status of \nthese nonproducing leases is. For those who say let's go out and get \nthe 68 million acres of leases and use them, right now, 50 percent of \nthem are in the data-gathering process and they will either be produced \nor returned, depending on whether there is oil there that can be \ncommercially found, but they are in the process of being pursued. \nTwenty-five percent they have found oil on and they are drilling or \nthey are preparing for drilling. In another 10 percent, they have \nconfirmed discovery and they are under construction. In 15 percent, the \ninitial analysis is complete, and there is low commercial potential and \nthey are likely to be returned to the Federal Government. That is the \nstatus of the ones that are currently not producing.\n  The point, though, is those who argue we should rely totally on the \ncurrent status of our lease effort are saying let's have no new \nproduction. Everything they are talking about is either in production \nor in exploration or in preparation for production, but what they don't \ntell you is that 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off the \nlower 48 States is off limits to development. There are no leases \nthere. Eighty-three percent of the onshore Federal lands are currently \noff limits or facing restrictions to development. There are no leases \nthere.\n  If you go back and think about the potential we have in the offshore \noil, in the oil shale, in ANWR, in our onshore oil, and in the \ntremendous coal-to-liquids potential we have, there is no reason the \nUnited States should not aggressively seek to become energy independent \nin the arena of oil.\n  There are those who say: Well, that is because the big oil companies \nhave the Republicans in their pockets and as we heard today, there is \nplenty of oil being produced. We just have to look at these acres, \nthese leases that are not being used. Again, the reality is the United \nStates of America, since the 1970s, has said no, basically no to \nfurther production, and that is why we see us increasingly and more \nincreasingly dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  In conclusion, the United States faces very serious threats to our \nfuture way of life. Our national security and our economic security are \nat risk. It is appropriate that we be here debating in the Senate on \nthis issue. What is not appropriate is that ideas about all of these \ndifferent kinds of production and renewable and alternative energy \nsources and conservation and efficiency measures are not allowed to be \ndebated on this floor. Instead, we are told we are simply going to have \na new government regulation system and the government is going to have \na little more control of our markets and that is going to fix the \nproblem of oil, and that is going to make it so the price of gas goes \ndown. Well, it is not. I call on our leadership in this Senate to \nsimply allow us to have a traditional, fair system of debate on the \nfloor on the energy issue so we can debate all of these ideas. If some \nof them are bad, let them be voted down, but let's debate these ideas \nand the many ideas that others of my colleagues have about how we \nshould solve our energy crisis in this country. I am confident if we \nwill allow such a full and robust debate to occur, a tremendous amount \nof good ideas will come forward, and out of that debate will come a \ncomprehensive, rational national energy policy that will focus on a \ndiversification on our approach to energy and will put the United \nStates on a sound, strong pathway toward energy independence.\n  If we don't do that and we refuse and shut down debate and allow only \nsome kind of a market regulatory solution to be put into place, we will \nfind we will have fouled up our markets, caused volatility in the price \nof oil. We will not have done anything to generate one more drop of oil \nor one more kilowatt of electricity or one more energy conservation \neffort that would reduce the consumption of oil or electricity, and we \nwill see gas prices continue to rise.\n  It is incumbent upon us as Senators to call for a full debate. If we \ndo so, the United States has the capacity, the resources, the \ningenuity, and the ability to become energy independent and to become \nstrong in the context of our energy policy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of the hundreds of Korean war veterans living in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. This July 27 marked the 55th anniversary of \nthe cease-fire that ended that conflict.\n  After 3 years of battle which nearly forced American and South Korean \ntroops from the peninsula, the determination and bravery of our \nservicemen prevailed. Our heroes in uniform ensured that the people of \nSouth Korea would remain free.\n  Recently, nearly 300 Kentuckian Korean war veterans were recognized \nfor their service by retired Korean Major General Seung-Woo Choi. Major \nGeneral Choi was a child during the Korean war, but he wanted to say \nthank you to the brave Americans who fought to protect his and his \nfamily's freedom. So he traveled from South Korea to my hometown of \nLouisville, KY, to honor them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full newspaper article describing \nthis ceremony be printed in the Record. I know the entire U.S. Senate \nstands with me to recognize the tremendous valor of our veterans, and \nto honor the sacrifice of those who did not return.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 25, 2008]\n\n     Korean War Vets Honored: S. Korean General Presents Medallions\n\n                           (By J.D. Williams)\n\n       Looking back, Joseph Scott said he is thankful to be a \n     veteran of the Korean War.\n       In 1950, Scott joined his two brothers, James and Talmadge, \n     and enlisted in the Army.\n       Yesterday, the 77-year-old and nearly 300 other Korean War \n     veterans from Kentucky were honored at the Kentucky \n     Exposition Center for their service.\n       ``I'm thankful I was there,'' Scott said of the war. ``It \n     was quite an experience.''\n       The veterans were given a medallion designed by retired \n     Korean Maj. Gen. Seung-Woo Choi, who came to Louisville from \n     South Korea to honor them. Choi was a child during the Korean \n     War, but has made it a priority to offer his thanks to \n     veterans of the war that ensured South Korea's freedom.\n       Since 2002, Choi has presented over 5,000 medallions to \n     veterans across the nation.\n       People from various veterans' organizations spoke at the \n     event, and the Kentucky Korean Women's Choir performed.\n       ``The sacrifice you made for the Korean people has not been \n     forgotten . . . you saved our freedom,'' said Charles Park, a \n     native of Korea who is with the Korea Foundation of Kentucky.\n       Marilyn Mullins, 67, the widow of Edward Mullins, said her \n     husband would have loved to be there. He died in April 2007 \n     of complications from diabetes.\n       ``I wish he could have been here to accept it himself,'' \n     Mullins said of receiving the medallion. ``He would have been \n     glad to meet the general.''\n       She said the medallion is the only award her late husband \n     has been presented. She said he was supposed to receive the \n     National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal and \n     the United Nations Service Medal, but they never reached him.\n       James Hall, 76, of Bowling Green, said he was glad to be \n     with fellow Korean War vets.\n       Hall, who was 18 when he was deployed to Korea, was in the \n     battle at Chosin Reservoir, which he called a ``horrible \n     place at a horrible time.''\n       He said the severe cold with snow and without heat and warm \n     food was nearly unbearable, but soldiers endured to ensure \n     South Korea's freedom.\n       ``I had tried to put a lot of things about Korea out of my \n     mind, but it was wonderful to be with the veterans I served \n     with,'' Hall said. ``It reminded me of how important it was \n     for us to be there so South Korea could be free.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7768-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7768-S7769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend marked the 19th \nanniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, \none of the Nation's most critical and effective civil rights laws. It \nis fitting that as we celebrate its passage, we reflect on the progress \nwe have made in expanding possibilities for Americans with disabilities \nand the challenges that still remain.\n  We passed the ADA in recognition that the bedrock principles of human \ndignity and equal opportunity require all Americans to be judged on \ntheir individual merits and not on the prejudices of others. This law \npromised generations of Americans the opportunity to leave their mark \non a country that had only years before denied them full participation. \nI, like many of my colleagues, supported this historic act. I hoped it \nwould serve as a vital tool against the barriers that had long excluded \npersons with disabilities from fully participating in society.\n  By any reasonable measure, the ADA has been a success. Today, persons \nwith disabilities enjoy rights many of us have long taken for granted. \nNow they\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\nhave access to public transportation built to accommodate people in \nwheelchairs. They have the ability to stay in hotels, travel, and enter \nschools and places of entertainment equipped for their needs. Indeed, \nalmost every office building in America is fully accessible to them. \nThus, the enactment of the ADA transformed our country and we are a \nbetter Nation because of it.\n  Despite these significant advances, recent decisions from the Supreme \nCourt and lower courts attempt to erode the ADA's protections and \nthreaten to turn back the clock on our progress. I am particularly \ndisturbed by rulings that have narrowed the ADA in ways we never \nintended. Rather than broadly interpreting the ADA's mandate, as we \nintended, courts have repeatedly interpreted that law to embody a \n``strict and demanding'' standard for determining who qualifies as an \nindividual with a disability. These narrow rulings ensure that the \npersons we intended to shield, including those with severe illnesses, \nlike epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, are no longer protected. As a \nconsequence, millions of Americans who suffer discrimination are now \nexcluded from ADA protection.\n  A few years ago, a Federal judge in Vermont's neighboring State of \nNew Hampshire ruled that a woman with breast cancer was not \nsufficiently disabled to be protected by the ADA. Court rulings \ncontrary to Congress's intent for the ADA are not limited to the New \nEngland States. Last year, a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit unanimously ruled that even mental \nretardation did not constitute a sufficient disability under the ADA.\n  The message sent by these rulings is as unfortunate as it is \nundeniable: the courts no longer consider certain persons ``disabled \nenough'' to be protected. That means an employer could fire or refuse \nto hire a qualified worker on the basis of his or her disability, and \ndefend that action in court on the grounds that the worker was not \n``disabled enough'' to be protected under law.\n  In addition, the legislative history is crystal clear. Congress \nintended the ADA to protect all persons without regard to mitigating \ncircumstances. Indeed, the Senate committee report on the ADA expressly \nstated ``[w]hether a person has a disability should be assessed without \nregard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable \naccommodations or auxiliary aids.'' Despite this clear intent, courts \nhave ruled that people with disabilities who take medication or use \nassistive devices should not be considered disabled.\n  I am particularly concerned that these rulings will undermine the \nrights of thousands of veterans with disabilities who, upon returning \nfrom the war, will enter the civilian workforce to support their \nfamilies. Many of these veterans have disabilities, including post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome, that may be controlled with medication. If \nany of them suffer job discrimination, we must make sure they will have \na remedy.\n  Equally disturbing is that many of these cases can lead all Americans \ninto what Senator Harkin has aptly described as a legal catch-22:\n\n       People with serious health conditions [] who are fortunate \n     to find treatments that make them more capable and \n     independent and, thus, more able to work may find that they \n     are no longer protected by the ADA . . . . On the other hand, \n     if they stop their medication or stop using an assistive \n     device, they will be considered a person with a disability \n     under the ADA but they won't be qualified for the job.\n\n  We must act to remedy these erroneous court decisions. Last month, \nthe House overwhelmingly passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \nRestoration Act. Now it is the Senate's turn to respond. This \nlegislation would reverse these flawed decisions and restore the \noriginal congressional intent of the ADA. First, the bill would clarify \nCongress's purpose to reinstate a broad scope of protection for a range \nof persons with disabilities under the ADA. Second, the legislation \nwould modify findings in the ADA that have been used by courts to \nnarrowly interpret what constitutes a ``disability.'' Third, the bill \nwould lower the burden of proving that one is ``disabled enough'' to \nqualify for coverage.\n  This long overdue legislation has ample support from both disability \ngroups and business interests. I hope this bipartisan bill does not \nfall victim to the petty partisan obstruction that has prevented \npassage of other civil rights measures in this Congress that had broad \nbipartisan support, like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. While \nunprecedented obstruction tactics have led Senate Republicans to stall \none bill after another on the Senate floor, it is well past time for us \nto turn the page on partisan tactics designed to thwart critical civil \nrights bills.\n  Indeed, our heritage of freedom and our continued march towards \nperfecting our Union, should remind us all that civil rights \nlegislation holds a unique place in this institution. These bills bring \nus closer to fulfilling the promises engrained in our founding charters \nof establishing freedom and equality for all Americans. Thus, they \nshould be held to a higher standard than other bills.\n  Time has shown the ADA to have been one of our Nation's most \neffective tools in combating discrimination. Its continued \neffectiveness is important to ensure that the great progress we have \nmade in widening the doors of opportunity for all Americans continues \nin the future.\n  We have before us a historic opportunity to restore the ADA's \noriginal intent and reclaim the basic rights it extended to persons \nwith disabilities. I was proud to support the ADA in the 101st \nCongress, and I am pleased to support this year's bill as it moves \nforward. I hope this bill will be promptly passed by the Senate and \nsigned into law by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7769-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7769-S7770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE WAR POWERS CONSULTATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I recognize the members of the \nNational War Powers Commission, particularly the cochairs and my dear \nfriends--former Secretaries of State James A. Baker and Warren \nChristopher--for their distinguished and valuable work in bringing \nforward this critical legislation to address this important issue to \nour Nation.\n  Few would dispute that the most important, and perhaps the most \nfateful, decisions our leaders make involve the decision of whether to \ngo to war. Yet after more than 200 years of constitutional history, the \nextent of the powers the respective branches of government possess in \nmaking such decisions is still heavily debated.\n  Let me first outline some points regarding the legislative history of \nthe War Powers Resolution. On November 7, 1973, Congress passed the War \nPowers Resolution over President Nixon's veto, by a vote of 284 to 135 \nin the House, and a vote of 75 to 18 in the Senate. The legislation was \npassed purportedly to restore a congressional role in authorizing the \nuse of force that was thought by many to have been lost in the Cold War \nand Vietnam war. The War Powers Resolution was intended to provide a \nmechanism for Congress and the President to participate in decisions to \nsend members of the U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities.\n  Less than 2 years after its passage by Congress in 1973, legislative \nproposals were introduced to amend the War Powers Resolution. The War \nPowers Resolution continued to raise concerns among the executive and \nlegislative branches of government throughout the next decade as the \nNation faced such situations as in El Salvador, Lebanon, and Libya.\n  Several legislative proposals were introduced in Congress to modify \nor repeal the War Powers Resolution. These legislative proposals were \nreferred to the appropriate committee on the House or Senate side, but \nnone were ever passed by Congress.\n  The War Powers Resolution again became an issue regarding activities \nin the Persian Gulf after an Iraqi aircraft fired a missile on the USS \nStark on May 17, 1987, killing 37 sailors. Shortly afterwards, the \nUnited States began to reflag Kuwaiti oil tankers and provide a U.S. \nnaval escort for Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Persian Gulf. As \nmilitary escalation also continued to increase in the Persian Gulf \nregion as a result of the Iran-Iraq War, the Congress became concerned \nthat U.S. forces could be committed to the region without consultation \nbetween the executive and legislative branch.\n  Consequently, 20 years ago, on May 19, 1988, I, along with two of our \nformer colleagues--Senators Mitchell and\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\nNunn--joined Senator Byrd and introduced the War Powers Resolution \nAmendments of 1988, known as S.J. Res. 323. Senator Boren later joined \nas well as a cosponsor of this legislation in June 1988. I humbly state \ntoday that I was the only Republican cosponsor of the legislation. This \npiece of legislation, however, was referred to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, where it remained.\n  Subsequently, on January 25, 1989, I again joined Senator Byrd, but \nthis time along with five of our former colleagues--Senators Boren, \nCohen, Danforth, Mitchell, and Nunn--and introduced the War Powers \nResolution Amendments of 1989, known as S. 2. Our former colleagues and \nI proposed legislation to modify the War Powers Resolution of 1973.\n  These amendments were intended to: require the President to consult \nwith six designated Members of Congress ``in every instance in which \nconsultation is'' required under the War Powers Resolution of 1973; \nrequire the President and the six designated Members of Congress to \n``establish a schedule of regular meetings'' to ``ensure adequate \nconsultation on vital national security issues;'' establish a \n``permanent consultative group'' within Congress, which would be \ncomprised of 18 Members of Congress; and require the President to \nconsult with the permanent consultative group at the request of a \nmajority of the 6 designated Members of Congress, unless the President \ndetermines that consultation needs to be limited for national security \npurposes.\n  Unfortunately, neither of these proposed pieces of legislation were \nvoted on by the Senate. However, I subsequently cosponsored another \nsimilar piece of legislation, the Peace Powers Act of 1995, sponsored \nby our former distinguished majority leader, Senator Bob Dole. Hearings \nwere held on this piece of legislation by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, where it remained.\n  For over 35 years, despite these and similar legislative efforts, no \nmodifications were made to the War Powers Resolution Act of 1973. \nToday, there still remains no clear mechanism or requirement for the \nPresident and Congress to consult before committing the Nation to war.\n  It is this Senator's opinion that the Nation benefits when the \nPresident and Congress consult frequently, deliberately, and \nmeaningfully regarding matters of national security-and-that is exactly \nwhy I felt compelled to bring to my colleagues attention the important \nwork recently completed by the National War Powers Commission.\n  The National War Powers Commission was formed in February 2007--by \nthe University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs, which is \ndirected by Virginia's former Governor Gerald L. Baliles--to examine \nthe respective war powers of the President and Congress. The University \nof Virginia, the College of William and Mary, Rice University, and \nStanford University served as partnering institutions.\n  On July 8, 2008, after more than 13 months of study, the Commission \nreleased their report and recommendations. I wanted to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the important work done by this \ndistinguished Commission to the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009. I \nstrongly recommend that those interested in this important subject \ncontact the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs \nand also review a copy of the Commission's comprehensive report, titled \n``National War Powers Commission Report,'' which can be accessed at the \nMiller Center's Web site, www.millercenter.org.\n  The exemplary work by the National War Powers Commission, concluded \nwith the following recommendations: the law purporting to govern the \nNation's decision to engage in war--the War Powers Resolution--has \nfailed to promote cooperation between the two branches of government; \nthe War Powers Resolution of 1973 is ineffective at best and \nunconstitutional at worst; and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 should \nbe replaced by a new law that would, except for emergencies, require \nthe President and Congress to consult before going to war.\n  I would specifically like to draw my colleagues attention to the \nCommission's legislative proposal, the War Powers Consultation Act of \n2009. This proposed legislation contains four key components. These key \ncomponents are: First, this legislation would replace the War Powers \nResolution of 1973. It would ensure that Congress has an opportunity to \nconsult meaningfully and deliberately with the President regarding \nsignificant armed conflicts, and would ensure that Congress has the \nopportunity to express its views as part of a consultative process.\n  Second, this statute would create a process that will encourage the \ntwo co-equal branches of government to cooperate and consult in a way \nthat is deliberate, practical, and true to the spirit of the \nConstitution.\n  Third, the act would establish a ``Joint Congressional Consultation \nCommittee'' with a ``permanent, bi-partisan joint professional staff'' \nwith access to all relevant intelligence and national security \ninformation.\n  Fourth, and finally, the act would require the President to consult \nwith the Joint Congressional Consultation Committee ``[b]efore ordering \nthe deployment of United States armed forces into significant armed \nconflict''--lasting longer than one week--and would mandate regular \nconsultation thereafter.\n  I have always believed that Congress has an important and central \nrole in the decision of the deployment of our men and women of the \narmed forces into harm's way. Undoubtedly, the War Powers Consultation \nAct of 2009 would provide Congress and the President a well-defined \nmechanism for consultation on matters of the use of force in armed \nconflict.\n  The decision to commit our country to war is by far one of the most \ncritical decisions that faces our Nation's leaders. This proposal seeks \na concrete and pragmatic solution to a longstanding problem that is \nonly getting more difficult in a time where our Nation will continue to \nface unconventional threats and warfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this important material and work \ntogether, with the next administration, to find a solution to this \never-present debate between a President and the Congress over their \nrespective constitutional powers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7770-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7770-S7772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo\n.senate.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will \nbe easily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is a most interesting subject [to] bring up, the \n     escalating prices of oil and the reason they are so high. I \n     am tickled to hear that you believe in exercising our own \n     resources here in our own country.\n       I have done a lot of research on this very subject and just \n     happen to know a lot of people that are directly associated \n     with or are involved in the Alaska oil situation and the \n     reason for the billions that we spent on the pipeline to \n     begin with. I also know that there is enough oil in Alaska to \n     last us for two hundred years . . . but Washington does not \n     seem to want to take that option. They are more interested in \n     foreign oil and the foreign oil policy, even at the expense \n     of our own country and fellow Americans.\n       Are you aware of how much natural gas they pump right back \n     down into the ground using 747 Jet engines to do it with? If \n     you are not aware, you need to be aware of it and if it does \n     not madden you, then I can only question your way of \n     thinking. Don't take my word for it, do the research.\n       If you are truly aware of what is really going on and you \n     are truly in favor of exercising our own resources, then I am \n     behind you one hundred percent. I am just not real sure how \n     we are going to get the ugly politics out of Washington D.C., \n     and I am an optimist, but on this one, it forces me to be a \n     pessimist. I believe it has gone too far and is way out of \n     control at this point.\n       I also know that we could be buying gasoline for our \n     vehicles for less than a $1.50 a\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\n     gallon if we were using our own resources, but again, \n     Washington does not seem to care and it sickens me. It is \n     clearly about greed and money and greed breeds greed--just \n     look how well it is working for the greedy. It makes me \n     wonder why I ever served in Vietnam and why I lost 60,000 of \n     my comrades, but [I feel resigned to accept what is \n     happening].\n       I have always been behind you and supported you and will \n     continue to do so and only can hope that at least you will \n     stay honest or at least believe that honesty is the best \n     policy.\n     Bob, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I received an e-mail several days ago that has ``shaken me \n     up'' and started my mind working. [We have enough gas] to \n     keep all of America going for at lease 150, and probably 200 \n     years, even accounting for increased population growth and \n     demand for energy. The reason--the ``bottom line''--that \n     keeps President Bush and Congress from allowing drilling oil \n     within our borders is NOT environmental issues, but paying \n     off the national debt. [Allow me to summarize:] In the early \n     1970's then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger traveled to \n     most of the oil producing countries in the world, agreeing to \n     buy oil from them IF they would sign to use part of the money \n     they made on the sale to buy off our national debt.\n       If we started producing our own oil reserves, the fear is \n     that the U.S. economy would collapse because the oil-\n     producing countries from which we buy oil would stop paying \n     down our national debt when we stopped buying oil from them. \n     Well, here is my solution:\n       Start using our own oil reserves which would reduce the \n     cost of gasoline to about $1.50/gallon. Charge us $2.50/\n     gallon, sending $1.00 per gallon to pay off the national \n     debt.\n       Who would not be delighted to pay just $2.50/gallon again? \n     Who would object to paying a ``tax'' of $1.00/gallon to pay \n     off the national debt when we would realize a savings over \n     today's oil prices?\n       Please do not just trash this. Please give it some careful \n     attention, and share the concept with others. It is time for \n     a change. It is time to start thinking about saving our \n     country for our country, and stop being held hostage by the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Thank you for \n     ``listening'' and implementing some changes.\n     Lois, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is in response to your email asking for my story about \n     the impact that high gas and energy prices are having on my \n     life. You said I could write a paragraph or two about how I \n     am affected by high energy prices, and that it would be \n     worthwhile for me to share the priorities that I think \n     Congress should set in resolving this crisis.\n\n\n                                 CRISIS\n\n       (1) I no longer go backpacking, hiking, camping, or \n     canoeing. Instead, I float the Boise River on a tube, because \n     it is close to home. I used to buy equipment and services \n     that supported those hobbies, but now I do not. So, those \n     businesses that I used to patronize are impacted negatively, \n     because I stay in town. Who also suffers? The businesses near \n     the towns where I traveled, and the businesses on the highway \n     that lead to those areas.\n       If more people are doing this, what is the impact to our \n     environment? More people will not recognize the beauty of \n     God's creation, which means they will be less likely to \n     support bills that protect the environment.\n       (2) I no longer explore small Idaho towns and ghost towns. \n     Who suffers? The business in those towns, and the businesses \n     on the highways that lead to those towns.\n       (3) Long before the ``energy crisis'', I had already \n     switched to fluorescent light bulbs. Fortunately, I had my \n     home built with 2 attic fans, so that I do not have to use \n     the air conditioning during summer. Also, almost every room \n     in my home has ceiling fans; so, I turn on the ceiling fan in \n     the room I am occupying instead of turning on the air \n     conditioning for my entire home.\n       During the cold months, I set my thermostat to 40 or 50 \n     degrees, 40 during the day if the outside temperature is \n     above 30, and 50 when I am at home or if the outside \n     temperature is below 30. This keeps my pipes from freezing, \n     and it keeps my bills low. I wear warm fleece underwear, and \n     warm fleece outer garments to stay warm. In contrast, my \n     neighbor pays 5 or 6 times as much as I do for their natural \n     gas bills during the cold months (but they are wealthy).\n       I have drained my hot tub, and I no longer use it. Now I \n     wish I had never bought one. This hurts the hot tub industry, \n     and any businesses that support that industry.\n       I canceled my satellite TV; that saves me $50 per month, \n     and that is good for about two-thirds of a tank of gas.\n       I do not have a cell phone, and I do not plan on getting \n     one, since it would cost $50 or more a month (which I can \n     apply toward higher food costs).\n       (4) I combine trips and do not drive unless I have to. No \n     Sunday drives. No ``unnecessary'' trips to the grocery store. \n     I used to travel about 10,000 miles per year; but for the \n     last 2 years, I have limited my driving to about 6,000 miles \n     per year.\n       (5) I exclusively shop at Wal-Mart. If Wal-Mart does not \n     carry it, then I don't buy it. Why would I drive around town \n     to shop other stores when I can buy most everything at one \n     place? That is great for Wal-Mart, but it hurts other \n     businesses.\n       (6) I used to take one decent overseas vacation each year \n     (or go to Hawaii or Florida). However, I stopped doing that \n     after 2005. And since the cost of airline tickets are \n     increasing, I won't even consider traveling. I need to save \n     my money to buy gas and food. And when I see the price of oil \n     rise $10 or more in one day, then I do not think about doing \n     anything but save money for ``the worst case scenario.''\n       (7) I have changed my diet. I purchase less or no meats and \n     more pasta and rice. I buy graham crackers instead of Oreos, \n     or I make my own cookies. I buy less snack foods. The energy \n     costs have driven up food costs. I have found ways to keep my \n     food prices low by adjusting my diet, but this hurts other \n     businesses. Oh, and I am not one of those obese Americans; \n     I'm 5'9\" and 160 pounds . . . right where I need to be. I do \n     not understand how obese Americans and their children can \n     afford to feed their addiction to foods.\n       (8) I had hoped to quit my full-time job and work part-time \n     instead (in lieu of traditional ``retirement''). However, \n     because of the drastic increase in prices of energy and food, \n     and because of the uncertainty and volatility in the global \n     markets, I have postponed quitting my full-time job. That \n     means that a college graduate cannot have my good paying \n     full-time job. And it means that I can not enjoy the extra \n     free time that a part-time job would give me.\n       (9) I drive a 1994 pick-up truck. I would like to buy a new \n     vehicle, but I can not. Why? Because I need something that \n     gets very good gas mileage and has a reasonable price tag, \n     and there are no cars on the road that meet these criteria, \n     even the so-called hybrids (which can not pay for themselves \n     even at $5 or $6 a gallon because of the increased cost of \n     hybrid technology). Back in 1994, it was a mistake to trade-\n     in my 1987 Honda Civic that got 40 mpg in the city and 50 mpg \n     on the highway (and it wasn't even a hybrid . . . and most \n     hybrids can't even come close to that kind of gas mileage \n     these days . . . but they cost 3 or 4 times as much as my \n     Honda did in 1987 . . . and the ``technology'' is so much \n     greater today!!!!). So, I will continue driving my 1994 truck \n     that gets 19 mpg city, because it is way too expensive to buy \n     a new vehicle (i.e., the cost to get a 30 mpg or 35 mpg \n     vehicle will not pay for itself for 7 or 10 years). And you \n     don't need to know my truck's mpg for highway driving, since \n     I do not enjoy outdoor activities anymore, so it doesn't \n     matter.\n       (10) I have noticed more crime in Boise within the last \n     year. Why do you think that is? Because energy costs (and \n     food costs) have risen too quickly . . . people can't cope \n     with the sudden increases. However, we are not adding more \n     police or more jails to support the increase in crime. I am \n     glad that I do not live in a major metropolitan area, because \n     I think that if energy costs continue to climb, the country \n     is at risk of rioting in its metro areas.\n\n\n                           CRISIS RESOLUTION\n\n       (1) Politicians need to stop pandering to oil companies and \n     oil executives by developing very stringent fuel economy \n     requirements. Politicians need to stop pandering to oil \n     companies and oil executives by honestly and diligently \n     pursuing alternative forms of energy. But can the politicians \n     do this? After all, there is a lot of money involved with oil \n     in so many places, industries, pocketbooks, and campaign \n     contributions (legitimate and otherwise).\n       (2) Drill for oil on USA soil and in USA waters. Why? \n     Because we can not wean ourselves from oil instantly; and \n     there are no viable automotive solutions today that do not \n     use oil. It is going to take several years to wean ourselves \n     from oil. In the meantime, we need to rely on our own oil \n     sources to balance our foreign oil dependency. This means \n     drilling in ``pristine'' Alaska, along both of our coasts, \n     and in other areas of our country where ``environmentalists'' \n     say we should not drill.\n       (3) Pursue fuel cell technology for vehicles (Honda is \n     doing it, finally). Forget ethanol. Forget hybrids. Fuel cell \n     vehicles require hydrogen and oxygen and emit water! No \n     gasoline involved at all. And no cash crops like corn are \n     required, which should help ease the price of this and other \n     commodities.\n       (4) Use more nuclear energy. This technology currently \n     exists, and it is viable. We do not have to start from \n     scratch.\n       (5) Take lessons from New Zealand with regards to hydro-\n     electricity and other forms of energy. That country is \n     extremely self-sufficient when it comes to energy.\n       (6) Use more wind power. This technology currently exists, \n     and it is viable. Are some (rich) people worried about the \n     view of the landscape changing? Then stop painting the wind \n     turbines all white! Paint them to blend into the background, \n     or camouflage style!\n       (7) Pursue solar power. It is amazing that this technology \n     is so far behind. The sun is so powerful, and so available. \n     Regular homeowners can not afford solar panels on their \n     homes. Look at all the wasted roof space on buildings and \n     homes!\n       (8) Give incentives for conservation. Why is this last on \n     my list? Because I think most people do conserve energy \n     already . . . except maybe the ``celebrities'' like Al Gore \n     and many other rich folks who tout the environment and \n     conservation, but live in the lap of luxury and waste.\n     Kristian, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I really do not think the gasoline price is really a result \n     of supply and demand. I am all for conservation and \n     alternative energy\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\n     plans and research with diverse sources. I am not opposed to \n     nuclear. I just do not like the feeling of being manipulated. \n     Just yesterday the spokesperson for Saudi Arabia expressed \n     concern about the price of oil. They can see the writing on \n     the wall if it stays like this. They increased supply while \n     insisting that it is not a supply issue.\n       Other sources that are much more progressive have pointed \n     out that legislation passed late in 2000 deregulated the \n     energy futures. It was suggested on NPR today that Congress \n     could reverse that decision and change the price of energy in \n     one month. You can tell I would sit on the other side of the \n     aisle if I was in Congress but with [the President] making \n     such a fuss about supply and demand I doubt we are going to \n     see any bold action from Congress.\n       I have pulled the points for the following paragraph from \n     ``Mother Jones'' July-August 2008. You may not like the \n     source but let us discuss the facts. I am referring to an \n     omnibus spending bill passed on or about December 15, 2000. \n     Yes, President Clinton was still in office then. Senator Phil \n     Gramm slipped in a 262-page measure called the Commodity \n     Futures Modernization Act. It contained a provision lobbied \n     for by Enron that exempted energy trading from regulatory \n     oversight. This is primarily about California electricity and \n     the mortgage securities fiasco but I am sure that this \n     regulation or other similar has allowed the current run up in \n     energy futures. This could be regulated. The regulations put \n     in place after the Great Depression were sound and it has \n     been a disaster to undo many of them.\n       Personally, the high energy prices have had little impact \n     on me. I am, at least for now, still an overpaid engineer at \n     Micron. I have purchased another old Saturn and my wife is \n     driving that more and driving the Bonneville less. GM is \n     saying how much it would take to raise the CAFE standards, \n     but many of us have increased the mileage of our cars by 20 \n     percent for about $200 and we have not disabled emission \n     systems or lied to the engine computer. My car has averaged \n     55 mpg for the last year and will do about 50 mpg at 65 mph.\n       The changes are primarily aerodynamics and a little hotter \n     air fed into the engine. Some have bypassed emission systems \n     but many have not.\n       That is not much of a story but I hope it gets you to \n     thinking about some of these in a new light.\n       Thanks.\n     Ernie, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Because of the gas prices we hardly go anywhere other than \n     work and the store. Most of this energy crisis has been \n     brought about by the speculators--these are the same people \n     who brought on the sub-prime mess. They have to be stopped \n     because they are ruining our economy. The cost of oil has \n     nothing to do with its availability; it is pure speculation \n     on the part of commodity traders. If these scavengers are not \n     reigned in, the world economy is in for a depression. As soon \n     as the energy bubble bursts, they will move to a new bubble \n     which is food and, because of them, millions will starve. One \n     of the other driving forces behind oil prices is the Federal \n     Reserve (which is neither federal or reserve) lowering \n     interest rates and devaluing the dollar. The banks are out \n     for only themselves and they do not care what happens to the \n     rest of us. The Federal Reserve needs to be done away with--\n     because of the Fed's printing and Congress's spending habits, \n     we are in big trouble.\n       We can barely afford the price of gas to go to and from \n     work so vacations are out this year and so are a lot of other \n     things. [How] are people, especially senior citizens on a \n     fixed income, going to heat their homes this winter? This is \n     going to hurt Idaho businesses because any extra money is \n     either spent on food or utilities.\n       Nobody believes the government figures on inflation (which \n     are out-and-out lies) or the figures on unemployment. We are \n     getting tired of the government lying to us and thinking we \n     are too stupid to figure it out.

The Silver Star Flag \nand Banner are symbols of remembrance and honor for the wounded \nsoldiers and their families as well as anyone wishing to honor those \nwounded during combat while honorably serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. \nThe goal of the Silver Star Families of America is to recognize the \nblood sacrifice of our wounded and remember their efforts by honoring \nthem with the Silver Star Banner.

Mr. President, the Red Cloud Indian School is \nworthy of much acclaim. Founded by Franciscan Sisters and Jesuits in \n1888 as the Holy Rosary Mission, they strove to teach and maintain \nOglala and western knowledge for the youth of Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation and its surrounding areas. In 1969 the school changed its \nname to Red Cloud Indian School out of respect and appreciation for the \ngreat Chief Red Cloud who petitioned the government to allow the \nestablishment of the school. Today nearly 600 students are enrolled in \nclasses spanning every grade from kindergarten through twelfth. The \nschool is private and 97 percent of its funds come from private donors, \nas students are required to pay only a minimal fee to attend. Classes \ninclude a wide range of subjects, such as math, science, history, \nethics, and Lakota culture. Combining this wide range of education \nhelps retain the Lakota heritage while preparing students to enter the \nlarger society.\n  Red Cloud Indian School has made postsecondary education a priority \nand has done an exceptional job educating and preparing its students \nfor the world. Seeking 100 percent college matriculation, the high \nschool proudly touts that, in 2004, 94 percent of its graduating class \npursued post-secondary education, the highest rate of any Indian school \nin the country.\n  Since 1999, 32 Red Cloud students have received the Gates Millennium \nScholarship. The Gates Millennium Scholarship Program was originally \nfunded through a $1 billion grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation in 1999. The program has two main goals: to encourage \nacademic success and to provide absolute financial support to excellent \nminority students who have financial constraints that could otherwise \ninhibit their ability to attend college. To date, over 12,000 people \nhave been awarded the Gates Millennium Scholarship.\n  The recent Gates Scholarship recipients of Red Cloud Indian School \nare as follows:\n\n       1999--Candace Brings Plenty;\n       2001--Sarah Yellow Boy and Lawrence Vigil;\n       2003--Donnel Ecoffey;\n       2004--Carmen Fourd, John Cross Dog, and Marie Zephier;\n       2005--Jason Clifford, Blue Dawn Little, Shayna Richards, \n     and Sarah White;\n       2006--Rianna Albers, Jordan Herman, Larissa Little Moon, \n     Dallas Nelson, Marissa O'Bryan, and Brandi Shortman;\n       2007--Monique Claymore, Sammi Herman, Samantha Janis, \n     Tanner O'Daniel, Matthew Shoulders, Kaylynn Two Bulls, and \n     Allison Weston; and\n       2008--David Anaya, Dylan Fills Pipe, Season Frank, Danielle \n     Hudspeth, Chante Knight, Stevie Tobacco, Vern White Butterfly \n     Jr., and Audrey White.\n\n  Congratulations to the Red Cloud Indian School staff, students, and \nfamilies.

Mr. President, I wish to speak today to recognize \nthe Cheyenne River Youth Project in Eagle Butte, SD. This year, the \nCheyenne River Youth Project is celebrating its 20th anniversary. From \nits beginnings in 1988, it has sought to assist the Lakota youth and \nfamilies on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation by providing them \nwith a nurturing environment and a sense of hope about their future. I \nam so proud of this project and the positive impact that it has had on \nthose youth.\n  Over the years, hundreds of volunteers from around the world have \ncrossed the threshold at the Cheyenne River Youth Project and offered \ntheir time and their hearts to influence the lives of the Lakota youth. \nThe project serves youth from as young as 4 years old to young adults \nof 18 years old. As we all know, these are critical years in \ndevelopment of young men and women. Combined with traditional customs \nand contemporary programs, the CRYP is a success story for other \nfledgling grassroots youth programs.\n  I am so proud to have helped guide Federal resources to help with the \nconstruction and programming for the project. Julie Garreau, who has \nserved as the executive director of the projects, has been a tireless \nadvocate and deserves high praise for the love, hard work, and \ndedication she has shown for her community. I would also like to thank \nOlympic Gold Medal winner Billy Mills and his organization, Running \nStrong for American Indian Youth, for his work in his home State and \nacross the Nation to help Native youth. His dedication to the Cheyenne \nRiver Youth is particularly evident in his efforts to assist the \nCheyenne River Youth Project.\n  On more than one occasion, I have had the opportunity to visit the \nCheyenne River Youth Project, at its facilities in Eagle Butte, at \n``The Main'' and the new Cokata Wiconi Teen Center. I couldn't be \nprouder of the accomplishments of its staff and its many volunteers of \nthe past two decades! Congratulations and best wishes for many more \nyears of service in the future!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7773-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RICHARD A. CODY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend GEN Richard A. Cody, Vice \nChief of Staff of the U.S. Army, for his outstanding service and \ncommitment to excellence throughout his 36 years of distinguished \nmilitary service to our Nation. General Cody will retire in August 2008 \nwith the gratitude and well wishes of the Nation and particularly of \nthe soldiers and families to whom he has devoted his life.\n  General Cody is originally from Montpelier, VT, and began his service \nas a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy. He graduated from West Point \nin 1972 and became an Army aviator. General Cody has long been widely \nregarded as the Army's premier attack helicopter warrior and pilot with \nover 5,000 flying hours.\n  For more than 20 of his 36 years as a soldier General Cody has been \nentrusted with the command of troops in well known combat units \nincluding the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and several \nassignments with the 101st Airborne Division . Most notably, in 1991 \nthen-Lieutenant Colonel Cody personally led the Apache attack \nhelicopters of Task Force Normandy, the joint aviation task force that \nfired the opening salvoes of the gulf war, that destroyed Iraqi air \ndefense sites and, as GEN H. Norman Schwarzkopf recounted, ``plucked \nout the eyes'' of Sadaam Hussein's air defenses.\n  Over the last 6 years, as one of the most senior leaders of the Army, \nGeneral Cody has dedicated himself to ensuring that American soldiers \nare the best-trained, best-equipped and best-led force ready for the \ncomplex challenges of the global war on terror. As a result, in part of \nhis determined leadership and uncompromising support, soldiers deployed \nin Afghanistan, Iraq and around the world have met those challenges.\n  General Cody's insight and leadership has also been a force behind \nthe Army's transformation, which has set the Army on a path to provide \nthe Nation with an Army that is more lethal, agile, deployable, and \nflexible; capable of fighting and winning this Nation's wars in the \n21st century.\n  General Cody has been an example to soldiers throughout his great \ncareer; an example shared by his proud Army family as well. His wife \nVicki will forever be a strong voice and tireless worker for soldiers \nand their families. Their brave sons Tyler and Clint, also Army \nofficers and attack helicopter aviators with six combat tours between \nthem, have answered the same call to duty and continue to serve the \nNation.\n  General Cody is an American hero, unflinching in war and tireless in \npeace. President John F. Kennedy once said, ``When at some future date \nthe high court of history sits in judgment of each one of us-recording \nwhether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities, \nwe will be measured by our answers to 4 questions-were we truly men of \ncourage were we truly men of judgment were we truly men of integrity \nwere we truly men of dedication?'' I believe that when history judges \nthe service of General Cody, the Army's 31st Vice Chief of Staff, it \nwill be clear that this was truly a man of courage, judgment, \nintegrity, and dedication.\n  The Nation is honored and grateful to have had the service of GEN \nRichard Cody and his family. As he and his wife start this next chapter \nof their lives, we wish them all the best for a day of rest well \ndeserved and earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7773-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO P.E.

He then spent 5 years in the Air Force as a captain and 27 months \noverseas in the 1st Fighter Group.\n  Joining the family business of MacAllister Machinery Company in \nIndianapolis after his service abroad, P.E. has been chairman of the \nboard since 1952. His awards in the business industry are many and \nwell-deserved. In addition to these accomplishments, P.E. has served on \nboards in the arts, health, recreation, philanthropic, and municipality \narenas. His love of opera, to cite one example of his activism, \nengendered the largest nonrestricted vocal competition for opera \nsingers in the Nation. This competition--The MacAllister Awards--ran \nfor 22 years.\n  When I was elected mayor of Indianapolis in 1967, P.E. was among my \nearliest and strongest supporters whose generous and wise counsel was \nmost appreciated. My election occurred just months before the death of \nMartin Luther King, Jr. and the extraordinary convulsions which \ntroubled most American cities at that time. P.E. provided exemplary \nleadership during this challenging time by recruiting business leaders \nto aid in the creation of outreach programs for our city's youth.\n  I recall one particular initiative in which the city was availing \nitself of Federal resources through the Special Employment Program and \nthe Special Program for Disadvantaged Youth in order to employ idle \nyouth in a public works project that turned unused land into gardens. \nP.E., in recognizing the value in such a project, generously provided \nthe heavy equipment that allowed for the planting of trees, the moving \nof soil, and the beautification of Indianapolis.\n  Further, in 1971, P.E. successfully served as the executive director \nof the Conference on Cities held in Indianapolis. This was an \ninternational symposium on urban problems in collaboration with the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. Since our early work, I have found \nhis insights on world events to be profound, continually aided by his \ntravels and comprehensive reading.\n  I celebrate P.E.'s achievements, friendship, and tireless dedication \nto engaging in constructive acts that always lead to great discussion \nand debate on complex issues. I wish P.E. MacAllister a very Happy 90th \nbirthday.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7774-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n                   VERMONT'S CHAMPLAIN HOUSING TRUST\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, It is with great pleasure that I \ninform you, my colleagues, and the Nation that Vermont's Champlain \nHousing Trust was selected as one of two recipients of the 2008 World \nHabitat Award, an honor presented annually by the United Nations.\n  Each year on World Habitat Day, the United Nations Agency for Human \nSettlements, which promotes socially and environmentally sustainable \ntowns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all, \npresents these awards. Established in 1985, the World Habitat Awards \nare bestowed on projects that provide practical and innovative \nsolutions to current housing needs and problems. One award is for a \nproject in the global north and the other for a project in the global \nsouth.\n  I have a particularly deep and lengthy interest in the Champlain \nHousing Trust. It was established as the Nation's first municipally \nfunded community land trust in 1984, when I was mayor of Burlington, \nVT. It has grown substantially, and today it is not only the first but \nthe largest, community land trust in the country. It has provided a \nmodel for securing perpetually affordable housing that has been adopted \nby many other cities and municipalities across the Nation.\n  The program came into being because, in the 1980s, Burlington faced a \nnumber of housing challenges--and we were looking for innovative \nsolutions. Among other issues that we faced was the reality that low \nand moderate income households, in the face of rapidly rising and \nfluctuating house prices, were threatened with displacement. We also \nbelieved that decent and affordable housing was a right of all people \nand not just a commodity for financial gain by a select few. As mayor \nof Burlington, I was very fortunate to have an outstanding staff as \nwell as strong community input in helping to formulate this concept. \nAmong many others who played an active role in developing what was \ninitially called the Burlington Community Land Trust were Terry \nBouricius, John Davis, Peter Clavelle, Michael Monte, Brenda Torpy, and \nAmy Wright.\n  When I entered the House of Representatives, my interest in land \ntrusts did not abate. Encouraged by the growing land trust community \nacross the Nation, I successfully introduced legislation that \nencouraged the use of the land trust model the Burlington community \nland trust had helped establish so that this model could be expanded to \ncommunities across the country.\n  Meanwhile, ably directed by Brenda Torpy and a legion of committed \nstaff and volunteers over the past two and a half decades, the \nChamplain Housing Trust has continued to grow and expand its geographic \nreach, and has been met with unparalleled success. Thousands of low and \nmoderate income families have been able to experience homeownership, \nwhile the trust has made great strides both toward revitalizing \nBurlington's historical Old North End neighborhood and expanding to \nthree different counties in northwestern Vermont.\n  The Champlain Housing Trust is a model of democracy at the \ngrassroots, involving homeowners, as well as government officials and \nmembers of the larger community, in its governance.\n  It has been a successful experiment that has revealed to the nation \nand, as this U.N. award demonstrates, to the world as well, how through \nthe land trust concept, home ownership can be combined with making \nhousing perpetually affordable.\n  The 2008 World Habitat Award is in recognition of all who have worked \non establishing and expanding land trusts, all who have bought land \ntrust homes, and all who have helped disseminate the land trust \nconcept. And, in particular, it is a celebration of the wonderful work \ndone by the Champlain Housing Trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7774-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SIMONES' HOT DOG STAND\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the centennial \nof a treasured institution within Maine's Lewiston-Auburn community. \nSimones' Hot Dog Stand has been located on Chestnut Street in Lewiston \nsince 1908, and by the looks of things, it will be there for at least \nanother hundred years.\n  A third- and fourth-generation family-owned small business, Simones' \nHot Dog Stand has been immensely popular since its founding. Back then, \nSimones' was truly a ``small'' business, constructed of wooden soda \ncrates with just four stools for customers. Luckily, Simones' had a \nwalk up take out window as well. Hot dogs at the time cost a nickel, \nwith the bargain price of a quarter for six hotdogs. Over the years, \nvarious members of the Simones family have operated and worked at the \nstand, and its present proprietor, Jimmy Simones, has been a steadfast \nemployee since 1973.\n  With time, the hotdog stand has faced challenges and undergone \nchanges. During the Great Depression, with the price of meat \nskyrocketing, Simones' turned to chopped bologna as a substitute for \nhotdogs. During World War II, when meat became scarce on the homefront, \nSPAM was used in its place until the daily ration was employed. In \n1966, realizing the need for additional space, Simones' moved across \nthe street, from 98 Chestnut Street to No. 99, where it has been since. \nOver the years, Simones' menu has expanded to include other lunch \nitems, such as subs, salads, and even homemade soups from scratch \nduring the cold winter months. It is also open for breakfast.\n  But what will catch the visitor's eye most, aside from the fast and \nfriendly service, is its signature bright neon red hotdog. Simones' \nfamed hotdogs are truly unique, with a complement of red food coloring \nin their casings. Many customers prefer the traditional presentation of \na steamed hotdog in a steamed bun topped with mustard, ketchup, or \nrelish. For those of different culinary persuasion, Simones' offers \nchili, cheese, and sauerkraut to top their hotdogs.\n  Simones family members are also charitable neighbors, helping to make \nLewiston a better place to live. Simones' donates their hotdogs to the \nscholarship foundation of the MAINEiacs, Lewiston's junior ice hockey \nteam, as well as Leavitt Area High School's Project Graduation and \nother local nonprofit groups. Current owner Jimmy Simones serves on the \nCentral Maine Community College Foundation board of directors and has \nvolunteered at Lewiston's Sexual Assault Crisis Center. Additionally, \nJimmy's wife Linda is a member of the St. Mary's Hospital Federally \nQualified Health Care Board in Lewiston and a graduate of the \nhospital's nursing school. The Simones family is also active in the \nHoly Trinity Greek Orthodox Church parish. Jimmy is a past president of \nthe church, and son George, who works at the stand, serves as a chanter \nfor services. And all three Simones are familiar faces during the \nchurch's annual Greek Festival, volunteering their time to enhance the \nexperience of the hundreds who attend.\n  From the regulars who come in daily for a hotdog, to Maine's \npolitical figures who make it a must-stop on the campaign trail, \nSimones' is truly the place to take the local pulse of the Lewiston-\nAuburn community. It is no wonder that Simones' has established itself \nas a pillar in central Maine. I wish Jimmy, Linda, George, and everyone \nat Simones' a wonderful celebration of 100 successful years and look \nforward to many more years--and hotdogs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7774-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7774-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7775-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE ACTIONS OF CERTAIN PERSONS TO UNDERMINE THE SOVEREIGNTY \n     OF LEBANON OR ITS DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS--PM 61\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to establish a minimum sound level standard \n     for all new automobiles sold in the United States to ensure \n     the safety of the blind and other pedestrians, and for other \n     purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 52\n\n       Whereas, electric vehicles operate on batteries and are \n     marketed as having the advantage of operating without the \n     sound and smell of standard internal combustion engines, and \n     hybrid vehicles combine conventional gas-powered engines with \n     battery-powered electric motors and, when in the electric \n     mode, also operate without making sound; and\n       Whereas, all pedestrians use the sound of traffic in \n     combination with other techniques to travel safely, as \n     evidenced by the fact that commercial trucks emit a sound \n     when backing up to alert pedestrians to their presence; and\n       Whereas, blind people depend solely on the sound of traffic \n     to determine the location of a traffic light and indication \n     of whether a traffic light is red or green and whether an \n     individual automobile is idling, accelerating, decelerating, \n     or turning left or right, all of which allows a blind person \n     to gauge the time to navigate a crosswalk and to travel \n     independently and safely; and\n       Whereas, action must be taken to ensure that all vehicles \n     emit a sound while turned on, and such a sound from all \n     vehicles must be loud enough to be heard over the din of \n     other ambient noise and be heard from a distance which would \n     allow pedestrians to travel safely, and such a sound must be \n     emitted both while the vehicle is in motion and while \n     motionless, the sound must also change with speed, must not \n     easily be disabled, must not be annoying but still emit a \n     unique sound distinguishable from other noises, and must be \n     uniform from model to model. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to ensure the safety of the blind and other \n     pedestrians by passing legislation requiring the United \n     States Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration, to adopt regulations establishing a \n     minimum sound level standard for all new automobiles sold in \n     the United States. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the regulations adopted by the United States \n     Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, need not prescribe the method automobile \n     manufacturers must use to achieve the minimum sound standard, \n     but the standard should have the following characteristics:\n       (1) In all phases of operation, including times when the \n     vehicle is at a full stop, vehicles should be required to \n     emit an omnidirectional sound with similar spectral \n     characteristic of those of a modem internal combustion \n     engine.\n       (2) The sound should vary in a way that is consistent with \n     the sound of vehicles with combustion engines to indicate \n     whether the vehicle is idling, maintaining a constant speed, \n     accelerating, or decelerating. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-423. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     enact legislation to take such actions as are necessary to \n     improve, modernize, and enhance drainage along the Jefferson \n     Parish and Orleans Parish line, and for other purposes; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 178\n\n       Whereas, since Hurricane Katrina local officials and \n     drainage personnel have worked diligently with neighborhood \n     civic associations, congress, and the Corp of Engineers to \n     improve the safety of lives and property against hurricane \n     overflow and rainfall flooding; and\n       Whereas, there is now a plan which is supported by local \n     officials that can achieve these goals and benefit the \n     residents and businesses that are dependent upon the \n     Seventeenth Street Canal, Pump Station Number Six, and the \n     Monticello Canal; and\n       Whereas, the locally preferred plan is comprised of four \n     essential components as follows: improve the depth and \n     efficiency of the Seventeenth Street Canal between existing \n     Pump Station Number Six and Lake Pontchartrain to move \n     rainwater more quickly to Lake Pontchartrain, build a new \n     pumping station at the lake end of the Seventeenth Street \n     Canal to replace the existing Pump Station Number Six and to \n     prevent water from Lake Pontchartrain from entering the \n     canal, supplement a new pump station at Lake Pontchartrain \n     with a pipeline system and a separate pumping station that \n     will discharge directly into the Mississippi River, rather \n     than into the Seventeenth Street Canal and Lake \n     Pontchartrain, and remove existing Pump Station Number Six \n     from the system. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United \n     States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to \n     implement the four essential components outlined in this \n     Resolution in order to improve, modernize, and enhance \n     drainage in Jefferson and Orleans parishes. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-424. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact the hearing aid assistance tax credit act; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 155\n\n       Whereas, hearing is clearly one of our most essential \n     senses. It is often taken for granted, unfortunately, until \n     the time one begins to experience hearing loss. At this point \n     it is too late to reverse the damage. Hearing aids are the \n     ready solution to the problems associated with hearing loss, \n     but the costs associated with good quality equipment is \n     expensive, is not always covered by one's insurance or \n     Medicaid, and is too often foregone for more immediate needs. \n     A federal tax credit would provide immediate and necessary \n     relief for tens of thousands; and\n       Whereas, indeed, it has been estimated that hearing aids \n     would help ninety-five percent of those suffering from \n     hearing loss. Only twenty-two percent of the population, \n     however, currently uses a hearing device, because the average \n     out-of-pocket costs associated with hearing aids is over \n     $2,800. Thousands upon thousands of individuals and family \n     members are impacted by these soaring costs. It is estimated \n     that close to 2 million people are affected by untreated \n     hearing loss; and\n       Whereas, in Michigan, legislation was enacted in 1978 to \n     exempt hearing aids from the state sales tax. This initiative \n     was a clear\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n     recognition of the important of cost savings to those in need \n     of hearing aids. The Congress should follow this stellar \n     example and enact similar tax incentives in the U.S. Tax \n     Code; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, That we hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-425. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Florida, urging Congress to increase federal funding \n     for Alzheimer's disease research; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Memorial No. 2662\n\n       Whereas, Alzheimer's disease is a progressive degenerative \n     disorder that destroys cells in the brain and is the leading \n     cause of dementia, a condition that involves memory loss, \n     decline in the ability to perform routine tasks, \n     disorientation, difficulty in learning, loss of language \n     skills, impairment of judgment, and personality changes, and\n       Whereas, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, individuals \n     with the disease become unable to care for themselves, and\n       Whereas, as many as 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's \n     disease, including approximately 500,000 Floridians, and, by \n     2050, the number of individuals in the United States with the \n     disease could range from 13 million to 16 million unless a \n     way to prevent or cure the disease is discovered, and\n       Whereas, Alzheimer's disease strikes approximately 1 in 10 \n     people over the age of 65 and nearly half of those who are \n     age 85 or older, and\n       Whereas, the average lifetime cost of care for an \n     individual with Alzheimer's disease is $170,000, and\n       Whereas, half of all nursing home residents have \n     Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder, with the average \n     annual cost of nursing home care for individuals with the \n     disease exceeding $70,000 per resident, and\n       Whereas, Medicaid pays half of the total nursing home bills \n     for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and helps 2 out of 3 \n     residents pay for their care, and\n       Whereas, Medicaid expenditures for nursing home care for \n     individuals with Alzheimer's disease are estimated to \n     increase from $21 billion in 2005 to $24 billion in 2010, and\n       Whereas, 1 in 8 caregivers for individuals with Alzheimer's \n     disease becomes ill or injured as a direct result of \n     caregiving, and 1 in 3 uses medication for problems related \n     to caregiving, with older caregivers being 3 times more \n     likely to become clinically depressed than others in their \n     age group, and\n       Whereas, a 4-year study conducted by researchers from the \n     University of Pittsburgh showed that elderly spouses strained \n     by caregiving were 63 percent more likely to die during that \n     4-year period than their noncaregiving counterparts, and\n       Whereas, if our nation achieves its research goals of \n     preventing the onset of Alzheimer's disease in those at risk \n     and treating and delaying progression of the disease in those \n     already ill, annual Medicare savings would be $51 billion by \n     2015 and $88 billion by 2020, annual Medicaid savings would \n     be $10 billion in 2015 and $17 billion by 2020, and the \n     projected number of cases of the disease would be reduced by \n     40 percent by the middle of the century, and\n       Whereas, a cure for Alzheimer's disease may be achieved \n     sooner by increasing funding of Alzheimer's disease research \n     at established and reputable research institutes, and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States appropriated \n     $642 million for Alzheimer's disease research during fiscal \n     year 2007-2008. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida: That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to increase \n     federal funding for Alzheimer's disease research by $360 \n     million during fiscal year 2008-2009. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-426. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Florida, urging Congress to support national \n     standards for educator ethics and a national clearinghouse to \n     strengthen state efforts in the reporting, screening, and \n     sharing of critical information relative to educator \n     misconduct; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1742\n\n       Whereas, teachers are entrusted with the care and \n     supervision of minor children away from the direct \n     observation of parents, and\n       Whereas, the student-teacher relationship is necessarily \n     built on a child's trust and respect for an adult in \n     authority, and\n       Whereas, parents and the community rely upon school \n     district officials and individual educators to protect the \n     integrity of that relationship, and\n       Whereas, educators rely upon the state and school districts \n     to promote respect for the teaching profession through the \n     timely investigation and disposition of allegations of \n     misconduct, assurance of due process, and elimination from \n     the teaching ranks of those who bring discredit to the \n     profession. Now, Therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida: That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to support the \n     passage of laws establishing ethical standards for \n     professional educators and to support a national \n     clearinghouse to provide for the reporting of data concerning \n     educator misconduct. A national database is necessary to \n     promote the timely sharing of critical information among \n     states and to provide for the safety and welfare of students. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-427. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Florida, urging Congress to make forms for the \n     United States Decennial Census of 2010 available in the \n     Creole language for the Haitian population of Florida; to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1454\n\n       Whereas, results from the United States Decennial Census of \n     2000 show that there were 419,317 foreign-born persons from \n     Haiti in the United States when the census was taken, and\n       Whereas, the state with the largest population of foreign-\n     born persons from Haiti in 2000 was Florida with 182,224, \n     which represented 6.8 percent of Florida's total foreign-born \n     population of 2.7 million, and\n       Whereas, in conducting the federal decennial statewide \n     census in 2000, the United States Census Bureau used a \n     variety of methods to communicate with people who could not \n     speak English, and\n       Whereas, households that received the census form in the \n     mail had the option of requesting the form in Spanish, \n     Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or Korean, and\n       Whereas, individuals who believed that they were not \n     included on a form or did not receive a form could use the \n     ``Be Counted'' questionnaires that were available in public \n     areas and printed in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, \n     and Korean, and\n       Whereas, the Census Bureau also published a short-form and \n     a long-form language assistance guide in 49 different \n     languages, one of which was Creole, to assist respondents, \n     and\n       Whereas, however, given the considerable size of Florida's \n     Haitian population, in the interest of equity and obtaining \n     the most accurate information possible from the next federal \n     decennial statewide census, the United States Census Bureau \n     should make forms for the United States Decennial Census of \n     2010 more accessible to the Haitian population of Florida by \n     making the census forms available in the Creole language, and\n       Whereas, in addition, the census forms for the United \n     States Decennial Census of 2010 should be prepared in a \n     manner that will allow a respondent to indicate whether he or \n     she is a Haitian national or of Haitian descent. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida: That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to require the \n     United States Census Bureau to make census forms for the \n     United States Decennial Census of 2010 available in the \n     Creole language to provide for optimal accessibility by the \n     Haitian population of Florida and to prepare the census forms \n     in a manner that will allow a respondent to indicate whether \n     he or she is a Haitian national or of Haitian descent. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-428. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to direct the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency to review its recovery policies \n     and programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 178\n\n       Whereas, during the seventeenth century, about one hundred \n     French families settled in a portion of Nova Scotia \n     controlled by the British, then known as Acadia, where they \n     developed friendly relations with the Indians and learned \n     their hunting and fishing techniques; and\n       Whereas, when the French and Indian War began in 1754, the \n     British government, doubting the neutrality of the Acadians, \n     demanded that they take an oath of allegiance to the British \n     monarch, and since the oath required renouncing a key article \n     of their Roman Catholic faith, most refused and as a result \n     many were imprisoned; and\n       Whereas, in what is own as the Great Expulsion (Grand \n     Drangement), about thirteen thousand Acadians, three-fourths \n     of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia, were expelled from \n     the colony between 1755 and 1764, their homes were destroyed, \n     and they were exiled among the American colonies and other \n     remote lands; and\n       Whereas, in the chaos of this expulsion, families and \n     friends were separated and placed on different ships, as a \n     result of a deliberate effort on the part of the British to \n     ``exterminate'' the Acadian culture through forced \n     assimilation; and\n       Whereas, many Acadians found themselves unwelcome among the \n     thirteen colonies,\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\n     some were deported to France and the French islands of St. \n     Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland, and other Acadians \n     became slaves in the British colonies, the Carribean, and \n     in Europe; and\n       Whereas, large numbers of these Acadians eventually made \n     their way to Louisiana just after France ceded its colony of \n     Louisiana to Spain in 1762 and were referred to as Cajuns by \n     the English-speaking colonists; and\n       Whereas, the Spanish allowed the Acadians to continue to \n     speak their language, practice Roman Catholicism, which was \n     also the official religion of Spain, and otherwise pursue \n     their livelihoods with minimal interference; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the Acadians settled in southern \n     Louisiana in the area west of what is now New Orleans, mainly \n     along the Mississippi River, and they were later moved by the \n     colonial government to the swamps, cheniers, and prairies \n     further west and southwest of New Orleans, to lands deemed \n     uninhabitable due to the harsh living conditions, where they \n     lived among the Attakapa and Chitimacha Native American \n     tribes; and\n       Whereas, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was so moved by the \n     plight of the Acadians that he wrote a poem titled \n     ``Evangeline'' and described in moving detail the story of \n     two young lovers separated by the Grand Derangement and their \n     travels to the land of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, for more than two hundred years, the Acadians have \n     lived in the coastal regions of Louisiana, a land Longfellow \n     described as the region ``where reigns perpetual summer, \n     where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and \n     citron, sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the \n     eastward ... a maze of sluggish and devious waters ... like a \n     network of steel, extend(ing) in every direction; A land \n     where over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of \n     the cypress met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-\n     air waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient \n     cathedrals ... A land where Deathlike the silence seemed, and \n     unbroken, save by the herons home to their roosts in the \n     cedar-trees returning at sunset, Or by the owl, as he greeted \n     the moon with demoniac laughter''; and\n       Whereas, the children and grandchildren of these Acadians \n     remained somewhat secluded in this region until the early \n     1900s in the areas of coastal Louisiana and regrettably \n     during the first half of the twentieth century, contempt for \n     the Acadians reemerged within their dear state of Louisiana, \n     and attempts were made to forcibly suppress Cajun culture by \n     measures such as forbidding the use of French in schools; and\n       Whereas, the indomitable spirit of their French ancestry \n     could not be suppressed, and they prevailed once again and \n     worked hard to overcome the stigma associated with their \n     ethnic heritage and instill pride in their Acadian roots, \n     forming the Council for the Development of French in \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, it is in the coastal wetlands and prairies of \n     South Louisiana that the Cajuns have not merely endured, not \n     merely survived, but have lived and laughed and cried and \n     built a culture uniquely American with a spiritual richness \n     and time-honored traditions complete with Mardi Gras and king \n     cakes, family togetherness, hard work, plenty of fun, music \n     played with lively fiddles, accordions, spoons, and \n     washboards, and a unique local cuisine of the indigenous \n     species of seafood and animal life with dishes such as \n     etouffee, gumbo, and jambalaya; and\n       Whereas, these Cajuns have distinguished themselves as \n     hunters, trappers, fishermen, shrimpers, doctors, lawyers, \n     engineers, roustabouts, farmers, priests and preachers, nuns, \n     and missionaries, and in numerous other honorable professions \n     and maintained their religious faith traditions as \n     Protestants and Catholics; and\n       Whereas, it is here in their homeland of coastal Louisiana \n     that they have endured disasters both natural and man-made; \n     and\n       Whereas, the eastern and western Cajun regions of Louisiana \n     were among the hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, \n     2005, and Hurricane Rita on September 26, 2005; and\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of these two natural disasters, \n     again the trumpets sound, and the ill winds blow, for many of \n     the sons and daughters of the Acadians are about to be exiled \n     again, not at the hands of a government demanding allegiance \n     but by the same government to which they have already pledged \n     allegiance and the same government that many of their sons \n     and daughters have fought and even died for; and\n       Whereas, this exile will be produced as the result of what \n     some who live outside the coastal region of Louisiana suggest \n     is a well-intentioned, reasonable application of the rules \n     and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program, \n     which if not challenged and changed, will force those who \n     live in many of the areas hardest hit by Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, especially in the southern portion of \n     the parishes of Cameron, Vermilion, St. Mary, Terrebonne, \n     Lafourche, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard, to leave the land \n     of their ancestry, the land of memories, to where they \n     know not, to be finally and forever assimilated into a \n     culture familiar yet strangely foreign to their traditions \n     and way of life; and\n       Whereas, the effect of these rules and regulations will be \n     to force them to build homes they cannot afford to build, and \n     as a result the land that no one wanted and which was settled \n     by the people no one wanted will now be available only to the \n     wealthiest, if available at all; and\n       Whereas, a policy with an impact of this magnitude has \n     never been implemented on such a large scale before in the \n     modem history of this nation; and\n       Whereas, people in California, Washington, Nevada, and Utah \n     who live in earthquake-prone areas were allowed to develop \n     privately funded programs to secure earthquake insurance \n     which is privately provided; and\n       Whereas, although flood insurance is provided through an \n     agency of the federal government and there is a cost and risk \n     associated with living in coastal regions of Louisiana, these \n     risks in terms of damages due to storm surges caused by \n     hurricanes is not unlike those risks faced by any other \n     community along the Gulf Coast from the Florida Keys to \n     Brownsfield, Texas; and\n       Whereas, since these rules and regulations make no \n     distinction between risk of damages in flood plains due to \n     storm surges and that caused by flooding resulting from \n     rising waters due to rain and are based primarily on \n     elevation, other communities along the Gulf Coast who are \n     just as vulnerable to damage caused by storm surge are \n     allowed to rebuild in areas next to the beach because the \n     initial elevation of the area is higher than that found in \n     the coastal area of Louisiana. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to direct the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency to review its recovery policies and programs and to \n     prepare an outline of the social and economic issues involved \n     in the implementation of the rules and regulations of the \n     National Flood Insurance Program as that implementation \n     affects the rebuilding efforts in all coastal Louisiana \n     communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That this report include any and all suggestions \n     or recommendations as to practical alternatives to such \n     policies to allow for the preservation of the unique culture \n     of coastal Louisiana. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-429.

A bill to protect, conserve, and restore native fish, \nwildlife, and their natural habitats at national wildlife refuges \nthrough cooperative, incentive-based grants to control, mitigate, and \neradicate harmful nonnative plant species, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will address the growing harm that nonnative or \n``invasive'' species are inflicting on the wildlife and environment of \nour National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt issued an executive order that \ndesignated Pelican Island, located in my home State of Florida, as a \nFederal bird reservation. This designation was intended to protect the \nnumerous species of waterfowl that called Indian River Lagoon and \nPelican Island home, including the last known brown pelican rookery on \nthe East Coast of Florida. President Roosevelt's action marked the \nfirst time that our Federal Government set aside land for the sake of \nwildlife.\n  In the century that followed, the Pelican Island reservation, 27 \nadditional sites in Florida, and other areas nationwide were set aside \nby the Federal Government and grew into a vast network that is now the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System. Today, this system is comprised of 540 \nwildlife refuges and 3,000 waterfowl production areas, spanning 95 \nmillion miles across all 50 States and several U.S. territories. These \nrefuges are home to 700 bird species, more than 200 mammal species, 250 \nreptile and amphibian species, and more than 200 types of fish--\nincluding one-fourth of all federally recognized threatened and \nendangered species. The habitat afforded by our refuges will become \neven more critical to the survival of wildlife, which is already being \nforced to adapt to a rapidly changing climate.\n  As if encroaching human development, water and air pollution, and \nclimate change weren't great enough challenges, our wildlife refuges \nand other protected areas are also threatened by a more insidious and \npersistent problem: invasive species. These non-native plant and animal \nspecies compete for habitat, food, and other resources that are \nessential to native wildlife, including endangered and threatened \nspecies.\n  According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, \nover 400 nonnative animals and nearly 1,200 exotic plant species have \nbeen documented in the State, with more arriving each day. The old \nworld climbing fern, Lygodium, poses a greater threat than any other \nnonnative plant to south Florida's natural areas, including one of our \nnational treasures, the Everglades. This plant currently infests over \n70 percent of the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife \nRefuge near Boyton Beach, Florida. The Everglades' tree islands, which \nare a unique and extremely rare habitat for nesting wading birds and \nterrestrial wildlife, are particularly vulnerable to Lygodium. This \ninvader first surrounds the islands' hardwood trees and dry ground, \nthen grows over the tree canopy, and eventually smothers the native \nplants. This process essentially eliminates all of the ecological \nservices that the tree islands once provided to native wildlife.\n  The threats posed by nonnative species are not confined to my home \nState of Florida--this is truly a national problem. According to the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, invasive species are one of the most \nsignificant problems facing the National Wildlife Refuge System. \nResource managers cite nonnative species as the single greatest threat \nto the refuges' biological and ecological functions, and as one of \ntheir most pressing management challenges. Currently, experts estimate \nthat nonnative plant species infest more than 2 million acres in the \nRefuge System, and that nearly 4,500 invasive animal populations are \nestablished.\n  Efforts are underway to control or eradicate harmful, nonnative \nspecies in our wildlife refuges and other conservation areas. For \nexample, the Fish and Wildlife Service treated 2,500 acres of Lygodium \non tree islands in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in fiscal \nyear 2006. The South Florida Water Management District has partnered \nwith the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service \nto develop a sustained population of natural enemies, known as \nbiological controls, to reduce the spread of invasive plants. The \ndistrict has funded a biological control program for Lygodium since \n1997, and has been working to find a natural enemy for the Brazilian \npepper, one of the most noxious, widespread weeds in Florida. Projects \nlike these are having a positive impact on the Everglades restoration, \nand show why it is important that all levels of government work \ntogether to combat harmful, nonnative species.\n\n  While these and other invasive species control efforts have yielded \npromising results, the job is far from complete. In the current fiscal \nyear, approximately $8.7 million was budgeted for treatment and control \nof nonnative plants in the Refuge System. That may sound like a lot of \nmoney, but it represents a mere drop in the bucket: the Fish and \nWildlife Service estimates that the total cost of managing invasive \nspecies on refuges nationwide is in excess of $300 million. Clearly, we \nneed to dramatically increase the resources we devote to combating \nharmful, nonnative species if we expect our refuges to fulfill the \nwildlife conservation purposes for which they were set aside.\n  That is why I have worked with Senators Stabenow, Collins, Cardin, \nand Martinez to develop and introduce the Refuge Ecology Protection, \nAssistance, and Immediate Response Act, or REPAIR Act. The primary \npurpose of this act is to protect, enhance, and restore habitats for \nnative fish and wildlife within the National Wildlife Refuge System. \nThe REPAIR Act would establish within the Fish and Wildlife Service a \ngrant program to support projects to assess, monitor, and manage \nharmful, nonnative species.\n  Specifically, REPAIR grants would be available to States, tribes, and \nterritories to assess invasive plant and animal species that may \nthreaten refuge resources, and to prioritize restorations needs and \nactivities. Grants would also be available to State and local \ngovernments, universities, conservation organizations, and others to \nimplement control projects to eradicate harmful, nonnative plants on \nrefuges and adjoining, nonfederal lands and waters. Volunteer and \npublic-interest groups would also be eligible for grants to conduct \nhabitat surveys and monitor invasive plant and animal species. The \nREPAIR Act would also give the Secretary of the Interior the authority \nto provide financial assistance to States to respond quickly to \noutbreaks of invasive plants at a stage when complete eradication is \npossible and more affordable.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service would be responsible for awarding \nREPAIR grants on a peer-reviewed, competitive\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\nbasis. For control projects, we establish numerous criteria that give \npriority to efforts that aid threatened and endangered species, \nencourage increased coordination among Federal, State, and local \nagencies, nongovernmental groups, and private entities, and that \ncontain a comprehensive plan to prevent reintroduction of target \nspecies. All projects include monitoring and reporting elements, with \noversight provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. These provisions \nwill help ensure that we achieve the greatest return on our investments \nto restore and maintain native habitat in the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem.\n  The assessments and control projects authorized by the REPAIR Act \nwill most certainly be of benefit to native wildlife living in and \naround our refuges, including the numerous threatened and endangered \nspecies that we have worked hard to protect. The restoration and \npreservation of native habitats and wildlife provided by the REPAIR Act \nwill also benefit the 37 million people who visit our refuges each year \nand take advantage of fishing, hunting, and other recreational and \neducational opportunities that these special places provide.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the efforts of Congressman Ron \nKind of Wisconsin, who introduced and championed the REPAIR Act in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. The House passed this important \nlegislation in October of last year. I hope that we can find a way for \nthe companion measure that I introduced today to pass the Senate and \nbecome the law of the land. I look forward to working with Chairman \nBoxer and the other members of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works to debate this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Refuge Ecology Protection, \n     Assistance, and Immediate Response Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Wildlife Refuge System is the premier land \n     conservation system in the world.\n       (2) Harmful nonnative species are the leading cause of \n     habitat destruction in national wildlife refuges.\n       (3) More than 675 known harmful nonnative species are found \n     in the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n       (4) Nearly 8,000,000 acres of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System contain harmful nonnative species.\n       (5) The cost of early identification and removal of harmful \n     nonnative species is dramatically lower than removing an \n     established invasive population.\n       (6) The cost of the backlog of harmful nonnative species \n     control projects that need to be carried out in the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System is over $361,000,000, and the failure \n     to carry out such projects threatens the ability of the \n     System to fulfill its basic mission.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage \n     partnerships among the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service, other Federal agencies, States, Indian tribes, and \n     other interests for the following objectives:\n       (1) To protect, enhance, restore, and manage a diversity of \n     habitats for native fish and wildlife resources within the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System through monitoring and \n     management of harmful nonnative species, including control of \n     harmful nonnative plant species.\n       (2) To promote the development of voluntary State \n     assessments to establish priorities for controlling harmful \n     nonnative plant and animal species that threaten or \n     negatively impact refuge resources.\n       (3) To promote greater cooperation among Federal, State, \n     and local land and water managers, and owners of private \n     land, water rights, or other interests, to implement \n     ecologically based strategies to eradicate, mitigate, and \n     control harmful nonnative plant species that threaten or \n     negatively impact refuge resources through a voluntary and \n     incentive-based financial assistance grant program.\n       (4) To establish an immediate response capability to combat \n     incipient harmful nonnative plant species invasions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bi11 to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevise the timeframe for recognition of certain designations in \ncertifying rural health clinics under the Medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nhealth care hero from Oregon, Maria Loredo. Through her hard work and \ntireless dedication to her community, Maria has played a critical role \nin creating access to health care for those in need in Washington \nCounty, OR.\n  Maria Loredo is the chief operating officer for the Virginia Garcia \nMemorial Health Center, named for a 6-year-old migrant farmworker girl \nwho moved from Mission, TX, to work with her family in Washington \nCounty's strawberry harvest. Tragically, Virginia Garcia died from a \nsimple foot wound, but her death inspired a committed group of \nindividuals to improve health care access in the community.\n  Like 6-year-old Virginia Garcia, Maria Loredo also hails from \nMission, TX, and as a young person worked with her family throughout \nTexas following crops. Eventually the family migrated to Oregon and \nsettled there in 1966. Maria began her work with the fledgling Virginia \nGarcia Clinic in 1978 when it was only 3 years old. Her own experience \nas a migrant worker has helped her develop the programs and services of \nthe clinic so that they are most effective in reaching the farmworker \ncommunity.\n  Maria has been instrumental in growing the health center from a \nclinic operating out of a three-car garage to an organization with four \nprimary care clinics serving over 30,000 people in Washington and \nYamhill Counties, OR. Her commitment to the community has enabled the \norganization to develop a farmworker outreach program that operates \nfrom a mobile clinic and provides medical and dental services in over \n20 migrant camps throughout the region.\n  In her role as chief operating officer, Maria has helped establish \nclinics in McMinnville, Hillsboro, and Beaverton serving a diverse \ncommunity that includes patients who not only speak English and \nSpanish, but Vietnamese, Russian, Swahili, Chinese, and Farsi.\n  She has helped Virginia Garcia develop critically needed dental, \npharmacy, and behavioral health care with an integrated approach to \nhealth care delivery that always remains sensitive to the language and \ncultural background of the patients. Most recently, Maria has helped \npave the way to a new access point at the Tigard School Based Clinic \nand also to the implementation of electronic health records.\n  While working full-time developing Virginia Garcia's programs, Maria \nfound time to pursue her education and graduated with her B.A. from \nPortland State University in 2003. Once a migrant worker, she has gone \non to not only serve her community, but inspire others to achieve a \nbetter, healthier life for themselves and their children.\n  Because she has dedicated the last 30 years of her life to the \nmission of the Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center and made a \nsignificant difference in the lives of so many, I recognize her as an \nOregon health care hero and thank her for her ongoing work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 3367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REVISION OF THE TIMEFRAME FOR THE RECOGNITION OF \n                   CERTAIN DESIGNATIONS IN CERTIFYING RURAL HEALTH \n                   CLINICS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The second sentence of section 1861(aa)(2) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(2)) is \n     amended by striking ``3-year period'' and inserting ``4-year \n     period'' in the matter in clause (i) preceding subclause (I).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3368. A bill to promote industry growth and competitiveness and to \nimprove worker training, retention, and advancement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today, Senator Snowe of Maine and I are \nintroducing a workforce development bill--the Strengthening Employment \nClusters to Organize Regional Success, or SECTORS Act.\n  Over the last 16 months, I have held 110 roundtable discussions in \ncommunities all over Ohio.\n  One of the themes that have recurred in the roundtables--from workers \nand employers, business and labor, teachers and professors--is that we \nneed to do a better job connecting workers with the middle and high \nskills needed for careers that are growing in Ohio.\n  Today, Ohio has an unemployment rate above the national average. It \nwas 6.3 percent in June.\n  Between 2000 and 2007, Ohio experienced a 24.3 percent drop in \nmanufacturing employment, shedding nearly 230,000 jobs. Overall \nemployment dropped by nearly 3.6 percent in the same time period.\n  That said, employers throughout the state talk about jobs gone \nbegging, and not being able to fill middle and high skilled positions. \nThere are open jobs in high-tech, healthcare, and even manufacturing \nthat are going unfilled.\n  A recent report by labor economists Harry Holzer and Robert Lerman \nfound that substantial demand remains in today's labor market for \nskilled workers. This is particularly true for ``middle-skill'' jobs \nthat require more than a high school degree but less than a 4-year \ncollege degree. These jobs make up nearly half of America's labor \nmarket and provide good compensation for workers.\n  The approach Senator Snowe and I take in this bill is to organize \ntraining around industry clusters.\n  Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Route 128 \naround Boston--these are examples of clusters.\n  But it is not just high tech jobs either.\n  Think of tourism in Florida, or insurance in Connecticut, or food \npackaging in Pennsylvania. These are successful clusters that build \naround a skilled labor force.\n  The Ohio Workforce Board has compiled great information about \nemerging industries and skills programs needed to see people fill these \njobs.\n  Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Chancellor Eric Fingerhut are giving \nworkforce training a high priority.\n  This bill complements those efforts, and builds on great examples of \ncluster partnerships around the country.\n  The National Governors Association has been promoting this model, and \nit really will be the way we successfully train our workers and promote \nregional economic development.\n  Nobody wants lack of training to be the constraint on Ohio's economic \ngrowth.\n  So the SECTORS Act focuses on targeted training, with multiple \nstakeholders in the same industry. The bill right now requires four \nprincipal stakeholders to be part of a training program: industry, \nlabor unions, workforce investment boards, and community colleges.\n  We want to build in a process that makes a training program \nsustainable and not just a one-time infusion of money. With that in \nmind, Senator Snowe and I have written in our bill a matching funds \nrequirement.\n  The legislation builds in rigorous evaluation so lawmakers and \npolicymakers know how tax dollars are being spent, something that has \nnot been the cause under President Bush's Department of Labor's \ntraining initiatives.\n  The Government Accountability Office found in May 2008 that the Labor \nDepartment's demand-driven workforce training programs have often been \nawarded through a non-competitive process, and have lacked \naccountability and evaluation so that Americans know how their tax \ndollars are being spent.\n  We need to break clean from this approach. I plan to work with \nSenator Snowe and colleagues in both chambers to authorize an industry \nclusters skills training program that builds in accountability and \nsustainability, and helps workers and businesses thrive in Ohio, Maine, \nand throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Employment \n     Clusters to Organize Regional Success Act of 2008'' or the \n     ``SECTORS Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Sherrod Brown, \nto introduce the Selecting Employment Clusters to Organize Regional \nSuccess, SECTORS, Act. This legislation would amend the Workforce \nInvestment Act of 1998 and establish a new industry or sector \npartnership grant program administered by the Department of Labor.\n  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, one \nof my key goals is to ensure that manufacturers are able to find a \ncapable workforce. Unfortunately, many manufacturers across the country \nhave raised significant concerns about whether the next generation of \nworkers is being trained to meet the needs of an increasingly high-tech \nworkplace. It is critical that we ensure that our Nation has a \nsufficient workforce to meet the needs of the U.S. manufacturing \nsector.\n  This legislation provides grants to help industry clusters--which are \ninterrelated group of businesses, service providers, and associated \ninstitutions--establish and expand industry partnerships. Existing \npartnerships, which are similar to those created by this bill, have \nlong been recognized as key strategic elements within some of the most \nsuccessful economic development initiatives throughout the country. \nUnfortunately, current Federal policy does not provide sufficient \nsupport for these critical ventures.\n  In my home State of Maine, the number of manufacturing jobs has \ndropped dramatically over the past decade. Between 1998 and 2008, \nmanufacturing employment in Maine went from 81,000 to 59,000, a 27 \npercent decrease! A key reason manufacturing job losses have \ndramatically affected Maine is that the average manufacturing salary is \n$10,000 more than the average annual State wage. The statistics for the \nwhole of New England are no better. From January 1998 through December \n2006, the region witnessed a decline of roughly 25 percent of its \nmanufacturing workforce.\n  For those who have lost manufacturing jobs, it is vital to help \nimprove their skills, preparing them for available U.S. jobs. This \nlegislation provides a crucial link between establishing worker \ntraining programs and fostering new employment opportunities for those \nwho have been affected by the manufacturing industry's decline. By \npromoting this innovative partnership we will take a crucial step \ntoward rejuvenating our economy.\n  Groups, such as the National Governors Association, the Aspen \nInstitute, and the National Network of Sector Partners have promoted \nand documented the success of sector partnerships. Throughout the \ncountry, sector partnerships are being used to promote the long-term \ncompetitiveness of industries and advancing employment opportunities. \nFor example, the State of Maine has recently created the North Star \nAlliance Initiative. The alliance has brought together Maine's boat \nbuilders, the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites \nCenters, Maine's marine and composite trade association, economic \ndevelopment groups, and investment organizations for the purpose of \nadvancing workforce training.\n  Out Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \ncontinues to grow and remains the envy of the world. Ideas by \ninnovative Americans in the private and public sector have paid \nenormous dividends, improving the lives of millions throughout the \nworld. We must continue to encourage all avenues for advancing this \nvital sector if America is to compete at the forefront of innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7789-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7789-S7790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 632--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE PEOPLE'S \n REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO USE THE UPCOMING \n    OLYMPIC GAMES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH FOR THE PARTIES TO THE \n  CONFLICTS IN SUDAN, CHAD, AND THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC TO CEASE \n HOSTILITIES AND REVIVE EFFORTS TOWARD A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THEIR \n                    NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CONFLICTS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Menendez, \nMr. Lieberman, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Johnson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

There will be no restriction concerning the use \n     of media material produced in China and intended principally \n     for broadcast outside.'';\n       Whereas Beijing's Action Plan for the Olympics states, ``In \n     the preparation for the Games, we will be open in every \n     aspect to the rest of the country and the whole world.'';\n       Whereas, on April 23, 2002, after the Olympic Games had \n     been awarded to Beijing, the President of the International \n     Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said, ``We are convinced \n     that the Olympic Games will improve the human rights record \n     [in China].'';\n       Whereas, on March 13, 2008, the United States Department of \n     State released the annual Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices;\n       Whereas the report on the People's Republic of China states \n     that in 2007 the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     ``tightened restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, \n     particularly in anticipation of and during sensitive events, \n     including increased efforts to control and censor the \n     Internet'';\n       Whereas that report also states that in 2007 authorities of \n     the People's Republic of China ``monitored telephone \n     conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text \n     messaging, and Internet communications'';\n       Whereas, on July 29, 2008, Amnesty International released a \n     report entitled ``People's Republic of China: The Olympics \n     Countdown--Broken Promises'', which finds, regarding the \n     promises of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to the International Olympic Committee in 2001, ``[T]here has \n     been no progress towards fulfilling these promises, only \n     continued deterioration. . . . In fact, the crackdown on \n     human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers has \n     intensified because Beijing is hosting the Olympics.'';\n       Whereas, that report also states, ``Chinese journalists \n     continue to operate in a climate of official censorship and \n     control, with many still languishing in jail for reporting on \n     issues deemed politically sensitive. Internet controls have \n     been increasingly tightened as the Olympics approach with \n     control, regulation and censorship extending to various \n     categories of internet users, including Internet Service \n     Providers, bloggers and website owners. Numerous websites \n     have been closed down for providing information deemed \n     sensitive by the authorities. Internet users who post such \n     information risk detention, prosecution and imprisonment.'';\n       Whereas, in April 2008, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China issued an order requiring hotels to allow \n     the Public Security Bureau to install hardware devices and \n     new software programs on the hotel networks that are designed \n     to send sensitive information about users, including foreign \n     visitors and journalists, to the Public Security Bureau;\n       Whereas, on July 29, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported \n     that ``China will censor the Internet used by foreign media \n     during the Olympics . . . reversing a pledge to offer \n     complete media freedom at the games'', citing confirmation by \n     Sun Weide, spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Organizing \n     Committee;\n       Whereas the Olympic Charter states that the mission of the \n     International Olympic Committee is ``to promote a positive \n     legacy from the Olympic Games to the host cities and host \n     countries'';\n       Whereas, on December 25, 2007, the Vice-President of the \n     International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, stated, ``The \n     Games can act as a catalyst and contribute to the opening of \n     a society.''; and\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2008, the President of the \n     International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, stated that \n     the Olympic Games are a ``force for good'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China--\n       (A) to rescind the order requiring hotels to allow the \n     Public Security Bureau to install hardware and software on \n     the hotel networks; and\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n       (B) to refrain from targeting, on the basis of information \n     collected from Internet monitoring, any individual who visits \n     websites related to politics or human rights or who expresses \n     opinions related to politics or human rights in electronic \n     communication;\n       (2) expresses grave concern regarding the deterioration of \n     respect for human rights in the People's Republic of China \n     leading up to the Beijing Olympics;\n       (3) notes that the behavior of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China violates several international \n     conventions to which the country is a signatory, violates the \n     Government's commitments to the International Olympic \n     Committee, and is contrary to longstanding Olympic tradition \n     and spirit; and\n       (4) remains concerned for the safety and privacy of \n     international visitors and journalists traveling to the \n     People's Republic of China for the Beijing Olympics, in \n     particular visitors and journalists involved in documenting \n     human rights abuses and promoting human rights improvements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/30/senate-section/article/S7791-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 634--RECOGNIZING JULY 30, 2008, AS THE 40TH \nANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING THE SENATE \n              SELECT COMMITTEE ON NUTRITON AND HUMAN NEEDS\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nSanders, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Pryor, \nMr. Smith, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S. Res. 634\n\n       Whereas on April 26, 1968, after viewing the CBS Emmy-award \n     winning documentary ``Hunger in America,'' Senator George \n     McGovern introduced a resolution to establish a Senate Select \n     Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs;\n       Whereas the resolution establishing the Select Committee on \n     Nutrition and Human Needs was enacted on July 30, 1968;\n       Whereas Senator George McGovern served as the Chairman of \n     the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs from 1968 \n     to 1977;\n       Whereas July 30, 2008, marks the 40th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the resolution establishing the Select Committee \n     on Nutrition and Human Needs, which later became the \n     foundation of the current Subcommittee on Nutrition and Food \n     Assistance, Sustainable and Organic Agriculture, and General \n     Legislation Jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry;\n       Whereas Senator George McGovern was committed to exposing \n     the failure of Federal food assistance programs to reach \n     citizens lacking in adequate quantities and quality of food;\n       Whereas Senators George McGovern and Robert Dole worked \n     tirelessly in their respective roles on the Select Committee \n     on Nutrition and Human Needs to develop a bipartisan Federal \n     response to hunger;\n       Whereas the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs \n     played a key role in educating Congress, the Federal \n     government, and the Nation at large about the magnitude of \n     hunger in the United States;\n       Whereas the work of the Select Committee on Nutrition and \n     Human Needs was vital to reforming the Federal food stamp \n     program, culminating in the passage of the Food Stamp Act of \n     1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), which made the program more \n     efficient and more accessible to those most in need by \n     finally eliminating the requirement that Americans pay for a \n     portion of their food stamps;\n       Whereas the work of the Select Committee on Nutrition and \n     Human Needs was essential to expanding the school lunch \n     program established under the National School Lunch Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and permanently establishing the school \n     breakfast program under section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act \n     of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773), the child and adult care food \n     program under section 17 of the National School Lunch Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1766), and the summer food service program for \n     children under section 13 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1761);\n       Whereas the work of the Select Committee on Nutrition and \n     Human Needs was instrumental in the establishment of the \n     special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, \n     and children established by section 17 of the Child Nutrition \n     Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) (WIC);\n       Whereas the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry remains committed to continuing the important work \n     begun by Senators George McGovern and Robert Dole of \n     providing a Federal response to hunger;\n       Whereas the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry provided a record-level amount of nutrition funding \n     in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law \n     110-246; 122 Stat. 1651) to reform and strengthen Federal \n     nutrition assistance programs;\n       Whereas, through the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n     2008 (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 1651), the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry made key \n     improvements to the food stamp program, including--\n       (1) increasing the food purchasing ability of low-income \n     households by accounting for food cost inflation;\n       (2) increasing the minimum benefit;\n       (3) encouraging retirement and education savings; and\n       (4) allowing families to account for child care costs in \n     calculating food assistance;\n       Whereas, through the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n     2008 (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 1651), the Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry helped to \n     strengthen the domestic food assistance safety net by \n     providing significant funding to increase commodity purchases \n     for local area food banks;\n       Whereas, in 2008, more than 28,000,000 people in the United \n     States participate in the food stamp program;\n       Whereas, in 2008, more than 17,500,000 low-income children \n     receive free or reduced-price meals through the national \n     school lunch program;\n       Whereas despite Federal food assistance programs, \n     35,500,000 people in the United States, including 12,600,000 \n     children, continue to live in households considered to be \n     food insecure;\n       Whereas children who live in households lacking access to \n     sufficient food are more likely to be in poorer physical \n     health than children from food secure households; and\n       Whereas children are particularly vulnerable to the effects \n     of food insecurity because undernutrition can have adverse \n     impacts on emotional health, behavior, school performance, \n     and cognitive development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes July 30, 2008, as the 40th anniversary of \n     the enactment of the resolution establishing the Senate \n     Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs;\n       (2) recognizes the substantial contributions the Select \n     Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs made in ensuring that \n     effective and efficient Federal food assistance programs were \n     accessible to those most in need;\n       (3) recognizes that hunger continues to be an issue \n     plaguing the United States;

OPEN FUEL STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Open \n     Fuel Standard Act of 2008'' or the ``OFS Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The status of oil as a strategic commodity, which \n     derives from its domination of the transportation sector, \n     presents a clear and present danger to the United States.\n       (2) In a prior era, when salt was a strategic commodity, \n     salt mines conferred national power and wars were fought over \n     the control of such mines.\n       (3) Technology, in the form of electricity and \n     refrigeration, decisively ended salt's monopoly of meat \n     preservation and greatly reduced its strategic importance.\n       (4) Fuel competition and consumer choice would similarly \n     serve to end oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and \n     strip oil of its strategic status.\n       (5) The current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of \n     petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices, \n     effectively imposing a harmful tax on the economy of the \n     United States of nearly $500,000,000,000 per year.\n       (6) Much of the inflated petroleum revenues the oil cartel \n     earns at the expense of the people of the United States are \n     used for purposes antithetical to the interests of the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (7) Alcohol fuels, including ethanol and methanol, could \n     potentially provide significant supplies of additional fuels \n     that could be produced in the United States and in many other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere that are friendly to the \n     United States.\n       (8) Alcohol fuels can only play a major role in securing \n     the energy independence of the United States if a substantial \n     portion of vehicles in the United States are capable of \n     operating on such fuels.\n       (9) It is not in the best interest of United States \n     consumers or the United States Government to be constrained \n     to depend solely upon petroleum resources for vehicle fuels \n     if alcohol fuels are potentially available.\n       (10) Existing technology, in the form of flexible fuel \n     vehicles, allows internal combustion engine cars and trucks \n     to be produced at little or no additional cost, which are \n     capable of operating on conventional gasoline, alcohol fuels, \n     or any combination of such fuels, as availability or cost \n     advantage dictates, providing a platform on which fuels can \n     compete.\n       (11) The necessary distribution system for such alcohol \n     fuels will not be developed in the United States until a \n     substantial fraction of the vehicles in the United States are \n     capable of operating on such fuels.\n       (12) The establishment of such a vehicle fleet and \n     distribution system would provide a large market that would \n     mobilize private resources to substantially advance the \n     technology and expand the production of alcohol fuels in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (13) The United States has an urgent national security \n     interest to develop alcohol fuels technology, production, and \n     distribution systems as rapidly as possible.\n       (14) New cars sold in the United States that are equipped \n     with an internal combustion engine should allow for fuel \n     competition by being flexible fuel vehicles, and new diesel \n     cars should be capable of operating on biodiesel.\n       (15) Such an open fuel standard would help to protect the \n     United States economy from high and volatile oil prices and \n     from the threats caused by global instability, terrorism, and \n     natural disaster.\n       (c) Open Fuel Standard for Transportation.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 32920.

Mr. BROWNBACK submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 3186, to provide funding for the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. OPEN FUEL STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Open \n     Fuel Standard Act of 2008'' or the ``OFS Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The status of oil as a strategic commodity, which \n     derives from its domination of the transportation sector, \n     presents a clear and present danger to the United States.\n       (2) In a prior era, when salt was a strategic commodity, \n     salt mines conferred national power and wars were fought over \n     the control of such mines.\n       (3) Technology, in the form of electricity and \n     refrigeration, decisively ended salt's monopoly of meat \n     preservation and greatly reduced its strategic importance.\n       (4) Fuel competition and consumer choice would similarly \n     serve to end oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and \n     strip oil of its strategic status.\n       (5) The current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of \n     petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices, \n     effectively imposing a harmful tax on the economy of the \n     United States of nearly $500,000,000,000 per year.\n       (6) Much of the inflated petroleum revenues the oil cartel \n     earns at the expense of the people of the United States are \n     used for purposes antithetical to the interests of the United \n     States and its allies.\n       (7) Alcohol fuels, including ethanol and methanol, could \n     potentially provide significant supplies of additional fuels \n     that could be produced in the United States and in\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\n     many other countries in the Western Hemisphere that are \n     friendly to the United States.\n       (8) Alcohol fuels can only play a major role in securing \n     the energy independence of the United States if a substantial \n     portion of vehicles in the United States are capable of \n     operating on such fuels.\n       (9) It is not in the best interest of United States \n     consumers or the United States Government to be constrained \n     to depend solely upon petroleum resources for vehicle fuels \n     if alcohol fuels are potentially available.\n       (10) Existing technology, in the form of flexible fuel \n     vehicles, allows internal combustion engine cars and trucks \n     to be produced at little or no additional cost, which are \n     capable of operating on conventional gasoline, alcohol fuels, \n     or any combination of such fuels, as availability or cost \n     advantage dictates, providing a platform on which fuels can \n     compete.\n       (11) The necessary distribution system for such alcohol \n     fuels will not be developed in the United States until a \n     substantial fraction of the vehicles in the United States are \n     capable of operating on such fuels.\n       (12) The establishment of such a vehicle fleet and \n     distribution system would provide a large market that would \n     mobilize private resources to substantially advance the \n     technology and expand the production of alcohol fuels in the \n     United States and abroad.\n       (13) The United States has an urgent national security \n     interest to develop alcohol fuels technology, production, and \n     distribution systems as rapidly as possible.\n       (14) New cars sold in the United States that are equipped \n     with an internal combustion engine should allow for fuel \n     competition by being flexible fuel vehicles, and new diesel \n     cars should be capable of operating on biodiesel.\n       (15) Such an open fuel standard would help to protect the \n     United States economy from high and volatile oil prices and \n     from the threats caused by global instability, terrorism, and \n     natural disaster.\n       (c) Open Fuel Standard for Transportation.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 329 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 32920.

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nI note my strong support for Senate passage of S. 2617, the proposed \nVeterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008. This \nmeasure, which I introduced earlier this year and which the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs reported on July 24, would direct the Secretary of \nVeterans' Affairs to increase, effective December 1, 2008, the rates of \nveterans' disability compensation to keep pace with the rising cost of \nliving. The rate adjustment would be equal to that provided to Social \nSecurity recipients, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer \nPrice Index.\n  Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, \nfor veterans' compensation in order to ensure that inflation does not \nerode the purchasing power of the veterans and their families who \ndepend upon this income to meet their needs. This past year Congress \npassed, and the President signed into law, Public Law 110-111, which \nresulted in a COLA increase of 2.3 percent for 2008. At this time, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the cost-of-living \nadjustment for 2009 will be 2.8 percent.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. According to the latest figures from VA, there \nare 2.8 million veterans currently receiving compensation for \ndisabilities incurred in the line of duty, as well as over 316,000 \nsurviving spouses of veterans receiving dependency and indemnity \ncompensation. Current U.S. military deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwill ensure that there will be new recipients of these benefits in the \ncoming years. The brave men and women who voluntarily put themselves in \nharm's way to keep our country safe need to be certain that we will \nfulfill our responsibility to ensure that those who are injured during \nservice are provided with the help they need to provide for their \nfamilies' economic security.\n  Many of the more than 3 million recipients of these VA benefits \ndepend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide for their own \nbasic needs but those of their spouses, children and parents as well. \nWithout an annual COLA increase, these veterans and their families \nwould see the value of\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\ntheir hard-earned benefits slowly dwindle, and we, as a Congress, would \nhave neglected our duty to ensure that those who sacrificed so much for \nthis country receive the benefits and services to which they are \nentitled.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support passage of this COLA increase \nand for their continued support for our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. PRYOR.
