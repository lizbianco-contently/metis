Mr. President, the House of Representatives passed an \nemergency war spending bill on Friday that includes tens of billions of \ndollars for projects that have no connection whatsoever to the needs of \nour troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, that tells U.S. generals how to do \ntheir jobs, and which pulls out of thin air a date for evacuating U.S. \ntroops from Iraq.\n  It was meant to send a message to the Commander in Chief, but its \nonly real effect is to delay the delivery of urgent material support to \nour troops. The President has said he will veto any legislation that \nincludes a surrender date and which substitutes the judgment of \npoliticians in Washington for the judgment of commanders in the field. \nThose who voted for the House spending bill on Friday, therefore, knew \nit had no chance of being approved. It was an empty promise to the \ntroops.\n  The Constitution gives Members of Congress a concrete way of \nexpressing their opposition to a war, and that is to vote against \nfunding it. But House Democrats are trying to have it both ways: They \ncall their bill a statement against the very war it continues to fund, \na promise of support for the troops that has no chance of being signed.\n  Who loses out in this strange calculus? American soldiers and marines \ndeployed in Afghanistan and Iraq and their worried families here at \nhome are the losers.\n  The Secretary of Defense said as much last week. He said delaying the \napproval of funds would slow the training of units already headed into \nIraq and reduce the funds available for repairs to buildings and \nequipment. He said it would force the Army to consider cutting funds \nfor renovations to barracks and cut off repairs to equipment that is \nneeded to support troop deployment training.\n  The House brushed these concerns aside to express a point of view. \nBut troops who have been sent into battle with assurances of support \ngot another message: Don't count on it from us.\n  Some have said the Senate version of the war spending bill is more \npalatable. They say this because its date for withdrawal is only a \ngoal. They think that by retaining this provision, they will eventually \nforce Republicans to accept the notion that battlefield commanders \nshould be tied to arbitrary timelines. Believe me, they are wrong.\n  The week before last, we prevented legislation that would have told \nour enemies the date on which we will give up. A majority in the Senate \nshowed it won't approve a bill that shares our battle plan with the \nenemy or which tells soldiers and commanders how to do their jobs.\n  We won't let timelines be used as the toll booth for getting aid to \nthe troops, and we need to send the President a bill that doesn't \ninclude them so he can sign it without delay. I urge my colleagues to \nput an end to this unfortunate and misguided effort to set an arbitrary \ndate upon which to withdraw from Iraq and to strip language from this \nemergency spending bill that only guarantees our troops will have to \nwait for the help they need and the support they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3728-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3728-S3729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first 3 months of the 110th Congress \nhave been very productive. We have shown the American people that when \nDemocrats and Republicans work together results flow. It is \ninteresting, when that happens, there are a lot of positives that can \nbe said by both parties. When we don't accomplish something, there is a \nlot of criticism that is shared by both parties.\n  This productive work began in January when we passed the ethics bill, \nthe most sweeping reform in the history of our country. Next we worked \nto raise the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. After minimum \nwage, we finished the fiscal work of the last Congress, the 109th \nCongress, by passing a responsible continuing resolution with no \nearmarks. Then we went to homeland security and ensured that 5 years \nafter 9/11, all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission will be \nimplemented. Last week, we passed a balanced budget which includes over \n$180 billion in tax breaks for middle-class families and says in the \nfuture, if you are going to lower taxes, if you are going to increase \nspending, you have to have some way to pay for it. Ethics, minimum \nwage, the continuing resolution, the 9/11 recommendations and the \nbudget--it is a record of which all of us can be proud. But, of course, \nwe have so much more to do. From stem cell to immigration to energy, \nthere are challenges ahead, and this week the Senate will turn its \nattention to the most pressing challenge of them all--the debacle of \nIraq.\n  Today we begin consideration of the 2007 supplemental appropriations \nbill. This legislation includes more than $121 billion. The vast \nmajority--90 percent of it--is for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nis also for enhancing military readiness generally, for improving \nveterans health care--and certainly in the wake of Walter Reed and \nother scandals regarding how veterans are being taken care of, this is \ncertainly something that is necessary--for national priorities such as \nrebuilding the gulf coast and homeland security and I mention, Mr. \nPresident, drought assistance, farm disaster.\n  In the western part of the United States, because of this global \nclimate change, we have had millions--I am speaking directly--millions, \nnot thousands, but millions--of acres burned, and unless we figure out \nsome way to restore that vegetation, that land is going foul, to say \nthe least. That is what this is all about--farm aid assistance. Willie \nNelson could sing for weeks about the need for this assistance to take \nplace in the West. I am not an expert on wheat, corn, rice, and all \nthose other products--a lot of people here are--but I am about \nrangelands and what has happened to Nevada.\n  The bill contains critical money, as I have indicated, for our \ntroops. We need to get the money to them as quickly as we can. Our \ntroops are serving under difficult conditions. The Senate will ensure \nthey have everything they need to continue this fight as we have done.\n  Our support, though, for the troops does not stop at funding. We must \nalso ensure our soldiers have a strategy for success. The Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress is listening to the American people and fighting to \ngive our troops what they need and strategy--strategy worthy of their \nsacrifices. That is why in addition to the much needed changes for our \ntroops, the bill also contains a strong message for President Bush: \nChange course in Iraq.\n  My friend, the distinguished Republican leader, criticized what is in \nthis bill that will be reported to the floor shortly, saying it is not \ngood for the troops. David Brooks, the very conservative editorial \nwriter for the New York Times, said last Friday on the ``Jim Lehrer \nNewsHour'': This is ridiculous for anyone to criticize a democracy for \ndebating the most important issue of the day, the war in Iraq. The very \nconservative David Brooks said this is what democracies are all about. \nThe troops over there know this is good.\n  I have my BlackBerry on my hip. Someone BlackBerried his friend, one \nof my staff members, who is a full colonel in the Army National Guard \nout in Nevada. He keeps in touch with his friends. He said what \nhappened in the House and what we put in our bill is good for the \ntroops--this is a soldier e-mailing my friend from Iraq--because it \nlets the Iraqi Government know we are serious. He went on to say the \ndeadline is important for the Iraqi people and the soldiers, and the \nIraqi people know that.\n  Secretary Gates, when asked about this timeline, provisions in the \nbill relating to Iraq, said it doesn't affect the troops adversely at \nall.\n  Certainly the troops know we care about them. We give them everything \nthey need. But last week, we entered the fifth year of this war. Think \nabout that, the fifth year of this war, and there is no end in sight, I \nam sorry to say. The news this morning, when I first got up, was five \nmore soldiers were killed yesterday, 238 this year alone. March 26, 238 \ndead Americans, just like the boy Raul Bravo, from Elco, NV. I talked \nto his mother--237 just like that young man. Three thousand two hundred \nforty-one so far in this war--dead Americans--25,000\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nwounded. One hospital in Texas has handled 250 amputations. There are \n2,000 double amputees as a result of this war.\n\n  The war continues to move in the wrong direction and yet--instead of \ndigging us out of the hole it created in Iraq--instead of stopping this \ndownward spiral of destruction--instead of taking the fight to the \nterrorists who attacked us on September 11--this White House wants us \nto keep doing more of the same in Iraq.\n  In January, President Bush said he would escalate the conflict and \nsend 21,500 new troops for a few months. Of course, we were misled on \nthat. We now know the number is around 30,000, and they will be there \nindefinitely, and the President has said he might ask for more troops. \nThere is no short-term surge, as the President has described. It is \nmore of the same. The President is placing troops in the middle of an \nIraqi sectarian civil war. More military solutions to a problem that \nGeneral Petraeus, our top commander in Iraq, has said can only be \nsolved politically. Our commander on the ground in Iraq has said that \nonly 20 percent of it can be won militarily. That is not good enough \nfor me. We need to find a new way forward.\n  If the President will not listen to the generals, if he will not \nlisten to the American people, who have spoken for a new direction, \nthen perhaps he will listen to us, Congress, when we send him a \nsupplemental bill that acknowledges reality in Iraq. We must find a new \nway forward. The President can swagger all he wants, but we have 3,241 \ndead Americans.\n  The Iraq measure in this bill changes the mission of U.S. troops from \npolicing a civil war to counterterror, training, and force protection. \nIt rejects the notion that this war can be won militarily, and it sets \na goal of redeploying our troops by March 2008. It includes a \nrequirement for a political, diplomatic, and economic strategy to be \nimplemented in conjunction with the redeployment.\n  The Iraq language is based on a simple premise: Iraq can be won only \npolitically. In short, it offers a responsible strategy in Iraq that \nthe American people asked for last November 7--a strategy that will \nenhance our country's ability to wage war on terror.\n  Contrary to what President Bush believes, the key to success in Iraq \nis not escalating the conflict by adding tens of thousands of \nadditional troops to trod down the same dangerous road. It is to find a \nnew way forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this supplemental. After 4 years of \nwar, our troops deserve a strategy to help them complete the mission so \nthey can come home.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to thank our leader for his \ncomments about the progress that has been made in the Senate on issues \nthat affect the working middle-class families of this country and also \nfor his responses on the issue of the war in Iraq, where there should \nbe an opportunity, as we focus on the particular amendment, to get into \nthat in greater detail. But I thank him for his very worthwhile \ncomments this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3729-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the leaders of Northern Ireland took \nanother giant step toward lasting peace earlier today when Sinn Fein \nand the Democratic Unionist Party reached a landmark agreement to share \npower in a joint administration to be established on May 8. The \nagreement gives hope to all who have worked so long and so hard to \nbring unionists and nationalists together in government on a permanent \nbasis.\n  Prime Minister Ahern of Ireland and Prime Minister Blair of Britain \nhave been strong allies for peace. John Hume and many others have been \nheroes along the way. But the indispensable persons in this historic \nagreement today are Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, and Ian \nPaisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. In reaching this \nagreement, they have acted to strengthen democracy and create a future \nof peace and stability for the future of that troubled land.\n  Today, the people of Northern Ireland salute them both for reaching \nthis new day, and the world congratulates them as well. We know it was \nnot an easy step to take. Their past disagreements have been intense \nand deep. The challenges they have faced often seemed irreconcilable, \nand the scars of the past have often seemed impossible to heal. \nCompromises have been difficult and painful to achieve. But with this \nagreement, Sinn Fein and the DUP have finally taken the essential step \nof looking forward together--not backward--and have agreed at long last \nto work with one another for the future of Northern Ireland.\n  The eyes of the world will be on them on May 8. All who care about \nlasting peace and stability look forward to the permanent restoration \nof the Northern Ireland Government at that time. In a world where \npolitical resolution often is elusive, these leaders deserve enormous \ncredit for giving us hope.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I do, myself, feel a \ngreat sense of pleasure and comfort in what has transpired today with \nregard to Ireland, and I wanted to say so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3729-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3729-S3732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Obviously, it \nis incumbent on us to make certain the Senate takes the opportunity for \nfuller debate on a measure of such wide impact.\n  The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nhas scheduled a hearing tomorrow, where we will undoubtedly hear how \n``unfair'' the current unionization system is and how it must be \namended to allow for greater unionization. I am sure we will have a \nfull and robust debate in this body. But as we kick off this debate \nover whether to deny private ballots to workers who wish to unionize, \nit is my hope we will be able to at least hold fast and true to the \nfacts. There should be a full debate on these facts.\n  There is ample evidence to indicate that we should be wary of \namending the National Labor Relations Act, the NLRA, in a way that \nwould upset the balance in national labor policy between labor and \nmanagement and employer and employee. We must not rely on slogans, \nanecdotal stories, and questionable secretly commissioned and selective \nstatistics about alleged unfair labor practices.\n  The NLRA and its attendant volumes of reported decisions and case \nprecedent by the National Labor Relations Board is an extremely \ncomplicated, interwoven area of law. Amending it in the way the \nsponsors of H.R. 800 envision could rip a gaping hole in the precise \nweave of this complex fabric and have a dramatic impact with many \nunintended consequences.\n  It must also be considered that amending the NLRA will not only \naffect the welfare of unions, but it will also have a negative overall \nimpact on workers, employers--especially small employers--and on the \neconomy and America's ability to be competitive in a global economy.\n  So let us begin the discussion of the bill. The Employee Free Choice \nAct is designed to increase union membership, which currently stands at \n7.4 percent of the private sector workforce. The bill would accomplish \nthat through an artificial, union-controlled ``card check'' \ncertification procedure in place of the traditional NLRB-supervised \nprivate ballot election or, as\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\nsome have called it, a secret ballot election.\n  In fact, the bill would radically upset the balance in labor and \nmanagement and employer-employee relations by amending the National \nLabor Relations Act in three ways:\n  First, the bill would mandate union representation without a private \nballot election among employees. The so-called Employee Free Choice Act \nmandates that the NLRB certify a union as the exclusive collective \nbargaining representative of employees when the union has demonstrated \nthat a majority of the employees, 50 percent plus 1, have signed union \nauthorization cards--or, in other words, the ``card check'' system \nwithout a private ballot election among employees.\n  Not only would this deny employees the right of private, NLRB-\nprotected ballot elections on the question of initial union \nrepresentation, but through operation of the NLRB's current \n``certification bar'' doctrine, it would prevent employees from \nchallenging the union's majority status through a decertification \nelection for the certification year.\n  Secondly, the bill would guarantee union contracts where the \nGovernment would impose the wages, the terms, and conditions of \nemployment for 2 years if the parties fail to agree after 90 days of \nbargaining and 30 days of mediation. That is because the so-called \nEmployee Free Choice Act requires compulsory, binding arbitration of \ninitial union contracts.\n  Specifically, under the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, an \nemployer must begin bargaining within 10 days of the union's demand. \nThereafter, if the union and the employer cannot reach an agreement \nwithin 90 days, the contract terms must be submitted to the Federal \nMediation and Conciliation Service for a 30-day period of mediation. If \nthe FMCS is unable to mediate an agreement between the parties, then it \nmust refer the initial contract to an FMCS arbitration panel with the \nauthority to issue a decision that is binding on the employer and union \nfor a 2-year period.\n  Added to current law, the effect would be to deny employees the \nopportunity to approve, or ratify, the terms of the contract. They \nwould be prevented by the NLRB's ``contract bar'' from initiating a \nprivate ballot decertification election challenging the union's \ncontinuing majority status for the 2-year term of the contract.\n  Finally, the bill would impose new antiemployer penalties. These \ninclude prioritizing NLRB investigations of unfair labor practice \ncharges alleged to have been committed by an employer during an \norganizing campaign and possibly pursuing injunctive remedial action in \nFederal Court.\n  The proposal also provides for liquidated damages in the amount of \ntwo times any back pay found due and owing and subjects an employer to \na civil penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation of the NLRA. As \nthis chart shows, the proponents of the so-called Employee Free Choice \nAct are asking the American worker to accept the denial of access to \ncomplete information about the union, the denial of a private ballot \nvote, the inability to decertify a union for at least 28 months after \nit is initially certified, the denial of the right to strike for a \nbetter deal after binding arbitration, potentially the denial of an \nemployee's opportunity to vote on a contract, and the denial of knowing \nif a union is organizing at their place of work.\n  Let us look at that again. The effect of the Employee Free Choice Act \ndissolves workers' rights to access to complete information about the \nunion, to vote in secret, to decertify the union for at least 28 \nmonths, to strike for a better deal--takes that away from them--to vote \non a contract--takes that away from them--and to know if union \norganizing is taking place. It takes their rights away as workers.\n  This deceptively named bill has little to do with employee free \nchoice. In fact, it would take away an employee's right to choose union \nrepresentation through private ballot elections--some say ``secret \nballot'' elections--something the unions have always fought for but now \nare going to throw away in their desire to unionize at all costs. \nIndeed, it has everything to do with guaranteeing union organizing to \nincrease union membership, at a time when unions represent a steadily \ndeclining percentage of America's private sector workforce.\n  As you can see clearly from this chart, since the modern-day union \nmovement in 1935, when you evaluate their percentage of the overall \nworkforce, unions have had good years, up in here, and they have had \nmany bad years.\n  As that chart clearly demonstrates, under the current system of NLRB \noverseeing private ballot elections in recent years, unions have lost \nmembership.\n  Currently, I must underscore, union membership stands at 7.4 percent \nof the private sector workforce. Proponents of the Employee Free Choice \nAct seek to turn back time when it comes to the percentage of the \nAmerican workforce that is unionized and that they want to be \nunionized.\n  I have no inherent problem with a fairly considered, fairly elected \nunion. However, this bill attempts to increase union strength through \nan artificial, union-controlled ``card check'' certification procedure \nwhich tosses away the traditional NLRB-supervised private ballot \nelection.\n  Where is the problem we are trying to fix? This bill would replace \nthe time-honored, NLRB-protected private ballot election, the \ntraditional system under which workers decide whether to be represented \nor not represented by a union. Instead, the system would be supplanted \nwith the mandated ``card check'' procedure, where union organizers can \npressure employees to sign union authorization cards which are then \npresented to the NLRB for certification of the union as the exclusive \ncollective bargaining representative of all of the employees.\n  It is important for us to consider that the U.S. Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly denounced union authorization cards as being ``inherently \nunreliable'' because of the types of peer pressures, some subtle and \nsome not so subtle or benign, to sign the cards. In its 1969 Gissel \nPacking decision, the Court acknowledged that the use of authorization \ncards to determine majority support is unreliable and that private \nballot elections are the ``most satisfactory--indeed the preferred \nmethod of ascertaining whether a union has majority support.''\n  Unions, likewise, prefer a NLRB-protected and supervised private \nballot election, at least when they are faced with a decertification \npetition from their members to determine whether the union has majority \nsupport. That was demonstrated once again last month by union \nopposition to a proposed amendment to apply the ``card check'' \nprovisions of the so-called Employee Free Choice Act to decertification \nelections. That amendment was defeated in the House committee's markup.\n  As one court stated with regard to ``card check'' authorization:\n\n       It would be difficult to imagine a more unreliable method \n     of ascertaining the real wishes of employees than a ``card \n     check'' unless it were an employer's request for an open show \n     of hands. The one is no more reliable than the other.\n\n  That is in the NLRB v. Logan Packing Company of the Fourth Circuit.\n  It is hard to believe we are seriously considering a bill to deny \nworkers a private ballot vote so soon after the national elections. It \nis also inconsistent with our Nation's history of promoting private \nballot elections for the disenfranchised members of society through the \nsuffragette and civil rights movements, especially when we are fighting \nfor the opportunity of individuals around the world to have the \ndemocratic right to a private ballot election that is free of \nintimidation and coercion.\n  I am reminded of a statement made on January 31 of this year by my \nlongtime friend and colleague from Massachusetts on the need for fair \nelections:\n\n       For too long, we've ignored the festering problem of \n     deceptive practices intended to intimidate and deceive voters \n     in our national elections. . . .''\n\n  Although I am not able to say this very often, I can say that I am in \nabsolute agreement with my friend on that point. In every election, \nwhether it is for President, local dog catcher, or union organization, \nwe as representatives of the people whom we serve have an obligation to \nensure our constituents' votes will be cast without fear of \nintimidation.\n  I assert--and I think many also would back this up--that a private \nballot election overseen by the NLRB, a\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\nGovernment agency, has a better chance to be more free and fair than \none in which it is left to the union organizers to solicit cards in \nsecret until they receive a majority of 50 plus 1. What happens to the \nother 49 percent? Are they just disenfranchised? The answer is yes.\n  Under the ``card check'' system, there is no inducement to allow \nemployees to make an informed decision, learn all the facts, and hear \narguments for and against unionization.\n  It is difficult for me to believe we would be considering a bill \nwhich would mandate that the Government impose wages, terms, and \nconditions of employment where the parties, new to collective \nbargaining, have not reached agreement after 90 days. This would \ndestroy free collective bargaining and the entire labor law concept of \n``impasse'' when the parties are unable to agree. Under the so-called \nEmployee Free Choice Act, for first contracts, ``impasse'' would be \ndefined as 90 days of bargaining before the Government steps in. Even \nbasic labor law textbooks term compulsory binding arbitration as the \n``antithesis of collective bargaining.''\n  These are radical changes in collective bargaining which have little \nto do with employee free choice. In fact, these amendments would \ndisenfranchise workers by denying them private ballot elections and a \nvote on whether to accept wages, terms, and conditions the Government \narbitration panel would impose on them.\n  Who would benefit from the passage of the so-called Employee Free \nChoice Act? I can tell you. Only unions. They would be virtually \nguaranteed organizing success, increased union membership, and more \nunion dues.\n  As you can see from this chart, over the past 6 years, unions \ntraditionally win approximately 50 to 60 percent of NLRB-supervised \nprivate ballot elections. In contrast, it is reported that ``card \ncheck'' elections yield unions success approximately 80 to 85 percent \nof the time. Who would benefit? I can tell you. Only unions.\n  Look at that chart again. ``Union Win Rates in Elections.'' The NLRB-\nsupervised election, in 2000, the unions won 51 percent; in 2001, the \nunions won 54 percent; in 2002, they won 56 percent; in 2003, they won \n57 percent; in 2004, they won 57 percent; in 2005, they won 61 percent; \nand in 2006, they won 61 percent.\n  Where ``card check'' elections have been held--because the employers \nhave agreed to them, I guess, because they are certainly not law yet; \nthat is why they are bringing this up--80-85 percent have become \nunionized even though 49 percent of the people in those companies have \nhad nothing to say about it. It is not right. It is not the way to go.\n  Unions would be guaranteed first contracts for a period of 2 years \nunder this bill.\n  Looking at the big picture, what would the so-called Employee Free \nChoice Act mean for our economy? Let me read from a recent article \nwritten by Jack and Suzy Welch in the March 12 issue of BusinessWeek \nmagazine. Jack Welch is one of the alltime important business leaders \nin this country. Here is what they had to say:\n\n       We know it must sound strange to oppose legislation that \n     promises something as motherhood-y as ``free choice.'' But \n     the title of this bill is pure propaganda. It won't encourage \n     liberty or self-determination in the workplace; more likely \n     it will introduce intimidation and coercion by labor \n     organizers, who, after a long slide into near-oblivion, \n     finally see a glorious new route to millions of dues-paying \n     members. Their campaign could trigger a surge in unionization \n     across U.S. industry--and in time, a reversion to the bloated \n     economy that brought America to its knees in the late 1970s \n     and early '80s and that today cripples much of European \n     business. If you want to be reminded of what that looks like, \n     drive through Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, as we did last \n     weekend, and take a look at all the shuttered factories. \n     Steel--like coal, autos, and so many other industries in the \n     global economy--paid the inevitable price of unionization run \n     amok.\n        . . . The advance of the Employee Free Choice Act \n     continues unabated. And so pretty soon, if enough business \n     leaders and legislators don't stand up, it may well be: Hello \n     again, unions. So long, American competitiveness. The change \n     will not happen instantly. Companies will fight unions as if \n     their lives depend on it, because they do. But given the \n     logistics of the Employee Free Choice Act, any management \n     campaign is hobbled. If you can't be at the kitchen table \n     with the organizers and their hard stares, you probably can't \n     win.\n\n  He sums it up:\n\n       In those areas where employers have agreed to a ``card \n     check,'' they have invariably become unionized and many \n     employees unionized against their will with the obligation of \n     paying dues.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I assert that this is the start of another \nhistoric Senate debate on national labor policy. It is unfortunate that \nI have to be involved in this because I was raised in the union \nmovement. I am one of the few people who have served in Congress who \nactually earned a union card, who actually became a skilled building \ntradesman, who worked in the building construction trade unions for 10 \nyears. I believe unions are important, but I believe they should have \nto earn their membership and not have it given to them.\n  In conclusion, as we enter this debate, let us not be fooled by the \nmisinformation from the other side.\n  Take a look at this chart. They claim employers coerce employees to \nvote no. The truth is that in less than 2 percent of cases is it found \nthat an employer has inappropriately interfered in a union organizing \nelection.\n  They claim unions can't win elections under the current system. The \ntruth is that unions won 62 percent of NLRB elections in 2005, the last \nyear for which a complete set of statistics exists.\n  They claim American workers want to form unions using a ``card \ncheck'' system. The truth is that, according to a recent poll, 79 \npercent of Americans disagree with the elimination of private ballots \nwhen voting in union organizing elections.\n  The President has issued a Statement of Administration Policy that he \nwould veto the so-called Employee Free Choice Act if it reached his \ndesk. That should not make us complacent in the Senate. Even if a veto \nwere necessary, Senate passage of a bill like that which was passed by \nthe House would put us on record in future Congresses as being against \nprivate ballot elections for workers in union representation decisions, \nin support of Government-imposed wages, benefits, and other terms and \nconditions of employment through union contracts where workers \nthemselves will be denied a ratification vote. Is that where we want to \nbe a year or two from now? I, for one, do not believe we as a nation \nshould head in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to resist any \nattempt to force unionization on the American workforce.\n  To paraphrase the movie ``The Godfather,'' I believe union bosses \nhave made the American workforce a deal they can refuse. We must oppose \nany attempt to pass any iteration of the Employee Free Choice Act, and \nwe must do it on behalf of the American worker.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From Business Week, Mar. 12, 2007]\n\n                          The Unemployment Act\n\n                        (By Jack and Suzy Welch)\n\n       Are you at all concerned about American competitiveness in \n     the future?\n\n                                --Srikanth Raghunathan, Irwin, Pa.\n\n       Yes. But not for the standard ``the sky is falling'' \n     reasons, like the twin deficits, low-cost Chinese \n     manufacturing, or intellectual property piracy. We believe \n     those challenges will largely be ameliorated by market, \n     political, and legal forces. No, we're as worried as can be \n     that American competitiveness is about to be whacked by \n     something no one seems to be talking about: the Employee Free \n     Choice Act, which is currently weaving an insidious path \n     through Congress toward becoming law. If it does, the long-\n     thriving American economy will finally meet its match.\n       You didn't read wrong. We know it must sound strange to \n     oppose legislation that promises something as motherhood-y as \n     ``free choice.'' But the title of this bill is pure \n     propaganda. It won't encourage liberty or self-determination \n     in the workplace; more likely it will introduce intimidation \n     and coercion by labor organizers; who, after a long slide \n     into near-oblivion, finally see a glorious new route to \n     millions of dues-paying members. Their campaign could trigger \n     a surge in unionization across U.S. industry--and in time, a \n     reversion to the bloated economy that brought America to its \n     knees in the late 1970s and early '80s and that today \n     cripples much of European business. If you want to be \n     reminded of what that looks like,\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n     drive through Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, as we did last \n     weekend, and take a look at all the shuttered factories. \n     Steel--like coal, autos, and so many other industries in the \n     global economy--paid the inevitable price of unionization run \n     amok.\n       Make no mistake, We don't unilaterally oppose unions. \n     Indeed, if a company is habitually unfair or unreasonable, it \n     deserves what it gets from organized labor. But the problem \n     with unions is that they make a sport out of killing \n     productivity even when companies are providing good wages, \n     benefits, and working conditions. It is not uncommon in a \n     union shop to shut down production rather than allow a \n     nonunion worker to flip a switch. Only a union or millwright \n     electrician can do that job! Come on. Companies today can't \n     afford such petty bureaucracy or the other excesses unions so \n     often lead to, such as two people for every job and a \n     litigious approach to even the smallest matters. Yes, \n     managers and employees will sometimes disagree. But in the \n     global economy, they have to work through those differences \n     not as adversaries but as partners.\n       The Employee Free Choice Act undermines that. Here's how. \n     Currently, when labor organizers want to launch a \n     unionization effort, they ask each worker to sign a card as a \n     show of support. If 30% or more employees do so, a federally \n     supervised election can be called and conducted with one of \n     the most revered mechanisms in democracy, the secret ballot. \n     Thus, employees can vote their conscience, without fear of \n     retribution from either union leaders or management.\n       By contrast; under the Employee Free Choice Act, organizers \n     could start a union if 50% of employees, plus one more \n     worker, sign cards. That's right--no more secret ballot. \n     Instead, employees would likely get a phone call with a \n     pointed solicitation, or worse, a home visit from a small \n     team of organizers. You can just imagine the scenario. The \n     organizers sit around the kitchen table and make their case, \n     likely with a lot of passion. Then they slide a card in front \n     of the employee with a pen. Who would say no? Who could?\n       Now, union supporters will tell you that they won't \n     intimidate employees for votes, and regardless, management \n     intimidates all the time by threatening to fire employees who \n     vote union. But the system as it exists has safeguards, \n     including heavy fines against companies that misbehave and \n     automatic new elections.\n       Still, the advance of the Employee Free Choice Act \n     continues unabated. And so pretty soon, if enough business \n     leaders and legislators don't stand up, it may well be: Hello \n     again, unions. So long, American competitiveness. The change \n     won't happen instantly. Companies will fight unions as if \n     their lives depend on it, because they do. But given the \n     logistics of the Employee Free Choice Act; any management \n     campaign is hobbled. If you can't be at the kitchen table \n     with the organizers and their hard stares, you probably can't \n     win.\n       It's too bad. In fact, its terrible. And ironic. First, \n     because the ability to unionize already exists in America, \n     thanks to the secret ballot. And second, because the Employee \n     Free Choice Act ultimately only provides a free choice nobody \n     would ever want: how to spend a government issued \n     unemployment check.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3732-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3732-S3735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to speak about \nthe issue of energy and the importance of this Senate and this Congress \nand this country moving forward with an authentic picture with respect \nto energy independence for our country. When I get up in the morning \nand think about the major issues that are facing our country, there are \nthree issues which always come to mind.\n  The first is what is happening in Iraq and around the world and how \nwe restore America's greatness and how we put Humpty Dumpty together \nagain with respect to making sure America's greatness which we have \nenjoyed for the last two centuries is something we enjoy in the 21st \ncentury and beyond.\n  Second are the difficult and important domestic issues which we are \nattempting to confront today--the issue of health care and how we move \nforward to create a system of health insurance and health care \navailability for all the people of America, an issue which continues to \nconfront us.\n  Third, the issue of energy and how we look forward. The issue of \nenergy is something many of us in this Chamber and in the House of \nRepresentatives and the White House today will continue to work on, \nwhich is so important to all of us.\n  With respect to Iraq, we will be facing that issue here in the weeks \nand months ahead. I believe strongly there is unity in the United \nStates of America in terms of our support for our troops. I believe \nthere is a long-term desire for us to make sure what we do is establish \nstability in the Middle East.\n  I believe all of us want to make sure we are doing everything we can \ndo to support our troops. Nonetheless, the debate will occur here on \nthis floor this week and beyond. It is an important debate. It is a \ndebate that involves perhaps the most important issue of our time. That \nis the issue of war and peace and the debate that is certainly \nappropriate to be held on the floor of the Senate.\n  With respect to health care, I am pleased with the efforts the Senate \nFinance Committee and the HELP Committee are undertaking, with the \nleadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Kennedy and others, as we try \nto address the issue of health care. This year for sure we will move \nforward with a program that hopefully will expand the coverage of \nhealth insurance to the children of America. We think about 9 million \nchildren in this country today who have no health insurance. The \nexpansion of the SCHIP program is something that is very important for \nall of these children across our many States who today do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  But the other issue, the energy issue, is one which is winding its \nway through our various committees in the Senate today. In the \nAgriculture Committee, under the leadership of Senator Tom Harkin, we \ncurrently are looking at title 9 of the farm bill. We will have a \nrobust law that will move us forward with a new agenda with respect to \nagriculture and energy.\n  In the Senate Energy Committee, under the leadership of Senators \nBingaman and Domenici, we are working on several bills that will help \nus move forward toward energy independence.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, we have numerous initiatives on the table \nthat will create incentives for us to have the kind of biofuels, solar \nenergy, and the other kinds of energy that will create the new \nenvironment for us to be successful in a program on energy \nindependence.\n  For me, when I think about energy, I see the dawning of a new age for \nmy State of Colorado and also for America. It is a dawning of an age \nfor America which we ought to embrace with vigor. It is the dawning of \nthe age of a clean energy future for the United States of America. One \nyear ago in my State I hosted the first Colorado Renewable Energy \nSummit. At the summit, there were more than 500 of us brought together \nto talk about our national energy policy and the energy opportunities \nwe face in my State.\n  We put renewable energy in the headlines for Colorado, and we have \nkept energy at the top of Colorado's agenda for the past year. This \nlast Saturday, 2 days ago, on March 24, 2007, we again summoned the \npeople of Colorado and we had over 1,000 people who attended a summit \nat the Colorado Convention Center. We were joined in that summit by my \ncolleague Senator Wayne Allard, by Colorado Governor Ritter, the mayor, \nsix Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, the president of the \nColorado Senate, the speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives \nand, as I said, more than 1,000 people in my State who were interested \nin renewable energy and energy efficiency, not only for our State but \nfor the entire country.\n  Because of the work we have taken on in the last year in Colorado, \ntoday we have a Colorado Renewable Energy collaboration. That \nlaboratory is an incredible association with the National Renewable \nEnergy Lab, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University, \nand the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n  Even though the ink is not yet dry on the formation of the \ncollaboration, these four great research institutions have already \nlaunched a world-class research program. It is called the Colorado \nCenter for Bioresearch and Biofuels.\n  Colorado's private sector is moving forward, too, on a variety of \ndifferent fronts. First, with respect to wind, Colorado has added over \n60 megawatts of wind generation in the last 4 years. But consider what \nis on the agenda for 2007. In 2007, my State of Colorado will add \nanother 775 megawatts. That is more than tripling the State's \nproduction of wind generation. That is an equivalent of the generation \nwe get from approximately two full-fledged powerplants.\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\n  Beyond wind, we have embraced solar. Since the passage of a citizens' \ninitiative in Colorado 2 years ago, Colorado's solar industries have \nseen a growth of 40 percent every year. The State's first commercial \nsolar electricity project will be constructed in my native San Luis \nValley in 2007. We moved from wind to solar to biodiesel. In 2004, \nthere was no biodiesel produced in the State of Colorado. Today we have \nthree plants in my State that are producing more than 30 million \ngallons a year, and a fourth plant is ready to start operations in the \nproduction of biodiesel.\n  We go beyond biodiesel to ethanol. Two years ago we had no ethanol \nplants in the State of Colorado. Today we have three ethanol plants \nthat are producing 90 million gallons of ethanol, and we have a fourth \nplant that will come on line in 2007, adding 50 million more gallons \nper year, and several other plants that are in the planning stages.\n  That is not all. In my State of Colorado, we have moved forward with \nwind energy companies, with solar, photovoltaic designers, and \nmanufacturers who are opening facilities in places such as Larimer \nCounty. Cellulosic ethanol companies, which are engaged in research and \ndevelopment, inform us within 2 years they will be at a point where \ncellulosic ethanol will be available in the commercial markets.\n  We have hybrid vehicle manufacturers who are doing the technology \ndevelopment and research in my State, hybrid and plug-in vehicle \nbattery manufacturers, engine efficiency research companies, such as \nGerman manufacturers in El Paso County and Colorado Springs.\n  There is a whole lot more that is happening with respect to clean \nrenewable energy in my State of Colorado. We have a long road ahead of \nus, but we have found our stride and we know the destination. We want \nAmerica to be the world's center for renewable energy research, for \ndevelopment and for production. I want my State to play a significant \nrole as we embrace that agenda.\n  Let's be clear about what is happening with respect to energy in the \nUnited States of America. Some of us need to remind ourselves it was \nnot so long ago when President Nixon and then President Carter later on \nsaid we needed to embrace a new ethic of energy independence. This was \nin the 1970s, some 35, 40, 45 years ago when we were talking about the \nimportance of energy independence, frankly, because of the economics \nthat were driving it at the time. There was great concern with respect \nto the formation of OPEC and with respect to the volatility of markets \nthat could disrupt the American economy.\n\n  We see what happened in response to the leadership in the 1970s where \nthere were great investments made in technologies that would look at \nalternative fuels that would power our homes and cars in this country. \nBut the driver of economics went away when the price of oil dropped to \naround $20, $21, $22, $23 per barrel. Over this last year, we saw the \nprice of oil get up to $60 and $70 per barrel, and we saw the price of \na gallon come up to $3 a gallon, in some places more than $3.50, $3.60 \na gallon, the price of diesel following the same path. It became \napparent at the time the economic driver was not the only significant \ndriver here.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire as to the amount of time we have in \nmorning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We have 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. May I inquire of my friend from West Virginia as to \nwhether he planned on using any of the time in morning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do have an amendment, and I will speak to \nthat amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator from West Virginia \ndoes have not objection, we will allow the Senator from Colorado to \nfinish his remarks, and then we will recognize the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, so I am clear on my time, I have about 7 \nminutes in morning business allocated to me under the current order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me continue with respect to the \ncomments I was making concerning the issue of energy.\n  If you think about the 1970s and the 1980s, it was the economy that \nwas at the root of what we were trying to do to develop solar energy \nand wind energy and looking at biofuels and the like. A lot has changed \nin those times. There is tremendous interest and a tremendous amount of \nenergy being spent in each of our committees here in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives and in the White House and the Department of \nEnergy on a clean energy future for America.\n  Some people will ask the question today: Well, is this another short-\nlived agenda in the same way it was in the 1970s and the 1980s? When \nyou look at the charts and you see what we were investing in clean \nenergy technology back in the 1970s and 1980s, it was significantly \nhigher than what we are investing in the 1980s and the 1990s and the \nearly 2000s.\n  I submit that things have changed because the drivers today are not \nonly the economic drivers of our time. Today when we look at the energy \nissues we face in our world, it is not just about the volatility of the \nenergy markets we see around the world and here in the United States, \nthere are two other drivers that are equally as important. The first of \nthose drivers has to be our national security. When you think about the \nfact that today we are importing about 60 percent of our oil from \nforeign countries, in the next 10 to 15 years, if projections continue \nthe way they are, and growth continues the way it is expected to \ncontinue, we will be importing 70 percent of our oil from foreign \ncountries.\n  If that occurs, then we will continue to compromise the foreign \npolicy, the national security of this Nation in a manner none of us \nshould ever allow to happen. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty \nfor this Congress, for the Senate, and for this country to allow that \nto happen.\n  In the latest skirmish with Israel and Lebanon, one has to ask the \nquestion about where that money was coming from that was funding the \nmilitia group of Hezbollah in its firing of nearly 10,000 rockets into \nthe northern city of Haifa in northern Israel. One has to ask that \nquestion, where was the money coming from that would fund the 10,000 \nmembers of that militia group called Hezbollah in Lebanon and other \nplaces around the world?\n  Well, we do not need to look very far for the answer to that \nquestion. You and I know--you as the Presiding Officer are well aware \nof the security interests here in our country--very well that the money \ncreating and funding the terrorist groups in places such as Lebanon is \ncoming from oil. It is coming from oil we are paying $60 and $70 a \nbarrel for today.\n  So the very national security of our country requires us, it demands \nof us, and we can do no less than to move forward with an agenda that \ngrasps the imperative of energy independence in our world. That energy \nindependence will come about with great opportunities as we look at a \nclean energy future for America. We will be able to derive jobs and \ncreate the kind of national economic security we need in the United \nStates of America.\n  The final driver is the issue of global warming. The debate is about \nwhether global warming is an issue that needs to be confronted in the \nUnited States of America, the debate that was being held several years \nago. But I would imagine most people in the United States of America \ntoday are saying it is important for us to confront this issue.\n  In fact, as we are opening this day in the Senate, Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Domenici are holding a hearing with members of the European \nUnion on the issue of global warming. Things have changed. Things have \nchanged from the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s when America slept, \nand the only factor that was driving us to energy independence was the \nvolatility of the markets.\n  Today the driver is national security. We cannot afford to compromise \nour national security by continuing to be overdependent, by continuing \nour current addiction to foreign oil. We cannot afford to ignore the \nissue of global warming that threatens the future of civilization. How \nwe approach those issues and how we develop solutions that bring us to \na positive movement forward is very important.\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\n  The issue of energy is one that can bring America together. To be \nsure, the last 6 years have seen a divided America on many issues, \nincluding Iraq. Energy can bring together Democrats and Republicans, \nprogressives and conservatives, much as the Energy Futures Coalition \nhas done in working with all of us. We crafted legislation that we call \nSet America Free. It is my hope that by the time the Senate finishes \nfor the year or before we begin the August recess, we will have \nlegislation that is bipartisan in nature, that will move us forward \nwith a new energy future for America. That energy future will be one \nthat is bound by a vision of a clean energy future that includes \nrenewable energies, new technologies, and that goes after the low-\nhanging fruit of energy efficiency and addresses the issue of global \nwarming.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a portion of a speech I gave at an \nenergy summit in Colorado be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Colorado New Energy Summit--2007\n\n       This is the dawning of a new age for Colorado and America--\n     this is the dawning of the age of America's clean energy \n     future!\n       One year ago, we hosted the first Colorado renewable energy \n     summit. That 2006 Summit brought more than 500 of us together \n     to talk about our national energy policy and Colorado's \n     energy opportunities. We put renewable energy in the \n     headlines for Colorado, and we've kept energy at the top of \n     Colorado's agenda for the past year.\n       This Saturday, March 24, 2007, over one thousand people \n     from Colorado joined us for Colorado's New Energy Summit. We \n     were joined by two United States Senators, the Colorado \n     Governor, the Mayor of Denver, six Members of the U.S. House \n     of Representatives, the President of the Colorado Senate, the \n     Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives . . . and \n     more than one thousand Coloradans who want more renewable \n     energy, improved energy efficiency, and greater energy \n     independence.\n       One year ago, we talked about attracting more energy \n     research projects and more energy entrepreneurs to Colorado. \n     Today, we have the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory, \n     an incredible association of the National Renewable Energy \n     Lab, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University \n     and the University of Colorado at Boulder. And even though \n     the ink is not yet dry on the Collaboratory Agreement, these \n     four great research institutions have already launched a \n     world class research program: the Colorado Center for \n     Biorefining and Biofuels--C2B2.\n       And Colorado's private clean energy sector is taking off, \n     too.\n     Wind\n       Colorado has added 60 megawatts of wind capacity in the \n     last two years.\n       And by the end of 2007, we will add another 775 megawatts, \n     more than tripling the State's production of wind power to \n     more than 1,000 megawatts.\n     Solar\n       Since the passage of Amendment 37, Colorado's solar rooftop \n     industries have seen growth of 40% per year.\n       And the State's first commercial solar electricity project \n     will be constructed in the San Luis Valley in 2007.\n     Biodiesel\n       In 2004, there was no biodiesel produced in Colorado.\n       Today, we have three plants producing more than 30 million \n     gallons a year, and a fourth plant ready to start operations.\n     Ethanol\n       Two years ago, there were no ethanol plants in Colorado.\n       Today, three plants produce more than 90 million gallons \n     per year, and a fourth plant will come on line in 2007, \n     adding another 50 million gallons per year.\n       And that's not all. We have locally based:\n       Wind energy companies\n       Solar photovoltaic designers and manufacturers\n       Cellulosic ethanol companies, engaged in R and preparing \n     to build biorefineries\n       Hybrid vehicle manufacturers\n       Hybrid and plug-in vehicle battery manufacturers\n       Engine efficiency research companies\n       And that's only the beginning.\n       Colorado's clean, renewable energy economy is on the move.\n       We have got a long road ahead of us, but we have found our \n     stride and we know our destination: Colorado will be the \n     world's center for renewable energy research, development and \n     production.\n\n\n                      america's energy challenges\n\n       We have come a long way in the past year, and we should be \n     proud, but we must be realistic about the energy challenges \n     that face us as a Nation and world.\n\n\n                    energy security and independence\n\n       First, energy policy is at the heart of our national \n     security. The United States continues to import much more oil \n     than we produce. Nearly two-thirds of our oil supplies come \n     from abroad. And much of that oil, comes from unstable and \n     even politically hostile regions. Our deep dependence on \n     foreign oil means that our national security is constantly at \n     risk. Our oil supply lines are long and fragile. Even worse, \n     our dependence on foreign oil means that we're sending \n     hundreds of billions of dollars overseas, much of which flows \n     to regimes that are hostile or corrupt or both. Indeed, we \n     are funding the very regimes that threaten our interests. It \n     is foolish to think we can control our Nation's security if \n     we can't control our energy lifelines.\n       It may be decades before we get the majority of liquid \n     transportation fuels from renewable sources, but that doesn't \n     mean renewables can't make a significant difference \n     immediately. We produced nearly five billion gallons of \n     ethanol in 2006, biodiesel is on the rise and cellulosic \n     biofuels will be in commercial production by 2009. We can \n     also look to other current or emerging technologies--hybrids \n     and plug-in electrics--to reduce our thirst for oil.\n       There are a lot of good reasons to turn to renewable \n     energy, but I start with this one: the most effective step to \n     increase our national security in the twenty-first century is \n     to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n\n                   Energy and Economic Sustainability\n\n       The second energy challenge that we face is economic. We're \n     not going to run out of oil any time soon, but we're going to \n     run out of cheap oil. Oil from new reserves and alternative \n     sources, like the deep Gulf of Mexico reserves and Canadian \n     tar sands, will cost much more to find, to extract and to \n     refine. On top of increased costs, we are going to see \n     increasing competition from the rapidly growing economies qf \n     China and India and other developing nations. That means \n     demand pressures on top of supply pressures.\n       And it is not just our cars and trucks that run on oil--\n     much of our current economy depends on oil and natural gas. \n     We heat with it, we produce lubricants and fertilizers and \n     commercial chemicals with it, and we make plastics and fibers \n     and construction materials from it. The economic \n     competitiveness of our economy will be determined in \n     substantial part by how we cope with increasing energy costs. \n     In coming decades, those economies that develop reliable, \n     affordable sources of energy will thrive. Those economies \n     that remain dependent on imported oil and gas will suffer.\n       But, there is also an economic opportunity. There is money \n     to be made in creating new energy technologies, and there is \n     money to be made in using them. America has led the world in \n     developing renewable energy technologies, but we have lost \n     much of our advantage because other nations have been much \n     better at implementing those technologies. Solar energy, wind \n     energy, biofuels--most of these technologies were originally \n     developed here, but other nations have surpassed us in \n     manufacturing or implementing these technologies. We should \n     admire the Japanese and the Germans for their solar \n     photovoltaics, the Israelis for concentrating on solar power, \n     the Danes and Germans for their advances in wind technology, \n     and the Brazilians for their ethanol, but there is no reason \n     for us to import their technology when we can manufacture \n     this equipment right here in America.\n\n\n                        Energy and Rural America\n\n       I believe our economic future depends on our ability to \n     create the energy technologies of tomorrow.\n       Nowhere is this more true than in rural America. With the \n     advent of new energy technologies--including biofuels, wind \n     and solar--rural America can become not only our food basket, \n     but also our energy basket. At a time when we have record \n     trade deficits and much of rural America is struggling \n     economically, we should be investing in renewable energy from \n     our farms and ranches instead of importing foreign oil.\n       And let me point out that all our energy does not have to \n     come from 500 megawatt electric power plants or 100 million \n     gallon a year ethanol plants. Big centralized plants will \n     always have their place, but much of our energy can come from \n     smaller production plants, whether it's a small wind farm or \n     a community-owned biodiesel plant. Distributed generation of \n     electricity and biofuels will play a major role in our energy \n     future, and much of that energy production will benefit rural \n     America, both by creating new sources of income and by \n     reducing the cost of locally produced and locally used \n     energy.\n\n\n                             global warming\n\n       The two drivers of national security and economic \n     challenges and opportunities drive us toward a renewable \n     energy and energy efficiency future. But there is a third \n     driver, just as compelling: global warming. Average \n     temperatures are rising, glaciers and sea ice are melting, \n     and the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that our \n     use of fossil fuels is a significant part of the problem.\n       There is no single solution to this crisis, no silver \n     bullet. But there are lots of options that will contribute to \n     a solution, including technologies and investments that \n     increase energy efficiency and conservation. Currently \n     available technologies, like fuel-efficient cars and compact \n     fluorescent light bulbs, reduce energy consumption. Biofuels \n     replace billions of gallons of gasoline and diesel, and \n     biofuels reduce the net amount of greenhouse gas emissions \n     because next year's crop will capture the emissions from this \n     year's fuels. Once installed, solar and wind technologies \n     produce electricity without generating any carbon dioxide.\n       And new technologies may enable us to use some fossil fuels \n     without contributing to\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\n     global warming. IGCC--integrated gasification combined \n     cycle--power plants, for example, may allow us to capture the \n     carbon dioxide in coal before it is released to the \n     atmosphere, so that the CO2 can be used or can be \n     sequestered deep underground.\n       With creativity and commitment, there are many actions that \n     we can take that will substantially reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions and help to turn the tide of global warming.\n       Countless generations of human beings have in my State \n     enjoyed this beautiful planet. But it is not certain that our \n     grandchildren and great grandchildren will be able to enjoy \n     snowcapped peaks, mountain streams, Colorado skiing, lush \n     green forests and fields of grain. If we want them to see and \n     enjoy Colorado's beauty and enjoy our State's natural \n     resources, then we need to act--now. And what is true for \n     Colorado is true for the Nation. Those of us who walk the \n     Earth today are not solely responsible for the fact of global \n     warming--the roots of this crisis go back to the Industrial \n     Revolution--but it falls to us to do something about it. We \n     must not fail.\n       The three great energy challenges that confront us at the \n     dawn of the 21st century are daunting--national security, \n     economic sustainability and the future of our planet. But we \n     know we can and will confront these challenges. And part of \n     the solution to each of these challenges lies in renewable \n     energy and efficiency and other clean energy technologies. \n     For the past 25 years, America has lacked the consistent \n     political leadership and public commitment to pursue these \n     new technologies, but their time has come and today we can \n     unite America in the spirit of bipartisanship to confront \n     these challenges.\n\n\n                       State and local leadership\n\n       Much of the leadership in the areas of renewable energy and \n     energy efficiency has come from local and state efforts. In \n     November, 2004, the people of Colorado were the first in the \n     Nation to enact a renewable energy standard by popular vote \n     with the adoption of Amendment 37. Our General Assembly and \n     our new Governor have taken up the baton and carried it \n     forward with exciting new programs that will expand wind and \n     solar power in Colorado. Other states have done the same.\n\n\n                      Energy in the 110th Congress\n\n       So I applaud and encourage this kind of state and local \n     leadership, but the ultimate success of our new energy policy \n     and our new energy economy will also require national \n     leadership in this 110th Congress.\n       I am proud to be a sponsor, with Senator Chuck Grassley, of \n     Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 to adopt 25 25 as a national \n     goal. Many of you know about this initiative. The goal is to \n     produce 25% of our total energy needs from our farms, ranches \n     and forests by the year 2025. Independent studies confirm we \n     can achieve that goal. 25 25 makes economic sense. Achieving \n     this goal will yield over 700 billion dollars in economic \n     activity and create more than 4 million new jobs. A \n     combination of energy conservation, energy efficiency and \n     renewable energy can get us to our goal. We should establish \n     the 25 25 resolution this Congress.\n       As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am also \n     working on the 2007 Farm Bill with Senator Tom Harkin and my \n     colleagues on that Committee. This new Farm Bill will include \n     an expanded Energy Title that will create new programs and \n     build upon existing programs to make the goal of 25 25 \n     achievable. Just two weeks ago, Senator Harkin, Chairman of \n     the Agriculture Committee, traveled to Colorado for two \n     purposes: to visit NREL and to hold a Committee hearing on \n     the Farm Bill. Senator Harkin and I agree that good farm \n     policy means good energy policy in this new world.\n       I am also enthused by Senator Max Baucus and my colleagues \n     on the Finance Committee as we do our part to address the \n     energy challenges of our time. I have introduced a series of \n     bills that will help us I produce more renewable energy, \n     adopt more energy efficient technologies and combat global \n     warming.\n       Senate Bill 672 is the Rural Community Energy Bonds Act. I \n     support our big wind farms, but we need a lot of small wind \n     farms, too, and we need a lot of small biomass and solar and \n     other renewable energy projects. This bill will allow small \n     renewable energy projects with at least 49 percent local \n     ownership to qualify for tax-exempt bonds. That will make it \n     easier for locally and community owned renewable energy \n     projects in rural and small town America to find investors. \n     And local ownership means that more of the profits from those \n     projects will stay on Main Street in Colorado's small towns.\n       I have also introduced the Rural Wind Energy Development \n     Act, Senate Bill 673. This bill will create a tax credit for \n     every residential wind turbine installed and will also allow \n     for accelerated depreciation on those turbines. For turbines \n     under 100 kilowatts, there's a tax credit of $1,500 for each \n     half-kilowatt of generating capacity. As I said earlier, we \n     need more distributed generation, and this bill will help us \n     develop it.\n       I am also working on several other bills to encourage \n     renewable energy production and energy efficiency \n     investments. The Securing America's Energy Independence Act \n     will extend the energy tax credit for solar technologies and \n     for residential energy efficiency improvements through 2016. \n     If we want manufacturers to build these technologies and we \n     want homeowners to buy them, we need to create reliable \n     incentives that encourage planning and investment.\n       I am also proud to co-sponsor the DRIVE Act with Senator \n     Bingaman and nearly 30 co-sponsors, with equal numbers of \n     Republicans and Democrats. The Drive Act stands for \n     Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and \n     Energy. This bill, Senate Bill 339, and other related \n     legislation, will reduce oil consumption by 25% by 2025, \n     impose Federal fleet conservation requirements, support \n     research on electric vehicles, require the Federal government \n     to purchase 15% of its electricity from renewable sources by \n     2015, and would phase-out incandescent light bulbs in favor \n     of more energy efficient technologies. I am hopeful that this \n     bill will pass in this Congress.\n       I'm also working with other members of the Senate Energy \n     and Natural Resources Committee to draft a bill to require \n     the use of 30 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2020, to \n     increase the funding for bioenergy research and development, \n     and to offer financial support for renewable fuel production \n     facilities, including cellulosic biofuel plants and \n     biorefineries.\n       We should all recognize that we are going to be dependent \n     on fossil fuels for a significant portion of our energy for \n     the next several decades, so I'm sponsoring legislation to \n     conduct a national assessment of our carbon sequestration \n     capacity. As we continue to burn fossil fuels, we must find a \n     way to reduce the volume of carbon dioxide released into the \n     atmosphere. IGCC technology can achieve its promise only if \n     we can effectively sequester the carbon dioxide that's \n     captured.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Together, the 110th Congress can lead our State and our \n     Nation to a new energy future.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 641.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today we take up a supplemental bill to \nfund our troops in the field, to send a strong message about the \ndirection of the war in Iraq, to improve the veterans and defense \nhealth care system, to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina rebuild, \nto secure the homeland, and to provide emergency relief to farmers \nimpacted by major drought and freezes. We are now in the fifth year--\nthe fifth year--of the war, this terrible war.\n  I was against it. I voted against it. We are there. We are now in the \nfifth year of the war in Iraq. The debate about the war has \ndeteriorated into a series of buzz words--preemptive war, mission \naccomplished, exaggerated intelligence, inadequate body armor, and \nsurges--and on and on. Our job in the Senate is not to look backward \nbut to look forward.\n  The Constitution clearly gives the Congress the power--yes, it does; \nit clearly gives the Congress, us, the power--to decide when this \nNation should go to war, and it gives Congress the power of the purse, \nmoney. Money talks. Funding such conflicts is the responsibility of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nThe buck stops here, and don't you ever forget it, the\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee. Because of that power over the purse, \nit is certainly our duty to debate the future of the war in Iraq.\n  The bill before the Senate includes a provision that would give the \nwar a new direction, and it points the way out--out, out--of the civil \nwar in Iraq. There is no restriction on funding for the troops--no \nrestriction on funding for the troops. We fully fund the needs of the \ntroops. We do that, yes. In fact, the bill provides more funds than the \nPresident requested for the Department of Defense, with an increase of \n$1.3 billion for the defense health care system, $1 billion for \nequipping the Guard and Reserve, and $1.1 billion for military housing.\n  The language in the bill narrows the mission of our troops in Iraq, \nkeeps pressure on the Iraqi Government to meet benchmarks on national \nreconciliation, requires the President--yes, hear me now; requires the \nPresident--to send Congress a phased redeployment plan. It sets a goal \nfor the redeployment of most of the U.S. troops from Iraq by March 31, \n2008.\n  This country was not attacked by Iraq on 9/11. There was not a single \nIraqi, not one, involved in the devastation in New York, Washington, \nand Pennsylvania on that fateful day. According to our own Government, \nthe perpetrators of 9/11, Osama bin Laden and his organization, are \nalive today and rebuilding in Afghanistan and Pakistan at this moment, \nas I speak, so help me God. Language in this bill would allow the \nPresident to refocus our military and our intelligence on the \nterrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11.\n  During the debate on this bill, assertions will be made, yes, that it \nis inappropriate to add to this bill funding to meet domestic needs. In \nfact, the White House has claimed that efforts to add funding for our \nveterans, for Katrina victims, and for homeland security will hold \nhostage the funds for the troops. What nonsense--hear me--nonsense. \nJust more buzzwords.\n  In fact, funding for the war is not the only critical need worthy of \nsupplemental funding this year. The war must not obliterate every other \nconcern. Last week, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Rob Portman, said the President would veto the bill if the Iraq \nlanguage and additional spending remain in the bill. He said:\n\n       We're disappointed the Senate is allowing politics--\n\n  humbug--\n\n     to interfere with getting needed resources to our troops.\n\n  Politics? Politics? I ask the Senate, is it politics to ensure that \nthe VA has a health care system that can provide first-rate care for \nthe wounded? Is it? No. It is a moral imperative--yes, a moral \nimperative.\n  Is it politics to provide critical resources to help the gulf region \nrebuild after Hurricane Katrina? Is it? Is it politics? No, it is not \npolitics. It is compassion--compassion.\n  Is it politics to help rural America recover from drought and freeze? \nIs it? No. It is common sense, do you hear me, common sense and good \neconomics.\n  This bill meets some of the most urgent needs of our country. It \nincludes $1.7 billion to ensure that the VA has the resources it needs \nto help the brave men and women wounded in the war. The VA needs \nresources in order to provide first-rate care to profoundly wounded, \nterribly wounded, horribly wounded soldiers. We are morally bound--hear \nme; yes, we are morally bound, aren't we, to care for our wounded \ntroops. This is not politics. No. Shame. This is not politics; it is \ncommon decency.\n  This bill also includes $3.3 billion above the administration's \nrequest for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The \nPresident proposes to pay for the increased costs of repairing the \nexisting levees in Louisiana by cutting the funding that Congress \nprovided to improve the capacity of the levees to protect New Orleans \nfrom future hurricanes. Shame. That makes no sense.\n  The bill provides new resources to repair the levees. We will not \nfollow a nonsensical strategy of repairing the existing levee system \nthat failed during Katrina by cutting funding already appropriated for \nactual improvements to the levee system. We will not. We also include \nfunding for health and education, for law enforcement, and for transit \nsystems in the gulf region to help rebuild, to bring people back to \nwork, and to bring the region back to life. Not politics, just plain \nold common sense.\n  The bill includes $4.2 billion for agricultural disaster relief. The \nagricultural economy has been hit with drought and freezes. In 2006, 69 \npercent of all counties in the United States were declared primary or \ncontiguous disaster areas. Fourteen States had 100 percent of their \ncounties declared disaster areas by the Department of Agriculture.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan and Senator Feinstein and Senator Bond for \ntheir hard work on this disaster package.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger requesting agricultural \ndisaster assistance be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Byrd, Senator McConnell \n     and Senator Cochran: As you prepare to begin work on the \n     Emergency Supplemental to fund vital government programs, I \n     implore you to include the Emergency Farm Assistance Act of \n     2007. The Farm Assistance Act provides much needed relief to \n     California's multi-billion dollar agricultural industry, \n     which has suffered devastating losses due to the recent \n     record setting freeze, as well as the extreme heat wave in \n     2006 and flooding in 2005.\n       As you know, on January 11, 2007, an arctic air mass moved \n     into the state and extreme cold air conditions pushed \n     nighttime temperatures to record and near record lows \n     throughout the state for the next 8-10 days. These extreme \n     weather conditions had a devastating impact on California's \n     agricultural industry, exacting catastrophic losses on our \n     citrus, avocado, vegetable and strawberry crops. Agriculture \n     plays a central role in our local economies, and as a result \n     of the freeze, many farm communities and related businesses \n     have suffered massive losses. To provide immediate relief, I \n     directed state agencies to make state facilities available to \n     local agencies for use as warming centers. We also contacted \n     agricultural associations to ensure that growers were aware \n     of cold weather, so that appropriate protective actions could \n     be taken.\n       In response to these dire events, I directed the execution \n     of the State Emergency Plan. In accordance with Section 401 \n     of the Stafford Act, on January 12, 2007, I proclaimed a \n     state of emergency for all 58 California counties. I also \n     issued additional proclamations to specifically address the \n     impacts of the freeze on the agricultural industry, small \n     businesses and individuals in an effort to expedite federal \n     assistance to the counties that were hardest hit. I have \n     since requested that the President declare a major disaster \n     for 31 California counties.\n       In spite of these significant efforts to protect crops, \n     agricultural communities in California have sustained \n     substantial crop losses and unknown long-term tree damage in \n     excess of $1.14 billion. With the loss of a major portion of \n     our agricultural crop, thousands of farmworkers and their \n     families in impacted counties have been displaced due to job \n     loss and loss of income. Despite the assistance farmers and \n     ranchers are now receiving through the United States \n     Department of Agriculture and the Small Business \n     Administration, more aid is needed. It is clear that the full \n     impact of this disaster wi11 be ongoing and systemic.\n       The California Delegation has played a critical role in the \n     development of the Farm Assistance Act. I applaud their \n     bipartisan work to provide crucial assistance to our farmers \n     and ranchers in need. To that end, I strongly support the \n     Farm Assistance Act and its inclusion in the Emergency \n     Supplemental. The unfolding crisis in our agricultural \n     communities requires swift assistance and attention. \n     California agriculture literally feeds the nation, and I urge \n     you to include the Emergency Farm Assistance Act of 2007 as \n     part of the Emergency Supplemental.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Providing agricultural disaster relief is not politics, no. \nIt is good policy.\n  The bill that is before the Senate also includes $2 billion for \nsecuring the homeland. In the State of the Union, the President said:\n\n       The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at \n     work in the world. And so long as that's the case, America is \n     still a nation at war.\n\n  Despite hundreds of innocent people being killed in train bombings in \nLondon, Madrid, Moscow, Tokyo, and Mombai, India, and despite the \naviation sector remaining at a high terrorist threat level since \nAugust, the President did not request one extra dime--not one thin \ndime--in the supplemental for securing the homeland. This bill includes \nfunding for purchasing explosive detection systems for our airports, \nfor grants to help secure our rail and transit systems, and for \nsecuring our ports and borders. The money is needed now.\n  For 5\\1/2\\ years, since the attack on 9/11, this administration has \nraised fears of another terrorist attack. The administration has \nannounced a high, or orange, threat level for possible terrorist \nattacks on eight different occasions. In every State of the Union \nAddress, the President has stoked the fires of fear. Periodically, the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the FBI \nDirector helped to fan those flames. Yet the President consistently \nsends to Congress budgets for homeland security that do not reflect \nthis perceived threat. Rather than spreading fear, the administration \nshould be reducing vulnerabilities by doing everything it can to deter \nanother attack. Providing funding to secure the homeland is not \npolitics; it is an essential duty.\n  The President's ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach to funding \ndomestic agencies has real and demonstrably severe consequences. The \nfailed response to Hurricane Katrina proved that. The inability to \nprovide first-class health care to our wounded veterans proved that. \nBut we never learn.\n  Another important aspect of this bill is in the oversight and \naccountability that it mandates. For far too long--far too long--\noversight has been a lost cause, yes, around this Congress. Tough \nquestions are ditched in favor of softballs. Honest answers are buried \nin political spin. This legislation says ``no more.'' Real oversight is \nback, and it will not be denied. This legislation makes major \ninvestments in inspectors general, from the Special Inspector General \nfor Iraq Reconstruction to inspectors general for the Department of \nState, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice. Let's \nhope we can begin to get the waste, fraud, and abuse in Government \nunder control. The legislation presses forward with GAO audits of the \nuse of these dollars as we try to put an end to the contractors' \nbonanza of big dollars free from the prying eyes of Congress or the \npublic. Insisting that U.S. tax dollars are wisely spent is not \npolitics. What is it? It is our duty. Hear me. It is our duty.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee has made careful choices. The White \nHouse assertion that spending in this bill is excessive or extraneous \nor political--humbug. It simply has no foundation. The committee has \nchosen to provide first-rate care to the war wounded, to provide \nresources to help the gulf region rebuild after Katrina, to improve \nhomeland security, and to provide agricultural disaster assistance. \nThis is a good bill. I urge prompt action on this legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this appropriations bill reported by \nour Committee on Appropriations responds to the President's request for \nsupplemental funding for the Department of Defense and other \ndepartments and agencies. The bill provides $121.6 billion in emergency \nspending. Of this amount, $102.48 billion is provided to support Iraqi \nsecurity forces to continue operations in Afghanistan and to wage the \nglobal war on terrorism. In testimony before our Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense, we were told this funding is needed by the end \nof April.\n  I am disappointed the bill contains language that sets forth a \ntimetable for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The language amounts \nto a restatement of S.J. Res. 9, which a majority of Senators voted \nagainst, 50 to 48, on March 15. The Senate has spoken on this issue. \nInclusion of this language as reported by the Appropriations Committee \nlast week will only slow down the bill and invite a Presidential veto. \nWe need to approve the funding now. Unnecessarily extending this debate \nis not going to serve the national interests. I will offer an amendment \nto strike this language from the bill.\n  In this bill, the Appropriations Committee also approved $14.8 \nbillion for additional emergencies, including $7.9 billion for \ncontinuing the recovery from Hurricane Katrina. The affected States are \nmaking good progress, slow but steady and sure. But additional Federal \nresources are needed. The bill also includes $1.7 billion for veterans \nhealth care facilities, which signals the committee's continuing \ninterest in ensuring that our veterans receive the quality care they \ndeserve.\n  I applaud the chairman's goal, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, of completing work on the bill this week. I am concerned, \nhowever, that the bill is almost $19 billion above the President's \nrequest. We need to be sure this spending is necessary and responsible. \nI look forward to working with my good friend from West Virginia to \nensure that this is the case. It is imperative that we provide funding \nto our troops promptly, and it will remain my goal to put a bill on the \nPresident's desk that he can sign.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 643 to Amendment No. 641\n\n  Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Craig, Mr. Allard, \n     Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 643 \n     to amendment No. 641.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 643\n\n(Purpose: To strike language that would tie the hands of the Commander-\nin-Chief by imposing an arbitrary timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. \n forces from Iraq, thereby undermining the position of American Armed \n Forces and jeopardizing the successful conclusion of Operation Iraqi \n                                Freedom)\n\n       On page 24, strike line 16 and all that follows through \n     page 26, line 24 and insert:\n\n     ``SEC. 1315. BENCHMARKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ.--''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this is an amendment to the committee \nsubstitute which is now at the desk. The amendment will strike part of \nsection 1315 of the bill titled ``Revision of United States Policy on \nIraq.'' The majority of section 1315 of this act is a restatement of \nS.J. Res. 9, the United States Policy in Iraq Resolution of 2007.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate voted against adopting S.J. Res. 9 by a \nvote of 50 to 48. Section 1315 calls for a prompt transition of the \nmission in Iraq to a limited mission; a phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces from Iraq within 120 days of enactment of this act; a goal of \nredeployment of all U.S. combat forces from Iraq by March 31, 2008, \nexcept for a limited number essential for protecting U.S. and coalition \npersonnel and infrastructure, training, and equipping Iraqi forces, and \nconducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  Section 1315 also calls for a classified campaign plan for Iraq, \nincluding benchmarks and projected redeployment dates of U.S. forces \nfrom Iraq. Finally, it also includes an expression of the sense of \nCongress concerning benchmarks for the Government of Iraq, along with a \nreporting requirement by the commander, multinational forces, Iraq, \nwhich is currently General Petraeus, to detail the progress being made \nby the Iraqi Government on the benchmarks contained in this section.\n  This amendment does not remove the sense-of-the-Congress provision \nthat is important to a number of Senators. I think all Senators share \nan earnest desire that the Iraqi Government move aggressively to \nundertake the measures necessary to ensure a stable and\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nfree Iraq. The language to be removed by my amendment is essentially a \nrestatement of S.J. Res. 9, which, as I said, on March 15 Senators \ndefeated by a vote of 50 to 48.\n  Before announcing his new plan in Iraq, the President sought input \nfrom his top military and civilian advisers, along with Members of \nCongress, foreign leaders, and other military and foreign policy \nexperts. He acknowledged there was no easy solution to the situation in \nIraq and the Middle East, and he determined a temporary deployment of \nadditional U.S. troops in Iraq to support Iraqi security forces would \nprovide a new window of opportunity for Iraqi political and economic \ninitiatives to take hold and reduce sectarian violence. This plan \nprovides the best hope to bring stability to the country and to hasten \nthe day when our troops will come home.\n  Earlier this year the National Intelligence Estimate entitled \n``Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A Challenging Road Ahead,'' was \ndelivered to the Congress. The National Intelligence Estimate \nindicated--and I am quoting now from an unclassified version:\n\n       Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources, \n     and operations, remain an essential stabilizing element in \n     Iraq. If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the \n     term of this Estimate--\n\n  Which is 12 to 18 months--\n\n     we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a \n     significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian \n     conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi \n     government, and have adverse consequences for national \n     reconciliation.\n       If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge \n     that the Iraqi security forces would be unlikely to survive \n     as a nonsectarian national institution; neighboring \n     countries--invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally--might \n     intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties \n     and forced population displacement would be probable; Al-\n     Qaida in Iraq would attempt to use parts of the country--\n     particularly al Anbar province--to plan increased attacks in \n     and outside of Iraq; and spiraling violence and political \n     disarray in Iraq, along with Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk \n     and strengthen autonomy, could prompt Turkey to launch a \n     military incursion.\n\n  It is clear to me that it is in our national interests to support the \nPresident's new strategy, to help provide an opportunity for political \nand economic solutions in Iraq, and for more effective diplomatic \nefforts in the Middle East region. Of course, we know there are no \nguarantees of success, but according to the National Intelligence \nEstimate and the perspective of some of our most experienced foreign \npolicy experts, maintaining the current course or withdrawal without \nadditional stability in Iraq will be harmful to our national interests \nand to the entire region.\n  We need to do what we can to help stabilize this situation and bring \nour troops home. As a beginning point, for this strategy to work, we \nshould show a commitment to success. I support the new initiative and \nurge the Senate to give it a chance to work. This does not mean we \nshould not monitor the situation or that the plan should not be \nadjusted as new developments occur, but we need to let the forces move \nforward to brighten the prospects of stabilizing Iraq and bringing our \ntroops home.\n  As Commander in Chief, the President needs our support. I support his \nefforts and the efforts of our troops. The Senate should provide the \nresources necessary to accomplish this mission, and these funds are \nincluded in this bill. Troop levels and missions need to be left to \nGeneral Petraeus and his commanders who ought to have the flexibility \nto react to the situation on the ground in determining how to deploy \ntroops as needed. Congress should not be tying the hands of our \ncommanders or limiting their flexibility to respond to the threats on \nthe battlefield.\n  The inclusion of unnecessarily restrictive language will ensure a \nPresidential veto, we are advised. In testimony before the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense, we were told that the funding \nprovided by this bill is needed by the end of April. We need to speed \nthis funding to our troops, rather than slow it down by returning to a \ndebate already settled by the Senate by a recorded vote.\n  Madam President, I urge the support of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I expect that a number of Senators will \nwant to debate the Iraq amendment tomorrow. I look forward to a good \ndebate on this matter.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to speak to the amendment that was \nlaid down by Senator Cochran from Mississippi, an amendment to strike \nlanguage from the bill that is pending before us, language that would \ninhibit the ability of our commanders on the ground to carry out the \nmessage we have asked them to perform in Iraq.\n  As we are all aware, this security supplemental is designed to \nprovide money for the conduct of our operations in Afghanistan and \nIraq. There is a timetable here. The commanders have said they need, by \nApril 15, the beginning part of this funding so they can carry out the \nmissions we have asked them to perform. When I was there about a month \nago, this message was given to me over and over when I would say: Is \nthere anything I can do for you: Senator make sure we get the funding \nwithout the strings attached when we need that money.\n  So the President requested this security supplemental appropriations \nbill. The House has acted. The Senate has the bill before us this week. \nMadam President, this funding bill will do no good if it has \nlimitations imposed in it that prevent us from carrying out the \nmission, and the President has already said if language that sets a \ntimetable for the withdrawal of our troops is included, he will be \nforced to veto the bill. We understand that.\n  It makes no sense to me that we would go ahead and pass such a bill, \nknowing the President will veto it, because there would be no way for \nus to go back and redo it all before the April 15 time, when the troops \nbegin to need this money. Many have suggested that this is actually a \nslow-bleed strategy on the part of some to put a poison pill in the \nbill, forcing the President to veto it, knowing it means the troops \nwould not get the money they need when they need it. I would rather \nlike to think that this is a genuine point of view on the part of some \nof my colleagues who believe we should put strings attached on this \nfunding and somehow that will provide a more clear way for us to \nachieve our mission. I don't understand it, but I suspect somebody \ncould argue that.\n  What I would like to do is support Senator Cochran's amendment to \nsimply strike this language from the bill. If the President is able to \ncontinue to carry out the Petraeus plan and we have funding to do that, \nwe will know soon enough whether it will enable us to achieve the \nmission. By the summertime or thereabouts, if it appears this surge is \nnot working, then we will know that as well.\n  What I cannot understand is why anybody would want to pull the rug \nout from under the troops just at the time it appears the President's \nstrategy is beginning to work. When I was there, there was already \ncautious optimism, signs of success of the plan--nobody wants to \ndeclare success or victory, of course, but that those elements of \nsuccess continue to be manifested and be reported on.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, a piece by William Kristol and Frederick \nKagan from the Weekly Standard of April 2, 2007, entitled ``Wrong on \nTimetables.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this piece by William Kristol and Frederick \nKagan tries to take the arguments that have been offered by the \nopposition in favor of a timetable and demonstrate why those arguments \nare incorrect. The first of the arguments is that the Iraqi Government \nneeds stimulus by us, or a threat by us, that if they don't hurry up \nand do what they are supposed to do, we are going to pull out. This \nkind of strings attached, therefore, makes some sense. They point out\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nthe fact that, first of all, the resolution itself that was defeated in \nthis body a week or so ago by a vote of 48 to 50, that resolution, \nwhich would have established timetables, was defeated, among other \nthings, because the Iraqis have already gotten the message.\n  It is not so much about sending a message to them as it is about \nsending a message to our enemies and to our allies and to our own \ntroops, which says regardless of what you do, we are going to be out by \na certain date. The problem with the goals and with the specifics that \nare supposed to be achieved, the benchmarks, so-called, in the \nlegislation is that it matters not how well the Iraqi Government \nperforms; we are still going to be out by a date certain. So it is not \nthe kind of message we want to send to the Iraqi Government and, \nclearly, not the kind we want to send to our enemies who simply know \nthey have to just wait us out.\n  Another argument is that American forces would be able to fight al-\nQaida, and we don't need to be involved in the civil war of the Iraqis. \nIt would take a lawyer to figure that out. You are going to have to \nhave a lawyer with every squad on patrol to figure out whether they are \nfighting al-Qaida or somebody else or what kind of action can be taken. \nIt is very hard to distinguish whom you are fighting when the fighting \nis going on. Al-Qaida is definitely a problem. What did al-Qaida do? \nThey went over to bomb the Golden Mosque in Samarra, which got the \nShiites to decide they had to provide protection with militias, which \nwent over and attacked the Sunnis, who then went over and attacked the \nShiites and achieved the objective that al-Qaida wanted: to foment \nviolence among different factions within the country.\n  Where do you draw the line against fighting al-Qaida and someone else \nif someone else is doing al-Qaida's bidding? It is a very convoluted \nproposition. Clearly, you cannot have troops there to fight one \nspecific enemy but not another, especially when they are so difficult \nto identify.\n  Finally, some think it is too late, that we have already lost, and we \nmight as well figure out a way to get out. I haven't heard my \ncolleagues talk that way because, under that scenario, you ought to cut \noff funding today and not wait for the 6 or 8 or 10 months called for \nunder the resolution. As I said, the Senate defeated the virtually \nidentical provision 2 weeks ago. One of the reasons is because our \nmilitary is making progress. It is finding that, for example, in Sadr \nCity, the mayor of Sadr City essentially invited the Iraqi and \ncoalition forces in without a shot being fired. The forces of Moqtada \nal-Sadr have either gone underground or disbanded. Al-Sadr himself is \nbelieved to have gone to Iran. Prime Minister Maliki has made it clear \nhe is not going to relent against the forces of the Sadr army. He has \nfired the Deputy Health Minister, one of Sadr's allies. He has turned a \ndeaf ear to the complaints of al-Sadr. He oversaw the cleaning out of \nthe Interior Ministry, which was a stronghold that was corrupting the \nIraqi police. He has worked with other coalition leaders to deploy the \nIraqi units pursuant to the Baghdad security plan. Interestingly, he \nhas also visited the sheik in Ramadi, which is the capital of Anbar \nProvince and formally the real base of al-Qaida operations, and has \ngotten cooperation with the tribal leaders in that area to join us in \nthe effort against al-Qaida and other insurgents.\n\n  All of this is demonstrating cooperation of the Government in \nBaghdad, clearly refuting the notion that somehow the American policy \nhas to be to threaten the Iraqis to cooperate with us or else we will \nleave and the only way to do that is by expressing that through a \ntimetable. Clearly, the Iraqi Government is cooperating, and setting \narbitrary deadlines would send exactly the wrong message both to our \nallies and, of course, to our enemies.\n  We need to express the view to our allies that we will be there to \nprotect them when the going gets tough. The enemy is not simply going \nto lie down and allow this plan to continue to work. They will fight \nback. As somebody said, there are going to be good days and bad days, \nbut our allies need to know that we will be there in the bad days and \nthat we won't set an absolute deadline for getting out.\n  The other point I made earlier is the services need this supplemental \nappropriations bill, and that is why it is necessary for us to strike \nprovisions of section 1315, provisions which would deny that funding \nwithout the strings that are attached.\n  To this point, I also alluded to the fact that section 1315 is \ninternally contradictory and self-defeating. As I said, it provides \nbenchmarks for the Iraqi leaders to meet and then says it doesn't \nmatter whether they meet them, we are out of here. The resolution would \nnot send any message that is constructive in any way and certainly is \nnot changing the behavior of the administration.\n  There are some who might believe they could support section 1315 \nbecause it is less restrictive than the House language. Indeed, it is \nsomewhat less restrictive, although essentially a distinction without a \ndifference.\n  This bill has to go to conference. There has been a great deal of \ndiscussion by pundits and others that the more liberal element in the \nHouse of Representatives is going to insist upon, at a bare minimum, \nthe language that passed the House of Representatives which they felt \nwas too moderate to begin with. We are likely to get change in a \nconference that is language the President will have to veto, language \nwhich is closer to the House language than the Senate language. I \nthink, therefore, Senators should not be acting under the illusion that \nwe can go ahead and pass this language and make sure that either in \nconference everything gets taken out or at least this language, rather \nthan the more difficult House language, will be what is sent to the \nPresident.\n  The reality is these are real bullets. This is not something with \nwhich to play around. I don't think we can be voting for something just \nbecause maybe in the conference committee we can try to make it a \nlittle bit better.\n  Madam President, I wish to get to this point that will, perhaps, put \nthis in perspective. I can't remember another time in history when the \nUnited States in the middle of a war has set a deadline and basically \ntold the world: We will be out by this specific date. To state the \nproposition is to illustrate how odd and destructive a proposition it \nis. If someone can come to the floor and tell me when this has been \ndone in the past and when it has had a salutary effect on the conflict, \nI would be very interested and would certainly be willing to listen to \nhow that might have a positive effect here. But even colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle several months ago expressed themselves on the \nmatter of timetables and deadlines, and they know who they are; they \nacknowledge this is not the way to fight a war. One thing you cannot do \nis tell the enemy when you are going to be leaving because it simply \nallows the enemy to wait you out. Nothing has changed. That fact still \nremains, and it seems almost inconceivable to me that Members now would \nbe deciding it is now OK to set a deadline and to set timetables.\n  Some might argue that it is just a goal, it is not a timetable. But \nthe reality is there are both embodied in this section which we seek to \nstrike. The beginning phrase is, ``The President shall commence the \nphased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq not later than \n120 days after the date of enactment of the act.'' That is not a \n``maybe,'' it is not an ``if everything goes well'' or ``if everything \ndoesn't go well,'' it is a ``shall commence'' redeployment. The goal is \n``with the goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008,'' but the ``shall \ncommence'' is pursuant to that goal. So you have to start it, and then \nyou keep going, and your goal is to get it done by March 31, 2008. The \nonly exception is for the limited purposes of leaving troops behind to \nprotect our infrastructure and coalition personnel, training and \nequipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism \noperations.\n  How do you decide how many troops you need to leave behind to conduct \ntargeted counterterrorism operations when virtually everything we are \ndoing in Iraq right now is counterterrorism? How do you decide we are \ngoing to be able to cut, say, in half the number of troops and still be \nable to effectively conduct targeted counterterrorism operations? If \nyou are driving down a street to conduct a targeted counterterrorism \noperation and somebody begins firing on you, do you have to ask them \nwhether they are a terrorist before you can return fire? Do you turn\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nto your lawyer sitting in the humvee with you: I want to comply with \nthe law, so can I shoot back or not?\n  This is ludicrous. We cannot impose these kinds of conditions on our \ntroops in the middle of combat and expect them to perform their mission \nsafely. We send the best trained and best equipped troops into harm's \nway, and we need to give them the other tool they need to prevail; that \nis, the ability to carry out their mission as their commanders have \ndefined it for them, not as it is micromanaged by a bunch of lawyers in \nWashington or Members of the Congress.\n  So, No. 1, this isn't just a wish that we redeploy. It begins ``shall \ncommence the phased redeployment not later than 120 days after the date \nof enactment of this act,'' and the goal is to have it all done by \nMarch 31 of next year. That is so destructive in the middle of war that \nI just can't believe my colleagues would actually contemplate doing \nthat or that they can believe putting these kinds of limitations on our \ntroops is a realistic way to fight a war--conducting targeted \ncounterterrorism operations but not returning fire against, what, \nagainst somebody defined as an insurgent, maybe? I don't understand it, \nand I don't know how many lawyers it is going to take to understand it. \nOur troops on the ground who are in the middle of a conflict certainly \nare not going to be able to fight and defend themselves under \nrestrictions such as these, which is, I gather, precisely why the \nPresident says he will have to veto it.\n\n  That gets me to my last point. I can understand why, Madam President, \nif you felt this was a lost cause, you would want to just say: Let's \nhave a vote to get out and be done with it and not fund the troops. But \ninstead, there are some--and I am not suggesting in the Congress but \nthere are some who have talked about this as a very clever strategy. \nThey say the opponents of the President and the Congress are going to \nbe able to say they voted to support the troops because they voted for \na supplemental appropriations bill for that purpose, knowing all along, \nhowever, that it is a false exercise because it puts restrictions on \nthe troops fighting the war that they can't possibly live with, so the \nPresident has to veto it. But he will get the blame, not them.\n  Well, that is too clever by half. The American people understand \nthis. I urge, if any of my colleagues are considering supporting this \nfor that reason, that they fail to appreciate that the American people, \nyes, would like to bring our troops home, they would like to see this \nconflict ended, but, no, they do not want it to end with an American \ndefeat. They do not want to see us defeated and, most especially, I \ncan't imagine anybody who wants to have our troops continue the war for \na limited duration of time under rules which put them in great danger, \nwhich is what this would do. So the President has to veto it.\n  What happens when he vetoes the bill, if this is the form in which we \npass it? We are now beyond April 15, the time the troops need the \nmoney, and yet Congress has still not acted to provide the security \nsupplemental funding. The Defense Department now has to terminate \ncontracts so they can switch money from this account over to this \naccount and begin a very costly and time-consuming process of trying to \nmake do while Congress makes up its mind, to make sure they can get the \nmoney to the troops so they can continue their operations.\n  Maybe secretly there are some out there who hope all of this will \ngradually reduce the ability of the troops to perform their mission so \nthat it becomes a proposition where our strategy, even under the best \nof circumstances, can't succeed. In other words, the Petraeus plan \nfails because we couldn't get the support to the troops when they \nneeded the support.\n  I hope that certainly my colleagues in the House and Senate will not \nbuy into that proposition, will not pull the rug out from under our \ntroops just when it appears this plan is showing signs of success. That \nslow-bleed strategy would not only ensure that we would lose everything \nwe have gained so far, including the prospect of a success, but that \nour troops would be put in more danger now than they would be either by \nsupporting them or simply by leaving. It would leave them in a middle \nground, in the middle of a fire but without the ability to properly \ndefend themselves.\n  Maybe some believe that would force our hand and just bring them home \nanyway, acknowledge defeat, and be done with it. I don't think that is \nwhat the American people want. If anybody is thinking that is the \nstrategy behind this proposition, I think they are not only misreading \nAmerican public opinion but do not have the best interests of our \ntroops in mind.\n  Since that is the rationale behind this resolution, as offered by my \ncolleagues, I am sure that is not the case. But that is why we need to \nstrike this particular section from the bill.\n  We will talk later about some other items that need to be stricken as \nwell. It is amazing to me, and I won't get into all the pork that is in \nthis bill, but here we have a security supplemental, emergency funding \nto support the troops, and we decide to lard it up with all manner of \nitems that are not emergencies, have nothing to do with supporting the \ntroops, but because everybody knows this is a must-pass bill, they \nfigure this is a real good opportunity for them to get things in the \nbill that might otherwise be very difficult to pass in the Congress.\n  Just a couple ideas: $3.5 million related to guided tours of the U.S. \nCapitol. I am all for guided tours of the U.S. Capitol, but is this an \nemergency?\n  There is $13 million for mine safety research. I am sure mine safety \nis important to research. Is this an emergency which can't be put in a \nregular appropriations bill?\n  We are targeting funding for sugar beets. I presume I like sugar \nbeets--I am not sure--but I don't think it is an emergency for which we \nneed to spend $24 million.\n  There is another $3 million funding for sugarcane, which I understand \ngoes to one Hawaiian cooperative.\n  Here is something which would appeal to all the politicians: $100 \nmillion for security related to the Republican and Democratic \nPresidential nominating conventions. Is that next month, Madam \nPresident? I have forgotten. Nominating conventions would be in July \nand August, not of this year but the following year--not exactly an \nemergency we need to fund in an emergency security supplemental to \nconduct this war.\n  Do my colleagues hear what I am saying? Politicians have decided this \nis a good train to get on board because it has to move, we have to fund \nthe troops. Since it is hard for us to get the Senate and the House to \nact on these items otherwise, we will just try to attach them to this \nbill.\n  We will have other amendments to try to remove these extraneous \nmatters from this funding bill. But what I wanted to talk about today \nwas primarily my concern that if we don't strike this section which has \nthe timetables for withdrawal, then one of two things is going to \nhappen: Either the President vetoes the bill and it then takes us \nforever to get a clean bill to the President, with the result that the \ntroops don't have the funding they need and the strategy that is \ncurrently working becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for those who say \nit can't work because they have denied the funds for it to work, or \nthese provisions remain and, of course, it is impossible to conduct \noperations with these strings attached for our troops. Either way, it \nis a heck of a way to fight a war. And it illustrates to me that we \nought not try to micromanage this conflict from the Halls of Congress. \nWe have plenty of other things that should occupy our time than \ndeveloping a strategy and the rules of engagement for fighting a war \nwhen we have perfectly good people, such as General Petraeus who was \nunanimously confirmed by this body, to develop a plan and see to it \nthat it is properly executed. We have sent him over to do it. I suggest \nwe give him and his troops the support they need to get the job done.\n\n  I would support the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi to \nstrike this section from the bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, Apr. 2, 2007]\n\n                          Wrong on Timetables\n\n              (By William Kristol and Frederick W. Kagan)\n\n       Let's give congressional Democrats the benefit of the \n     doubt: Assume some of them earnestly think they're doing the \n     right thing to insist on adding to the supplemental \n     appropriation for the Iraq war benchmarks and\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\n     timetables for withdrawal. Still, their own arguments--taken \n     at face value--don't hold up.\n       Democrats in Congress have made three superficially \n     plausible claims: (1) Benchmarks and timetables will \n     ``incentivize'' the Maliki government to take necessary steps \n     it would prefer to avoid. (2) We can gradually withdraw over \n     the next year so as to step out of sectarian conflict in Iraq \n     while still remaining to fight al Qaeda. (3) Defeat in Iraq \n     is inevitable, so our primary goal really has to be to get \n     out of there. But the situation in Iraq is moving rapidly \n     away from the assumptions underlying these propositions, and \n     their falseness is easier to show with each passing day.\n       (1) The Iraqi government will not act responsibly unless \n     the imminent departure of American forces compels it to do \n     so. Those who sincerely believe this argument were horrified \n     by the president's decision in January to increase the \n     American military presence in Iraq. It has now been more than \n     ten weeks since that announcement--long enough to judge \n     whether the Maliki government is more or less likely to \n     behave well when U.S. support seems robust and reliable.\n       In fact, since January 11, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki \n     has permitted U.S. forces to sweep the major Shiite \n     strongholds in Baghdad, including Sadr City, which he had \n     ordered American troops away from during operations in 2006. \n     He has allowed U.S. forces to capture and kill senior leaders \n     of Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army--terrifying Sadr into fleeing \n     to Iran. He fired the deputy health minister--one of Sadr's \n     close allies--and turned a deaf ear to Sadr's complaints. He \n     oversaw a clearing-out of the Interior Ministry, a Sadrist \n     stronghold that was corrupting the Iraqi police. He has \n     worked with coalition leaders deploy all of the Iraqi Army \n     units required by the Baghdad Security Plan. In perhaps the \n     most dramatic move of all, Maliki visited Sunni sheikhs in \n     Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province and formerly the base \n     of al Qaeda fighters and other Sunni Arab insurgents against \n     his government. The visit was made possible because Anbar's \n     sheikhs have turned against al Qaeda and are now reaching out \n     to the government they had been fighting. Maliki is reaching \n     back. U.S. strength has given him the confidence to take all \n     these important steps.\n       (2) American forces would be able to fight al Qaeda at \n     least as well, if not better, if they were not also engaged \n     in a sectarian civil war in Iraq. The idea of separating the \n     fight against al Qaeda from the sectarian fighting in Iraq is \n     a delusion. Since early 2004, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) has \n     sought to plunge Iraq into sectarian civil war, so as to \n     critically weaken the government, which is fighting it. AQI \n     endeavors to clear Shiites out of mixed areas, terrorize \n     local Sunnis into tolerating and supporting AQI, and thereby \n     establish safe havens surrounded by innocent people it then \n     dragoons into the struggle. Now, heartened by the U.S. \n     commitment to stay, Sunni sheikhs in Anbar have turned on \n     AQI. In response, AQI has begun to move toward Baghdad and \n     mixed areas in Diyala, attempting to terrorize the locals and \n     establish new bases in the resulting chaos. The enemy \n     understands that chaos is al Qaeda's friend. The notion that \n     we can pull our troops back into fortresses in a climate of \n     chaos--but still move selectively against al Qaeda--is \n     fanciful. There can be no hope of defeating or controlling al \n     Qaeda in Iraq without controlling the sectarian violence that \n     it spawns and relies upon.\n       (3) Isn't it too late? Even if we now have the right \n     strategy and the right general, can we prevail? If there were \n     no hope left, if the Iraqis were determined to wage full-\n     scale civil war, if the Maliki government were weak or \n     dominated by violent extremists, if Iran really controlled \n     the Shiites in Iraq--if these things were true, then the new \n     strategy would have borne no fruit at all. Maliki would have \n     resisted or remained limp as before. Sadr's forces would have \n     attacked. Coalition casualties would be up, and so would \n     sectarian killings. But none of these things has happened. \n     Sectarian killings are lower. And despite dramatically \n     increased operations in more exposed settings, so are \n     American casualties. This does not look like hopelessness.\n       Hope is not victory, of course. The surge has just begun, \n     our enemies are adapting, and fighting is likely to intensify \n     as U.S. and Iraqi forces begin the main clear-and-hold phase. \n     The Maliki government could falter. But it need not, if we do \n     not. Unfortunately, four years of setbacks have conditioned \n     Americans to believe that any progress must be ephemeral. If \n     the Democrats get their way and Gen. Petraeus is undermined \n     in Congress, the progress may indeed prove short-lived. But \n     it's time to stop thinking so hard about how to lose, and to \n     think instead about how to reinforce and exploit the success \n     we have begun to achieve. The debate in Washington hasn't \n     caught up to the realities in Baghdad. Until it does, a \n     resolute president will need to prevent defeatists in \n     Congress from losing a winnable war in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from Arizona \nthat the consequences of playing politics with this important funding \nfor our troops is simply the wrong strategy; that what we have is a \ngame of chicken between the House of Representatives, which is larding \nup a supplemental appropriations bill with a bunch of extraneous pork, \nand the President, recognizing that there are nonsecurity provisions in \nthat supplemental appropriations, has said if that and the timetable \nfor withdrawal from Iraq is included as part of this emergency \nsupplemental, he will veto it. So this is a high-risk game of chicken, \nwith the impact of delaying passage of the supplemental being felt \ndirectly by our troops on the ground, if that is in fact the result.\n  Last week, Secretary Gates made clear the consequences of not quickly \npassing the supplemental funding necessary to support our troops. The \ndownstream effects will directly impact our soldiers, sailors, marines, \nand airmen. By not moving expeditiously to pass a clean supplemental \nbill that can pass the Senate and be signed by the President, the \nmajority risks extending the tours of our troops scheduled to come home \nfrom Iraq and slowing the repair of equipment necessary to equip them, \nas well as the training of Iraqi soldiers who are designed to replace \nthem.\n  Any delay in funding will not prevent a buildup of security forces in \nIraq but, instead, threaten to dramatically impact forces already on \nthe ground. Secretary Gates has said this kind of disruption to key \nprograms will have a genuinely adverse effect on the readiness of the \nArmy and the quality of life for soldiers and their families. So I \ncan't imagine why in the world our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, the new majority, would want to risk that.\n  This supplemental is necessary to pay for training and equipping the \nsoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. If approved, the supplemental will \npay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, repairing and \nreplacing equipment damaged or destroyed in combat, and new \ntechnologies to protect U.S. servicemembers. This last provision \nincludes a new generation of body armor, better armored vehicles, and \ncountermeasures against improvised explosive devices. IEDs have caused \nabout 70 percent of the casualties in Iraq. The supplemental also will \nprovide funding for training and equipping the Iraqi and Afghan \nsecurity forces.\n  If this supplemental appropriations bill is not passed by April 15, \nthe military will be forced to consider the following: curtailing and \nsuspending home station training for Reserve and Guard units; slowing \nthe training of units slated to deploy next to Iraq and Afghanistan; \ncutting the funding for upgrading and renovating the barracks and other \nfacilities that support quality of life for our troops and their \nfamilies; and stopping the repair of equipment necessary to support \npredeployment training. This is what Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \nhas said on March 22, 2007.\n  If the supplemental is not passed by May 15, the military will be \nforced to consider the following: reducing the repair work done at Army \ndepots; delaying or curtailing the deployment of brigade combat teams \nto their training rotations. This, in turn, will cause additional units \nin theater to have their tours extended because other units are not \nready to take their place. Delaying the formation of new brigade combat \nteams; implementation of civilian hiring freeze; prohibiting the \nexecution of new contracts and service orders, including service \ncontracts for training events and facilities; and, finally, holding or \ncanceling the order of repair parts to nondeployed units in the Army.\n  All of these, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, on \nMarch 22, 2007.\n  When the new majority took over Congress, they promised change. In \nfact, the first bill passed in the Senate was an ethics bill that, in \npart, helped improve transparency in the way we spend taxpayers' money \nin Washington. While that ethics bill remains in limbo, the 110th \nCongress has returned to the tried-and-true technique of inserting \nmystery earmarks that have nothing to do with funding our troops or \nfighting the war on terror into a war supplemental bill.\n  During the election season, many on the other side called the 109th \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nthe ``do-nothing'' Congress. The 110th Congress is quickly becoming the \n``say anything and do-nothing Congress'' when it comes to fiscal \ndiscipline. Last week, when the Senate debated the budget, the majority \nspoke of the need for fiscal discipline, even as it passed the $700 \nbillion tax hike for taxpayers over the next 5 years.\n  The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee was quoted as saying:\n\n       We have a responsibility to govern, and you can't govern \n     without a budget.\n\n  But governing takes more than simply passing a budget. Governing also \nincludes the discipline to live within a budget.\n  Unfortunately, both the Senate and the House failed in their first \ntest by including billions more in the war supplemental than the \nPresident requested. As I mentioned, President Bush has already \nthreatened to veto the House bill; not all because of the timetable it \nimposes for our troops' withdrawal from Iraq but also because the bill \nis full of pork.\n  In today's edition of the Politico, they did a fine job of \nidentifying some of the most egregious examples of pork included in the \nHouse bill. They highlighted $5 million for tropical fish breeders and \ntransporters for losses from a virus last year; $25 million for spinach \nthat growers and handlers were unable to market, up to 75 percent of \ntheir losses; $60.4 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service \nto be distributed among fishing communities, Indian tribes, \nindividuals, small businesses, including fishermen, fish processors, \nand related businesses, and other persons for assistance to mitigate \nthe economic and other social effects by a commercial fishery failure.\n  It also includes $74 million for the payment of storage, handling, \nand other associated costs for the 2007 crop of peanuts to ensure \nproper storage of peanuts for which a loan is made, and the House bill \nalso includes $120 million for the shrimp and menhaden fishing \nindustries to cover consequences of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Now, I have to confess, even though I like to fish a little myself, I \nhad never even heard of menhaden, so I went on the Internet to \nsomething called the Menhaden Fact Sheet. This is, if you will recall, \n$120 million for the shrimp and menhaden fishing industries to cover \nconsequences of Hurricane Katrina. Well, as it turns out, according to \nthe Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia on the Internet, the menhaden are \nfish of the--well, I can't even pronounce the Latin phrase, but they \nare of the herring family.\n\n  It says here, describing this menhaden that the taxpayer is being \nasked to pay $120 million in this emergency war supplemental: to \nsupport the gulf menhaden and Atlantic menhaden which are characterized \nby a series of smaller spots behind the main, humeral spot and larger \nscales than yellowfin menhaden and finescale menhaden. In addition, \nyellowfin menhaden tail rays are a bright yellow in contrast to those \nof the Atlantic menhaden, which are grayish. Menhaden range in weight \nup to 1 pound or more. At sea, schools of Atlantic menhaden may contain \nmillions of members. Common names for Atlantic menhaden are mossbunkers \nand fatback. In Florida, yellowfin menhaden are called pogies, and are \nthe preferred species for use as strip bait.\n  This is important. It talks about the range, since this is supposedly \ndone as part of the Hurricane Katrina relief measure. It says gulf \nmenhaden range from the Yucatan Peninsula to Tampa Bay, FL, with \nfinescaled menhaden from the Yucatan to Louisiana--I guess we are \ngetting a little closer now to where Hurricane Katrina hit--yellowfin \nmenhaden from Louisiana to North Carolina, the Atlantic menhaden ranges \nfrom Jupiter Inlet, FL, to Nova Scotia. The various species of menhaden \noccur anywhere from estuarine waters outward to the Continental Shelf.\n  It says that menhaden are essentially filter feeders, straining \nmicroscopic plankton, algae, et cetera, from the water they swim \nthrough open-mouthed. Unlike mullet, they are not bottom feeders. Due \nto their feeding habits, they must be caught by cast netting to be used \nas live bait.\n  This is the most interesting part of the article. It says: menhaden \nare not used for human consumption. Most recently, menhaden has begun \nto be exploited as a source of omega-3 fatty acid fish oil for \ncommercial human consumption, further threatening menhaden populations.\n  I certainly don't know what the purpose is of this $120 million for \nshrimp and the menhaden fishing industries, but I can't see in this \ndescription, or anywhere else in this legislation, why this is an \nemergency or why it ought to be included in an emergency war \nsupplemental. If anything, the inclusion of this kind of appropriation \nin this emergency war supplemental in the House bill trivializes the \nimportance of providing the money that will help our troops deployed in \nAfghanistan and Iraq in harm's way.\n  Here is what the Senate bill included: $24 million for funding of \nsugar beets; $3 million funding for sugar cane, all of which goes to a \nHawaiian cooperative; $100 million for dairy product losses; an \nadditional $31 million for a 1-month extension of the Milk Income Loss \nContract Program; 13 million for Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention \nProgram; $115 million for the conservation security program; $100 \nmillion for small agricultural dependent businesses; $13 million for \nmine safety technology research; $50 million for fisheries disaster \nmitigation fund.\n  There is so much pork included in this supplemental appropriations \nbill, both in the House version and in the Senate proposal, that it \nwarranted a front-page story and editorial in USA Today. An editorial \nin USA Today questioned:\n\n       Which is worse: Leaders offering peanuts for a vote of this \n     magnitude, or Members allowing their votes to be bought for \n     peanuts.\n\n  The editorial went on to conclude:\n\n       These provisions demean a bill that, if enacted, would \n     affect the lives of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \n     balance of power in the Middle East and America's long-term \n     security.\n\n  In short, what we have is that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are willing to put money into pet projects--which may or may not \nbe worthy endeavors, we will never know--and yet are unwilling to \nadequately fund the needs of our military. For all their talk of \nearmark reform and transparency earlier this year, my colleagues seemed \nto have forgotten all of that when they put together the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, my late friend Alex Haley, the author \nof Roots, lived his life by 6 words: ``Find the Good and Praise It.'' I \nthought of those 6 words in connection with the current discussion \nabout the firing of 8 United States Attorneys.\n  The Democrats are making political hay out of these firings at a time \nwhen the Senate should be focused on Iraq, terrorism, health care \ncosts, excessive federal spending, energy independence and keeping our \nbrainpower advantage so we can keep our good jobs here instead of \nseeing them move overseas.\n  U.S. Attorneys have always been political appointees serving at the \npleasure of the president. President Clinton fired them all on his \nfirst day in office. Such partisanship is nothing new. Former Attorney \nGeneral Griffin Bell recently said that the custom once was for U.S. \nattorneys simply to vacate their offices on the day a new president was \ninaugurated, knowing that new political appointees would soon arrive to \ntake their desks.\n  In the summer of 1963, in between my first and second year at New \nYork University Law School, I worked in Attorney General Robert \nKennedy's office as an intern. I was so impressed that, after \ngraduation, I drove to Chattanooga to apply for a job as an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney. The interview went fine until the U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of Tennessee asked about my politics.\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\n  ``I'm a Republican,'' I said.\n  ``Sorry,'' he said, ``We only hire Democrats.''\n  ``But the Attorney General said the administration of justice was \nnon-partisan,'' I replied.\n  ``That word hasn't gotten down here,'' the U.S. Attorney said.\n  Yet the historic political nature of these appointments is no excuse \nfor the excessive partisanship, amateurishness and bumbling exhibited \nby the firing of these eight U.S. Attorneys in the middle of the \nPresident's term. The best way to put in relief what is wrong with \nthese firings is to remember Alex Haley's admonition, ``Find the Good \nand Praise It,'' and point to an example of how political appointees \ncan by their courageous action earn respect for the administration of \njustice.\n  I have a personal interest in the example I offer. Nearly 30 years \nago--on January 17, 1979--I was sworn into office 3 days early as \nGovernor of Tennessee in order to prevent the incumbent Governor from \nissuing 52 pardons and commutations to prisoners the FBI believed had \npaid cash for their release.\n  The U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, Hal Hardin--a \nDemocrat appointed by President Carter--telephoned to ask me to take \noffice early. Hardin was working with the State attorney general, \nWilliam Leech, another Democrat, to arrange the unprecedented early \nswearing-in. Because Hardin and Leech were able to rise above \npartisanship, the Speakers of the Senate and House and Chief Justice as \nwell as the Secretary of State--also all Democrats--participated in my \nearly swearing-in and the ouster of a Democratic incumbent Governor.\n  As it turned out, I was the only Republican in the group.\n  As then-Speaker of the House and later Governor Ned McWherter said, \n``We are Tennesseans first.''\n  The story of January 17, 1979 was recently retold by Judge William C. \nKoch, Jr., a member of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, in the March \n2007 issue of the Nashville Bar Journal. Judge Koch was on the staff of \nthe State attorney general at that time and later was counsel when I \nwas Governor.\n  In the spirit of ``Find the Good and Praise It,'' I offer for the \nRecord Judge Koch's article as an example of how our system of \npolitical appointment of U.S. Attorneys can and should operate, in \ncontrast to the example of the 8 firings and the response to those \nfirings that we are discussing today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Nashville Bar Journal, Mar. 2007]\n\n                      They Were Tennesseans First\n\n                    (By Judge William C. Koch, Jr.)\n\n       Cries of ``let's kill all the lawyers'' have been heard \n     ever since Shakespeare wrote Henry VI. Some believe that \n     lawyers and judges have caused--or at least contributed to--\n     most of society's ills. Because the legal profession provides \n     such a convenient target, lawyer-bashing remains fashionable \n     in some circles.\n       Despite the din of criticism, the truth is that our nation \n     has looked to lawyers for guidance and leadership in times of \n     crisis. An appellate lawyer from Virginia wrote the \n     Declaration of Independence. A trial lawyer from Illinois \n     signed the Emancipation Proclamation. A former criminal \n     prosecutor led the citizens of New York during the dark days \n     following the destruction of the Twin Towers. And it was a \n     Tennessee lawyer who, as a member of the Senate Watergate \n     Committee, helped establish that not even the President of \n     the United States is above the law.\n       Lawyers and the courts have also been instrumental in \n     facilitating orderly transitions of governmental power in \n     times of controversy and unrest. Most recently, the nation \n     and the world looked on as lawyers and courts resolved the \n     legal disputes surrounding the 2000 presidential election. \n     Almost thirty years ago, two Tennessee lawyers orchestrated \n     one of this country's most unique transitions of governmental \n     power right here in Tennessee. My purpose is to recount some \n     of what Hal Hardin and Bill Leech did in less than twenty-\n     four hours on Wednesday, January 17, 1979.\n       Governor Ray Blanton's administration was clouded by \n     controversy from its very beginning in January 1975. Many of \n     these controversies involved state prisoners. In October \n     1976, a rumored federal ``clemency for cash'' investigation \n     made front page headlines when FBI agents raided the office \n     of Governor Blanton's lawyer and seized over one hundred \n     files. In August 1977, the Governor fired Marie Ragghianti, \n     his hand-picked chairman of the parole board. Ms. Rigghianti \n     hired Fred Thompson, and litigation followed.\n       Perhaps the most notorious controversy involved Roger \n     Humphreys, the son of one of Governor Blanton's political \n     allies, who had been convicted in 1975 of murdering his \n     former wife and her boyfriend. Humphreys shot his two victims \n     eighteen times with a two-shot derringer. Governor Blanton \n     arranged for Humphreys to become a trustee and then gave him \n     a job as a state photographer. When questioned, the governor \n     insisted that Humphreys was ``a fine young man'' and bragged \n     that he planned to pardon Humphreys before he left office.\n       The reaction to Governor Blanton's promise to pardon Roger \n     Humphreys was swift and furious. The Tennessee House of \n     Representatives passed HJR 271 urging Governor Blanton not to \n     pardon him. A bipartisan committee, chaired by former \n     Governor Winfield Dunn, a Republican, and John Jay Hooker, a \n     prominent Democrat, started a statewide petition drive to \n     urge the Governor not to pardon Humphreys. Governor Blanton \n     announced on the eve of the 1978 general election that \n     ``after prayerful consideration'' he would not pardon \n     Humphreys. However, two weeks after the election, Governor \n     Blanton announced that he had changed his mind and that he \n     was again considering a pardon for Humphreys.\n       The public's outrage increased during December 1978. The \n     FBI arrested Governor Blanton's lawyer in his office at the \n     Capitol and charged him with selling pardons. The lawyer had \n     clemency papers and marked money in his possession when we \n     was arrested. One week later, Governor Blanton appeared \n     before a federal grand jury and proclaimed as he was leaving \n     the courthouse, ``I have nothing to hide.''\n       Governor Blanton's activities eventually prompted Senator \n     Victor Ashe, a Republican from Knoxville, to ask William M. \n     Leech, Jr., Tennessee's new Attorney General, to decide \n     whether the governor-elect could become governor before the \n     inauguration set by the legislature for January 20, 1979. \n     While Bill Leech, a populist Democrat from Santa Fe, had been \n     in the eye of the storm before, he did not relish answering \n     this question. On January 3, 1979, his office issued Opinion \n     No. 79-3 concluding that Republican Governor-elect Lamar \n     Alexander could take the oath of office and become governor \n     any time after midnight on January 15, 1979. General Leech \n     decided against releasing the opinion to the public \n     immediately.\n       On January 5,1979, Governor Blanton confirmed that he had \n     been notified that he was a target of the federal grand jury \n     ``clemency for cash'' investigation. In addition, the United \n     States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee sent a \n     letter to the parole board identifying twenty-six \n     prisoners who were implicated in the growing ``clemency \n     for cash'' investigation. Despite these developments, \n     Governor Blanton continued to joke with the press about \n     his plans to pardon Roger Humphreys.\n       Even though the Attorney General's opinion was not released \n     to the public until January 15, 1979, rumors about the \n     possibility of an early swearing-in began to circulate on \n     Capitol Hill. Speaker of the House Ned Ray McWherter \n     confirmed that the General Assembly might inaugurate the \n     Governor-elect early if Governor Blanton issued any mass \n     commutations. Lamar Alexander, an accomplished lawyer \n     himself, downplayed the Attorney General's opinion. After \n     consulting privately with the Speaker McWherter and \n     Lieutenant Governor John Wilder, he stated that it would be \n     ``totally inappropriate for me to assume power wholly on my \n     own initiative.''\n       Speaker McWherter's fears were realized on Monday, January \n     15, 1979. Around 8:00 p.m. on that cold, rainy evening, \n     Governor Blanton returned to his office in the Capitol. He \n     was joined by his new lawyer and his Commissioner of \n     Correction, and later by Secretary of State Gentry Crowell. \n     Over the course of the next three hours, Governor Blanton \n     signed clemency papers for 52 prisoners, including Roger \n     Humphreys. As he signed Humphreys's papers, the Governor \n     commented, ``This takes guts.'' Mr. Crowell replied, ``Yeah, \n     well some people have more guts than they've got brains.''\n       The press corps quickly learned that Governor Blanton was \n     in his office, and the reporters were waiting for him when he \n     left the Capitol after 11:00 p.m. The Governor confirmed that \n     he had signed a number of clemency documents, but he was coy \n     about how many and for whom. Governor Blanton did not tell \n     the reporters that Rogers Humphreys's clemency was being \n     hand-carried to the state prison at that very moment. By the \n     time the Secretary of State confirmed that Humphreys was \n     among the 52 prisoners receiving clemencies, Humphreys had \n     already left the prison a free man.\n       News of the 52 late night clemencies hit like a bombshell \n     on January 16, 1979. State and federal officials--both \n     Democrat and Republican--expressed dismay and began looking \n     for ways to undo what Governor Blanton had done. The \n     Governor's office fueled the controversy when the Governor's \n     new lawyer announced that Governor Blanton might issue 18 \n     more clemencies, including one ``big name,'' before the \n     governor-elect's inauguration.\n       General Leech was in Washington on January 16, 1979 to \n     argue a case before the United States Supreme Court. His \n     pregnant wife had also gone into labor. He completed the \n     argument and telephoned his office with directions to modify \n     Opinion No. 79-3 to state that a court might hold that the \n     Governor-elect could only take the oath of office at the \n     scheduled inauguration. General Leech\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\n     arrived in Nashville later that evening and went directly to \n     the hospital. His son was born the next morning.\n       It was at this point that Hal D. Hardin, the United States \n     Attorney in Nashville, stepped up to the plate. Hardin, a \n     ``yellow dog'' Democrat, had been appointed United States \n     Attorney by President Jimmy Carter in July 1977. Prior to \n     that appointment, he had been the widely respected presiding \n     judge on the Circuit Court for Davidson County. In fact, \n     Governor Blanton himself had placed Mr. Hardin on the bench \n     in 1975. Despite Governor Blanton's protestations that the \n     ``clemency for cash'' investigation was a partisan Republican \n     conspiracy, Hardin had been involved with the investigation \n     for more than a year.\n       Mr. Hardin had learned from a confidential source that \n     Governor Blanton was preparing to issue clemencies for 18 to \n     20 more prisoners who were implicated in the ongoing \n     ``clemency for cash'' investigation. Rather than waiting for \n     events to unfold, Mr. Hardin, without the knowledge of the \n     FBI or his staff, telephoned Lamar Alexander on the morning \n     of January 17, 1979. He told Alexander that he was calling as \n     a Tennessean and explained that he had received reliable \n     information that Governor Blanton was preparing to issue \n     additional clemencies, and he recommended that the Governor-\n     elect consider taking office three days early in what Lamar \n     Alexander later described as a ``swift and secret coup.''\n       Lamar Alexander had high regard for Hal Hardin. However, \n     rather than acting on his own, he asked Hardin relay the \n     information to Speaker McWherter, Lieutenant Governor Wilder, \n     and General Leech. Hardin placed separate telephone calls to \n     Speaker McWherter and Lieutenant Governor Wilder. He \n     suggested a meeting among the three of them. Speaker \n     McWherter and Lieutenant Governor Wilder decided against the \n     meeting because they were concerned that a private meeting \n     might violate the Sunshine Law. Instead, they asked him to \n     meet with General Leech. Mr. Hardin telephoned General Leech, \n     and a short time later, General Leech and two senior \n     members of his staff met with Mr. Hardin in a hotel room \n     across the street from the federal courthouse that Hardin \n     had rented under an assumed name. Both Hardin and Leech \n     understood that they had been given the responsibility to \n     chart a course of action for the leaders of state \n     government. The discussion was tense and sometime heated \n     despite their close personal and professional \n     relationship. For several hours, they reviewed Opinion No. \n     79-3 and eventually determined that the original opinion \n     was correct. They also discussed how Governor Blanton \n     might react and formulated contingency plans. When the \n     meeting concluded, both General Leech and Mr. Hardin \n     agreed to advise the state officials that the only way to \n     prevent Governor Blanton from issuing more clemencies \n     would be for Lamar Alexander to take the oath of office \n     immediately.\n       Mr. Hardin returned to his office following the meeting in \n     the hotel room. General Leech telephoned Lamar Alexander. He \n     told the Governor-elect that despite his earlier misgivings \n     about Opinion No. 79-3, he was now convinced that state law \n     permitted the Governor-elect to assume office before the \n     inauguration and that removing Governor Blanton from office \n     was not only appropriate but necessary. Then General Leech \n     met with Speaker McWherter and Lieutenant Governor Wilder and \n     reiterated what he had told the Governor-elect. The \n     legislative leaders were convinced that Governor Blanton \n     should be removed from office, and Speaker McWherter \n     telephoned Lamar Alexander and told him, ``It's time for \n     leadership . . . We will support you.''\n       Numerous telephone conversations involving Lamar Alexander, \n     Speaker McWherter, Lieutenant Governor Wilder, and General \n     Leech followed.\n       They agreed that bipartisanship was essential and that \n     Tennessee's citizens should understand that Tennessee's \n     elected leaders were united in this decision. They decided \n     that the legislative leaders, the constitutional officers, \n     and the Attorney General- all Democrats--should be present at \n     the ceremony, and they agreed on a statement that Alexander \n     would read before he took the oath of office. They also \n     decided that the ceremony should take place in the courtroom \n     at the Supreme Court Building in Nashville and that Chief \n     Justice Joseph Henry, also a Democrat, should be invited to \n     administer the oath of office.\n       Shortly after 5:00 p.m., Speaker McWherter, Lieutenant \n     Governor Wilder, the constitutional officers, and the members \n     of the media walked from the Legislative Plaza to the Supreme \n     Court. They were joined there by Lamar Alexander, his family, \n     and several of Alexander's senior advisors. Chief Justice \n     Henry administered the oath. The somber ceremony lasted six \n     minutes. The press conference that followed lasted much \n     longer. It was not lost on the media that the new governor \n     was a Republican while most of the other officials involved \n     in the ceremony were Democrats. One television reporter \n     attempted to obtain a partisan comment from Speaker \n     McWherter. However, Speaker McWherter, who would later serve \n     as Governor with distinction, cut the reporter short saying, \n     ``Let me say to you. First, I'm a Tennessean, and I think \n     this is in the interest of Tennessee regardless of the \n     party.''\n       Just before the ceremony began, General Leech telephoned \n     Governor Blanton to inform him he was no longer Governor. \n     Following the call, Governor Blanton complained that ``there \n     was no courtesy extended to me today.'' Agents of the FBI \n     circulated through the Capitol serving grand jury subpoenas \n     on Governor Blanton's staff. Hal Hardin decided not to attend \n     the ceremony. Rather than remaining in his office, he went \n     for a long drive to be alone with his thoughts and to reflect \n     on the events of the day.\n       As soon as the ceremony ended, several senior members of \n     now Governor Alexander's staff made their way to the Capitol \n     to secure the Governor's office. They found Governor \n     Blanton's lawyer in his office preparing clemency papers for \n     30 more prisoners. Lewis R. Donelson, a Memphis lawyer who \n     had already been named as the new Commissioner of Finance and \n     Administration, refused to permit the lawyer to leave the \n     building with the papers. When Governor Blanton telephoned to \n     question his authority, Mr. Donelson replied that he was \n     acting ``by the authority of the new governor.'' In response \n     to Governor Blanton's assertion that he was still the \n     governor, Mr. Donelson replied, ``Not anymore.''\n       A full discussion of the aftermath of the events of January \n     17, 1979 must await another day. Governor Alexander appointed \n     Fred Thompson as special counsel to oversee his \n     Administration's response to the clemency crisis. Governor \n     Alexander's formal inauguration took place as planned on \n     January 20, 1979. For the second time, Governor Alexander \n     took the oath administered by Chief Justice Henry in the \n     presence of Speaker McWherter, Lieutenant Governor Wilder and \n     the constitutional officers. While litigation in the federal \n     and state court would follow, the transition of governmental \n     power proceeded with bipartisan dignity. Governor Alexander \n     announced that ``today ought to be a happy one because the \n     people and their government are back together again.''\n       Courage does not always draw attention to itself. Hal \n     Hardin did not attend the inauguration. Bill Leech was \n     present but did not play a prominent role in the ceremonies. \n     While Lamar Alexander, Ned Ray McWherter, and John Wilder \n     deserve credit for their personal courage and decisive \n     demonstration of bipartisanship, the principal figures in \n     this political drama agree that the events of January 17, \n     1979 would not have unfolded the way they did had it not been \n     for Hal Hardin and Bill Leech. These lawyers placed the rule \n     of law and governmental integrity ahead of political \n     expediency and personal reputation. In the words of Speaker \n     McWherter, they were Tennesseans first and their actions \n     sprang from their desire to protect the interests of all \n     Tennesseans, regardless of party.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment to strike section 1315 of the supplemental appropriations \nbill now before the Senate. The motion to strike was proposed earlier \ntoday by the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. I am honored to be \na cosponsor of it. I wish to explain to my colleagues why I am \ncosponsoring it.\n  This is a bill that is quite necessary to the funding of our military \neffort in Iraq and more broadly. The bill has kind of grown like Topsy \nand has a lot of other stuff in it. Maybe I am reflecting on the fact \nthat I am going to see my grandchildren soon. One of my favorite Dr. \nSeuss books is about Thidwick the moose. Thidwick is a glorious moose \nwith large antlers. Various creatures in the forest begin to occupy, \nultimately quite unjustifiably, Thidwick's antlers until they fall off. \nThere are parts of this supplemental appropriations bill that in my \nopinion, respectfully, do not belong there. Most significant of those \nis section 1315, which our motion would strike.\n  Section 1315 would order a withdrawal of American troops in Iraq to \nbegin 120 days after passage, regardless of conditions on the ground, \nregardless of the recommendations of General Petraeus, regardless of \nthe opinions of our partners in Iraq and throughout\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\nthe region, regardless of whether security is improving or \ndeteriorating, the most significant of all. The withdrawal would be \nordered by this section of the bill regardless of whether security was \nimproving or deteriorating on the ground. It is the wrong measure at \nthe wrong time. Ultimately, it will be a lot of sound and fury that \nsignifies nothing but, more importantly, that accomplishes nothing and \nmay do harm.\n  Why do I say it will accomplish nothing? Because everyone in this \nChamber knows that the President of the United States could not have \nbeen more clear: If section 1315 is in this bill and is sent to his \ndesk, he will veto it. In my opinion, he should veto it. Everyone in \nthis Chamber knows there are not the votes in either House of Congress \nto override that veto. So that all that would have been accomplished is \na delay in getting essential support to our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, support they need and on which they are counting. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Obviously, Iraq and what has happened there, what is happening now is \non our minds. We should discuss it. There are ways in which we can \nappropriately legislate with regard to Iraq. In fact, in this bill \nbefore us, there is a section on benchmarks which establishes for \nourselves and for the Iraqi Government some benchmarks, some goals that \nwe have in mind for what they primarily, on their own, should be \nachieving as they move to secure Baghdad and the rest of the country \nand to take control of their own destiny, an Iraqi Government governing \nthe Iraqi people, which was the aim of our overthrow of Saddam Hussein.\n  The benchmarks are in there, inspired by the good work done by \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Warner of Virginia. Senator McCain \nand I, earlier in the debate on Iraq a couple of months ago, were \nprepared to introduce an amendment to have such benchmarks. So there \nwas constructive work that could be done. The benchmarks in this bill \nare in the form of a sense of Congress. They are a message. But they \nare not tied to a deadline. The measure that passed the House last week \nactually has some benchmarks that are tied to triggers that would begin \nwithdrawal from Iraq.\n  President Eisenhower, speaking as a general, once said, now famously \nbecause it has been quoted often in these debates about Iraq, and I \nparaphrase: Anyone who sets a deadline, who argues for a deadline to be \nset in war doesn't understand war.\n  I believe what General Eisenhower was saying is that war is a dynamic \nprocess, a terrible process, a deadly process, one we try, through the \nexercise of all our diplomatic strength, to avoid. But when you are in \na war, you have to give some deference not just to the generals you \nauthorized to be in command but to the reality on the ground. War is \never changing. I believe Eisenhower must have intended, when he said \ndeadlines should not be set in war, that there are two occasions which \nwould justify a withdrawal. One is when the mission is accomplished. \nWhen the purpose for which a nation entered a war is accomplished, then \none withdraws in victory. The second occasion when one would withdraw, \nbased on what is happening on the ground, not some arbitrary deadline \nset far from the battlefield, would be if those in charge conclude that \nit is impossible to achieve the mission, to achieve the purpose for \nwhich the military action, the war, was commenced. Then a retreat \noccurs, a retreat which is a retreat in defeat.\n  As difficult as it has gone in Iraq and as many mistakes as have been \nmade, as many setbacks as have occurred, as much as these mistakes and \nsetbacks have stirred feelings of anger and frustration among the \nAmerican people, which are totally understandable, justified, we have \nnot reached the point in Iraq, in my considered judgment, where it is \nready for a retreat because we have lost all hope of achieving our \npurposes there, which are to create a self-governing, self-sustaining \nIraqi Government that will be our ally, particularly in the war against \nterrorism, as opposed to our enemy, and would create a model, a path, \nan alternative path to a better future in the Arab world, the Islamic \nworld, than the death, hatred, and suicidal ambitions of al-Qaida and \nthe other Islamic extremists, such as those who attacked us on \nSeptember 11.\n  We are in a long and difficult war, and the price paid by our heroic \nsoldiers and their families has been heavy. I understand the feelings \nof anger and frustration among the American people. But what is not \nunderstandable, with all respect, is for Congress now to let the \npassions of this moment, in Washington, obscure what is happening at \nthis moment in Baghdad and in Anbar. Our actions should be driven by \nthe real-war conditions in Iraq, not by the mindset here in Washington.\n  So I ask my colleagues to keep their minds open as we begin this very \nimportant and, critical debate. Our national security, in my opinion, \nis on the line in the outcome of this debate. The lives of our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan are on the line, quite literally, in the \noutcome of this debate.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep their minds open and to make a judgment \nas to whether this section--ordering a withdrawal from Iraq within 120 \ndays, regardless of what happens on the ground; to be essentially \ncompleted by March of next year when most American troops would be \nwithdrawn, regardless of what is happening on the ground in Iraq--to \nkeep their minds open as to whether this is the right time for such a \nmeasure, whether it is the right measure, and whether it has any chance \nto do anything but to send a mixed message from this Congress, \nparticularly to those who are fighting for us.\n  I ask my colleagues to look from here, for a moment, at what is \nactually happening on the ground in Baghdad and in Anbar Province, to \nthe west, under the new security strategy with the new troops GEN David \nPetraeus is implementing.\n  Here is what I hear people saying--this is preliminary, this is \nearly, but it is encouraging--sectarian fighting between Sunni and Shia \nis down significantly in districts in Baghdad where American and Iraqi \nforces have entered. That means the number of people killed in \nsectarian conflict, violent acts, death squads in Baghdad is down \nsignificantly in those districts where Iraqi and American forces have \nentered and established a presence.\n  As security improves, many Iraqi families that fled from their homes \nare returning to Baghdad. Moqtada al-Sadr, the head of the Mahdi \nmilitia, who has been so anti-American, has disappeared and many of his \ntop lieutenants have been arrested.\n  The Government of Prime Minister Maliki, the Government in Iraq, has \nshown the kind of strength and decisiveness that is an obvious and \nnecessary precondition for progress there.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the testimony given to the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to \nchair, last Wednesday by Stuart Bowen, Jr., the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraqi Reconstruction. Anybody who has followed Mr. Bowen's \nwork knows this is a straight shooter. He is not in there to protect \nanybody. He is not in there to spin. He has told it as he sees it. He \nhas been extremely critical of so much of what has happened in Iraq, \nparticularly, obviously, within the jurisdiction the law gives him as \nInspector General, which is to see how our money has been spent. He has \ndocumented waste in ways that are truly infuriating.\n  So when Stuart Bowen says something encouraging about what he sees in \nIraq, that matters to me, and I believe it should matter to others. \nLast Wednesday, before the committee, Mr. Bowen said the week before he \nhad returned from his 15th visit to Iraq. He said:\n\n       It's been about twenty months--\n\n  Almost 2 years--\n\n     since I have returned from Iraq with a sense of cautious \n     optimism. I have that now.\n\n  That is significant. Why on Earth--with independent testimony from \nIraq that there are preliminary, encouraging signs of the effect of the \nnew troops, the new plan, the new leader--why on Earth would we at this \ntime order a withdrawal of those troops to begin within 120 days \nregardless?\n  Why, in the face of these encouraging developments, would this \nChamber demand that the essence of the plan that has brought about \nthese encouraging developments should end? Why, just several weeks \nafter confirming GEN David Petraeus to lead our effort in Iraq, would \nthis Chamber block him from carrying out the strategy he\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nshaped, is now implementing, and appears to be working?\n  In my opinion, the deadline for withdrawal from Iraq that is in this \nbill now is a deadline for defeat, where victory and success are still \npossible. There are no guarantees, of course, in war. That is why we \nadjust our judgments according to what is happening on the ground. So \nthere are no guarantees that the encouraging first results of the \nimplementation of the Petraeus plan will continue and go to full \nsuccess--no guarantees.\n  But I can tell you this: If we adopt an arbitrary order to begin to \nwithdraw our troops, regardless of what is happening on the ground in \nIraq in the war, it will guarantee failure. That failure will have \nprofound consequences for Iraq, which I believe will break up into not \njust full-fledged civil war but the kind of ethnic slaughter that drew \nus a decade ago into Bosnia to stop. And we will have withdrawn and be \nexpected to stand by and let it happen.\n  Of course, ultimately it will lead to what will be claimed as a \nvictory for the forces of Islamic extremism, our enemies in this war we \nare fighting. It will, in my opinion, ultimately embolden them to \nstrike us here at home again.\n  So I appeal to my colleagues, as this debate on this amendment to \nstrike begins, let's have a good debate. That is our nature. That is \nthe essence of our democracy and of this Senate in which we are \nprivileged to serve. But I ask my colleagues, in the end, to step back \nand think carefully about what this section 1315 would bring about, and \ninstead of undermining General Petraeus, or at best sending a mixed \nmessage to him and his troops, let's give him and his troops the \nunified support and time they need to succeed for us.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withdraw the suggestion of an absence of a quorum, seeing my friend \nand colleague from Oklahoma now on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Senate is going to take up, tomorrow, \nin rather full detail, an emergency supplemental spending bill. I think \nit is real important, first, for the American people to know what an \nemergency supplemental bill is supposed to be. It is supposed to be \nabout funding unforeseen problems we could not have anticipated in the \nregular appropriations process. For a very small amount of this bill, \nthat may be true.\n  This bill is $121 billion of your grandchildren's and great-\ngrandchildren's money. This bill does not have to stay within the \nbudgetary limitations Congress sets on itself. This bill goes outside \nevery rule we have in terms of controlling the budget, living within \nour means, and it says: Here is a credit card.\n  Now, by the way, on the way to funding the war in Iraq, the wisdom of \nthe Senate has added--and it is $21 billion in the House--about $18.9 \nbillion in a wish list. It is a Christmas tree. If each of us in our \nown personal lives ran our businesses or our households the way \nCongress is running the emergency supplemental process, we would do it \nfor about 1 year. Then we would be going to bankruptcy court, and we \nwould be losing the vast majority of our possessions because we would \nnot have been deemed to be responsible with the assets we had.\n  There lies the problem. It is the culture of Congress that thinks we \ncan put a hood over the American people's eyes so they will not know \nwhat we are about to do in the next 4 or 5 days in this Chamber. You \nare going to hear all the reasons in the world why somebody needs \nsomething, except it is never going to be held in contrast to the loss \nof the standard of living of our grandchildren. Yes, there are \nagricultural needs out there we should have funded a year ago.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee said when he would get in power, \nwhen the Democrats would get in power, they were going to pay for it--\nexcept here we have an emergency agriculture supplemental bill, a good \nportion of which is needed but it is not paid for. There is no offset \nanywhere else in the hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of waste in \nthe discretionary side of the budget alone, to reduce something else so \nwe can take care of those who need us now.\n  There is another aspect to this funding bill; that is, the politics \nthat plays into it over the debate on the Iraq war. What we are seeing \nplay out is a double-edged sword of how do we hurt the troops in the \nfield by adding things to a supplemental bill to take care of them, \nwhen there has already been a threatened veto over the bill because it \nadds $18.9 billion more than what the President asked for to fund the \nwar.\n  So as you listen, in the next 4 or 5 days, to the Senate debate this \nbill, there are a couple things you ought to pay attention to, and you \nought to ask yourself the question: Where is the money coming from to \npay for this bill? Where is the sacrifice from the generations today to \ndo what the Members of this body want to do?\n  There is no sacrifice. We are not calling on anybody to sacrifice. \nWhat we are saying is: Those unborn, those young, those who are about \nto be born, and the children of those who are young, unborn or about to \nbe born are the ones who are going to pay for it.\n  It portends a great moral question of our society today: How is it we \ncan totally turn upside down the heritage of this country, the heritage \nof a country that has been built on the following premise: ``I am going \nto work hard. I am going to sacrifice. And I am going to serve so that \nmy children and grandchildren get ahead''? Have we become such a \nselfish country that we do not care about the next two generations?\n  I think the Senate has spoken, at least the appropriators have \nspoken. They have said ``yes,'' it is OK to do things such as pay for \nthe conventions, in August, of the Democratic and Republican Parties \nfor the additional funds that will be needed for police enforcement \nwith an emergency bill. Our grandchildren are not going to benefit from \nthat. The political process today is. But we put it in this bill \nbecause it means if we put it in this bill, it will not be charged \nagainst the regular budget process. It is another way to spend more \nmoney. So let's move more things into the emergency category, so we do \nnot have to be responsible when the rest of the appropriations bills \ncome through the Senate.\n  Think about this: You have a grandchild sitting on your knee and you \nsay: Yes, back in 2007, they had a party in Minneapolis and in Denver, \nand they charged it to you. You may get to go to college, you may not, \nbut I just want you to know we had a good time at our conventions. How \nabout $100 million for businesses that have under $15 million in \nrevenue a year that have suffered some loss from a drought over the \nlast 2 or 3 years. We already have several organizations within the \nFederal Government: Farm Service Agency, loan capabilities from the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Small Business Administration. All are \nqualified to loan money to businesses that work in the agricultural \narea but, no, we set aside. We expanded the farm program with this bill \nto give $100 million to small businesses that have been hurt. If you \nare not connected to agriculture and you have been hurt, where is the \nbill to help you? Where does the precedent stop in terms of your small \nbusiness?\n\n  What about the fact that gas prices rose and some auto dealers went \nout of business? Where is the $100 million for them? What about the \nfact that energy prices have gone up and small business profits all \nacross the country have been severely damaged because if they are \nenergy dependent, their costs have risen significantly? Where is the \n$100 million? Where does it stop? Where does it stop that we steal--\nwhen do we stop stealing from our grandchildren?\n  There is also in this emergency provision $3.5 million for tours of \nthe Capitol. An emergency, that we have to have the money now, \notherwise we won't have tours in the Capitol? That isn't right, but \nthat is what is in the bill: $3.5 million. Why? So we can have $3.5 \nmillion more to play with when we get inside the budget now that we are \noutside the budget.\n  Oh, and I forgot to mention the fact the administration isn't \ninnocent in this either, because the war in Iraq is hardly an \nemergency. As a matter of fact, it is in its fourth year. The \nadministration should know what they need. Rather than send a \nsupplemental up here, it should be in the Defense appropriations bill. \nIt should have been in the bill we passed this last year. But instead, \neven the administration is complicit.\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\n  Who is going to stand and speak for the future against the processes \nthe Congress uses today to fund and grow the Government, not worrying \nabout how we pay for it in the future? Will you? Will you challenge \nthis process? Will you say enough is enough? Will you do your part as a \ncitizen of this country to make a difference, to hold people \naccountable here, rather than let the continued culture--and I call it \na culture which actually the majority party ran on. It is a culture of \ncorruption. When you do for you and steal from those who are weak and \nhave no access or ability to pay it, that is corruption. It is morally \ncorrupt. It is a process by which we undermine the very foundation upon \nwhich our country has become strong. If we continue it, what we will \nsee is a weakened nation.\n  We now have $70 trillion of unfunded liabilities for Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. Think about that for a minute. Go figure \nout how many zeroes are associated with $1 trillion. If you had \neveryone who was worth more than $1 billion in the world sell all of \ntheir assets tomorrow and give every bit of that to the U.S. \nGovernment, it wouldn't even pay the interest for 1 year. How is it we \ncan be going down this road? How is it we can be turning our backs on \nthe principles that made us great as a nation--the idea of personal \nresponsibility even applied to Senators, and accountability, and \ntransparency. We are going to hear a lot of stories about what is and \nisn't happening with this bill over the next 3 or 4 days, but the \nquestion I hope the American people will ask themselves is where is the \nmoney coming from? Where is the money coming from? If it is not in a \npot somewhere and if it is not saved, somebody is going to have to pay \nfor it.\n  This money is coming from the big Visa card of the Federal \nGovernment. We are going to ``cha-ching'' and we are going to say: \nGrandchildren, you have to pay for this war in Iraq, plus another $19 \nbillion, because we don't have the courage to hold this Government \naccountable. We don't even have the courage to hold ourselves \naccountable. We don't have the courage to eliminate the duplication, \nthe fraud, and the waste that accounts for over $200 billion every year \nin this $3 trillion budget. There is no courage here to face that. We \ncan do oversight hearings, and we have done so. Senator Carper and \nmyself did 46, more than any other committee of Congress, over the last \n2 years. What we found was almost $200 billion of either duplicative \nprograms, wasteful programs, or outright fraud. Yet where is the \nCongress offsetting those with this bill? No. It is too hard work. You \nmight offend somebody. The next election is more important than the \nnext generation. Being here is more important than doing what is the \nbest thing for our Nation.\n  So I hope as we approach this bill, the American public will ask that \nquestion about where the sacrifice comes from to do this. Where does \nthe sacrifice come from? Unfortunately, it is going to come from the \nnext 2 generations. It is hard to identify what that means, but with $9 \ntrillion of actual outstanding debt we have now and the $70 trillion of \nunfunded liability, it doesn't take a great imagination to understand \nhow that might impact our children and grandchildren, with high \ninterest rates, lack of ability to afford a college education, \ninability to own a home, buy a new car. All of those things are coming \nas we continue to steal the future from our children and our \ngrandchildren. The big government credit card. It is only available \nbecause there is a lack of backbone and spine in the Congress to do \nwhat is necessary to give the American people true value from their \nGovernment. It is hard. A lot of people get upset. But I would much \nrather stand here and try to change it now than try to explain to my \ngrandchildren why we didn't change it, why we didn't do that.\n  I have some hope the American people are starting to wake up to the \nbudgetary gimmicks and processes the Congress uses. When they really \nawaken, what they are going to do is change who runs this place. It is \ngoing to be real citizen legislators. It is going to be people who care \nabout the future more than they care about today. It is going to be \npeople who care about a heritage that continues to be and create and \nhold forth the greatest experiment in freedom that has ever been. \nWithout that change, as Will Durant said:\n\n       Great societies are never conquered from without until they \n     rot from within.\n\n  This is part of the rotting process we are going to see over the next \n5 days in the Senate. If people summon courage, summon long-term \nviewpoint, summon sacrifice of giving up of themselves, whether it be \nposition or power so we can create something better, the country will \nbe all the better for that. If we don't, there won't be a headline that \nsays: ``Grandchildren hurt by supplemental bill,'' but it doesn't mean \nthey won't be. The fact is they will.\n  It is interesting the accounting that Washington uses. Last year the \nofficial number on the deficit was $175 billion, but the real number, \nthe amount the debt went up, was $360 billion. If you are at home and \nyou have a checkbook and you spend $175 more than you had in the \ncheckbook, but at the end of the year you charged another $200 on top \nof it, you really spent it all, and you went into debt for that whole \namount. But we don't do what national accounting standards say. We play \na game. We take the Social Security money and we lessen the effect of \nwhat we are doing through Social Security and 30 some other trust funds \nsuch as the inland waterway trust fund and several others, and the \nretirement of the employees of the Federal Government that is not \nfunded, and we add all that back and we make it look better than it is.\n  The idea behind a half lie is a whole truth, but it is not. A half \ntruth is a whole lie.\n  So my hope is when we have this debate on this bill, this $121 \nbillion bill, America will say: Wait a minute. Why aren't you paying \nfor it? Why aren't you trimming some of the fat? Why aren't you \ntrimming some of the problems? Why aren't you doing that? Because it is \nhard. That is not a good enough reason to undermine the future of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come and speak this \nevening and the staff staying here.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007 budget resolutions \nincluded an importation reserve fund for drugs imported from countries \n``with strong safety laws.'' Yet the Dorgan-Snowe amendment omits that \nlanguage. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that under the \nDorgan-Snowe amendment, the term ``safe importation'' means from \ncountries ``with strong safety laws''?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. The term ``safe importation'' means importation only \nfrom countries with strong safety laws. The additional language ``with \nstrong safety laws,'' which was included in last year's budget, was \nredundant, but the absence of those words does not alter the meaning, \nin my opinion. ``Safe importation'' refers to the importation of \nprescription drugs from countries that require the review of drugs for \nsafety and effectiveness by an entity of the government of the country; \nthat require the methods used in and the facilities and controls used \nfor the manufacture, processing, and packing of drugs in the country to \nbe adequate to preserve their identity, quality, purity, strength, and \nefficacy; that require the labeling and promotion of drugs to be in \naccordance with the approval of the drug and whose valid marketing \nauthorization system is equivalent to the systems in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3748-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE ACT\n\n  Mr. BURR.

Senator Obama introduced this legislation last year. \nWe have worked together on some revisions, and I am proud to join him \nin cosponsoring the legislation this year.\n  I believe this legislation will help improve the quality and safety \nof health care by providing a better understanding of what causes \ncertain diseases. Through a coordinated research initiative and safer \ngenetic tests, patients and doctors will be empowered to make more \ninformed decisions about medical treatments.\n  This bill will advance the study of human genes and their functions \nto better predict patients' susceptibility to certain diseases or \nconditions and better customize drugs and medical treatments to meet \npatients' unique needs. By facilitating genomics research, fostering a \ncapable genomics workforce, and encouraging the development of high \nquality genetic tests, patients will be better informed about the \nmedical care they need.\n  I am proud that North Carolina is a leader in genomics and \npersonalized medicine research. Duke University's Institute for Genome \nSciences and Policy and the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill's Institute for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy are \nboth conducting significant research efforts in this area and support a \nstronger Federal focus on genomics. This legislation will increase \nFederal support for initiatives at Duke and Chapel Hill--a win-win for \nNorth Carolina and patients.\n  Specifically, this bill establishes an Interagency Working Group at \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pull together and \naccelerate genomics research by developing standardized terminology and \nestablishing quality standards and guidelines for the collection, \nprocessing, and storage of genomic samples and data. It advances \ngenomics research by establishing a national biobanking distributed \ndatabase that collects and integrates genomic data to simplify pooled \ndata analysis. The bill also develops biobanking initiatives at \nacademic medical centers across the country, including biobanks \ncontaining biological specimens. It will improve genetics and genomics \ntraining by developing model training programs, residency curricula and \nteaching materials, and by integrating genetics and genomics into \nclinical and public health practice by developing health professional \nguidelines.\n  The bill will also encourage drug sponsors and device companies to \ndevelop companion diagnostic tests, and it will improve Federal \noversight and regulation of genetic tests by identifying which tests \nrequire review and which agency--the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices or the Food and Drug Administration--should have oversight \nover specific categories of tests. It requires the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to evaluate direct-to-consumer marketing of \ngenetic tests to which consumers have direct access and to educate the \npublic about genomics and its applications. It also asks the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality to assess the clinical utility and \ncost-effectiveness of companion diagnostic tests that guide prescribing \ndecisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3748-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3748-S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   BURLINGTON COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this spring, the new community \nhealth center in Burlington, IA, officially opened for business. Having \nsecured funding for the center and attended the groundbreaking ceremony \nlast June, I know how important this health care facility is to \nBurlington and the surrounding communities. At long last, Des Moines \nCounty has a permanent, unified medical and dental clinic, which has \nbeen sorely needed for many years.\n  This is a truly unique community health center. It is housed on the \ngrounds of Southeastern Community College, and there is an agreement \nbetween the CHC board and the community college to allow nursing and \nhealth aide students to do some of their training in the center. This \ngives the center an edge in recruiting staff, and it gives students \nhands-on training opportunities right there on campus. Clearly, this is \na win-win-win arrangement for the center, for the community college, \nand for the entire Burlington community.\n  I salute Ron Kemp and others who had the vision to create this new \ncommunity health center, and the persistence to transform their vision \ninto bricks and mortar. The facility is welcoming, modern, and well-\nequipped. The staff members are truly an inspiration. They have a \nspecial passion for their work, and take pride in the fact that they \nare providing first-rate health care to underserved communities.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that ``Life's most \npersistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?'' The \nstaff members at the community health centers of Southeast Iowa have \nanswered that question in powerful ways. They have committed themselves \nto providing high-quality health care to all comers, regardless of \nability to pay. All are welcomed equally. All are served with \nprofessionalism and excellence. As chair of the Health and Human \nServices Appropriations Subcommittee, I am 100 percent committed to \nsecuring appropriate funding for community health centers all across \nAmerica. One thing I know for certain: Every dollar Congress \nappropriates for centers like the one in Burlington is a dollar spent \nwisely and frugally. It never ceases to amaze me how their staff \nmembers are able to do so much--and to serve so many people--with such \nlimited resources.\n  I dare say that no one in the health care profession faces greater \nchallenges than those who choose to work in community health centers. \nThese challenges include chronic illness, cultural and linguistic \ndifferences, geographical barriers, and homelessness, to name just a \nfew. Nothing stops these dedicated professionals.\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n  And one more thing: community health centers have a well-deserved \nreputation for caring and kindness. They offer a direct and personal \nstyle of health care. They follow up. They care about prevention and \nwellness.\n  So I am deeply grateful to Executive Director Ron Kemp, to President \nBeverly Simone of Southeastern Community College, to the center's \ndedicated board members, to Ted Boesen, executive director of the Iowa/\nNebraska Primary Care Association, and to all the other people who made \nthis new facility possible. They work their hearts out to provide the \nvery best health care to some of our most needy citizens. I deeply \nappreciate their passion, their compassion, and their dedication to \npublic service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3749-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LAS PLANTADAS\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Las \nPlantadas, a group of women incarcerated for resisting the dictatorial \nregime of Cuba for nearly half a century. The National Association of \nCuban American Women will gather on Saturday, March 24, 2007, to honor \na group of Las Plantadas--Ana Lazara Rodriguez, Miriam Ortega, Genoveva \nFelixgraw, Clara Berta Canton Gomez, Olga Morgan and Gladys B. \nCampaneria Herrera--with the Elena Mederos Award during a Women's \nHistory Month Celebration at Schuetzen Park, in North Bergen, NJ.\n  The Elena Mederos Award was instituted by the National Association of \nCuban American Women in memory of Dr. Elena Mederos, 1900-1981, a human \nrights activist, who is considered the most prominent Cuban woman of \nthe 20th Century.\n  Ana Lazara Rodriguez, a doctor, was imprisoned when she was a 19-\nyear-old medical student for participating in protests against the \nCuban dictatorship. She was released in 1979 and traveled to the United \nStates via Costa Rica. In May 1995, she published ``Diary of a \nSurvivor,'' a book detailing her experiences while incarcerated.\n  Miriam Ortega was born in Ciego de Avila, Cuba. She was imprisoned \nfor 18 years for working against the Castro regime. She was released \nand moved to the United States, where she continues in her \ndetermination to fight for a free Cuba.\n  Clara Berta Canton Gomez was born in Havana, Cuba. In 1962, State \nsecurity agents searched the home of her parents seeking her brother \nwho was involved in efforts against the Castro regime. Because they did \nnot speak against their family member, Clara and her parents were \nincarcerated and sentenced to serve 30 years in prison. Released after \n7 years, Clara has dedicated her time to fight for the release of \npolitical prisoners. She dreams of returning to see a free Cuba.\n  Olga Morgan was born in Santa Clara, Las Villas. When she was working \nagainst the Batista dictatorship, she met her husband, William \nAlexander Morgan, with whom she has two children, Olguita and Loretta. \nOlga and her husband were imprisoned in 1960 and 1961. Her husband was \nexecuted with the regime proclaiming both he and Olga a ``high risk for \nthe revolution.'' Olga was released in 1971, and after being denied a \ntravel document in 1978, she reached the shores of the United States in \nthe 1980 Mariel boatlift.\n  Gladys B. Campaneria Herrera was born in Matanzas and raised in \nHavana. Between 1959 to 1963 she fought against the Castro regime, for \nwhich she was arrested in 1964 and sentenced to 3 years in prison. \nWhile she was in prison, she suffered greatly. She was released and \nmoved to the United States, where she has lived in New York and worked \nin New Jersey as a reporter for various Spanish media outlets. An avid \nwriter, Gladys has authored more than 150 poems and songs. She \ncontinues to fight for a free Cuba.\n  The inspiring stories of these women, and of the nearly 3000 other \nCuban women who have been imprisoned, tortured, and endured many \npunishments for refusing to accept a dictatorial regime are a symbol of \nthe dignity and courage of women and a reminder of the need to continue \nto fight for human rights around the world.\n  There is no doubt that Las Plantadas are exemplary leaders and \nprofoundly committed individuals who are role models for the Nation. \nTherefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Las Plantadas, and I know my \ncolleagues will join in wishing them continued success in their quest \nfor human rights and a free Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3749-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ELSIJANE TRIMBLE ROY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, every year during the month of \nMarch, we honor the women who have made a lasting impact on our \ncountry's history with Women's History Month. This month, I want to pay \ntribute to a true Arkansas pioneer who passed away earlier this year, \nJudge Elsijane Trimble Roy.\n  Judge Roy has been referred to as ``Arkansas' Lady of Many Firsts.'' \nOnly the third woman to graduate from the University of Arkansas law \nschool in 1939, Judge Roy was the first female in the state of Arkansas \nto be appointed as circuit judge in 1966. In 1975, then-Governor David \nPryor appointed Judge Roy to the Arkansas Supreme Court, making her the \nfirst woman to serve as an Arkansas Supreme Court Justice. Just 2 years \nlater, newly elected President Jimmy Carter selected Judge Roy to serve \non the Federal bench, and she was given the distinct honor of becoming \nArkansas' first female Federal judge, as well as the first female judge \nappointed to the eighth Circuit.\n  The daughter of Federal judge Thomas C. Trimble, Judge Roy and her \nfather also held the distinction of being the first father and daughter \nto serve as Federal judges. In fact, Judge Roy served in the same \ncourtroom that her father presided over for nearly 20 years. She often \nmentioned that she could feel his presence, and in a 1996 interview \nwith the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, she noted that ``It's meant so much \nto me to be able to try cases in the same court. I look up there, and \nhe helps me with the hard cases.''\n  A gifted athlete who loved sports, Judge Roy was a star player for \nthe Lonoke High School basketball team in Lonoke, AR, and was a two-\ntime women's singles champion at the University of Arkansas.\n  Judge Roy was devoted to both her family and her faith. She was a \nproud mother, grandmother, and later in life, a great-grandmother. \nJudge Roy was also an aunt to many nieces and nephews. She was a \nlongtime member of First Baptist Church in Lonoke and taught Sunday \nschool class when she lived in Blytheville, AR. According to her \nobituary, Judge Roy gave credit to the Lord for her many judicial \nappointments, saying, ``I have always felt I have been brought to these \npositions by the Lord.'' The center of her faith was her favorite Bible \nverse, Micah 6:8, which reads, ``What does the Lord require of you but \nto do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.''\n  A truly remarkable woman, Judge Roy received many honors in her life, \nincluding the Outstanding Appellate Judge of 1976-1977 by the Arkansas \nTrial Lawyers Association. One honor, however, stands out above others. \nIn 1976, Judge Roy was chosen as Arkansas Democrat's Woman of the Year, \na distinction her mother also earned. She received a plaque for that \nhonor, and in a 1979 Arkansas Democrat article, Judge Roy said, ``If \nanything is ever written about me, I want it to contain the words on \nthat plaque. Throughout my career, the things written there are the \nthings I have lived for.''\n  The plaque reads:\n\n       As a law clerk, lawyer, and trial judge, Elsijane Trimble \n     Roy established a reputation for integrity, intelligence, and \n     independence. As the first woman on the Arkansas Supreme \n     Court, she has become a symbol of pride and inspiration to \n     all women.\n\n  Judge Roy, you have been a source of pride and inspiration to all \nwomen, not only in Arkansas, but throughout our great land. You will \nmost certainly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3749-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3749-S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DIERKS, ARKANSAS, CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I honor Dierks, AR, which will soon be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary. Dierks is located in Howard County which lies in the \nsouthwestern part of my State. It was named after a German family that \nimmigrated to the United States in the mid-1800s. The family \nestablished a major sawmill known as Hardscrabble, and when the \ncommunity was incorporated in 1907, it changed its name to Dierks.\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\n  The Weyerhaeuser Company purchased most of the Dierks' family \nholdings in 1969. Weyerhaeuser employs some 600 people in Howard County \nand is one of the county's largest employers.\n  Dierks is also one of many of Arkansas's fine recreation \ndestinations. Visitors take advantage of Dierks Lake which offers \nboating, fishing, waterskiing, camping, and sightseeing. Among \nfishermen, the lake is best known for its large-mouth bass and crappie. \nCatfish and bream can also be caught in abundance. The beautiful \nsurroundings make it among one of the most scenic spots in the State.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating \nDierks on its 100th anniversary and in wishing its 1,300 citizens a \nwonderful day of celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3750-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3750-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3750-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 545.

A bill to expand eligibility for Combat-Related Special \nCompensation paid by the uniformed services in order to permit certain \nadditional retired members who have a service-connected disability to \nreceive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for that disability and Combat-Related Special Compensation by \nreason of that disability; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I introduce my legislation, The \nCombat Related Special Compensation Act of 2007, I would like to \nbriefly talk about the unfair treatment and the deplorable health care \nconditions found at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I feel that \nthe current situation there has some bearing on my legislation.\n  Walter Reed is one of the Army's best-known and premier medical \nfacilities for wounded service members in the country. Numerous reports \nby the Government Accounting Office and transcripts of congressional \ntestimony\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\nindicate that many of our military facilities for wounded outpatients \nare in disarray. These facilities are plagued by mold, mice, stained \ncarpets, and a system ill equipped to handle another generation of \npsychologically scarred veterans.\n  Nearly 4,000 outpatients are currently in the military's Medical \nHolding companies, which oversee the wounded. Soldiers and veterans \nacross the country report bureaucratic neglect similar to Walter \nReed's: untrained staff; misplaced paperwork; lost computer generated \nmedical appointments; and long waits for consultations. These serious \nproblems have resulted from bureaucratic red tape and substandard \nhealth care conditions. This situation is unacceptable. We have not \nfulfilled our covenant, nor have we kept our promise to take care of \nour troops.\n  Our dedicated service members took an oath to serve our Nation. We as \npolicy makers have a moral obligation to take care of these dedicated \nservice men and women that have shown heroic patriotism in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  ``As described in the Washington Post'', It is not just a problem at \nWalter Reed: others describe depressing living conditions for \noutpatients at military bases throughout the country. Let me share with \nyou the comments of a 70-year-old soldier, Mr. Oliva, who is worried \nabout the military health care our wounded will receive. He described \nhis own troubling experiences at the VA hospital in Livermore, CA.\n  ``It is not just Walter Reed,'' Mr. Oliva states. ``The VA hospitals \nare not good either except for the staff members who work so hard. It \nbrings tears to my eyes when I see my brothers and sisters having to \ndeal with these conditions.''\n  Mr. Oliva is but one voice in a vast outpouring of emotion and anger \nabout the treatment of wounded outpatients at Walter Reed. Stories of \nneglect and substandard care have flooded in from soldiers, their \nfamily members, veterans, doctors and nurses working inside the system. \nThis is appalling and an embarrassment to our Nation.\n  I am particularly concerned that some of the highest ranking \nofficials were aware of the problem for almost two years, but took no \naction to correct the situation. While we have seen some positive signs \nfrom the fallout over the scandal, such as the firing of the head of \nWalter Reed and the establishment of a bipartisan commission, more must \nbe done.\n\n  Our soldiers receive first class care in combat, and they should \nreceive the same level of care in our own country. Congress must lead \nthe way in this effort. We must continue our efforts and pass \nlegislation that will improve the quality of life for all of America's \nheroes, including providing them with the benefits they have earned.\n  Today, I join with many of my Senate colleagues to fight and end the \nban on current receipt so that disabled veterans can get the fair \nbenefits they deserve. We have made some progress over the last few \nyears, but as everyone knows, we still have a lot of work to do.\n  The legislation I am introducing today--the Combat-Related Special \nCompensation Act of 2007, would continue to chip away at this unfair \npolicy, by giving pro-rated retirement benefits to our service men and \nwomen who are forced into early retirement because of their combat-\nrelated injuries.\n  Our veterans on a day-to-day basis sacrifice their life for our \ncountry. As public servants, we Americans owe it to our dedicated \nservice men and women to end this inequity. We must support our troops; \nwe must ensure that those who serve us with dignity and valor receive \nthese deserving benefits. They have earned it and they deserve it.\n  My legislation will take care of soldiers who had hoped to make the \nmilitary a career, but were discharged prematurely for an injury \nsustained in combat and forced to retire medically before attaining 20 \nyears of service.\n  Like many of you, I have visited military hospitals on several \noccasions and have seen first hand the injuries sustained by our \nmilitary personnel. Many of the members have reached the 10-, 12-, 14-\nyear marks of their military careers and have been forced to retire \nmedically before they meet the 20-year requirement to receive full \nbenefits. Right now, these soldiers receive combat-related disability \nbenefits, but are not eligible to receive retirement benefits because \nthey cannot fulfill the 20-year service requirement.\n  This is a travesty to treat our dedicated service men and women \ninequitably. It's wrong.\n  We should not penalize veterans because they incurred a combat-\nrelated injury while serving their country. This legislation will \nensure they will receive both their prorated military retirement pay, \nalong with their disability compensation.\n  Let me point out that this legislation is especially important given \nthe injuries sustained by these troops that are currently serving in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and other theaters throughout the world. This \nlegislation is essential for the more than 23,000 injured personnel who \nare returning from war. The widespread use of improvised explosive \ndevices (IED) has created numerous amputees and therefore, result in an \nincrease in medically discharged veterans. As described in stories \nreported by the Washington Post, a 25-year-old soldier got to close to \nan IED in Iraq and was sent to Walter Reed, where doctors did all they \ncould before shipping the soldier to the VA for the remainder of his \nlife. Will this young soldier be one of the victims of war that do not \nreceive disability compensation and military retirement pay?\n  Mr. President, ensuring our veterans receive retirement benefits they \nhave earned is the right thing to do, especially in light of recent \nissues surrounding the treatment of patients at Walter Reed. We must \nnever forget the sacrifices our service men and women have made to \nprotect our freedom. They serve because they love this great country. \nTaking care of our veterans is not only the right thing to do; it is \nalso important for our efforts to win the war on terror. In our all-\nvolunteer military, it is critical to attract and retain professional \nand dedicated soldiers. In turn, they expect that we will honor our \ncommitments to provide health care and other primary benefits for them \nand their families.\n  By ending this unfair policy, we now have an opportunity to show our \ngratitude to our veterans. If we are to truly honor the sacrifices of \nour veterans, we need to ensure that those who were injured in defense \nof our Nation receive these well deserved benefits.\n  While our Nation is at war, there is no better honor we could bestow \nupon them than to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the energy security of the United States by \npromoting biofuels and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the Biofuels for Energy \nSecurity and Transportation Act of 2007, along with my co-sponsor, \nSenator Domenici. This bipartisan bill will increase our use of home-\ngrown biofuels and reduce our dependence on imported oil.\n  The bill establishes a new Renewable Fuel Standard. Starting in 2008, \nthe new renewable fuel standard will require 8.5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuel. The standard increases gradually to 15 billion gallons \nper year by 2015. After 2015, a complementary ``advanced biofuel'' \nstandard takes effect. This standard requires 3 billion gallons per \nyear of advanced biofuels in 2016 and increases steadily to reach 21 \nbillion gallons per year in 2022, for a total renewable fuel standard \nof 36 billion gallons per year in 2022.\n  The bill includes a number of provisions to expand the renewable \ntransportation fuel infrastructure of the United States. A pilot \nprogram for renewable fuel corridors is created. Funding for biofuels \nresearch is increased, with new research centers established to include \nmore of the country's diverse biofuels feedstocks. To promote the \ngrowth of local biorefineries, a national biorefinery information \ncenter is established. Further toward that end, a competitive grant \nprogram is established to develop infrastructure to support local \nbiorefineries.\n  Finally, the bill calls for a number of studies that will explore how \nwe should move forward with biofuels. Studies include: the feasibility \nof nationwide ethanol blended gasoline at levels between 10 and 25 \npercent (E10 to E25); the feasibility of dedicated ethanol pipelines; \noptimization of flex fuels vehicles, which are currently optimized to \nrun on gasoline, to run on E85; an assessment of the state of advanced \nbiofuels technology, in advance of the advanced biofuel standard in \n2015; and allowing for renewable fuel standard credit generation \nthrough plug in hybrids.\n  The introduction of this bill is the beginning of what I hope will be \na substantive exploration of the comprehensive set of issues \nsurrounding the role of biofue1s in meeting our future energy security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to fight criminal gangs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. MENDENEZ. Mr. President, today, all across America, organized \ncriminal gangs plague our communities, destroying the lives of \nthousands of young children and adults each and every year. \nUnfortunately, this plague is currently not being treated effectively, \nand as a result has grown in size and power in almost every State in \nthe Nation. In order to effectively counter this growing threat, we \ncannot continue to believe it is only a State and local issue that \npredominantly occurs in highly urbanized areas. Instead, we must \nrecognize that it has escalated into a national issue--reaching small \nrural towns, suburban areas, and big cities alike--and affecting our \ncountry as a whole.\n  In light of this, it is clear that we must recalibrate our efforts \nand--in addition to our local initiatives--comprehensively confront \ngang violence at the national level. That is why I rise today, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, to introduce the Fighting Gangs \nand Empowering Youth Act of 2007.\n  Combining the efforts of Federal, State, and local agencies, this \nlegislation would utilize a multi-pronged approach in order to \ncomprehensively deal with all aspects of gang violence. From rigorously \nenforcing and appropriately sentencing criminal acts, to exposing and \neliminating the root causes of gang pervasiveness, this bill would \nsimultaneously deter gang violence while proactively targeting the \nsources that have led to its expanding prevalence.\n  Like most of the problems we face as a society, gang violence can \nmost effectively be handled by addressing its root causes. In order to \ngrow in size and power, gangs need a large, self-replenishing pool of \nrecruits to draw upon. They prey on areas that suffer from high dropout \nrates, crippling poverty, and rampant unemployment--areas where hope is \noften in short supply. All\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\ntoo often children who live in these areas are caught in a tragic web \nof gang violence simply because they can envision no other alternative.\n  It is in these circumstances, where a 15-year-old child sees life in \na gang as not just their best option, but often their only option--that \ngang membership thrives. It is in these circumstances, where children \ndo not anticipate living to celebrate their 30th birthday--that gangs \nflourish. Not only does this environment destroy the life of the \nindividual recruited--it also serves to strengthen the gang, further \nreinforcing a vicious cycle.\n  Thus, any effort undertaken to combat gang violence must address the \nenvironment that transforms promising, young adolescents into ruthless \ntools of a criminal enterprise. While we will probably never be able to \ncompletely eliminate all acts of violence from our society, there is \nmuch we can do to instill in our children the skills they need to \npursue a law abiding life. To this end, my legislation would authorize \nfunds for afterschool and community-based programs designed to \neconomically empower young people. Disadvantaged students will be given \nthe opportunity to realize their potential, through tutoring, \nmentoring, and job training programs as well as college preparation \nclasses and tuition assistance. Additionally, millions of dollars would \nbe authorized to enhance and expand anti-gang and anti-violence \nprograms in elementary and secondary schools, ensuring that students \ncan focus solely on learning, without having to be concerned for their \npersonal safety. By providing ``at-risk'' youth with the resources and \nopportunities necessary to succeed in life, they will be far less \nsusceptible to the pressures to join a criminal gang.\n  This bill would also attack one of the roots of gang violence--gang \nrecruiters, who seek out young, economically disadvantaged, at-risk \nyouth and pressure them to join. Currently, there is no Federal law \nspecifically forbidding gang recruitment. This legislation would change \nthat--making it illegal for a gang member to solicit or recruit others \ninto a gang--and would incarcerate an offender for up to 10 years if \nthe person being recruited was 18 or older, or up to 20 years if the \nindividual was under the age of 18. This provision would effectively \ntarget the kingpins of gangs, who cowardly order younger members to do \ntheir violent bidding, callously sacrificing their lives like pawns on \na chessboard.\n  For those who have made wrong choices in life, but are still capable \nof rehabilitation, this bill would expand adult and juvenile offender \nreentry demonstration projects to help with post-release and \ntransitional housing, while promoting programs that hire former \nprisoners, and establish reentry planning procedures within \ncommunities. To be eligible for early release, prisoners with drug \naddictions would be required to participate in treatment programs both \nwhile they are imprisoned as well as during their transition period \nback into society. All offenders would be encouraged to participate in \neducational initiatives such as job training, GED preparation, and a \nmyriad of other programs designed to provide offenders with the skills \nnecessary to become legally employed when they are released from \nprison. By providing such individuals with an alternative choice to a \nlife of crime, lives can be transformed and recidivism rates amongst \nex-convicts will be reduced.\n  In addition to programs focused on gang violence prevention, we must \nprovide law enforcement officials at every level of government with all \nof the tools and resources necessary for them to safely and effectively \nprotect and serve their communities. All too often these heroic \nofficers are caught in the crossfire of gang violence, and all too \noften they make the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live.\n  One tragic example involves the late Detective Kiernan Shields from \nEast Orange, New Jersey. Detective Shields was a rising star in the \nEast Orange Police Department, living his lifelong dream of serving his \ncommunity as an officer of the peace. He was a devoted, loving husband \nand proud father of three children, who was remembered by his peers and \ncolleagues not just as a multi-talented person with a great sense of \nhumor, but as the epitome of a role model in an area that desperately \nneeded one. Unfortunately, New Jersey lost one of its bravest and \nfinest sons on the evening of August 7, 2006, when Detective Shields \nwas ruthlessly shot-gunned to death by a reputed member of the \nBloods gang, as he valiantly ran toward the sound of echoing gunfire--\nRan toward the gunfire.\n\n  This single act of heroism is consistent with the way police officers \nacross this Nation live their daily lives. These are the people who are \nfighting day in and day out to keep our communities safe. The best way \nto honor the victims of gang violence and those who are still fighting \nit is to fully commit ourselves to eradicating this cancer.\n  To assist our frontline warriors in their daily struggle against gang \nviolence, my proposal would provide law enforcement officials on every \nlevel of government with the resources and information they need to \naccurately track and effectively neutralize criminal gangs. \nSpecifically, this legislation would establish a program similar to the \ncurrent Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to augment \nthe number of police officers combating gangs in our local communities, \nand would authorize $700 million annually for it. Additional funds \nwould be used to provide more forensic examiners to investigate, and \nmore attorneys to prosecute, gang crimes. These measures would show \nthat we pay homage not just with our words, but more importantly, with \nour actions, as we recognize the heroic deeds performed by law \nenforcement officials every single day.\n  As is true with almost all problems, a better understanding of how \ngangs operate translates into a better understanding of how best to \ncounter them. That is why this bill would authorize additional funding \nfor the National Youth Gang Survey to increase the number of law \nenforcement agencies whose data is collected and included in the annual \nsurvey and provide money to upgrade technology to better identify gang \nmembers and include them in the National Gang Database. Additionally, \nthis legislation would expand the Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) to \ninclude local gang and other crime statistics from the municipal level, \nwhile also requiring the Attorney General to distinguish those crimes \ncommitted by juveniles. The bill also requires consolidation and \nstandardization of criminal databases, enabling law enforcement all \nacross the country to better share information.\n  For those who still choose a life of crime, this proposal would \nincrease the penalties for crimes committed in the furtherance of a \ngang. Gangs are dependent on committing crimes such as witness \nintimidation, illegal firearm possession, and drug trafficking--\nimplementing these violent instruments to augment their power. \nSubsequently, when these crimes are committed in the furtherance of \ngang activity, they can be more detrimental to society than if they \nwere committed in isolation. Thus, these tougher sentencing \nrequirements for crimes committed in the furtherance of a gang are not \nonly appropriate, but necessary to deter gang violence and shield \nsociety from its most dangerous and unremorseful criminals.\n  Taken together, the provisions of this bill develop a comprehensive \napproach to gang violence by focusing on prevention, deterrence, and \nenforcement. Failure to address all of these gang violence catalysts in \ntheir entirety would leave us with an incomprehensive approach that \nwould do little to quell the scourge of gang violence. Therefore, I \nurge my colleagues to support the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth \nAct, and by doing so, give law enforcement and our communities the \nmeans to thoroughly and comprehensively counter the growing specter of \ngang violence that afflicts our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3758-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3758-S3759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 123--REFORMING THE CONGRESSIONAL EARMARK PROCESS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 124\n\n       Whereas after a half century of war and upheaval, and in \n     the face of economic and political crises and the threat of \n     communism, European visionaries began a process to bring the \n     countries of Europe into closer economic and political \n     cooperation to help secure peace and prosperity for the \n     peoples of Europe;\n       Whereas, on March 25, 1957, 6 European countries--the \n     Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the \n     Netherlands, and Luxembourg--signed the Treaty of Rome, \n     creating the European Economic Community;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Rome established a customs union \n     between the signatory countries, but also did much more, \n     creating a framework that has broadened and deepened over \n     time into the European Union, promoting the free movement of \n     people, services, and capital, and common policies among the \n     countries in important areas, and that has helped secure the \n     spread of peace and stability in Europe;\n       Whereas the European Economic Community expanded to bring \n     more European countries into closer union, with the United \n     Kingdom, Denmark, and Ireland joining in 1973, Greece joining \n     in 1981, and Spain and Portugal joining in 1986;\n       Whereas the member countries of the European Economic \n     Community agreed to the Single European Act in 1987, paving \n     the way for a single European market, and on February 7, \n     1992, the member countries of the European Community signed \n     the Treaty of Maastricht, furthering the economic and \n     political ties among the member countries and creating the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas the European Union has continued to grow so that \n     the European Union now comprises 27 countries with a \n     population of over 450,000,000, after the successful \n     unification of Germany in 1990 and the joining of Austria, \n     Finland, and Sweden in 1995, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, \n     Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, \n     and Slovenia in 2004, and Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and \n     the European Union continues to consider expanding to include \n     other countries central to the history and future of Europe;\n       Whereas the European Union has developed a broad acquis \n     communautaire covering policies in the economic, security, \n     diplomatic, and political areas, has established a single \n     market, has built an economic and monetary union, including \n     the Euro currency, and has built an area of freedom, \n     security, peace, and justice, extending stability to its \n     neighbors;\n       Whereas the European Union played a key role at the end of \n     the Cold War in helping to spread free markets, democratic \n     institutions and values, and respect for human rights to the \n     former central European communist states;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union have \n     shared a unique partnership based on a common heritage, \n     shared values, and mutual interests, and have worked together \n     to strengthen international cooperation and institutions, to \n     create a more open international trading system, to ensure \n     transatlantic and global security, to preserve and promote \n     peace, freedom, and democracy, and to advance human rights; \n     and\n       Whereas the United States has supported the European \n     integration process and has consistently supported the \n     objective of European unity and the enlargement of the \n     European Union to promote prosperity, peace, and democracy: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the European Union and the member \n     countries of the European Union on the 50th anniversary of \n     the historic signing of the Treaty of Rome;\n       (2) commends the European Union for the critical role it \n     and its predecessor organizations have played in spreading \n     peace, stability, and prosperity throughout Europe; and\n       (3) affirms the desire of the United States to strengthen \n     the transatlantic partnership with the European Union and \n     with all of its member countries.\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 641.

Res. 124\n\n       Whereas after a half century of war and upheaval, and in \n     the face of economic and political crises and the threat of \n     communism, European visionaries began a process to bring the \n     countries of Europe into closer economic and political \n     cooperation to help secure peace and prosperity for the \n     peoples of Europe;\n       Whereas, on March 25, 1957, 6 European countries--the \n     Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the \n     Netherlands, and Luxembourg--signed the Treaty of Rome, \n     creating the European Economic Community;\n       Whereas the Treaty of Rome established a customs union \n     between the signatory countries, but also did much more, \n     creating a framework that has broadened and deepened over \n     time into the European Union, promoting the free movement of \n     people, services, and capital, and common policies among the \n     countries in important areas, and that has helped secure the \n     spread of peace and stability in Europe;\n       Whereas the European Economic Community expanded to bring \n     more European countries into closer union, with the United \n     Kingdom, Denmark, and Ireland joining in 1973, Greece joining \n     in 1981, and Spain and Portugal joining in 1986;\n       Whereas the member countries of the European Economic \n     Community agreed to the Single European Act in 1987, paving \n     the way for a single European market, and on February 7, \n     1992, the member countries of the European Community signed \n     the Treaty of Maastricht, furthering the economic and \n     political ties among the member countries and creating the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas the European Union has continued to grow so that \n     the European Union now comprises 27 countries with a \n     population of over 450,000,000, after the successful \n     unification of Germany in 1990 and the joining of Austria, \n     Finland, and Sweden in 1995, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, \n     Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, \n     and Slovenia in 2004, and Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and \n     the European Union continues to consider expanding to include \n     other countries central to the history and future of Europe;\n       Whereas the European Union has developed a broad acquis \n     communautaire covering policies in the economic, security, \n     diplomatic, and political areas, has established a single \n     market, has built an economic and monetary union, including \n     the Euro currency, and has built an area of freedom, \n     security, peace, and justice, extending stability to its \n     neighbors;\n       Whereas the European Union played a key role at the end of \n     the Cold War in helping to spread free markets, democratic \n     institutions and values, and respect for human rights to the \n     former central European communist states;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union have \n     shared a unique partnership based on a common heritage, \n     shared values, and mutual interests, and have worked together \n     to strengthen international cooperation and institutions, to \n     create a more open international trading system, to ensure \n     transatlantic and global security, to preserve and promote \n     peace, freedom, and democracy, and to advance human rights; \n     and\n       Whereas the United States has supported the European \n     integration process and has consistently supported the \n     objective of European unity and the enlargement of the \n     European Union to promote prosperity, peace, and democracy: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the European Union and the member \n     countries of the European Union on the 50th anniversary of \n     the historic signing of the Treaty of Rome;\n       (2) commends the European Union for the critical role it \n     and its predecessor organizations have played in spreading \n     peace, stability, and prosperity throughout Europe; and\n       (3) affirms the desire of the United States to strengthen \n     the transatlantic partnership with the European Union and \n     with all of its member countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/26/senate-section/article/S3779-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMITTING USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. REID.
