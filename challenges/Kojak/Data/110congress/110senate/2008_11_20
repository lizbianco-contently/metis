They are having trouble making new arrangements, if, in \nfact, we have any to be made. So it may be necessary that we come back \nafter Thanksgiving. I have not had an opportunity to converse with my \nRepublican counterpart, but I will do that.

Mr. President, Americans are once again being asked to \nfoot the bill for yet another very urgent bailout, as it is termed. In \nOctober, Congress voted for an unprecedented $750 billion bailout of \nWall Street. Now much of the same alarmist rhetoric is being employed \nto pressure Members to act quickly.\n  The latest bailout demand making the rounds of Washington is for the \nBig Three in the auto industry. The Democrats would have you believe \nthe proposed bailout is all about saving jobs. But having been in \nWashington long\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\nenough, my instincts led me to dig deeper, where I unearthed the green \nroots hiding behind the ``bailing out'' rhetoric. It now appears that \nmuch of what you have heard in the media about the auto bailout being \nabout jobs has been misleading. In fact, there are the usual suspects \nworking behind the scene to subvert the auto bailout and ultimately \nbetray autoworkers.\n  These are the facts. The proposed $25 billion bailout of Detroit now \nappears to have been hijacked by the powerful environmental lobby. When \nI say ``powerful,'' it is by far the most powerful lobby and best \nfinanced lobby--those out in Hollywood I have referred to many times, \nmoveon.org, George Soros, the Michael Moores--they talk millions and \nmillions of dollars. They are indeed the powerful lobby.\n  I suggest there is an idea that came to fruition from the November 19 \nWall Street Journal. They ask, in this Wall Street Journal editorial:\n\n       When is $25 billion in taxpayer cash insufficient to bail \n     out Detroit's auto makers?\n\n  The answer:\n\n       When the money is a tool of the Congressional industrial \n     policy to turn GM, Ford and Chrysler into agents of the \n     Sierra Club and other green lobbies.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the auto bailout has \ndegenerated into a tool to ``make Detroit a subsidiary of the Sierra \nClub.''\n  We hear proponents of the auto bailout endlessly saying this is all \nabout jobs. But the truth is, this bailout appears to be about \nenvironmental lobbies taking over the U.S. auto industry.\n  The Wall Street Journal explains further, and I am quoting again:\n\n       In their public statements, proponents describe the bailout \n     as an attempt to save jobs, American manufacturing and the \n     middle-class way of life. But look closely and you can see \n     that what's really going on is an attempt to use taxpayer \n     money to remake Detroit in the image of the modern \n     environmental movement. Given a choice between greens and \n     blue-collar workers, Congress puts greens first.\n\n  That was an interesting quote in the article, that really has delved \ninto this thing and talks about what the real motivation is behind it.\n  How did this attempt at a green takeover of Detroit come about? \nCongress approved $25 billion for Detroit earlier this year for ``green \nretooling.'' President Bush--when this came up, the need came up to \nhave the $25 billion--proposed to revise that $25 billion, the same \namount of money, and allow it to be used for Detroit's general purposes \nby eliminating the green conditions. In other words, the amount of \nmoney there that everyone is so anxious to get in there, that they say \nis going to resolve the problem, is there and it is available today, \nbut it has been rejected. That shows the choice between green and blue \ncollar is very clear.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       Democratic leaders refused. They are insisting instead that \n     the Bush administration give Detroit another $25 billion in \n     cash.\n\n  Let's keep in mind this is the second $25 billion we are talking \nabout, not the first. ``The Bush administration's proposal is \nunacceptable,'' declared my colleague, Senate majority leader Harry \nReid.\n  The Wall Street Journal asks, and I am quoting again now:\n\n       If the problem is so urgent, why keep the green chains on \n     that first $25 billion? General Motors in particular is \n     saying that it may have to declare bankruptcy by the end of \n     the year without a taxpayer capital injection. Aren't jobs at \n     stake?\n\n  Again, this is the choice being given. But the jobs do not appear to \nbe the overriding concern when it comes to the proposed bailout. A \nNovember 13 commentary in the Chicago Sun-Times bluntly declared that \nCongress should ``attach environmental strings to the Big Three \nbailout.''\n\n       The auto industry occupies a critical position, not just in \n     the U.S. economy, but also in the struggle to cope with \n     climate change and the energy crisis. The government has \n     immense leverage right now to force the Big Three to make \n     progress on multiple fronts and should and should not be \n     afraid to use it.\n\n  This is what Andrew Leonard wrote in the Sun-Times.\n\n       Barack Obama has spoken many times of his ambitious plans \n     to steer the U.S. toward a future where Americans are driving \n     fuel-efficient cars that run on renewable energy. If the \n     government is going to bail out the auto industry, it should \n     do so only with the explicit requirement that the Big Three \n     accelerate down that road as fast as they can.\n\n  Again, I am quoting from the Sun-Times. One of the key ``green \nstrings'' that the environmental lobby wants to impose on Detroit is \nmaking the Corporate Average Fuel Economy--that is the CAFE standards--\nmore draconian than they are today.\n  My colleague, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, wants conditions on the \nauto bailout that would mandate auto companies increase their average \nfuel economy to 40 miles per gallon in 10 years and then 50 miles per \ngallon a mere 2 years later, in 2020. He also reportedly wants \nrequirements for an ``increased production of hybrids, flex-fuel and \nelectric vehicles,'' according to Congress Daily.\n  My colleague, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, has also tied auto \nbailout money to increased CAFE standards:\n\n       Congress should require that the automakers shift to a new \n     business model that focuses on hybrid, electric, and other \n     next generation vehicle technologies.\n\n  She wrote that on November 14. She even expands the mandates to \ninclude costly global warming concerns by ``requiring the NHTSA to use \nthe Energy Information Administration's most accurate gasoline price \nprojection and consider global benefits from reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions when setting CAFE standards.''\n  Again that is a quote.\n  The Wall Street Journal countered with a commonsense alternative to \nincreasing CAFE standards.\n\n       If Congress wants to ease the immediate burden on Detroit, \n     it could also ease the onerous fleet-mileage standards (CAFE \n     rules) that force the companies to make cars domestically \n     that are unprofitable. A mere tweak would help a lot--for \n     example, simply allowing Congress to meet CAFE standards by \n     counting the cars it makes at home and abroad.\n       If you include them all, they would be able to meet these \n     standards.\n       This alone might save Chrysler from bankruptcy. But \n     Congress won't budge on that simple change.\n\n  This latest bout of environmental thuggery is not an isolated \nincident. The legislative goals of Democrats and their environmental \nallies reveal that saving jobs is not their highest priority. \nPresident-elect Obama has pledged to grant California a global-warming-\nmotivated waiver to allow the State to demand its own standards of \nemission reductions from new automobiles. This would essentially allow \na State-by-State approach, thus creating a patchwork of regulatory \ncompliance regimes in addition to the Federal standard that would be \neven more costly for automobile manufacturers.\n  We have gone through this before. We have had this same suggestion \nbeing made. If there is any single thing that would increase the price \nof cars and drive them out of the market, it would be to let each State \ndetermine what its own standards are going to be. It cannot work.\n  The Wall Street Journal summed up this attempted hostile green \ntakeover and the efforts to create an ``Environmental Motor Company'' \nthis way:\n\n       All of this shows that Democrats don't merely want to save \n     jobs. They want an entirely different American auto industry \n     that serves goals other than selling cars to consumers. The \n     green lobbies have disliked Detroit for decades--for \n     resisting fleet mileage standards and having the audacity to \n     make SUVs, trucks and other vehicles that people have wanted \n     to buy but that violate the modern environmental pieties. For \n     the greens, the bailout is their main chance to remake \n     Detroit according to their dictates.\n\n  That is the height of us in Government saying our wisdom is so much \ngreater than the private sector that we are going to impose that on \nthis industry. Now the problems are there.\n  They continued:\n\n       The more realistic alternative to this utopian green vision \n     is to let GM or Chrysler file for Chapter 11 like any other \n     company that can't pay its bills.\n       The immediate cost would be severe. At least bankruptcy \n     would provide the political and legal means for them to \n     evolve into smaller, more competitive companies. Taxpayers \n     should not be asked to finance a green industrial policy \n     promoted by lobbyists and Congressmen who know nothing about \n     what it takes to make a car, much less what it takes to make \n     a profit.\n\n  You have to look at this. I wonder sometimes, if we had not been so \nquick and so generous to come up with $700 billion in this bailout, \nthat perhaps they would not be lining up. Who is going to be standing \nin line after the auto industry? I don't think anybody knows--I don't--\nbut someone is. They are waiting to see what kind of results there are. \nIs it Government's role to\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\nrun businesses from Washington and to finance those businesses? Is it \nnecessary?\n  I have gotten a lot of criticism because I have been quite outspoken \nin opposition to the $700 billion bailout. But I would like to do one \nthing; that is, if there is one thing people have not stopped to think \nabout, that is the amount of $700 billion. What is $700 billion? It is \nvery difficult for me and for anyone else, I think, to think in terms \nof those billions of dollars. But I did some research. I found that \nthere are 139 million families, households in America, who file tax \nreturns. If you do your simple math, 139 million families and $700 \nbillion in a bailout, that is $5,000 a family. If people think in terms \nof that, maybe they will get a little bit concerned.\n  We have already spent, of that--Secretary Paulson--$125 billion on \nnine large banks. This is not what they said or what he said 2 weeks \nprior to the October 1 vote. What he said at that time was: We have to \nhave $700 billion to buy damaged assets, and it is going to take $700 \nbillion. If this continues to happen, we are going to have another \nGreat Depression.\n  And we got all excited and concerned. Granted, I know Secretary \nPaulson is a very knowledgeable person. But for him to make that case, \nget the money, and then spend it on something else is something that is \nvery difficult to understand.\n  I would suggest that when we drafted that law, which I opposed at the \ntime, that was in two increments--actually, three. The first $250 \nbillion was going to be handed to him to go ahead and spend as he \nwanted to, and then, if he needed $100 billion more, the President \ncould see to it that they got it. That has already happened. They have \n$350 billon, of which $60 billion is left and has not been spent as of \nthis moment in time, to my knowledge. I got my information personally \nfrom them last Tuesday.\n  So where we are today is we are sitting on $60 billion. He has \ndescribed this as a cushion. When I say ``he,'' I am talking about \nSecretary Paulson. So we need to now think about the other $350 billion \nbecause it appears, as he said, the financial markets have been \nstabilized. If this is true, then maybe we do not need to get into that \nother $350 billion. Keep in mind, we have $60 billion there on the \ntable ready to be used anyway.\n  So what I have done is drafted legislation that is called S. 3697. We \nhave some Democrats and some Republicans cosponsoring this. It is not a \nfreeze. I wish it were. I wish I could craft a piece of legislation \nthat said: Let's take the $350 billion and give it all back to the \ntaxpayers; it belongs to them. But we know that would not fly. So \ninstead of that, we went ahead and did it to make a modest change in \nthe system.\n  As the law is drafted right now, if the request is made by the \nTreasury Secretary, whether Secretary Paulson or another person, that \nmoney is going to automatically come to them if no one objects while we \nare in session for 15 days. Well, we are going to go out of session \nprobably tomorrow and very likely will not be coming back until January \n6. That means that if any need is there, all he has to do is say so and \nthe money will come forward.\n  So what we have done is change--actually, we only changed one word. \nThe word we changed was ``unless'' and ``until.'' I do not have it \nright here, but it says the money can be accessed unless Congress stops \nthem from doing it. However, by changing that to ``until,'' that means \nit cannot be accessed until we take a positive action in the Senate. \nThat is what I think is perhaps not nearly enough protection, but it is \nsome protection. I would encourage colleagues to rally around this \nbecause there is no other means out there right now, no other vehicle \nthat anyone has put forward that is going to resolve this problem. It \nis going to keep the other $350 billion, and that is about $2,500 for \nevery family in America who pays taxes and files a tax return. There is \nno other way of doing it except for this bill.\n  So I would encourage our Members to join in this effort. And it is \ngoing to have to be done today. If it is not done today, it is not \ngoing to be done. I hope the people outside realize there are a few of \nus here who realize we want to stop this train, particularly if \nSecretary Paulson is correct, as he believes he is, when he says the \nfinancial markets have been stabilized. So we have S. 3697. I would \nencourage my colleagues to come down and sign this so we can actually \nbring it up and vote on it and have it become a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wish to speak in morning business on the topic of the \neconomic situation which the country faces and where we are.\n  I want to acknowledge that the Senator from Oklahoma has some \ninteresting ideas, and I would like to know more about it because I am \npretty frustrated about what has happened with the taxpayer rescue \nmoney we have gotten.\n  First, let me say, though, I am pretty frustrated with the Senate \nright now. I am frustrated that we are lame in this lameduck session. I \nwas telling my constituents as I moved around Maryland, as is my habit \nand joy, that I have used this as a November work session--you know, \nget back to work. The election is over. We know who won. Now it is time \nto govern and govern with responsibility, to come back and go to work. \nSo we come back, and here we are again whirling around with a lot of \nparliamentary quagmires. Can we bring it up? I object. No. We could be \nfilibustered, et cetera. While we are fiddling and diddling to a \nparliamentary tune here, our economy is burning. And the question is, \nDo we burn the economic house down around us by inaction?\n  Now, you might not like this rescue plan or that rescue plan or what \nabout the automobile. I am a champion of jobs in the automobile \nindustry. I do not champion an industry, I champion the jobs in the \nindustry. I do not believe this Congress understands what the \nautomobile industry is. Yes, it is manufacturers, union and nonunion. \nWhether it is the big three in Detroit and the UAW or whether it is \nforeign logo cars being made in the Southern States of our country, the \nToyotas in Texas and Kentucky, the Nissans in Tennessee and so on, we \nare talking about jobs. We are talking about people who make the cars, \nand then we are talking about dealers who sell them, service them, \nmaintain them, and the support services. In many rural parts of my \nState, the automobile dealers are the biggest employers outside of the \nlocal school system and the local hospital. So I want to talk about \njobs, and that is what I have been talking about.\n  But while we are talking about the rescue plan, what is shocking to \nme is the rigidity of the administration to help wrap up their time in \nthe White House and their time to get our economy going, the fact that \nthey are unwilling to look at the rescue package as a tool for saving \njobs rather than saving banks.\n  Now, this is where I believe we have gotten ourselves off on the \nwrong track. When I voted for the rescue plan, I thought I was voting \nfor dealing with the credit crisis and bringing the financial system to \nsome form of stability. It was a little too trickle-down for me, but I \nthought, we are in a crisis, square your shoulders and get out there \nand do it. Well, what has happened is, instead of dealing with helping \nwith jobs, we have been helping with banks. The bailout has been simply \na handout to Wall Street banks. And you know what, they have made out \nlike bandits. Them that got want even more and do not promise to do \nanything in return.\n  Let's review how we got there. We were facing Armageddon. We were \nconcerned about the collapse of our financial system that America \nessentially helped create in terms of a financial system. We were \ntalking about a frozen credit system that would affect big business and \nsmall business in our community. We were also concerned about the \nhomeowner who was losing their home. Well, what did we do? We said: OK, \nwe are going to make a public investment of $700 billion of taxpayers' \nmoney in the economy, through our Secretary of the Treasury. Now, who \nwas this investor? Well, the taxpayers became investors.\n\n  You know, we use that term, ``taxpayers.'' What does it mean? Well, I\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\nwill tell you what it means to ``Senator Barb'' from Maryland. It means \nthat single mother, that single mother who is trying to hold her family \ntogether, maybe in a job that pays $10 or $12 an hour, trying to keep \nher kids together, collect her child support, make sure she has an 8-\nyear-old car still running and make sure those kids are in school to do \nsomething. She does not have a lot of money, and we take a chunk of it. \nWhat about the farmer and what about the waterman who right now is out \nin this cold weather trying to bring oysters to our Thanksgiving table? \nWe are going to have a table of bounty; they have a table of trouble. \nBut no, we are going to take their money and give it to Paulson to give \nit to AIG.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for one question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me finish describing the taxpayer, and I will come \nback to you.\n  What about the waitress--you know, somebody who carries, in that \ndiner, big plates of food? And what does she end up with at the end of \nthe day? A few tips, a bad back, varicose veins, and a government that \nis not on her side. That is where Paulson got the money from. OK. So \nthat is where that $700 billion came from. Then I will talk about what \nhe did with it.\n  I turn to my colleague.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. I appreciate the very \nfavorable comments she has made about my legislation. What is \ninteresting about this is it is supported by a whole host--Senator \nSanders is supporting it, as well as on the far right we have Senator \nCoburn and Senator DeMint. So we are not the only ones who feel this \nway.\n  But the point I would like to make and ask you if you agree is, $700 \nbillion--you heard me describe how to put that in and understand how \nmuch that means to the American people. It is $5,000 for each family \nwho files a tax return. We have an opportunity to save half of that \nright now. I would encourage the Senator from Maryland to join in this \neffort because I think it can get done and it could get done during \nthis time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, I will consider looking at his legislation, I \nassure him on the floor. I think we are in agreement with some of the \nprinciples you articulated earlier.\n  But let me go on with my speech and see if we can't find that \nsensible center, that common ground we both would like to perceive \nbecause when I say, What were the Congress and the American people \npromised for this astronomical sum of money we gave, we were promised \nby the Secretary of the Treasury, on behalf of the President of the \nUnited States, that the investment of the taxpayer would go to \nstabilizing the financial system, get credit flowing again in our \ncommunities, and get the economy rolling. What did we get? We got bait \nand switched from Paulson. Paulson changed his plan. He originally said \nhe would use it to open credit and to also deal with the toxic \nmortgages. Now he is using it for money to buy ownership in banks and \nnot asking anything in return. Paulson threw money at the banks with no \nstrings attached. We have now spent close to $350 billion, and where \nare we? We are nowhere. The stock market is down and unemployment is \nup. Things have actually gotten worse. People continue to lose their \nhomes. Now they are losing their life savings. And with our inaction on \nunemployment, they will lose their jobs.\n  So let's talk about them that got. Do you remember their greed? Do \nyou remember their incompetence on Wall Street that got us into this \neconomic Superfund site?\n  What did Wall Street say over the last several years to regulators \nand policymakers? Stay away. Get out of the way. It is our way or the \nhighway. Having gotten buckets of bucks from the taxpayer, what does \nWall Street say? Stay out of the way. Get out of the way. It is our \nway. And by the way, give us more, and let us keep our high pay.\n  Well, it is not only what we hear from them, it is what we don't hear \nfrom them. You know what is so shocking to me. After this money goes to \nthe big banks, there is no sense of gratitude. There is no sense of \ngratitude that that waitress, that single mother, that farmer, that \nfirefighter is willing to do this--no sense of gratitude. There is also \nno sense of remorse on how they got us into this terrible situation.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a man of faith, as are our colleague \nfrom Oklahoma and myself. In my faith, when you have sinned, the way \nyou get it right is you show remorse, you promise not to sin any more. \nYou say: Let's make amends. How can I get it right?\n  Have we heard that out of them? I have read every paper, heard every \nconversation. There is not one bit of remorse. They swagger around and \nsay: There are three Americas--North America, South America, and \ncorporate America. They treat themselves like a free trade zone. Hello. \nDo they promise to sin no more? Do we see a sense in the passion for \nreform coming out of them, saying: Boy, did we screw up; we now want to \nget it right? No. Do they say: Let's make amends? And the way they want \nto say let's make amends would be to work with our economic people to \nget jobs, credit, and our economy rolling. No. So what, instead, do \nthose who have gotten bailout money do? They give themselves lavish \nsalaries, bonuses, big perks such as spa retreats and golf tournaments \nin the most luxurious places in the world. And we are told that in \norder for them to keep talent, they have to pay big bonuses or people \nwill walk away. They say that in order to keep the big talent at the \nbig banks, they have to give big bonuses. I want to say, if they want \nto go, it is OK by me. I am an investor. Not as a Senator, but as a \ntaxpayer, Why would we want to hold on to them? They got us into this \nmess. So it is OK by me if they go. There are plenty of talented people \nready to go to work for our country.\n  This is what ``Senator Barb'' wants to say to Wall Street: We do not \nwant to be passive investors. We want to be active investors, not in a \nsocialist form of government, picking winners and losers, but, by God, \nhave a sense of reform. Cull out what is the best way to have sensible \nregulation. Come up with the great ideas to get our economy going and \nuse the power and muscle of America's financial system. There is talent \nthere to do that. If you need a lavish bonus to do this, then leave. \nLeave or get out of the way. There is a new sheriff coming to town, and \nI am part of that posse. There are not only young people but a lot of \npeople who want to rebuild our country.\n  So I say to those on Wall Street who feel they can't work for less \nthan $14 million a year, you now work for the United States of America. \nOnce we started making that public investment in you, you now work for \nthe United States. Work for the United States. Give us your best \nthinking. Give us your energy. Give us your ideas. What I want to say \nto them is: It is time to restore our economy, restore our national \nhonor.\n  I say to those who are working in the economic system, pull up your \npants and your pantsuits and start to go to work. Let's rebuild the \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be back here this \nweek. I hope the Presiding Officer and his family have a wonderful \nholiday season when we leave tomorrow. I rise today to talk about the \nproposed automaker bailout. I have tremendous empathy for all of the \npeople involved. I spent most of my life in business. I am sure these \nCEOs and others leading these companies are going through tumultuous \ntimes. I empathize with them.\n  In my beginning period, I was a card-carrying union member. I know \nthere are a lot of workers who are very concerned about their future. I \nhave tremendous empathy for them and their families. This is actually a \nvery serious time in our history. Regardless of where you are, people \nare concerned about the future. I was in other parts of the world last \nweek. All around the world, people are concerned about the future.\n  I do want to speak to the speech of the Senator from Maryland \nregarding the financial component. Many of the car dealers who have \ncalled into our office actually are far less concerned about the Big \nThree. What they are more concerned about is having financing for \nconsumers who are coming into\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\ntheir dealerships. Like her, I want to see people throughout our \ncountry be able to operate their businesses. I am certainly not here to \ndefend any of the Secretaries or anybody else. I will say that I did \nhave a conversation yesterday with Secretary Paulson and with Federal \nReserve Chairman Bernanke. They are putting in place a facility to deal \nwith consumer finance that hopefully will be in place by year end to \nhelp deal with some of the financing components that are stressing the \nautomakers.\n  I wish to specifically address the request by the automakers. I was \nprivileged to be part of a hearing the other day in banking where the \nthree CEOs and the leader of the United Auto Workers testified. I was \nstruck by the lack of coherence, the fact that we had three leaders in \ncorporate America whom I actually have a degree of respect for. I was \nin some ways embarrassed for some of them. They evidently had no plan. \nThey felt in the Senate and in the House today the time was good for \nreceiving moneys from taxpayers. It was sort of a ``get here while the \ngetting is good,'' if you will. It was embarrassing to hear their \ntestimony and the lack of thought that had been put into place as it \nrelated to the request. They had come up with a number of $25 billion. \nThey were actually hesitant to tell us how, as a pact, the three of \nthem had decided to divide this money. After a lot of probing, we were \nable to get them to say that they have decided to divide the money \nbased on their proportional share of the auto market.\n  I pressed them to find out if we did, in fact, agree to loan them \nthis $25 billion, would that be it? It was evident that, no, this was a \ndownpayment and that they had done nothing whatsoever to think about \nwhat might happen after the taxpayers invested in them.\n  One of the questions I wish to ask is: Why would we address these \nthree automakers as some homogeneous group? They are three different \ncompanies. They are in three different circumstances. It is interesting \nto me that the head of the United Auto Workers knows that they are in \nthree different circumstances. What he said was that Ford was actually \nin good shape. They had made some tough decisions and done some things \nback in the year 2006 that have put them in place to actually survive. \nThey have about $23 billion of cash right now. He said he had been in \nto look at the books and Chrysler was actually in second place. I would \nhave thought that Chrysler actually would have been the weakest of the \nthree. Their books are not public because they are a private company. \nHe laid out the fact that actually Chrysler was in a stronger position \nbut that GM was a company that was in more disarray. So as we look at \nthis, I find it so irresponsible that we would actually even talk about \na rescue package, looking at these companies as a group. They are three \nvery different companies that have addressed their issues in three very \ndifferent ways. I find it incredibly irresponsible to even consider \nlooking at them as a group.\n  I wonder, in a market with 10 million cars being sold, why we need \nthree domestic automakers. I wonder whether we would be better off if \npossibly we had two or we had one that was strong. Again, that is \nsomething that the market can decide.\n  One of the greatest disservices we could actually do to these \nautomakers and to the many people who depend upon them for employment, \nwhether they be direct employees or tier 1 or 2 suppliers, is to grant \nthem this money. That would be a major mistake. These companies have \nall kinds of legacy issues they have not been able to deal with. Let me \npoint out one. General Motors has 7,000 dealers. They probably need \nabout 1,500 dealers. What the dealers did years ago is, they went \naround and got States to pass laws that said that GM could not do away \nwith their dealerships. We have had the strong dealers actually calling \nour office and telling us they actually have hurt themselves by putting \nthese State laws in place, because there are so many dealers that each \nof them is having trouble making a profit. It would be a tremendous \ndisservice for us to grant money to these companies without causing \nthem to reorganize.\n  There is something we have in this country called bankruptcy \nprotection. There is something that allows companies to go in and \nreorganize, to put their strengths in order, do away with their \nweaknesses and actually carry on. I do hope as we debate this--I \nrealize nothing is going to happen this week; this was kind of a \npreapplication; that we will probably be dealing with this in January--\nbut I do hope we will look at this in a mature way and realize that \nthese companies have not done the things they should have done, maybe \nthat they could have done, and that possibly we can be of service to \nthem by making them do the things they need to do.\n  Another example: Chrysler Company has a situation where when they \nidle a plant, they actually, in some cases, are obligated to pay the \nworkers of those plants for up to 4 years beyond the time the plant is \nidle. I don't know of any business in the world that can survive in a \nhealthy fashion with those types of obligations.\n  I have tremendous empathy for the people involved. One of these \ncompanies has a plant in our State. But I say to my colleagues, the \nworst thing we could possibly do in this situation is to acquiesce to \nthis request that lacked coherence, lacked thoughtfulness, lacked a \nplan as to how these companies would be successful in the future, and \nlet them go about their business in the way that they have been going \nabout it. They will be back, if this money is granted. I hope we will \nstand firm, that we will be responsible with taxpayer moneys, and that \neven though I am opposed to this, even if the money ends up being \ngranted in some form or fashion, we will cause them to make the \ndecisions that need to be made for them to actually be successful in \nthe future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10685-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10685-S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of extending unemployment \ninsurance to help the 10 million jobless Americans, the most in a \nquarter century, who are searching for work.\n  In the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, turmoil on Wall Street, \nand decline in consumer spending, workers throughout this country are \nbeing given pink slips by the thousands. In fact, we are seeing record \nnumbers today, further amplifying the depth and the seriousness of this \nemployment crisis in the United States. The situation continues to \nworsen. This does not appear to be a passing trend, but, unfortunately, \nunless we do something quickly and appropriately, we can anticipate \ncontinuing job losses. We have already seen across the country \nindividuals whom we know--family members, cousins, friends--who, one, \nare either losing their job, or, two, are being very concerned that \ntheir employment status is tenuous and at any moment they could be \ngiven the word that they have lost their job. Over the course of 1 \nmonth, national job loss numbers jumped from 6.1 percent to 6.5 \npercent--an extraordinary jump in 1 month. Updated State numbers, which \nwill be released on Friday, will unfortunately likely continue to \nreflect this deterioration in our job markets.\n  Despite this bad news, a resolution of this employment crisis does \nnot seem to be approaching. As I suggested, there are indications this \nwill get worse before it gets better--another reason to act now to try \nto provide support and assistance to those people who have worked and \nnow find themselves without a job, through no fault of their own.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, these national trends are amplified \ndramatically. Nearly 9 percent of Rhode Islanders are now unemployed. \nThat is 50,200 people. We are a small State with a relatively small \npopulation. Mr. President, 50,200 people are without work. They are \nsearching for work. They are searching for answers. They are searching \nfor help. We have to provide the help, and then the long-term answers.\n  Job losses in Rhode Island are occurring in all sectors. This is not \njust one area of economic endeavor that is under stress. Every area is \nunder stress. Workers in manufacturing plants have been particularly \nhurt, and that is another consequence or another aspect of this \ndiscussion of the support for the auto industry. We have thousands of \njobs in Rhode Island that in\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\nsome way depend upon the auto industry. So their fate is linked to what \nwe do effectively, constructively to assist these companies to maintain \ntheir presence, but also to change their practices so they are not only \nhere for a few more months, but they can evolve into a sustainable \nmanufacturing industry that will lead the world, as it once did, in the \nmanufacture of high-quality, economically, and environmentally sound \nvehicles.\n  We are seeing layoff notices in the financial and services industries \ndespite all the efforts we have made to support these industries \nthrough the legislation we passed last September. These losses are from \nsmall mom-and-pop manufacturing shops in Rhode Island and go up into \nnational financial companies that are shedding workers.\n  This is a problem that must be addressed. We have done it in the \npast. In 1991 and 2002, Congress worked with the White House to \nsuccessfully extend temporary benefits when unemployment rates were \nsignificantly high. In June, I was pleased that Congress came together \nand passed a 13-week emergency extension of unemployment insurance for \nall States. This was an important step to help desperate families make \nends meet. But jobs are becoming scarcer. The action we took in June \nhas actually been overtaken by events in the world marketplace.\n  We have to deal with this issue, particularly in those States such as \nRhode Island that are seeing unusually high unemployment rates. So far, \n4,416 Rhode Islanders have already exhausted their federal benefits. \nThey are still searching for work, unsuccessfully, but now they have \nlost the support of unemployment insurance.\n  There are 20,000 Rhode Islanders who are receiving unemployment \ninsurance benefits. In the first week of November, another 1,347 Rhode \nIslanders were added to our State's unemployment rolls. These are very \ndispiriting numbers. They call for action, and I hope we can act.\n  Nationally, it is estimated that nearly 1.2 million Americans will \nexhaust their current benefits by the end of the year. Where do they \ngo? They have no direct financial support through the unemployment \ncompensation program. They have seen the value of their homes whittle \ndown to, in some cases, less than the mortgage they owe. They are \nseeing pressures in every area. Unless we provide them some assistance, \ntheir ability to simply keep their heads above water--to keep their \nfamilies fed, to keep a bit of hope alive--will be extinguished. We \ncannot let that happen.\n  These benefits are not handouts. These people have worked. They have \npaid into the program. They receive a modest weekly benefit to keep \nthem close to making ends meet.\n  There is something else too. We have a task before us not simply to \ndeal individually with men and women who have worked hard and now--\nthrough no fault of their own, through the action of the huge economic \nforces worldwide--find themselves without jobs. We have to get this \ncountry moving again. We have to stimulate the economy.\n  Unemployment insurance helps do that. These benefits are spent right \naway in the local communities. These benefits are going to people who \nare not going to, unfortunately, be able to put it away for a rainy \nday. Today is their rainy day. They are going to have to go to the \nsupermarket. They are going to have to go to the pharmacy. They are \ngoing to have to go put some gas in their automobiles to get around, to \nget their families around. This money is spent almost immediately on \nfood, medicine, and gasoline. Economists of virtually every stripe \nbelieve this is one of the most effective ways to stimulate the \neconomy, to increase consumer demand.\n  This is something we have to do. It generates approximately $1.64 in \ngross domestic product per $1 spent. So for every dollar of \nunemployment compensation benefits, we are generating additional \nsupport.\n  In September, I introduced bipartisan legislation to provide an \nadditional 7 weeks of unemployment insurance to people who have \nexhausted their benefits, and 13 more weeks of benefits to unemployed \nworkers in States such as Rhode Island that have unemployment rates \nabove 6 percent.\n  Despite the urgent need for these extra benefits, a minority of \nSenators prevented this bill from moving forward. What we have seen \nsince that date is not an improvement in the situation but a \nsignificant deterioration in the situation. We can no longer ignore \nacting on this critical issue.\n  Today there are more disturbing numbers. There is an indication also \nin the press that President Bush would sign a bill, but he cannot sign \na bill unless we pass a bill. We have the opportunity to do that before \nwe leave today. Since the economy continues to unravel, we cannot sit \nback and wait. We have to act.\n  In October, the House overwhelmingly passed a measure virtually \nidentical to my legislation. We must do the same. I hope we take this \naction this week. We cannot wait until January. There will be more \npeople without jobs, unfortunately, by January, and those who are \nhaving the opportunity to collect benefits bill exhaust those benefits \nby January. We have to act.\n  We have to do more than just an unemployment insurance program. We \nhave to focus on other forms of relief that will provide not only help \nto Americans but stimulate our economy, such as funding for food stamps \nand food banks. Families are turning more to these institutions every \nday. It is not just the marginal American, someone who might be on the \nstreet struggling with mental health issues, who needs the assistance \nof those institutions. More and more families--working families--are \ncoming to food banks and asking for a handout, for food, to feed their \nchildren.\n\n  We can do better, and we must do better.\n  We also have to make investments to improve job creation and provide \nlong-term benefits. I think this means investing in our infrastructure, \nputting people to work, putting people to work to rebuild this country, \nnot in a transient, temporary fashion but in projects that will last \nbeyond this economic crisis.\n  When I was a child in Rhode Island, walking around on the sidewalks, \nlooking down, I would ask my mom and dad: What is this plaque: ``WPA''? \nWell, it is the Work Projects Administration. That was from 1935, 1934. \nWell, in 1955, in 1958, in 1968, and, indeed, in 1998, and now in 2008, \nwalk around, look at those facilities, those public infrastructures \nthat are still serving the communities. They were investments to help \npeople work, but investments that have spurred this economy for more \nthan 60 years.\n  We have to do a lot, and we can do a lot. There are so many needs \nhere: aging infrastructure, roads, bridges, public transportation \nsystems, transit systems so people can get to work and get to school, \ndrinking water systems and wastewater systems.\n  In Rhode Island, proposed funding for these initiatives would support \n$50 million for road improvements. Some of the discussions we have had \nabout a package--$50 million for road improvements. It would also \nsupport $14 million for transit operations which would assure transit \noperations for particularly the poorest citizens of Rhode Island. It \nwould also support $19.1 million for water infrastructure projects.\n  Across this country, these projects could generate more than 470,000 \njobs. We are losing about 500,000 jobs, it seems, every reporting \nperiod. If we could reverse that and report an increase in jobs, that \nwould not only put a lot of money into people's pockets and families' \npockets, but it would also send a signal to the country that confidence \ncan be restored, that hope can indeed be engendered.\n  Finally, I believe we need to provide some funding for the States and \ncommunities that are strapped by this crisis. We are looking at severe \ndeficits. States are looking at them. Many States do not have the \nability to operate beyond a balanced budget. They are going to have to \nmake excruciatingly difficult cuts. I think we should put more money \ninto our matching Federal Medicaid programs which will help States and \nhelp people receive health care. These investments, again, are not only \ncompelling because of the needs of our fellow Americans, but justified \nbecause of their ability to stimulate the economy and to pick us up and \nmove us forward.\n  Events over the last several months have dramatically highlighted the \neconomic challenges we face. We are grappling with the most severe \neconomic\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\ndownturn we have seen perhaps since post-World War II and perhaps since \nthe Great Depression--the worst set of economic circumstances. We must \ndo something. To sit back and watch Americans continue to lose hope, to \nlose their jobs, to lose their sense of the potential of this country \nis unacceptable. We need swift action. No more debate; we need to vote. \nWe need to pass an unemployment compensation extension bill before we \nleave today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10687-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, this may well be my last opportunity to \nspeak on the floor of the Senate. I see my senior colleague, the senior \nSenator from Alaska. I come for the purpose of saying some remarks \nabout several colleagues, including my longtime friend. If it is \nconvenient, I will take the 5 minutes I have just been granted by the \nPresiding Officer because I have to go out to the CIA for a meeting \nthat has been established for some time. I shall leave shortly after I \nfinish my remarks.\n  Again, I see my friend from Alaska, and it evokes many long years of \ninteresting and happy memories. I recall so well that when I came here \n30 years ago to the Senate, Senator Stevens was one of those who sort \nof took the ``youngsters,'' as we called ourselves in those days, under \nhis wing. He had been here 11 years, I think, when I arrived. I \nremember serving under the Senator when he was the whip. I remember \nthat whip; he exercised it judicially but with determination. All in \nour freshman class remember that very well.\n  I suppose what I remember most is that I had a very modest and brief \ntour of military service in World War II. I was only 17. I went in the \nlast year of the war, as did all the kids on my block. We joined and \nwent in. I don't know if I ever shared this story with the Senator. In \nthose days, the boys on the block who were a year or two older than me \nhad already gone in and started military service and were coming back \non leave to visit their families. Some were severely wounded and having \nto stay for long periods of hospitalization. It was a dramatic period \nin American history.\n  I remember the Army Air Corps and those fellows who would come back \nhaving flown their missions in Europe, Southeast Asia, north Africa, or \nwherever the case may be. All of us who were 16 and 17 and getting \nready to take up our responsibilities stood in awe because the nearest \nthing we had connected with an airplane was building model airplanes. \nWe built all the military model airplanes, and we knew them by heart. \nThere were those magnificent flying jackets, and they were the envy of \nall of us. I tried to join the Army Air Corps and went down and signed \nup and joined the Navy. As happenstance would have it, the Navy first \ncalled me in. I had a modest career with my generation in the training \ncommand.\n  The record reflects that Senator Stevens, at a very young age, \ndisplayed courage, determination, wisdom, and leadership. His service \nin the Army Air Corps in World War II won him two Distinguished Flying \nCrosses, several Air Medals, and other decorations for flying those \naircraft. He and I have reminisced many times over the different types \nof planes he flew--primarily the old C-47, if my recollection serves \nme--and flying over the hump, which was a perilous, dangerous mission \nnot only from enemy resistance, but if anything malfunctioned on that \nplane, there was no landing field below you, just miles and miles of \nrugged mountain terrain, much of it totally uninhabitable.\n  I think the Senator was under 21 when he flew those missions, and his \ncrew exemplified the courage of the World War II generation. He, among \nmany, deserves credit as being a member of the ``greatest generation.''\n  In subsequent years, when I came to the Senate and joined the Armed \nServices Committee, it was my privilege to travel to many places in \nthis world with Ted Stevens to visit the men and women in the Armed \nForces. How many times did we work together on this floor--I as an \nauthorizer and him as an appropriator--shaping that annual bill which I \nregard with a sense of humility as the most important bill this body \npasses every year; that bill that cares for the men and women of the \nArmed Forces and provides the economic resources for them to train, to \nmodernize, and to preserve and protect the freedom of this Nation. \nSpeaking on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces, they are \ngrateful to Senator Stevens for all he has done for them through his \ndistinguished career in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10687-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10687-S10694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from \nVirginia for his comments. I understand that duty calls him to go to \nhis meeting at the CIA. I am grateful for his support.\n  Mr. President, just before Christmas in 1968, I was appointed to \nsucceed Alaska's first senior Senator, Bob Bartlett. Next month will \nmark the 40th year I have had the honor and privilege to serve in this \ngreat Chamber.\n  First, and most important, I thank my family. After my wife Ann's \ntragic death in 1978, I thought the end of my career had come, but my \ndear wife Catherine entered my life in 1980, and joined by my six \nchildren, Susan, Beth, Ted, Walter, Ben, and Lily, and my 11 \ngrandchildren, my family has given me love, support, and sacrifice, \nwhich made my continued career in the Senate possible and gave it \nmeaning. I dearly love each member of my family.\n  Forty years. It is hard to believe that so much time could pass so \nquickly, but it has. I want everyone listening to know that I treasure \nevery moment I spent here representing Alaska and Alaskans, the land \nand the people I love.\n  As a Member of this body, I served as whip from 1976 to 1984, as \nchair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, as chair of the \nArms Control Observer Group, as chair of the Ethics Committee, as chair \nof the Rules Committee, as chair of the Governmental\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nAffairs Committee, as chair of the Appropriations Committee, as chair \nof the Commerce Committee, and also had functions as the ranking member \nas the political change took place back and forth across this aisle. I \nalso served as President pro tempore and President pro tempore \nemeritus.\n  I am having really a difficult time today articulating my feelings, \nand I hope if I puddle up a little bit, as my old friend used to say, I \nwill be excused.\n  When I came to the Senate, Alaska had been a State for less than a \ndecade. We were then more of an impoverished territory than a full-\nfledged State. The commitments made by the Federal Government in our \nStatehood Act were unfulfilled, and some are still unfulfilled. Alaska \nhad not received the land and resources it had been promised. Poverty \nand illness reigned supreme in rural regions of our State. I remember \nso well when Senator Kennedy and I went to the Arctic and examined some \nof those villages. It was a disaster. Our fisheries were in peril, \nprimarily from the intrusion of foreign vessels that were anchored just \na few miles offshore 12 months out of the year.\n  Many people doubted whether Alaska had what it took to be a \nsuccessful State, and they asked whether Alaska was still Seward's \nFolly. We proved those doubters were wrong. Working with one another as \nAlaskans and with great friends in the Senate, Alaskans took control of \nour own destiny.\n  In 1958, as legislative counselor for the Department of Interior, I \nworked on Alaska's Statehood Act. Section 4 of that act committed \nCongress to settle the Alaska Native land claims.\n  In 1971, Congress did enact the Alaska Natives Land Claims Settlement \nAct, settling aboriginal claims in our State. Native corporations, \nestablished at my request to manage $1 billion paid to our State by the \nFederal Government, and the 44-million acre land settlement are now \ndriving forces in the Alaska economy.\n  In 1973, after a dramatic tie-breaking vote by the Vice President of \nthis Chamber on an amendment which closed the courts of this country to \nfurther delay by extreme environmentalists, the President signed into \nlaw the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. That act dramatically \nimproved America's energy security and secured the economic future of \nAlaska.\n  In 1976, Congress passed what became known as the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct to fight foreign fishing fleets which endangered America's \nfisheries. Because of that act, America's fisheries today are the most \nproductive and the best managed in the world.\n  Working within the framework of these basic laws, Alaskans have \nlabored in the appropriations and administrative process to make \nstatehood a reality. Where there was nothing but tundra and forest, \ntoday there are now airports, roads, ports, water and sewer systems, \nhospitals, clinics, communications networks, research labs, and much, \nmuch more. Alaska was not Seward's folly and is no longer an \nimpoverished territory. Alaska is a great State and an essential \ncontributor to our Nation's energy security and national defense. I am \nproud to have had a role in this transformation. Working to help Alaska \nachieve its potential has been and will continue to be my life's work.\n  My motto has been here ``to hell with politics, just do what's right \nfor Alaska,'' and I have tried every day to live up to those words. I \ntake great pride in the work of the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee, the leadership of which I have shared for almost three \ndecades with my brother Senator Dan Inouye, and I thank him for being \nhere. He is a great American patriot and a true friend. Together, we \nhave worked to rebuild our Armed Forces to provide the support and \ntraining needed by our warfighters to meet the challenges of a rapidly \nchanging world.\n  I don't have time today to recount the highlights of 40 years of work \nin this body. That will take a lot of time. I will take time, however, \nto acknowledge the friendships I have enjoyed with so many of my \ncolleagues and Senate staffers.\n  I really am grateful to every Member of the Senate for their \nfriendship, and I bear no ill will toward any Member of this body. I am \nmost grateful for the support and counsel of my colleagues in the \nAlaska congressional delegation, my old friend in the House, \nCongressman Don Young, who has done so much for our State, and my \nsteadfast partner in the Senate, Senator Lisa Murkowski, to whom I owe \nso much and admire so much. She has been a true friend and true \npartner. I wish her well in the future here.\n  I also want to acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by \nhundreds of young Alaskans who have come to Washington to serve on my \nstaff. In particular, let me express my gratitude to my current staff, \nall of whom have worked hard for Alaska during the toughest of times. I \nknow all will go on to do great things for Alaska and our country.\n  I feel blessed by God to have had the opportunity to serve in this \nbody. I deeply appreciate the trust Alaskans have reposed in me for 40 \nyears. When Alaska needed a strong voice to speak up for its interests, \nI did my part to the best of my ability. When an administration \nsubmitted legislation or a budget that ignored Alaska's legislative \nconcerns, I urged Congress to exercise its constitutional power to \nredress the balance. When an Alaskan--any Alaskan--or any Alaskan \nentity needed help, my office was ready and did help to the maximum \nextent possible.\n  I feel the same way now that I did in 1968. I really must pinch \nmyself to fully understand that I am privileged to speak on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. Coming from the boyhood I had, I could never even \nhave dreamed of being here today. And home is where the heart is, Mr. \nPresident. If that is so, I have two homes--one is right here in this \nChamber, and the other is my beloved State of Alaska. I must leave one \nto return to the other.\n  As I leave the Senate and the work that has given me so much \nhappiness and satisfaction over the years, I know Senator Murkowski and \nCongressman Young will continue to be strong voices for our 49th State. \nThis is the last frontier. I also pray for my successor's success as he \njoins in that effort.\n  My mission in life is not complete. I believe God will give me more \nopportunities to be of service to Alaska and to our Nation. And I look \nforward with glad heart and with confidence in its justice and mercy.\n  I told members of the press yesterday that I don't have any rearview \nmirror. I look only forward, and I still see the day when I can remove \nthe cloud that currently surrounds me.\n  That's it, Mr. President, 40 years distilled into a few minutes, I \nclose by saying and asking that God bless Alaska and our Governor, God \nbless the United States of America and our President, and God bless the \nSenate and every Member of this body.\n  I yield the floor for the last time.\n  (Applause; Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to say farewell to our distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from the State of Alaska. Ted Stevens' \npublic service has been more than a career, it has really been his \nlife's calling.\n  After serving in World War II, where he rose to the rank of first \nlieutenant, Ted Stevens completed undergraduate work at UCLA and \nreceived a law degree from Harvard. He then came to Washington, DC, for \nthe first time to work for President Eisenhower. His career in elected \noffice started in 1964 with his election to the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives. He became majority leader in his second term. \nAppointed to the U.S. Senate in 1968, Ted Stevens was returned by the \nvoters of Alaska six times and last year became the longest serving \nU.S. Republican Senator in our Nation's history.\n  His career has been more than about longevity. He has been an \nadvocate for his State. And that is an understatement. He has served as \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, and now emeritus. He has been a \nsenior member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees. \nHe has been heavily involved, as I know, in the Appropriations \nCommittee, Homeland Security Committee, and Rules Committee.\n  That is where I have become so well acquainted with Ted Stevens, is \non the Appropriations Committee. I had the good fortune of helping on \nthe floor on a number of appropriations bills. I consider a mark of \ndistinction and something I will always remember my\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nHulk tie Senator Stevens gave me. I don't know anyone else he gave one \nto, but it was his way of saying thanks for getting that appropriations \nbill done; I liked the way you worked to get it done.\n\n  Events have transpired in Senator Stevens' life these past 2 years \nthat are deeply unfortunate. He and I had a number of conversations \nabout what was going on. I wish nothing but the best for Ted, \nCatherine, and his daughter, whom I have known since she was a little \ngirl, now a distinguished lawyer.\n  Although I said in the past that Senator Stevens flew in World War II \nwith the Flying Tigers, on the Senate floor he will always be \nremembered as a lion.\n  I have two final stories. I was a brandnew Senator, and my friend \nAlan Bible died. Alan Bible served the State of Nevada with distinction \nfor 20 years. A military aircraft was provided to take those who wished \nto go to Nevada for the funeral. There were two people on that \nairplane--Harry Reid and Ted Stevens. Think about that. We flew to \nReno, NV, for a funeral. We went out and back in 1 day. It takes 5 \nhours to go out that way and 5 hours to come back.\n  I said--and I was a new Senator: Senator Stevens, why are you on the \nairplane? I framed it a little differently than that. He said: I have a \nlong memory. The Alaska pipeline bill would not have passed but for \nAlan Bible. It was very hard for him to make up his mind what he wanted \nto do, and when he did, he was the culminating vote that allowed that \nto pass. He said: I had to go to Reno to honor what Alan Bible did for \nme.\n  Finally, everyone knows I have a unique relationship with Dan Inouye. \nWhen he ran for leader, I supported him above anyone else. I did it \nbecause he had been so good to me personally and, I felt, good to the \nSenate. And, of course, I admired this man for what he had done for our \ncountry, not only in the House of Representatives and in the Senate but \nas a soldier in Italy where he was badly wounded.\n  It doesn't take much intelligence to understand that the most secure, \nlasting friendship in this Senate and one that probably is a friendship \nI have never seen before is the one with Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye. Terms are thrown around a lot: ``He's my brother.'' With Dan \nInouye and Ted Stevens, they are brothers.\n  The Bible tells us in the Old Testament: ``Two are better than one; \nbecause they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the \none will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he \nfalleth, for he hath not another to help him up.'' Dan Inouye may not \nbe the most powerful physical person in the world, but I think he is \nthe most powerful friend a person could have. And as Scripture \nindicates, he will always be there for his friend, Ted Stevens.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senate colleagues, how does one sum up \nthe extraordinary accomplishments of the longest serving Republican \nSenator in U.S. history? The majority leader has summarized Senator \nStevens' career, but I think there is a way to measure it and to \nsummarize it that is even shorter. I think it is safe to say, without \nany fear of contradiction, there is no Senator in the history of the \nUnited States who has ever done more for his State than Senator Ted \nStevens. Alaska would not be what it is today----\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But for him.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So we say farewell to our friend from Alaska and wish \nhim well in coming years. He can always be proud of the fact that no \nSenator in the history of this country has ever done more for his State \nthan Senator Ted Stevens.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right, Ted. That is right.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to speak this morning from \nthe perspective of an Alaskan. Sometimes it is not appropriate for a \nwoman to acknowledge her age, but when Senator Stevens first came to \nthis body, I was 11 years old. Senator Stevens, Ted Stevens, has been \n``Alaska'' in this Senate for four decades now. Many Senators earn \ntheir place in the history of their States during the course of service \nin the Senate. But by the time Ted came to the Senate back in 1968, he \nhad already earned his place in Alaskan history. He had earned his \nplace in Alaska's history for his work a decade earlier.\n  As an Interior Department attorney in the late 1950s, Ted was the \nEisenhower administration's point man on Alaska statehood. Well, this \nyear, our State is celebrating its 50th anniversary of statehood. But \nfor the persistence of Ted Stevens at that time, our statehood \nanniversary date might be celebrated some years off in the future. It \nwas that persistence that Ted brought to the Senate.\n  Historians will record the life of Ted Stevens and the history of \npost-statehood Alaska and suggest they are all interwoven. But I think \nthere is an easier way to express that. When I think of the good \nthings, the positive things, that have come to Alaska in the past 50 \nyears, I see the face and I see the hands of Ted Stevens in so many of \nthem.\n  Some of them are so small, like a washeteria for Golovin, a village \nof 67 people people near Nome. Ted Stevens, through funding from the \nDenali Commission, has enabled that village to have that washeteria. \nYou might not think much of that, but when you don't have a water and \nsewer system and you don't have a place for basic sanitary services, \nproviding a washing facility in a little community is a big deal.\n  There are also the big projects, whether it is our 800-mile trans-\nAlaska pipeline that Senator Stevens helped to create or the settlement \nof our Alaska Native land claims, the fact that we have F-22s at \nElmendorf Air Force Base, or a compromise recently that allowed Eielson \nAir Force Base to remain a vibrant and strategic center for our \nmilitary. And then the big things that are yet to come, as we are \nworking to advance a natural gas pipeline to bring that energy source \nto the lower 48. We will also have a new VA outpatient clinic in \nAnchorage that Ted has been responsible for.\n  When Alaskans think about the difficult debates, the issues Congress \nhas dealt with over the years as they relate to Alaska--and primarily \nthese are debates where the Nation has sought to tell Alaskans what we \nshould be doing to manage our lands, to develop our economies, to live \nour lives. Every time there has been an argument, a debate, a victory, \nit has been the forceful voice of Ted Stevens defending the right of \nAlaskans that prevails.\n  We all knew when he would come to the floor wearing his Incredible \nHulk tie, he was fighting a battle for Alaska that day, and look out. \nWhether it was our timber issues or the battle over ANWR or our \nfisheries, he was there working, fighting, compromising, negotiating \nthese battles for the State of Alaska.\n  There are a lot of things we know about Ted and his passions, as he \nhas demonstrated them here on the floor, but there are some other \nthings you might not know about Senator Stevens and what drives him, \nsuch as his care and his passion and support for world-class fishing \nout on the Kenai River, his support for public broadcasting, which \nearned him two national awards, and his undying commitment for the \nOlympic movement and amateur athletics.\n  Somebody mentioned it would take a long time to enumerate the \naccomplishments of Ted Stevens. Mr. Majority Leader, I might suggest \nthat in order to do that, it would take as long as it took you when you \nread your book about Searchlight on the floor when I was sitting in the \nPresiding Officer's chair. We don't have time to do that this morning, \nand that is not my purpose today. But I would like to refer to Ted's \naccomplishments in two small areas to illustrate a point I wish to make \nabout his character and his personal commitment to public service. \nThese are in the areas of what he has done to improve the lives of \nAlaska's Native people and also his legacy to America's fisheries.\n  It is often said a society is judged by the way it treats its most \nvulnerable members, and it is appropriate we judge the character of our \nelected leaders in a similar way. In Alaska, the most vulnerable among \nus are our Alaska Native people--the 120,000 or so Aleuts, Eskimos, and \nIndians who are the descendants of Alaska's first inhabitants. We \nrecognize that the statistics\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\nabout the condition of our Alaskan Natives are not something of which \nwe are proud, with incomes that are half of other Alaskans and high \nrates of domestic violence, suicide, child abuse, violent deaths, and a \nprison rate among our population which is not acceptable.\n  For decades, Alaska's most vulnerable people have had no better \nfriend than Ted Stevens. If you go to Ted's Web site, it lists his \nmilestone legislative accomplishments, and 8 of the 13 are directed to \nimproving the conditions of Alaska's first people. So many of them are \nso basic. You have all heard the stories; Ted has stood on the floor \nand talked about the economic conditions we face--the fact that we \ndon't have road systems, the fact we have to fly to most of the \nvillages or go by boat--but the reality is that in so many of our \ncommunities, in so many of our villages, we still don't have basic \nwater and sanitation for those who live there. Before Ted Stevens came \nto the Senate, many of these villages had no running water, no flush \ntoilets, no plumbing, no place to wash clothes or take a shower--the \nbasic needs when it comes to sanitation and health.\n  In so many instances, our Native people have lived, and some still \nlive, in what could be called Third World conditions, conditions that \nwouldn't be tolerated anywhere in this country, and conditions that Ted \nStevens would not tolerate. He determined he was going to change it and \nhe did. In 1980, only about 20 percent of the rural houses in Alaska \nhad indoor sanitation facilities. Thanks to Ted Stevens, that \npercentage has risen to well over 75 percent. Now, we still have a ways \nto go, but what he has done is pretty remarkable.\n  Talking about health improvements and conditions, it is almost \nimpossible to recruit health professionals to our small and remote \nareas. So Ted looked into the future and wondered how we were going to \nprovide access, how we were going to provide for the needs of those who \nlive out here. And he said: Well, let's think ahead, and he brought \nstatewide telemedicine. It is the backbone of what we have in Alaska in \nterms of how we provide for our health care needs. It is the largest \ntelemedicine program in the world. It gives first responders an ability \nto consult with doctors in the larger cities. Thanks to Ted Stevens, \npeople's lives have been saved. He has made an enormous difference in \nour community. He has championed the construction of hospitals in our \nrural hubs out in Kotzebue, Barrow, Nome, and Dillingham. He has \nbrought about the community health centers and health clinics.\n  I know a lot of you have had an opportunity to come to Alaska, and \nyour first stop is the airport in Anchorage, and you notice that the \nairport is named after Ted Stevens. Well, you might not know that there \nis a large monument at the entrance to the Alaska Native Medical Center \nthat has been erected to remind Alaskans that this facility would not \nhave been possible without the work of Ted Stevens. So our Alaska \nNatives today enjoy an integrated, high quality health care system \nthanks to Ted Stevens.\n  This is important for us to remember because so much of what we see \nin the Senate, the record that is created, we don't have the \nopportunity to see how that translates to the people Ted Stevens has \nrepresented for some 40 years.\n  Other areas he has worked for Alaska's Natives involve work to \npreserve their cultural lifestyles through preservation of their \nsubsistence traditions and making sure the Inupiaq people can continue \ntheir whaling and helping with economic opportunities and reducing \ntransportation costs. We are seeing a migration from our smaller \nvillages into our larger cities, but I can tell you, without the \nlifestyle improvements Ted Stevens has brought to rural Alaska, our \nNative people would have left their villages decades ago. So I wish to \nthank you, Ted, for all you have done there.\n  I mentioned the fishery resource, and Senator Stevens himself \nmentioned that in his comments, but it was nearly 40 years ago that Ted \njoined with Warren Magnuson and developed a new management regime for \nour fisheries. This was at a time when our fisheries in the United \nStates, including Alaska, were heavily overfished by foreign fleets. \nThe Magnuson-Stevens Act helped put America back in the fishing \nindustry. This legislation also created the Regional Fishery Management \nCouncil. It is largely responsible for the development of Alaska's \nsustainable fisheries. We are very proud of the fact that to this day \nwe supply about half the seafood that is caught in this country.\n  It was at Ted Stevens' insistence that the United States negotiated \nan agreement to stop the illegal fishing in the international waters of \nthe Bering Sea. This agreement has restored the Alaska pollock fishery \nfrom near collapse. He has been an absolute champion of ocean \nconservation. He pushed the U.N. to ban high seas drift net fishing, a \npractice that was devastating our salmon fisheries. Alaska fishermen \nwill never forget Ted Stevens, the conservationist, the advocate who \nhas truly helped bring our fisheries where they are.\n  Ted's departure from the Senate truly leaves a void in our hearts and \nsome very big shoes to fill here in the Senate. There are a lot of us \nin Alaska who are wondering if anyone can fill these shoes. We agonize \nover whether the Federal Government's interest in Alaska is going to \ndwindle without Ted here to fight for us. But I am optimistic, Ted, \nthat is not going to be the case.\n  You have said many times in speeches you have given here on the floor \nand back at home--you voiced the words of GEN Billy Mitchell back in \n1935 when he said:\n\n       I believe that, in the future, whoever holds Alaska will \n     hold the world. . . . I think it is the most important \n     strategic place in the world.\n\n  Those words of Billy Mitchell, I think you and I agree, hold true \ntoday. Alaska continues to provide this top cover for the defense of \nthe North American Continent. Our troops tell us our communities in \nAlaska support the military like nowhere else in the country. The \nheartfelt appreciation is genuine. We offer unencumbered military \ntraining areas that are simply not available anywhere else. Our \nresources--our natural gas, our mineral resources--will support and \ncontinue to support America's national security for generations to \ncome.\n  Through his investments in the development of our State and our \npeople, Ted Stevens has helped to prepare Alaska to meet its future \nchallenges. We are a strong and confident and skilled people, and we \nare empowered--we are empowered by all Ted's work has brought to us \nover 40 years of service in the Senate.\n  While Ted may leave this body, I think all of us will continue to \nseek his advice, his counsel, and his wisdom for as long as he is \nwilling to offer it.\n  Ted, you have earned a very special place in the golden hearts of \nAlaskans, and you hold a very special place in my heart. Thank you for \nyour service to Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, all of us realize the events of recent \nweeks have been less than pleasant and at times dismal and \nheartbreaking. But to my friend, I say stand tall, Ted, because you \nhave every reason to do so. Your good and courageous service to our \nNation is part of our history. It can never be obliterated. Your \nservice to the people of Alaska is legendary, and I am certain that in \ndecades to come, Native Alaskans--Eskimos and Indians--will be singing \nyou songs of praise. But above all, I thank you for your four decades \nof friendship. I will cherish them. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate President pro tempore is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been thinking, while sitting here \nlistening to the eloquent remarks of the senior Senator from Alaska on \nthis day, I have been here a long time, and so has he, the Senator from \nAlaska, although he is just a youngster compared to me. Some in this \ntown would say we have both lived too long.\n  A long life is a blessing for many reasons. One of the reasons is one \nlearns a lot. One learns to take the bad with the good. One learns to \nseparate the phonies from the friends. One learns that family is the \nmost important gift. One learns to appreciate small, special moments \nand the really good things in life--like a good laugh, a good cry, a \ngood dog, and a good meal.\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\n  Politics is a rough business, with lots of highs and lots of lows. \nAfter a long time in politics, I come to understand that the point of \nit all is helping people. Ted Stevens has helped a lot of people.\n  We all make mistakes. I have made more of them than I have hair \nfollicles. But thank God we will be judged in the next world by the \ngood we do in this world. Ted Stevens has done a lot of good.\n  I wish for you, my friend Ted Stevens, many happy years. I know you \nwill never stop working for the people of your beloved State of Alaska. \nBless your heart, Ted. I love you.\n  I offer an Irish blessing: May all the roads that you have built, \nTed, rise up to meet you, and may the wind, Ted, be always at your \nback. May the Sun shine warmly upon your face, Ted, and may the rains \nfall softly upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold \nyou, Ted, in the hollow of His hand.\n  Bless your heart, Ted. I love you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise now because I look around and I \ndon't think there is any Senator left on the floor who has served \nlonger than I with him. He has had his 40; I have had my 36.\n  Senator, I just want to say this to you. The Constitution of the \nUnited States said that there will be a difference between the Senate \nand the House. They said the way to get a constitution is to make sure \nthey provide that individually the States would be adequately \nrepresented. And they said: We will make sure of that by creating a \nU.S. Senate where two Senators represent the State.\n  My friend, I want to say to you, obviously I have traveled a little \nbit different path in my 36 years, but many times the paths have \ncrossed--you and this Senator. I do want to say that, more than anyone \nelse, you have taught me the meaning of representing my State. You are \nunabashed about that. That caused me on many occasions to think about \nwhat I was doing and whether I was representing my State correctly, to \nthe full extent of my ability, and whether I did that with gusto, \nknowing that we needed things. For we are comparable in that we are a \nvery poor State. We are among the last that came in, and we have many \nof the same problems you have.\n  It has truly been a luxury of my life to work with you, to see how \nyou got things done, and, from time to time, to be able to help you \nbecause you asked--you were unabashed in that regard too--to help your \nState. You would ask any of us to join you in your cause, and most of \nus did that willingly.\n  Mr. BYRD. You bet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But, Senator, I wish to say just a word to the people \nof your State.\n  We know Ted Stevens as a Senator representing you people. A big event \nhas occurred in the life of Ted Stevens that you people of Alaska quite \nproperly have been involved in. But none of us who have worked with him \ncould let this day pass with anyone not knowing--whether they be in \nAlaska, a Native of Alaska or resident of Alaska or a Native, true \nNative--all of you must know of the high respect and great esteem in \nwhich we hold your Senator. We are most grateful that you sent him here \nfor 40 years. For some of us, it ends too abruptly, but every ride \nseems to have an end.\n  All I hope is, with what you have left in your life, that you will \nfeel this day is a special one, when Senators have put their hearts out \nhere on the Senate floor to tell you who you were to them, what you \nmeant to them. I hope I have done my share in my few moments. Nobody \nwill know how many times we have talked and met, how many times you and \nI have shared personal things and gone on with our own business, but we \nwere certain to mention our personal problems along with it, things we \nwanted to share as men. I thank you for every bit of that.\n  To the extent that some of our prayers and the prayers of some of our \nrelatives whom I asked personally to pray for you--I hope it has had \nsome good. I hope when you were down, you were lifted a bit. I hope \nthat today you are going to be lifted more so that you can stand what \nis ahead of you with a high head and come out of it with more of the \nsuccesses of your life right out in front of you for you to feel and \ntouch, as those hard issues still remain.\n  Thank you for your friendship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, much that has been true and honest has \nbeen said by our colleagues this morning to support and pay tribute to \nthe unique, the great and historic service of Senator Ted Stevens to \nAlaska and to our country. I will come back to that, but I wish to take \na moment to speak about Ted Stevens as a friend and a neighbor.\n  It happened that when I first came to the Senate 20 years ago, our \nwives, Catherine and Hadassah, became friends. As usual, they led us in \nthe right direction--which is toward each other. In fact, it was \nCatherine and Ted's counsel and urging to Hadassah and me that led us, \nafter 6 years living somewhere else, to the neighborhood we live in \nnow, which is where they used to live. In the last several years, they \nhave come back to that neighborhood.\n  Maybe, beyond the news that comes out of the Senate in Washington and \nthe politics that dominates the news, a lot of people back home and \naround the country do not realize we are actually just normal people--\nwe live in neighborhoods here, we have friends, and we get to know our \nfriends.\n  I speak of Ted in that regard. Once years ago somebody said: What can \nyou tell me about Ted Stevens? I can tell you a lot and others can \nabout what he is like as a Senator. I will tell you this, that Hadassah \nand I talked the other day and we said: Who would we call, of our \ncolleagues in the Senate, if something happened in the family?\n  Now I think about it, it was said at 3 a.m. in the morning. That was \nbefore the commercials in the last campaign. But this was not about a \nnational emergency, this was about something that happened in the \nfamily and you needed somebody's help to come over and watch the kids \nor something such as that. We said we would call Ted and Catherine \nStevens. I never had to make that call, but I have no doubt they would \nhave responded.\n  I have gotten to know Ted Stevens very well. This is a good and \nhonorable man. He is a wise man, reads a lot. And in recent years we \nhave exchanged books, usually adventure novels, with one another. He \nhas a tremendous sense of history, and more than some might appreciate, \nhe has a great sense of humor as well.\n  So I salute him as a good and honorable man, a man of faith who has \nserved our country with great effect. I want to take a moment before I \nclose to talk about the extraordinary service and supportive leadership \nTed Stevens has given to the Armed Forces of the United States and, \ntherefore, to the security of every American, the freedom of every \nAmerican, and I would say the security and freedom of people in \ncountries all over the world who have benefited from the courage of our \nmilitary, the skill of our military, and even more directly because of \nthe support Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye have given to our allies \nmilitarily around the world.\n  The distinguished Republican leader said he could not think of any \nSenator who had done more for his State in the history of the Senate \nthan Ted Stevens has done for Alaska. I would say something else at \nthis moment. Remember, we have constitutional responsibilities that we \nswear to uphold when we take the oath of office as Senators. One of the \ngreat ones, perhaps the first one, which precedes all others, is to \nprovide for the common defense. I honestly cannot think of two Senators \nwho have done more to protect the security of the United States of \nAmerica, and therefore our freedom, than Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye.\n  You know, we talk a lot around here about partisanship. All of us \nagree that there has been too much of it, that it gets in the way of us \ngetting things done. I have been privileged in the years I have been on \nthe Homeland Security Committee to have had a wonderful relationship \nwith Senator Collins, whether she has been chairman or I have been \nchairman. But this relationship between Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye is \nunique. Regardless of which one was in the majority and which was in \nthe so-called minority, these two were cochairs. They shared staff, \nthey helped each other, because the party affiliation ultimately did \nnot matter.\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\n  What did you say your oath was? To hell with politics, I have got to \ndo what is good for Alaska. I am going to say, in so many ways, \nparticularly working with Dan Inouye, you have said throughout this 40 \nyears, particularly in the years you have worked together on the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, to hell with politics, we, Dan \nInouye and I, are going to do what is good for America.\n  I salute you for that. I thank you for that. I love the fact that you \nsaid in your remarks that you are confident God has more work for you \nto do. I share that confidence and that faith. I wish you and your \nwonderful family, your beloved wife Catherine and your children, all of \nGod's blessings in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I remember the first time I met Ted Stevens. It was back \nin 1976 when I was a young candidate for office, citizen candidate, \nhardly knew where the Senate floor was. I have loved and admired him \never since. We have been in the presence of three great senior lions in \nthe Senate. Bob Byrd, as we all know, has served this Senate many \nyears. And I love these three people.\n  Dan Inouye. I admire him so much for the courage, honor, and \nfriendship he has displayed to so many of us. But above all, to Ted \nStevens. Ted Stevens is truly one of the greatest Senators who ever sat \nhere. All three of them are. They have been exemplary to all of us, but \nespecially me.\n  I have watched them. I have learned from them. Hopefully I have not \nheard the last of my dear friend Ted. Ted Stevens personifies a person \nwith real guts, with real ability, that dedication to his State, \ndedication to every person in his State regardless of politics, \nreligion, or anything else. He has worked his behind off for 40 years, \nand actually longer than that, in public service--one of the greatest \nmen I have ever met.\n  I always loved him when he wore the Incredible Hulk tie. I always got \na big kick out of it. I even liked his crankiness, because there was \nalways a little smile behind it. He never held a grudge against \nanybody, and he was always willing to lend a helping hand and give good \nadvice.\n  Frankly, I admire him so much. Ted, I believe this cloud will be \nlifted from you. It should be. The fact is that you are a great man in \na great body here where so few rise to the top level. You really have. \nYou have shown such kindness and graciousness to virtually everybody \nhere, and enough toughness too, when we have needed it. You are a great \nleader. I for one am going to miss you as a Member of this body. I hope \nwe will not miss you as a friend and colleague in the future, because \nyou will always be my colleague. You will always be somebody I look up \nto. You will always be somebody who I learn from. You will always be \nsomebody who has stood for things that count: family, home, State, \ncountry.\n  I do not know if I can say anything much better than that. But all I \ncan say is this is a good man. He deserves to be remembered as a great \nman as well. We all love you. We wish you the best. We hope we continue \nto see a lot of you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of many citizens \nof Washington State who are friends of the Senator from Alaska. On \ntheir behalf today, I say thank you for all of the work that you have \ndone for your neighbor to the South.\n  Obviously, everyone here has listed the many accomplishments of the \nsenior Senator from Alaska in his many decades of service. We are a \nState that considers Alaska a neighbor. He has been an ally of ours \nmany times over, and throughout his long service in serving his own \nState, has also helped the citizens I represent. I thank him for that \ntoday. I thank him for his years of service on the Appropriations \nCommittee where I watched him as the Chair and ranking member, where \nthough he may be a strong adversary, he also understood that everyone \nhad a right to speak and had a right to offer arguments and respected \nthat. I think that is truly a lesson all of us should remember.\n  But I want to share a lesson that the Senator from Alaska also taught \nme that I think is important for this time as well. Several years ago I \nwas privileged to join the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nHawaii on a delegation trip to China where we met with officials across \nthe country to talk about the important issues facing our country and \nChina.\n  Senator Inouye was called away, and I was left as the senior Democrat \non the trip. We met with leaders from China across the table from us. \nSenator Stevens led many of these meetings but on several occasions \nturned to me to ask me to lead those. As we were leaving China, I \nthanked him for that respect he gave me in front of our delegation and \nin front of theirs. He said to me he thought it was important that the \npeople of China see that even though we have two different parties here \nwith very strong opinions we respect each other and out of that respect \nare able to lead this country facing the challenges we have in front of \nus.\n  He used that as a lesson to China, but it was a lesson to me as well, \nthat we do have two strong parties, but in the end we serve the people \nof America, and we do it by respecting each other. So I stand today and \njoin my colleagues in thanking the Senator from Alaska for being the \nleader he has been here, for the work he has done, and wish him the \nvery best in his future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first impressions are always important. I \nthink many times they are completely false. I was a Member of the House \nwhen I first met Ted Stevens. It was at a retreat our party was having, \nand I sat there wondering what on Earth makes this man tick. Here was \nthe most obstreperous if not outrageous person expressing his opinion, \ndespite any other person who had an objection, who insisted on making \nhis point.\n  I went away from that meeting and said: That Ted Stevens fellow is \none of the most unique people I have ever met. I would just as soon not \nmeet him again. Then I found out that he was running for leadership of \nthe Republican party in this distinguished body against my friend and \ncolleague, mentor, hero, Bob Dole, and came within one vote. There is a \nstory there, but we will not get into that. And so that was the history \nas I regarded Ted Stevens.\n  I came to the Senate, had the privilege of being elected to the \nSenate in 1996. I was standing right over there. All of a sudden there \nwas Ted Stevens standing in front of me. That was sort of a frightening \nexperience for a new Senator. But he came up and he jabbed his finger \non my chest--Ted, you will not remember this--and he said, ``I know who \nyou are.''\n  I said, ``Well, I sure as hell know who you are.''\n  He said, ``You allegedly know something about agriculture. Bob Dole \ntold me about you, said you were a stand-up guy.''\n  I said, ``Thank you. That is a real compliment.''\n  He said, ``You serve on Armed Services and Intelligence?''\n  I said, ``Yes, sir, I do.''\n  He said, ``How would you like to go to the Russian Far East with \nme?''\n  I thought to myself: Why on Earth would I want to go to the Russian \nFar East?\n  He said, ``We are going to go to Habarodfk. I can assure you, \nHabarodfk is not one of the places that you would want to go to if you \nhad free time to go anywhere.'' And he said, ``Then we are going to go \nto Vladivostok. We are going to meet with the admiral of the Russian \nnavy. He is closer to Alaska than he is to Moscow. I know him.''\n  I thought, this is a man who has unusual relationships with people \nall around the world.\n  ``And then we are going to go to South Korea to meet one of the many \npresidents that come and go in South Korea to indicate our strong \nsupport. But then we are going to be the first delegation allowed into \nNorth Korea.''\n  Well, that got my attention. He said, ``That is why I would like to \nhave you come along, because if we could arrange a third-party grain \nsale''--and I guess this is not classified anymore, but at any rate--\n``arrange a third-party grain sale, and using agriculture as a tool for \npeace, there are things we can do in North Korea to at least establish \na relationship.''\n  This man has tried to do that all around the world with our \nadversaries.\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\nPeople talk about that a lot, that he actually just does it. He does \nnot make any press releases about it, does not talk about it much.\n  So I said, ``Well, sure, I will sign up.''\n  And he said, ``I understand that you are a journalist.''\n  I said, ``Yep, that is an unemployed newsman.''\n  And he said, ``You could be the scribe in regard to this CODEL.'' I \nmight say that any CODEL you went on with Ted Stevens, you always had a \nT-shirt saying: ``I survived CODEL Stevens'' because you would go to \nthe South Pole, you would go to other places, but you didn't go to the \nwater holes where apparently the business executives of our financial \ninstitutions go now to think about things.\n  In any case, we went to Habarovsk where I had a little discussion \nwith Senator Inouye about where we were staying, our accommodations, \nand got to know Danny very well. We went to Vladivostok. We talked to \nthat admiral who felt closer to Ted Stevens than he did the Russian \nGovernment at that particular time. We went to Sakhalin Island. There \nare tremendous oil reserves there. He was trying to work out some kind \nof arrangement where American oil companies could come in and take \nadvantage of all of the oil reserves. We had to work our way through \nthe saber-toothed tigers; I am not making that up.\n  Then we went to South Korea because you have to go to South Korea if \nyou are going to go to North Korea. That is just required. Then we went \ninto North Korea. Darnedest experience I have ever had in my life. It \nwas a situation where that is a theocracy. It is a robotic theocracy. \nIf there is a trudging contest in the Olympics, the North Koreans will \nwin without any question. It was the first delegation allowed into \nNorth Korea. Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens met with the North \nKoreans. It was Senator Cochran who insisted on going to a farm. I say \nthat with a smile. We did that. I will just say from an agricultural \nstandpoint, it was just a field with nothing there except a 1938 Case \ntractor with a camouflage net over it. That sort of tells you where \nthey are: not a Third World country but, as I said, a theocracy. But \nback to the story. It was about 11 or 12 midnight. This was a very \nunusual trip. We left everything on the plane, and we stayed at an \nalleged VIP headquarters. There wasn't any heat. I won't go into all \nthat.\n  At any rate, this discussion had gone on and on and on, and there was \nan interpreter with the two people with whom we were meeting. We had \nhoped to meet with Kim Jong-il. That was not possible. So he sent two \nof his puppets down there to meet with us. They were just going back \nand forth with propaganda and we were serious. We had permission from \nthe Treasury to waive certain requirements so we could arrange for a \nthird party grain sale to assist North Korea which goes through a \nfamine every harvesting year. In response, we could ask for other \nthings.\n  So you had two World War II veterans who told these two individuals: \nWe are World War II veterans. We want to make Pammunjon a tourist \nattraction. We want to make real progress about that. Finally, Ted had \nit up to here. He said: Knock off the BS. I know you understand \nEnglish. Just take the interpreter out of it and let's get to the \nbottom line.\n  The bottom line was that they couldn't do anything. They were there \nto learn what we were about. They really couldn't make any decisions. \nThat was a real lost opportunity at that particular time. I will never \nforget his leadership.\n  At any rate, I would just like to say on another CODEL, I don't even \nknow which one it was, we landed at 11 and we got to the hotel about \nmidnight. This man is a great connoisseur of military movies, military \nhistory, almost any other movie. He is a great devotee of that great \ndocumentary ``Band of Brothers.'' So we were playing ``Band of \nBrothers'' to virtually staff and to all present. And this is at 12:30 \nat night. We had reached episode 5; we were going to episode 6. So \nthere we all were. And, of course, it was playing and playing. I looked \naround. All the staff were asleep. Loyal, they were still there, but \nthey were asleep. Then all the Members who were still there, because \nyou didn't leave in regards to the Stevens entourage and whatever \nperformance he decided that we should see, so consequently, I was \nhaving a hard time keeping my eyelids open.\n  I looked over at him and his eyes were closed. I thought, the great \nman has his eyes closed. Everybody else is asleep. So I will get up, \nthe scribe of the CODEL, and look around and gently turn off the \ntelevision and then I can gently wake him up and say: ``Ted, it is \npretty late, 1 o'clock. We all ought to go to bed.''\n  As I reached for the button to turn off the power, he said: ``This \nnext part is the best part.'' He wasn't watching it; he was listening \nbecause he had seen it about three times. Well, needless to say, we saw \nepisode 6 in its entirety. Thank the Lord, we didn't go into episode 7. \nWe would have been there all night.\n  Let me just say, I was present for the ceremonies in Alaska when Ted \nwas named the Alaskan of the Century. How can a sitting Senator or a \nsitting Member of Congress or anybody get citizen approval or approval \nfrom his State or accolades from his State at that particular time. But \nhe was Alaskan of the Century. His name was everywhere. I told him the \nAnchorage Daily News should have been the ``Ted Stevens News.''\n  But I had the unique privilege of roasting this man, which I enjoyed \nthoroughly, and then got pretty serious toward the end. At any rate, he \nflew in on a World War II plane. He had his combat jacket. He came in \nwith Catherine and took his place on two very posh chairs. And I quoted \nagain that saying he has said, and it has been said today by the \nSenator himself and by others: ``The hell with politics; let's do what \nis good for Alaska.'' I will add: And the country and our national \ndefense and for every man and woman in uniform; they owe this man a \ngreat debt. That is a true thing that he has done in terms of his \nservice.\n  I am a journalist. I am an old newspaper guy. My great-grandfather \nfounded the second oldest newspaper in the State of Kansas, John Wesley \nRoberts. He was an abolitionist. I have printer's ink in my blood. The \nonly thing I would say to my fellow colleagues who have now left the \ngalleries because the show is over, or at least up to this point, I \nwould only say to my colleagues that I don't know who sang the song, \n``You Don't Know Me.'' Maybe that was Patsy Cline; maybe it was \nsomebody else. I will have to Google it. But at any rate, you don't \nknow him. You really don't know him. This is a man with a very gruff \nexterior, but he is a teddy bear when you really get to know him. I \nknow that because that is exactly what my daughter labeled him when she \nworked part-time for him some years ago.\n  As a matter of fact, she called him the mad penguin. She never called \nhim that to his face. I don't know if you knew that or not, Ted. But \nthat was the label.\n  So under this great, gruff facade--i.e., the mad penguin--there is a \ncompassionate, caring, wise and, yes, a man with a very good sense of \nhumor which I enjoyed immensely.\n  When you come to this body and you come to public service, you know \nthat you risk your ideas, your thoughts, your hopes, and your dreams \nbefore the crowd. Sometimes the crowd says yes, and you have friends \nwho will stand behind you when you are taking the bows. Then when \nsomething happens in your life, when it is most unfortunate--and my \nfamily has experienced this as well--you wonder where your friends are \nwho will stand beside you when you are taking the boos as opposed to \nthe bows.\n  I want to tell you that being the Alaskan of the Century and the \nAlaskan or the Senator who has done so much for the country and my \nState of Kansas, I stand next to you, Ted, and as many have said: You \nare a dear friend. I love you. God bless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I so appreciate hearing the many \nstories that Ted Stevens has generated in this body. He has been a \nfriend to everyone who has served all of the time with him. People say: \nTed took care of Alaska. Ted did take care of Alaska. But from my \nstandpoint, what I saw is that Ted made sure that every State was taken \ncare of, that every Senator's priorities were met, if at all possible. \nHe\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\ntook care of the military. He took care of upgrading the military bases \nbecause, of course, he served in the military. And he wanted more than \nanything for our military people to have the quality of life they \ndeserved. So I see him as someone who has been what people say is so \nrare in this city, and that is a true friend.\n  It has been mentioned a couple of times that he has a gruff exterior. \nWhen I see pictures of him in the newspaper and he is looking like \nthis, it is not the Ted Stevens we know. It is not the person who has \nendeared himself to our colleagues for years and years and years in the \nSenate. That is his manner, but I always said behind his back: He is \nall bark and no bite. He is the most loyal friend and the person you \ncould go to when you needed advice, as I know his great colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, has done many times, as have I, but also \nwhen you needed help.\n  I, too, have traveled with Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye because I was \nfortunate enough, with Ted's help, to get on the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee. So we went to the garden spots of the world such as Bosnia, \nwhen the Serbs had been shooting from the hills, and when we went \nundercover with flight jackets, undercover of delivering 2,000 pounds \nof peas to the many refugees who were in Bosnia at the time. We came \ninto the Sarajevo airport with our helmets on and our flight jackets. \nOf course, it was a war-torn city. We saw later, when we went there, \nthe former Olympic fields that were burial grounds because they had no \nplace else to put the people who had died in these terrible, tragic \ncircumstances in Bosnia.\n  I went with Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye to Saudi Arabia where I was \ntold later that it was actually discouraged that a woman would be in a \ndelegation. But Ted Stevens said: No way was there ever going to be \ndiscrimination against a Senator. I was a part of that delegation. I \nwent to our airbase there. I went and met with everyone we met with as \na delegation. I spoke in my turn, just as every member of our \ndelegation did, because Ted Stevens was always going to stand up for \nthe right of every Senator to be a part of a foreign delegation.\n  I went to the farm bureau air show with Ted Stevens. There is nothing \nmore joyous than Ted Stevens when he is in an air museum or at an air \nshow. He is an aviator to his core. He asked all the questions. He knew \nmost of the answers already because he knows airplanes and he knows \naviation.\n  I know what this man has been through for the last few months. I know \nthe toll it takes on himself and his family.\n\n  I am proud to stand with Ted Stevens because I value his friendship \nand all he has done for me in my term in the Senate and what he has \ndone for Texas every time I have needed for Texas to be taken care of.\n  I will say two things in conclusion about Ted Stevens. His country \nhas never called that he has not answered the call--from the military, \nto being in the Eisenhower administration, to fighting for Alaska to be \na State, and then fighting to make Alaska a great State. It is a great \nState.\n  It would not be the State it is without your leadership, Ted.\n  But I want to say the most important thing I think you could say \nabout anyone you know; that is, those who know him best love him most.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay honor to Senator Ted Stevens \nof Alaska. While our country may not realize this, Ted has been a great \nadvocate on a number of important issues for our country. Reminding our \ncountry of its responsibility to its indigenous people has been one of \nthe major causes that Ted Stevens has pursued and advanced. It has been \na delight to work with him to expand opportunities and help our \nindigenous peoples of the noncontiguous States of Alaska and Hawaii, as \nwell as those across the country.\n  We have worked well together to improve the lives of Federal \nemployees. We tried hard this Congress to enact meaningful reforms on \ntelework opportunities in the Federal Government and, most importantly, \nto provide retirement equity to Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, \nand the territories by extending locality pay to those areas. Your \nleadership on those issues was invaluable to our efforts to move the \nbills forward. Thank you for your efforts to expand opportunities for \nFederal employees.\n  Also, I want to mention something that is probably an unknown part of \nhistory, and that is a number of years ago I discovered that since 1965 \nthe model of the Statue of Freedom was in storage at the Smithsonian. I \nworked to try to bring that statute here to the Capitol, and I was \nhaving a hard time with that until Ted Stevens joined me. With his help \nwe were able to move that statue from storage in the Smithsonian to the \nCapitol.\n  It was, as you may now know, the model which was erected in the \nRussell rotunda. I am pleased to say that on December 2, 2008, the new \nCapitol Visitor Center will be dedicated and that Statue of Freedom \nwill be placed between the two escalators that will lead to the \nCapitol. For me and for Ted Stevens, this symbolizes that freedom is \nreturning to the Capitol of the United States. And on December 2, 2008, \nthe Center will be open and the Statue of Freedom will be an eminent \npart of the Visitor Center.\n  I thank Ted Stevens for all the help that he has given us in Hawaii \nand other States. He has brought strength and passion to the Senate and \nhas been a constant presence in this institution. And for Millie and \nme, Ted, I want to say aloha, and a warm aloha and mahalo nui loa to \nyou for all the friendship that we have had and continue to have. I \nwant to say God bless you and Catherine and your family in the years \nahead.\n  Mahalo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I think the length of my service is a \nblink of the eye compared to those who have spoken before. And as I \nstand here, I cannot tell you whether it is going to be two blinks.\n  But I was on the CODEL with the Senator from Washington. We were in \nChina with Senator Stevens, and I would like to offer some insight, if \nI can, as to the question raised by my colleague from Kansas as to what \nmakes Ted Stevens tick.\n  When we were in China, Senator Stevens was treated as a hero. And he \nis a hero because of his service in World War II. He flew under General \nChennault and went over, I think it was, the China-India-Burma bump. He \nlanded in places in China to refurbish supplies, ammunition, I think, \nbring in intelligence sources, as described to me, where landing fields \nwere cut out. There may have been a foot on one side and a foot on the \nother side, and this young guy was flying in there because he loved his \ncountry.\n  When we talk about Ted Stevens and his service to our country--so \nmany talk about 40 years in the Senate--as I reflected on who that \nyoung guy was, flying in there with absolute fearlessness, with \ncourage, with love of country, he is the same guy. He is the same guy. \nThat is what he has given to this country his entire adult life, and it \nhas been given in great service to this country. I think that is pretty \nspecial.\n  He has the veneer of a tough guy. And Ted Stevens can be tough. There \nis no question about that. But those of us who know him also see the \nlove, the love that is in his heart, reflected in love of country, but \nlove of family, love for his magnificent wife, love for his daughter. \nYou see the gleam in his eye anytime he talks about her or she is in \nhis presence. We see the love he has for this body, the love he has for \nhis colleagues, even, by the way, for those with whom he disagrees. I \nhave not been on the side of ANWR with my colleague from Alaska. But if \nyou simply\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\ntell him where you are and you give your word and live by that, he is \nalways there with you.\n  Senator Smith is not with us today, but few of us will ever forget \nwhen he stood on the floor of this Senate after the tragic death of his \nson and reflected upon the support of his colleagues and took special \nnote of the fact that he was not with Ted Stevens on the most important \nissue to Ted at that time: ANWR. Yet when Senator Smith suffered \ntragedy in his life, who was the first person to step up to try to \nprovide support, to try to ensure that cause get there? It was Senator \nStevens.\n  That is the person we know. He has given his entire adult life to \nservice to this Nation--extraordinary service to this Nation--and he \nhas done it with fearlessness, courage, love, and commitment, as with \neverything he did as a young man. He has never lost any of those \nqualities, and we see them today. This Nation has been blessed by his \nservice, and many of us have been blessed by his friendship, and we \nwish him our very best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon with \ntremendously mixed emotions to visit with all of you and with our \ncountry about Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.\n  Many have said much about this great man. I will not say a great \ndeal, but I will try to express it in an emotional way for a fellow I \nhave known of for 28 years and have known personally for 18 years.\n  So let me visit for a moment as a westerner, as somebody from a \npublic lands State, where the Federal Government is, in many instances, \ndominant over the lives of small communities and citizens in a way that \nmost of you from nonpublic lands States wouldn't ever appreciate. I \nknow that passion. I, every day of my life, in working with Ted \nStevens, sensed that passion in a way that if you are not from a public \nlands State, if you do not have an agency or a bureaucrat dictating to \nyou about the lives of your citizens and your people, you would simply \nnever understand.\n  But Ted grasped that early on and without question has been the \nchampion of his State and their citizens in a way that no other Senator \nhas been. I have so tremendously respected that.\n  I have been in and out of Alaska several times in my tenure as a \nSenator or as a Congressman. I will close with an expression given to \nme by a cab driver in Anchorage that says more to me about this man \nthan anything I could possibly say myself.\n  I was en route from downtown Anchorage, Ted, to the Ted Stevens \nInternational Airport. We rounded the curve and pulled up. As I exited \nthe cab, I looked up, and there was your name. I said: Oh, my, Ted's \ngot an airport. That is neat.\n  And the cab driver said, ``Do you know Uncle Ted?''\n  I said, ``Well, yes, I do. I work for him in the Senate.''\n  He said ``You do?''\n  I said ``Sure do.''\n  He said, ``Give him my best when you get back to Washington because, \nas an Alaskan, I know of no other person who has done more for my State \nthan Uncle Ted.''\n  Well, Ted Stevens now knows why I call him Uncle Ted more often than \nnot. I view that as a much more affectionate term than Senator Stevens \nbecause, as I was flying out of that great State and headed down the \ncoast, looking off to my left at those phenomenal mountains and \nexpanses of wilderness and public lands and resources, I thought: If \nany one person deserves the credit for taking this phenomenal region of \nour world and providing reasonable points of life for so many of its \ncitizens, it is Uncle Ted Stevens.\n  Uncle Ted, I am going to miss you. This Senate will miss you. Your \nState will miss you. And America will miss you.\n  Thank you for your service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of coming to \nthe Congress in 1987 as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nTherefore, I did not get to mingle and get to know Ted Stevens really \nwell--just in conferences. If you want to get through to the other side \nof Ted Stevens--not the one we have heard about so much on the floor \ntoday--go to a conference with Ted Stevens, and he will defend his \nissues and his particular beliefs in that conference as good as anyone \nI know of these 100 people who are in the Senate.\n  But then, in 1998, I had the good fortune of being elected to the \nSenate. When you come to the Senate for the first time, and you have \nhad an encounter with Ted Stevens in any manner, it is kind of like: \nOh, my God, is he really that tough to deal with all the time or is \nthat a facade we see?\n  Well, I have gotten to know, over the last 10 years, the true Ted \nStevens. If you want someone who represents America representing you in \nthe Senate, it is Ted Stevens--not only for his State, for the defense \nof our country, for the principles of the United States on which we \nstand, our Founders embedded in Ted Stevens' mind, but for all the \nother things this country stands for: the goodness of its people, \ngiving to others, allowing them to get to know you to the point of \nchanging that gruff outside into pure love. I have found Ted Stevens to \nbe the most straightforward, honest Senator I have ever dealt with. He \nhas given me, just by association for the last 10 years, the basis on \nwhich I serve here in the Senate. He has given me the example. He has \ngiven me the principles and the things that each and every one of us \nhere on the Senate floor should demonstrate daily. Sure, we all look \nout for our State; he does it better than everyone. Sure, we look out \nfor the United States of America as a whole--and he has done it better \nthan anyone--but for family values or love of family, for love of \nfellow citizens and fellow Senators, this man is a shining example of \nwhat a Senator should be. I will hold his friendship dear until we both \ndie. I thank him for his service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, this is not my desk. I choose to speak \nfrom this place because the vantage point is better, because I will \nalso have something to say about the delightful wife of Senator Ted \nStevens. I am the junior-most Member of this body. I am here today with \nthe junior Senator from Alaska and two of the longest serving Members \nof the Senate. It is almost presumptuous for me to even rise to speak \nat this occasion, but I do so because as the least ranking Member of \nthe Senate, I wish to express my profound respect for Senator Ted \nStevens.\n  The previous speaker, my friend from Kentucky, said one way to get to \nknow Members such as Ted Stevens is to go to a conference with them. As \na Member of the House of Representatives, I had occasion to go to \nconferences sponsored by the Aspen Institute where we would discuss \nmatters of importance to our Nation and to the world. It was at a \nconference in Istanbul on the subject of political Islam that I learned \nabout the keen intellect of Senator Ted Stevens, and also the fact that \na participant in that conference could be less than half Senator \nStevens' age, but he was willing to engage with you, to listen to you, \nto have the give and take you can have in small group sessions such as \nthat. I appreciate the opportunity I had as a Member then of the House \nof Representatives in having that sort of interaction with this great \nman.\n  There has been expression today about the seemingly gruff exterior or \nfacade of the man we speak of today. I will tell my colleagues who he \nis gruff about. He is not too happy about people such as Islamic \njihadists, about the opponents of freedom around the world. He is a \nlittle gruff about anyone around the globe who would wish our country \nill, and he makes no bones about that.\n  I wish to commend Senator Stevens and to express my admiration to him \nfor the good judgment and good fortune he has had in having as a spouse \nsomeone such as Catherine Stevens.\n  I mention two very small stories that I think tell a lot about both \nSenator Stevens and Catherine. We were at this conference and my wife \nwas not able to accompany me. According to the rules, I was able to \nbring my college-age daughter Caroline. It happened that she needed to \ntake an earlier flight to get back and I would stay with the conference \nfor another day. I\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\nfound out later what happened. She said: Daddy, Mrs. Stevens gave me \nsome money before I left. It happened this way: Mrs. Stevens asked \nCaroline how much money she had to make it through the various airports \nand Caroline told her and, as usual, her cheapskate dad had \nshortchanged her. Mrs. Stevens said, That is not enough money, and she \npulled out a couple of hundred dollar bills to make sure Caroline got \nthrough the airport system safely. Here was the wife of the President \npro tempore of the Senate being kind and being careful that a college-\nage girl was well taken care of. I paid the money back, I wish to \nassure my colleagues, but I don't know that I will ever be able to pay \nback the friendship.\n  I have only been in the Senate some 10 months. Early on I offered an \namendment which was important to my State and my region. It was obvious \nthat the amendment did not have the support of a majority. It was going \nto go down and go down in flames, as it did. I was down close to the \nfront and had already abandoned all hope for the amendment passing. I \nam sure Ted does not even remember this, but he walked by the desk \nthere and cast an aye vote for the Wicker amendment. He was one of the \nfew people to do so. Someone was taking Senator Stevens to task for \nvoting yes. He did not know I was listening, but I heard him say, ``I \ndid it to help Wicker.'' I am sure that was the only reason he cast \nthat vote. I can tell my colleagues I appreciated that act of kindness, \njust as I appreciated Catherine Stevens' act of kindness toward my \ndaughter.\n  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said:\n\n       Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives \n     sublime, and departing, leave behind us footprints on the \n     sands of time.\n\n  Now, the junior Senator from Alaska did a wonderful job of outlining \nthe many footprints our friend Ted Stevens has left for both the United \nStates of America and the people specifically of his beloved State of \nAlaska. The people of Alaska will long live better, Alaskans yet unborn \nwill live better because of the efforts of Ted Stevens. Americans today \nand Americans yet unborn will be safer and live freer because of the \nservice and the leadership of Ted Stevens. I am honored down to my \nbones to be able to stand on the floor of the Senate today and pay \ntribute to this great man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have been here to hear \nmost of the comments and remarks of our colleagues about the \ndistinguished career of the Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens. I haven't \nhad a better friend in the Senate than Ted Stevens and his example and \nhis friendship have been very vital to my service in the Senate, and \nthe people of my State have benefited from the relationship I have had. \nSo I am glad to have this opportunity here today, when so many are \nsaying the things that come to their mind and are in their heart about \nthe impact Ted Stevens has had on the work of this Senate and on \nindividual Senators and their careers.\n  I am one of those who had the privilege of being by his side as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. After 2 years in the Senate, I \nwas able to get on that committee and moved up pretty quickly, because \nof the retirements of other Senators, to sit by his side and to benefit \nfrom his example. I am grateful to have had that opportunity, and I \nthank him for his generosity, for his time and his efforts to help \nassure that I was assisted. I tried to be helpful to not only my State \nbut to programs and activities within the Department of Defense that I \nhad strong feelings about and thought were very vital to our national \nsecurity interests. Missile defense comes to mind as one of those \nissues that we dealt with in a way that led our country to move forward \nquickly. Senator Inouye was very much a part of that as well. I think \ntheir experience and the way they worked together served as an example \nto the rest of us as to how working through the committee system of the \nSenate benefits our country and how it is important to this institution \nthat traditions be respected and observed. It is not just for \nprocedural standpoint benefits, but it truly does improve the quality \nof the work and the importance of the influence of the Senate in our \ngovernment today.\n  So I can't say enough in terms of praise and expression of \nappreciation, except that we are going to miss the benefit and the \nexample of Ted Stevens here in this Senate. There is no way around \nthat. We are suffering a loss by his departure from the Senate. We wish \nhim well. We know he is going to be around and we look forward to \ncontinuing the friendship and the opportunities to get advice. He may \nvolunteer some advice that he thinks we might need, and I hope he will. \nI invite him to. We will continue to benefit from his service and the \nthings he has done in his great career to help this institution and our \ngreat country.\n  It is a sad day for me but one that I know he appreciates very much \nin terms of the people who have spoken and the things that have been \nsaid about him. These are words of praise that are very well earned.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there have been some beautiful tributes \nmade to my colleague, the senior Senator from Alaska today, and I am \ncertain that others will be coming to the floor to speak of their \nrelationship, their experiences, and to speak of the good works of \nSenator Stevens. I would encourage them to come to the floor or to \ncertainly submit their written comments for the Record so that Senator \nStevens can have the full opportunity of those, and I ask unanimous \nconsent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to pay a brief \ntribute to our dear friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to say that when I was elected 4 \nyears ago, a gentleman by the name of Mack Mattingly called me on the \ntelephone, a former Senator from 1981 to 1986, and he said, ``Johnny, \nwhen you get to Washington and you get to the Senate, you go meet Ted \nStevens. Ted Stevens is the best friend you will ever have.''\n  I stand here today, 4 years later, telling you he was exactly right. \nThere is not a person in this Chamber you have not been willing to \nhelp. There is not an Alaskan you have not helped. You are a steadfast \nfriend, and you are as tough as nails. I wish to tell you how much I \nappreciate, from the bottom of my heart, what you have done to help me \nand the citizens of Georgia. Your work on Commerce, your work on \nAppropriations, your work on Armed Forces, and your work on the \nmilitary, all of it is important to Georgia. You have been a champion \nall along. You are a true hero.\n  The tributes today are well deserved to a great man, a great Alaskan, \nand a great Senator. God bless you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to say how much \nI have appreciated the friendship of Ted Stevens. He and his wife are a \nwonderful team.\n  Since I was elected a short--to him--12 years ago, it has been truly \nenjoyable to work with Ted on the numerous western issues before this \nbody. Often, those issues correspond to Alaska issues, working for a \nstrong military, missile defense, sound land management practices, \nenergy development. He has been very helpful to Colorado.\n  I have particularly admired his work for our Nation's military. Ted \nand I worked together, and worked hard, on missile defense. He was an \nappropriator, I was an authorizer. I should also say, he was a titan of \nthe Senate, I was a freshman Senator. So the workload was a little \nunfair, in my favor. But we, along with many others, got the missile \ndefense established. I am delighted that after such a rocky fight the \nsystem is now a cornerstone of not only our national defense, but of \nour\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\nNATO relationship as well. European militaries understand the value of \nwhat we can do, and what protections we can afford them. Ted saw this, \nhe knew what the results would be, and he shouldered the burden, fought \nthe fight, and dragged the system into reality.\n  I have had the pleasure of helping Ted raise money for his \nconservation efforts on the World Famous Kenai River. I have been \nfortunate enough to join him on the river. I had the even greater \nfortune to win his annual tournament a couple times. Some rivers are \njust lucky for some fisherman, and while I might wish my lucky river is \na little closer to home than Kenai, AK, being lucky on a river famous \nfor its prize salmon is not so bad. And what he is doing for that \nriver, his conservation efforts, is remarkable. I have noticed a \ndifference between my first visit and my last.\n  My wife Joan and I wish Ted and his wife Catherine the best. God \nBless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10697-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10697-S10698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ERIC HOLDER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak about some of the things we \nhave seen recently in the press about the President-elect nominating \nEric H. Holder, Jr. to be Attorney General.\n  Eric Holder would make an outstanding and historic nominee if \nPresident-elect Obama were to choose to nominate him. Mr. Holder would \nbe the first African American to be nominated and confirmed to serve as \nAttorney General, the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the \ncountry. But far more important than that, he would be as qualified a \nperson as could be found in either party in this country.\n  Over the last 8 years, political manipulation and influence from \npartisan political operatives in the White House have undercut the \nDepartment of Justice and its mission, severely undermined the morale \nof its career professionals, and shaken public confidence in our \nFederal justice system. We need the new Attorney General to be a person \nnot only of integrity and experience, but also somebody who can inspire \nthe thousands of hard-working prosecutors, agents and employees who do \ntheir best every day to enforce the law and promote justice without \nregard to partisan politics. We need an Attorney General in the mode of \nRobert H. Jackson, and Eric Holder fits that mold.\n  Investigations by the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House \nand by the Department of Justice's own inspector general have \nsubstantiated some of our worst fears. As you go around the courts in \nthis country, we now see a corrosive situation in which defendants \nroutinely question whether Federal prosecutions are politically \nmotivated; not whether the law was broken but whether political \nconsiderations determined whether the prosecution would be brought. \nGreat damage has been done to the credibility and effectiveness of the \nJustice Department.\n  I have known Eric Holder for years. If he is President-elect Obama's \nselection to be the next Attorney General, he will bring the kind of \nleadership, temperament, experience, and judgment we need to restore \nthe rule of law and rebuild the reputation of the Department of Justice \nso it is worthy of its name.\n  In October, before the results of the current election were known, I \nwrote with Senator Specter about the kind of person who should be \nappointed the next Attorney General of the United States. Eric H. \nHolder, Jr., surely fits the bill. The next Attorney General has to \nunderstand our moral and legal obligations to protect the fundamental \nrights of all Americans. The Attorney General must ensure that the \nDepartment of Justice is working to uphold the Constitution and the \nrule of law, not working to circumvent them in order to promote the \nPresident's political agenda.\n  We need an Attorney General who realizes that no one is above the \nlaw. The Attorney General is not above the law and no Member of this \nbody, but especially the President of the United States, is above the \nlaw.\n  I know Mr. Holder appreciates and respects the work and commitment of \nthe thousands of men and women who work at the Justice Department in \ntheir dedication to enforcing the law and promoting justice. They know \nhim from his days at the Public Integrity Section, from his time as a \nU.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, from his years as the \nDeputy Attorney General, the second highest ranking official in the \nDepartment. I think this choice would be welcomed by career \nprofessionals and prosecutors at the Department of Justice. He can do a \ngreat deal to restore morale as well as the rule of law.\n  His career has been one of ``firsts''. It would be fitting for him to \nbecome the first African American nominated and confirmed to serve as \nthe Attorney General of the United States.\n  Shortly after his graduation from Colombia Law School, he joined the \nDepartment of Justice as part of the Attorney General's honors program. \nHe was assigned to the newly formed Public Integrity Section in 1976. \nHe worked there for 12 years investigating and prosecuting corruption. \nWhile at the Public Integrity Section, Mr. Holder participated in a \nnumber of prosecutions and appeals involving such defendants as the \nState treasurer of Florida, a former Ambassador to the Dominican \nRepublic, a local judge in Philadelphia, and assistant U.S. attorney in \nNew York City, an FBI agent, and a capo in an organized crime family.\n  After a dozen years as a prosecutor, one of the best there was, \nPresident Ronald Reagan nominated him to be an associate judge on the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia. When Ronald Reagan \nnominated him to be a judge, he was easily confirmed, and he served in \nthat position for 5 years. He left the bench--becoming, incidentally \nagain, the first African American U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia. That is the largest U.S. Attorney's Office in the country. \nWhile in that post, he oversaw prosecution of a powerful Democratic \nCongressman.\n  Four years later he was nominated to the important post of Deputy \nAttorney General. I worked with the then-chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch to report his nomination \nfavorably to the Senate. I was disturbed that an anonymous Republican \nhold delayed consideration of his nomination for 3 weeks. But when that \nhold was lifted and we had a vote--open, in the daylight--all 100 \nSenators voted to confirm Eric Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General \nof the United States. He became the first African American in the \nhistory of the Department to achieve that high position and later \nserved briefly as the Acting Attorney General.\n  But, notwithstanding my friendship with Mr. Holder, notwithstanding \nmy friendship with the President-elect, should he be nominated, Mr. \nHolder should be voted for or against on his merits. His race will be a \nhistoric footnote, but that is not what should make the difference.\n  Whoever is nominated to the position of the chief law enforcement \nofficer of this country should be considered on his or her merits. And \nwhat wonderful merits he has. He has prosecuted high-level public \nofficials and organized crime; developed comprehensive programs to \ncombat domestic violence, child abuse, violent crime; revitalized \nprograms to assist crime victims. He has helped guide the Department's \nefforts in the criminal prosecution of corporations, health care fraud, \ncomputer crimes, software piracy, helped develop a community \nprosecution model. He has served in nearly every level of the \nDepartment of Justice he would lead. That is what makes him qualified.\n  We need an Attorney General, as Robert H. Jackson said 68 years ago \nabout the Federal prosecutor, ``who serves the law, not factional \npurposes, and who approaches his task with humility.'' That is the kind \nof prosecutor Eric Holder always was, and that is the kind of Attorney \nGeneral he would be.\n  This is very personal to me. I consider the 8 years I spent as a \nprosecutor in Vermont after returning from law school one of the best \nopportunities I ever had to serve the public.\n  I came close to serving in that area in the Federal Government. The \nthen-Attorney General had invited me in to talk and to encourage me to \ncome to the Department of Justice. He had reviewed my grades, he had \nreviewed where I was in the Georgetown Law Center, and he talked to me \nabout coming in to the Department. I said to\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\nhim, ``Mr. Attorney General, tell me again how the Department of \nJustice works. Are you free of political influence from the White \nHouse?'' I remember him saying, and I can see his eyes today as he \nlooked me straight in the eye and said, ``I have told the President \nthat neither he nor anyone from the White House can interfere with \nprosecutions. We will make those determinations here in the Department \nof Justice based on the facts and the law.'' I remember even at that \ntime I thought if I was ever a prosecutor, that is the kind of \nprosecutor I would want to be. And this Attorney General whom I talked \nwith did exactly that. When a person who was key to the election of the \nPresident of the United States had committed a crime, this Attorney \nGeneral prosecuted that person. This was particularly significant \nbecause that Attorney General was Robert F. Kennedy. The President of \nthe United States was his brother, John F. Kennedy. But he said: We \nwill protect the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n  I want to see that again. I had that in my mind when I was a \nprosecutor. I believe strongly that we need to enforce the law with \nneither fear nor favor when. There is no question in my mind that Eric \nHolder would do that.\n  I think of the thousands of men and women who work for the Department \nof Justice, some of the finest people you will ever see anywhere, many \nI have known for decades. For most of them, I have no idea what their \npolitical allegiances are, whether they are Republicans or Democrats or \nIndependents. But I know one thing about every single one of them: they \nare the best of the best. They deserve, as an Attorney General, the \nbest of the best.\n  I commend President-elect Obama for considering Eric Holder for this \nposition. He is a public servant who has broad support within the law \nenforcement community and on both sides of the aisle. I was pleased to \nsee that the initial reactions of Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, and \nSenator Coburn--all Republican members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--and many others, were to acknowledge his public service, his \nintegrity, and good qualities. Mr. Holder should have the support of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle if the President-elect chooses to \nnominate him.

Mr. President, a large number of very special and \nextraordinary individuals will be leaving the Senate at the end of this \nsession, many friends and many people I have admired for a number of \nyears and had the privilege to serve with. I wished to speak \nspecifically to one, and that is my colleague from New Hampshire, John \nSununu.\n  John is the youngest Member of the Senate. He came here as the \nyoungest Member, and he is still the youngest Member after 6 years, but \nhe is one of the most accomplished and capable people in the Senate, \none of the brightest, as we all know, and also one of the people who \nbrings the most common sense to issues. Time and time again, I would \ncome to the floor, and this was throughout his term but especially \nduring the last few months when he was in a very challenging election, \nand there would be votes being cast that were very difficult political \nvotes, votes which, when you cast these votes, most people knew they \nwere not going to be understood and, in many instances, they were going \nto be misinterpreted or subject to misrepresentation but votes which \nwere necessary to cast in order to preserve especially the fiscal \nresponsibility of this Government. John Sununu never backed away from \nany of those votes. He always cast the difficult vote, knowing in many \ninstances that politically it was going to be characterized in a way \nwhich might hurt him; votes, the basic purpose of which, in most \ninstances, were to protect the taxpayer, keep the size of Government \nunder control, and be a force for a better country and for more \nindividual rights. He understands as well as anyone in this body the \nbasic values of making Government live within its means, of having a \ngovernment which people can afford but is still compassionate and \naccomplishes the goals of delivering adequate services. He has worked \nvery hard in order to pursue those goals.\n  He also brought to the body a unique sense of humor, New Hampshire \nhumor, quiet, witty, and comfortable with himself but also willing to \nmake fun of himself, and an essential common sense, which I like to \nthink is characteristic of New Hampshire, and also an integrity, a \ncommitment to public service for the purposes of public service--the \nfact that he was here not to benefit himself in any way but simply to \ndo what he felt was right in order to make our Nation better and make \nNew Hampshire better. He served New Hampshire for 12 years, both in \nCongress and in the Senate.\n  As I mentioned, he is the youngest Member of the Senate and his \nservice is hardly completed, I hope. His opportunities are virtually \nlimitless because his abilities are limitless. He has talent and \ncapability, intelligence, drive, the personality to pretty much do \nwhatever he wants as he moves forward.\n  He also has one other resource which is very special and that is his \nwife and family. Kitty is an exceptional individual. Kathy and I have \ncome to enjoy not only working with John and Kitty but getting to know \nthem as friends, as fellow travelers. Kathy has been through many years \nbeing a political wife, and she has put up with a lot of ups and downs. \nShe and Kitty naturally bonded, as they understood the importance of \nwhat we do. Kitty is an individual who brings a smile whenever you see \nher because she is a person filled with good will to everyone. Their \nchildren, Grace and Charlie, John Hayes, great kids, very enthusiastic \npeople, a wonderful family. That family is a tremendous support to \nJohn, and he is a tremendous support to them. That unit, as it moves \nforward, will always be successful.\n  It is obviously with great regret that I look on John's leaving the \nSenate. His talent will be lost here, and it will be a loss to the \nbody. He is a special individual who had a special group of skills that \nuniquely worked for the benefit of New Hampshire and the people of New \nHampshire. I hope he will stay engaged.\n  Kathy and I wish him and Kitty and their children the best of luck as \nthey go forward and that the road always rises to meet them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we do not intend to wait until the new \nCongress convenes in January to begin work on health care reform \nlegislation. The fact is, health care reform was one of the signature \nchanges promised by President-elect Barack Obama during the campaign. \nThis legislation is too important and too urgent to put off until \ntomorrow, to wait until the new President and the new Congress are \nsworn in.\n  I applaud both Senator Baucus, Chair of the Finance Committee, and \nSenator Kennedy, Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, for plunging right into the ambitious and historic task of \ncreating a comprehensive health care reform bill.\n\n[[Page S10699]]\n\n  Last week, Senator Baucus came forward with a 98-page white paper \nsetting broad parameters for prospective legislation. Earlier this \nweek, Senator Kennedy brought together members of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee to kick off the long process \nof crafting a bill.\n  At that meeting, Senator Kennedy designated three working groups to \noversee the principal components of the bill. Senator Clinton was asked \nto chair the health insurance coverage working group. Senator Mikulski \nwill chair the health system quality working group. I will chair the \nprevention and public health working group.\n  As I said, the working group I will chair will focus on the wellness, \ndisease prevention, and public health components of this \nlegislation. Again, this has been a longstanding focus of mine. Indeed, \nin the past, I have already introduced comprehensive wellness \nlegislation. Several elements of that bill, and others, have been \nenacted into law. Prevention and wellness as a component are absolutely \ncritical to transforming the way we approach health care in the United \nStates.\n\n  To be honest about it, we don't have a health care system in America; \nwe have a sick care system in America. Well, think about it. If you get \nsick, you get care, either through insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, \ncommunity health centers, charity--one way or the other--but that is \nthe most expensive way to do things. That is sort of trying to patch it \nup later on. We have spent untold hundreds of billions of dollars a \nyear on pills, on surgery, hospitalization, disability, but we spend \npeanuts--3 percent--less than 3 percent of our health care money for \nprevention and wellness.\n  Again, there are huge untapped opportunities in this area of wellness \nand prevention. If we think about where we are right now, we will see \nthat we spend a staggering $2 trillion annually on health care--more \nthan any other nation in the world and more than most nations put \ntogether. Yet the World Health Organization ranks U.S. health care 37th \namong the nations of the world--37th. We are 20th of 21 industrialized \nnations in the quality of health care for children. We are No. 20--20 \nout of 21 industrialized nations--in terms of the quality of children's \nhealth care.\n  If you want evidence of the failure of our current sick care system, \nconsider these facts: Tens of millions of Americans suffer from \npreventable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and, of \ncourse, some forms of cancer. In tandem with a childhood obesity \nepidemic now, we have new guidelines from the American Academy of \nPediatrics advising that some children as young as 8 years old should \nbe put on cholesterol-lowering drugs. That is the American Academy of \nPediatrics. We have an epidemic of children with adult-onset diabetes--\nunheard of until just recently. Unheard of until just recently. We are \nnow seeing young Americans, as young as age 25, getting heart bypass \nsurgery because of clogged arteries. So again, it is almost as though \nwe have lost our capacity to be shocked when we hear these statistics. \nHow much evidence do we need that America's approach to health care or, \nas I say, sick care is simply not working?\n  The good news is that President-elect Barack Obama, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Kennedy, and other key players here in the Senate and in the \nHouse kind of get it when it comes to real health care reform. It is \nnot enough to just talk about how to extend insurance coverage or how \nto pay the bills, as important as those things are. That is not enough. \nIf all we are going to do is figure out a better way to pay the bills, \nwe are sunk. We have to start keeping people healthier and preventing \ndisease in the first place.\n  Again, I would lay down this marker right now. If we pass a health \ncare reform bill that greatly extends health insurance coverage but \ndoes nothing to implement a national prevention and wellness structure \nand agenda, then we will have failed the American people. It simply \nmakes no sense to legislate broader access to a health care system that \ncosts too much, delivers too little, largely because it neglects \nwellness and prevention. We need to craft a bill that mobilizes our \nsociety to prevent these unnecessary diseases and conditions, including \nobesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. It \nis time to recognize obesity as a disease that needs to be attacked--\nnot cured but prevented.\n  A robust emphasis on wellness is about saving lives and saving trips \nto the hospital and saving money. It is the only way--the only way--we \nare going to get a grip on these skyrocketing health care costs. As I \nsaid, there are a lot of opportunities here in terms of cost savings \nbut also in terms of helping people live healthier, happier, and more \nproductive lives. We want to be more productive in this country. Not \nall of this is going to come under what we think of as the health care \numbrella. Not all will come under what I would say we think of as \nmedicine and doctors and hospitals and things such as that. A lot of \nthis is going to be outside of that sort of health care regimen.\n  I think of things such as schools. The Presiding Officer and I serve \non the Agriculture Committee in the Senate. Next year, we are going to \nbe reauthorizing the child nutrition bill. This is a bill that \nbasically sets up the parameters for school lunch, school breakfast, \nschool snacks, the WIC Program, the Women, Infants and Children \nProgram.\n  It seems to me this ought to be thought of also as a part of \npreventive health care. Our kids in school have to start eating better, \nmore wholesome foods, less starches, less fats, less sugars, less \nsodium. I just mentioned the onset of type 2 diabetes and childhood \nobesity. We have to get a grip on this. We can't continue to do the \nthings with our school lunch and school breakfast programs as we have \nbeen doing in the past.\n  Obviously, another component of this--it doesn't fall within our \nAgriculture Committee jurisdiction, I say to the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Colorado--we also have to start making sure that schools \nthat get any sort of Federal funds have exercise programs. Schools are \nbeing built in America today without a playground, without a gym, \nwithout any kind of exercise equipment for kids. It is nonsense.\n  I don't know about the Senator from Colorado, but I would wager that \nwhen he was in grade school, he had to go outside and run around for a \nhalf an hour or so a day. In my grade school, we had 15 minutes in the \nmorning, 15 minutes in the afternoon, and a half hour after lunch. One \nhour a day we were out running around, sometimes in the snow, and it \nwas pretty cold in the wintertime. We always had exercise. We were \nalways doing something. Of course, we didn't have Game Boys and a lot \nof TV and things such as that at that time.\n  My point is that schools--as we attack feeding programs and the \nvending machines and what goes into vending machines in schools--again, \nwhen the Senator from Colorado was in school, I bet they didn't have \nvending machines. Now we see Pepsi and Coke and candy bars and all \nsorts of things in vending machines. Why should that be so? School is \nwhere you go to learn, to be healthy, not to get stoked up with junk \nfood and sugar and starches and sodium.\n  So I digress a little, but that is another component of it that we \nhave to be thinking about. It may not be in the health care reform bill \nas such. I intend to have it in the health care reform bill as guidance \ndirections for other committees that are involved in other things to be \nable to start looking at wellness and prevention components.\n  I would go this far: I think we need a direction in this health care \nreform bill to every committee of Congress that whatever you are \nworking on, you have to think about how it impacts prevention and \nwellness--does it add to that or does it subtract from that and are \nthere things we ought to be doing in this legislation?\n  Again, I digress a little bit, but take the recent highway \nreauthorization bill. That was 3 or 4 years ago, and now we are going \nto reauthorize it again in 2010. I offered an amendment which didn't \nsucceed, but I think, over the passage of the years, the more I have \ntalked to others about it and we have conferred about it, I hope it has \na good chance on the next reauthorization bill. It was simply this: any \ncommunity or region or State that uses Federal highway monies, the \nFederal gasoline tax monies for road improvements\n\n[[Page S10700]]\n\nand such, if they are building roads, improving them, or building \nbridges or whatever, they have to incorporate in their planning bike \npaths and walking paths along with them. I am not saying they have to \nbuild those; I am just saying that at least they ought to have them in \ntheir plans. Again, thinking about kids going to school, they ought to \nhave sidewalks along their streets going to school so they can walk to \nschool. Many places don't have sidewalks and bike paths and walking \npaths.\n  My point is that there are a lot of things outside of the health care \nenvironment we normally think of that can be very helpful for \nprevention and wellness--workplaces, workplace wellness. There are some \ncompanies in this country doing a great job with this. They have set up \nwellness programs, nutrition guidance programs, antismoking programs \nfor employees, and in every case I have ever looked at where you have \nthe incentives and the company really goes to work at this, they find \nsome amazing results. They find their absenteeism goes down, they find \nworkers are much more productive than they had been in the past, and \nthey find their health care costs going down. Now, we need to make this \navailable to every business in this country--small businesses, people \nwho employ 10 people or more. There has to be something including a \ncomponent of prevention in the workplace.\n\n  So I mentioned schools, workplaces, communities. Communities have to \nbe involved. We need to promote community wellness programs.\n  The Trust for America's Health earlier this year came out with a \nstudy they had done on community-based wellness programs and the return \non investment. Most times when you talk with people about prevention \nand wellness, they say: Oh, that is all fine, but you don't get a \npayback for 20 or 30 years. The Trust for America's Health did a study \nState by State and they showed that in these cases where the \ncommunities had community wellness programs, that actually, in the \nfirst year--in the first year--there was almost a 2-to-1 return. For \nevery dollar they invested, they got $2 back the very next year, and it \nincreased every year after that. So we have to think about how we \npromote community-based wellness programs.\n  The elderly. I can't think of how many times I have been to senior \ncitizens centers, congregate meal sites, some independent living \ncenters, and those types of places where we see so many elderly on \ndrugs. They are on so many drugs. They can't keep track of the 15 pills \nthey have to take every day. Well, there have been some very good \nstudies done, on the fact that if you give the elderly better \nnutrition, better exercise, better social ability, you can get them off \nsome of those drugs--maybe not all of them, but you can get them off of \nhalf of the drugs or more that they are taking. So there are a lot of \nthings we can do just, as I say, outside.\n  Within health care, there are a lot of things too. Students are going \nto medical school today, taking all of these courses on medicine and \ndrugs and pharmacology year after year; very intensive, very hard \nstudies. I think I would not be wrong in saying that most medical \nschool students today, at most they might have one 3-hour credit course \nat the end of their study where they take something dealing with \nprevention. It is just not a factor in medical schools. It should be. \nIt should be a factor in nursing schools. Any health care professional, \nany health care profession should have that component, including \nphysicians assistants, nurse practitioners, and anyone involved in the \nhealth professions. So that is another part also.\n  We need to be thinking about how we can beef up our public health \nservice in this country. When I was a young kid going to public school, \nwe had school nurses, and they came around and made sure we had our \nvaccinations and things such as that, and that we exercised. We don't \ndo that anymore. We have to restructure our public health service in \nthis country, to think about how we better utilize the public health \nservice.\n  If you go to medical school now, Medicare is one of the biggest \nfunders of medical schools now, or if you go into the military, the \nmilitary will put you through medical school and then you pay it back \nin 8 to 10 years for your medical school training. But what if you \nwanted to be a public health service officer, you wanted to go to \nmedical school and maybe take one of the courses in public health? \nWell, that would apply there too. Why not pay their way through \ncollege, and then they pay it back for working in the public health \nservice for a number of years.\n  We think about the several hundred community health centers we have \nin this country, doing a great job. Why aren't they a part of the \nPublic Health Service Corps in America, and utilize them for prevention \nand wellness, diagnostics? Quite frankly, people should not have to pay \na copay or a cost share to get a colonoscopy, or breast cancer \nscreening or a host of other things for diagnosis. Annual physical \ncheckups; there shouldn't be a copay or cost share for that. That is \njust keeping people from doing it. When you detect things early and you \ncan intervene early, that is part of prevention also, earlier \ndiagnostics.\n\n  Again, this has to be a big part--I think the centerpiece--of health \ncare reform because it is the only way we are going to actually save \nmoney. Well, you may save money in a bigger pool and better insurance, \nthat type of thing, yes, but the big bucks we will save and will make \nour people more productive and healthy is to have prevention and \nwellness.\n  Yesterday, I convened a meeting of the key groups that have been \nactive in the wellness and prevention field, including the Trust for \nAmerica's Health, the Partnerships for Prevention, the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation, the American Diabetes Association, the American \nHeart Association, the American Cancer Society, the YMCA, the American \nMedical Association, and many others. This was yesterday. It was an \nexcellent session, with a room full of people who all realize this is \nthe time for bold thinking and real change. In addition, I intend to \nhold additional hearings in December.\n  This working group that Senator Kennedy asked me to chair will reach \nout broadly. We wish to capture the best ideas, the best practices. Our \ngoal is nothing less than to transform America into a genuine \n``wellness society.''\n  To borrow a phrase, that is change you can believe in. It is also \nchange that is long overdue.\n  To date, wellness and prevention have been the missing pieces in the \nnational conversation about health care reform. It is time to make them \nthe centerpiece of the conversation--not an asterisk or a footnote but \ncenterpiece of our conversation on health care reform.\n  As chair of the Prevention and Public Health Working Group, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsolicit ideas and input. Promoting wellness and preventing disease is \nnot about party or ideology; it is about pragmatism and common sense. \nIt is about what works--keeping people healthy and keeping costs down, \nmaking people more productive in their daily lives.\n  We have a big job ahead of us, but I am confident the new President \nand the new Congress can deliver on health care reform, and we can do \nit in the next calendar year. Yes, we can greatly expand access to the \nhealth care system--or as I call it, the ``sick care'' system. At the \nsame time, if that is all we do, we will have failed. We can and must \ntransform America's sick care system into a true health care system, \none that makes preventing illness and staying well every bit as \nimportant as curing the illness later on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, next week we will celebrate \nThanksgiving--a holiday to be with family and to give thanks for the \nmany blessings we enjoy. But this year, American families gathering \naround the Thanksgiving table are burdened with serious worries: Are we \ngoing to lose our home? Can we afford to retire when our savings have \nbeen wiped out? Will we have to choose between sending our children to \ncollege and paying our medical bills?\n  One of the greatest hardships millions of Americans are facing is the \nloss of their jobs. The current job market is the worst in the past \nquarter century. Over 1 million people have lost their jobs this year--\nhalf a million in September and October alone. Last week, more workers \nfiled for unemployment benefits than at any time since the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Economists predict the unemployment rate will \ncontinue to climb from its current 14-year high of 6.5 percent to well \nover 8 percent in the coming year.\n  Earlier this year, Congress approved additional unemployment benefits \nfor workers. That was an important step, but families need additional \nsupport. Unemployment benefits have expired for many workers, and \nfinding a new job is far more difficult as the recession deepens. More \nthan 2 million Americans have been unable to find work for more than 6 \nmonths. If Congress fails to extend benefits again this year, nearly \n1.2 million Americans will have exhausted their benefits by the end of \nthe year.\n  That's why this legislation is so essential. It provides 7 additional \nweeks of unemployment assistance to workers whose benefits have \nexpired, and an additional 13 weeks for jobless workers in high-\nunemployment states. This bill has already passed the House \noverwhelmingly, with strong bipartisan support. By acting today, we \nwill deliver immediate aid to many of the neediest Americans who are \nunable to find work.\n  Not only does the extension of unemployment benefits provide a \nlifeline for struggling families, it also serves as a needed and \nimmediate stimulus for the economy--each dollar of unemployment \nbenefits generates $1.64 in economic growth. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this critical extension of unemployment \nassistance.\n  Providing these additional unemployment benefits, however, is not the \nonly step we must take to help working families meet the tough \nchallenges that lie ahead. Jumpstarting our economy and restoring \nAmerican prosperity will take bolder vision and more decisive action. \nWe need to create good jobs for the millions of Americans who want to \nwork. That means investing in our workers, investing in our \ninfrastructure, and investing in technology for the future. It also \nmeans repairing the broken safety nets, so that more families who are \nbeing hurt by this downturn can get back on their feet.\n  I wish we could have done more in this lame-duck, but at least we are \ntaking an important step. I look forward to working with our new \nPresident and the new Congress in January\n\n[[Page S10702]]\n\nto meet these difficult challenges and to restore the vitality of our \neconomy.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I support H.R. 6867, the Unemployment \nCompensation Act of 2008. The unemployment level is high, it is \nincreasing, and it is likely that this condition will prevail for many \nmonths. Thus, the need for this extension.\n  According to the Labor Department, claims for unemployment benefits \nhave increased dramatically, last week reaching a 16-year high. The \nunemployment rate in October was 6.5 percent; last year the rate \naveraged 4.6 percent. The Federal Reserve also released estimates \nWednesday that project the jobless rate will climb to between 7.1 \npercent and 7.6 percent next year.\n  As everyone knows, the economy has slowed dramatically. Retail and \nbusiness spending has decreased. The next several months are projected \nto be a period of contraction. As long as the economy continues to \nstruggle, the people of Arizona and the rest of our country will face \ndifficult job prospects, given the limited number and types of jobs \navailable.\n  This dramatic downturn in the economy and surge in unemployment \nconvinced me to support this extension of unemployment coverage. But \nthis step simply treats a symptom of the bad economy; it is not a \nsolution. We must try to take steps to improve the economy and, thus, \ncreate new jobs. As I have said in the past, I do not believe an \nextension or expansion of Federal unemployment benefits stimulates the \neconomy. In fact, most economists believe that continual, temporary \nextension of unemployment benefits has little effect on the economy, \nand, in some circumstances, actually lengthens the time individuals \nremain unemployed because of the incentive to remain on unemployment \ninsurance.\n  Accordingly, I support this extension with a steadfast commitment to \nwork to pass pro-growth measures that will actually help the economy \nrecover and create new jobs. In the long run, people would rather have \na job than have to take unemployment insurance; and, at some point, it \nwill have to end.\n  What can we do immediately to help Americans get back to work? First, \nwe must maintain existing tax rates. During an economic downturn, the \nlast thing Government should do is take more money out of the economy \nby increasing taxes. Everyone benefits when lower tax rates enable \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs to expand and create more jobs.\n  When Congress returns to Washington, its first priority should be to \nreassure taxpayers that taxes will remain low by maintaining existing \nincome-tax rates, marriage penalty relief, current rates on capital \ngains and dividend income, and relief from the death tax. Under \nexisting law, the tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 will expire after \n2010. Extending current tax rates now would give individuals and small \nbusinesses the certainty they need to plan their family budgets and \npermit small businesses to make critical long-term investments in our \nNation's economy that will increase job growth now and in the future.\n  Unless the tax relief is extended, 43 million working families with \nchildren will face a $2,300 tax increase. Small businesses will see \ntheir taxes increase by an average of $4,100. The death tax will \nrebound from zero in 2010 to a whopping 55 percent. The tax on capital \ngains will increase 33 percent, and the dividend tax rate will increase \nan astounding 164 percent, affecting 18 million senior citizens who \nwill see their taxes rise by an average of $2,200. We shouldn't be \nasking Americans to pay out more of their hard-earned money at a time \nwhen they need it most; but if Congress doesn't act, we will be asking \nexactly that.\n  The current economic downturn has also affected the Nation's \ninvestors, especially seniors who rely on their investments for their \nincome. We need to continue to encourage responsible savings and \ninvestment, and one of the things we should do to ensure savings is to \nallow unlimited contributions to retirement accounts such as 401(k)s \nand IRAs. We should also raise the age at which holders of tax-deferred \nretirement savings accounts must begin making minimum required annual \nwithdrawals. I believe that Congress will likely suspend the mandatory \nwithdrawal rules for one year. While that is a positive step, a more \npermanent measure would provide certainty to seniors.\n  The United States also needs to improve its competitiveness. We need \nto encourage trade between our country and others, and we need to \nenact, as soon as possible, the Colombia, Panama, and South Korea free \ntrade agreements. We also need to stop taxing overseas corporate income \nand decrease our corporate tax rate--let's not provide additional \nreasons for valuable companies here in the U.S. to move all their \noperations overseas.\n  The United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the \nworld. We can make the United States more attractive to foreign \ninvestment by reducing our own corporate tax rate, perhaps from its \ncurrent rate of 35 percent to 25 percent.\n  I will vote for the unemployment extension today. But I am also \ncalling on the President-elect and Congress to quickly pass measures \nthat will actually help the economy to maintain and create jobs. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues toward such an end in the coming \nweeks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, passing an unemployment insurance \nextension today is urgent. More than a million people have lost their \njobs this year alone, and there are 10.1 million unemployed \nindividuals. We must ensure that these individuals who have lost jobs \nand are looking for work, during a time when industries are cutting \njobs and the price of food and other necessities is rising, are not \nalso struggling to put food on their table, pay their utility bills, \nand provide shelter for their families.\n  During economic downturns in the past, we have always provided longer \nperiods of unemployment benefits. The bill that I hope we pass today \nwill provide a much needed unemployment insurance extension. This \nextension would ensure that out of work Americans in high unemployment \nStates like Michigan will receive an additional 20 weeks of insurance, \nfor a total of up to 59 weeks.\n  In October, Michigan's unemployment rate increased from 8.7 percent \nto 9.3 percent, the highest unemployment rate since July 1992. The \nNation's unemployment rate also increased to 6.5 percent. These are \nvery hard economic times. Unemployment rates are rising dramatically, \nand since January 2001 we have lost 3.7 million manufacturing jobs \nnationally and more than 250,000 manufacturing jobs in Michigan. There \nare currently 429,000 unemployed people in Michigan. Between August \n2007 and July 2008, the long-term unemployed--those who have been \nunemployed and looking for a job for 27 weeks or more--comprise about \n27 percent of the total unemployed in Michigan. This is approximately, \n100,000 unemployed persons.\n  The numbers of unemployed are rising all over the country. We must do \nsomething now to protect American workers and their families.\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I regret that I will be unable \nto be present for today's vote on the Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act, H.R. 6867, due to a hunger awareness event previously \nscheduled in Arkansas. If I were present for the vote, I would vote to \nsupport this important piece of legislation as I did in June when the \nSenate passed a 13-week unemployment insurance extension as part of the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, Public Law 110-252.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthird reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 6867) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10702-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, at this moment, exactly 13 years ago, I \nwas locked in the toughest political battle of my life against Gordon \nH. Smith. I went on to narrowly win that race and continue to hold that \nSenate seat today. But Gordon Smith dusted himself off only a few \nmonths later and took on yet another very tough battle, and that time \nhe won the Senate seat that had been held for 30 years by our \nremarkable Senator Mark Hatfield.\n  At that point, Oregonians did not know what to make of their Senate \ndelegation. They had two Senators, myself and Senator Smith, who were \nreplacing Bob Packwood and Mark Hatfield. Those two individuals were \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee and the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. And, of course, the old story was that Bob \nPackwood got to raise all of the money because he was chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and Mark Hatfield got to spend it all because he was \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Of course, I was very much concerned about what was ahead because I \nthought it was very possibly going to be a long and uncomfortable 6 \nyears serving with the fellow with whom I had just duked it out over \nmany months of a political campaign that, as the two of us like to say, \nwas not exactly for the faint hearted.\n  One of the great surprises of my career came, however, when I \ndiscovered that my new colleague, Gordon Smith, was as thoughtful and \nkind and decent outside the political arena as he was tough and \ncompetitive inside the political arena. It was that charm and that \ndecency and his desire to meet me halfway on Oregon's interests that \ngot me closer to Gordon over the years and led to an unusually strong \nworking relationship and what became a strong and genuine friendship.\n  Gordon lost a very tough reelection race a few weeks ago in a State \nthat has changed rapidly from what was a very small Democratic voter \nedge, back when we ran against each other in 1996, to what has become a \nsignificant Democratic voter edge in 2008. Gordon and his skillful \ncampaign team battled hard and tough as they always have. They did \neverything they could to withstand a formidable political tide and a \nvery strong Democratic challenger, a challenger whom I support. So it \nis with mixed and conflicting emotions that I come today to pay tribute \nto my colleague and my friend of 12 years, Gordon H. Smith.\n  Gordon and I have had plenty of political differences, enough \ndifferences, differences that we knew would be the case, that made us \nsay from our very first meeting, when Gordon won that race to replace \nMark Hatfield, that we would be supporting each other's opponents in \nyears ahead.\n  Political campaigns are important, and each of us was called upon to \nseparate our friendship from our beliefs every 2 years. Yet I will say \nthis afternoon that I have come to genuinely loathe much of what has \nbecome of the political process in our country. The relentless and \nomnipresent negative ads obscure and distort to the point that it can \nbe difficult for the typical citizen to maintain anything resembling a \nhealthy perspective on fundamentally good and decent individuals who \nseek public office.\n  Thankfully, the negative ads are now off the air, and I want to make \nsure Oregonians once again remember the Gordon Smith I have known for \n12 years. Gordon has been a good and decent and selfless public \nservant.\n  The fact is, Gordon Smith did not need to serve another term in the \nSenate. He and his wife Sharon have built a strong and prosperous \nbusiness, and they could have done countless things with their time \nthat would have been more glamorous and certainly produced less strain \nand wear and tear on their personal lives. But Gordon ran because of \nhis belief in the role that he believed he could play in shaping our \ncountry's future. That, in my view, is the essence of being a good \npublic servant. No one in this body or in the State of Oregon ought to \nlose sight of the extraordinary sacrifices that Gordon and his wife \nSharon have made over the course of almost two decades of public \nservice.\n  Among Gordon's many personal triumphs in the Senate, I would like to \nhighlight two that are especially important to our State, to our \ncountry, and to me personally. I wanted to remind my colleagues and the \npeople of our country of the very difficult decisions made by Gordon \nand Sharon to share with the public and the Congress their heartrending \nstruggle on behalf of their son, Garrett. They did this selflessly to \nfurther the cause of mental health treatment, and particularly the \ncause of mental health parity.\n  If not for Gordon's courage in sharing their family's story, I \nbelieve Congress might not have acted on mental health parity this past \nfall, and thousands of parents might never know that they are not alone \nin their difficult struggle.\n  There were other critical tasks that Gordon shouldered and one that I \nwas especially appreciative for his leadership on, and that was being \nthe voice for rural folks, for people whose way of life and quality of \nlife is connected to natural resources that are bountiful in our State.\n  Gordon spoke for the farmer, and he spoke for the rancher. He spoke \nfor the logger, for the mill worker, and the miner. He spoke for the \nrural communities they live in, communities that struggle to retain a \nvoice in increasingly urban America.\n  It was written fairly frequently in Oregon's papers, and was in the \nNew York Times at one point, that there was something in the State of \nOregon that people came to say was the Senate's odd couple. In fact, I \nthink the headline in the New York Times when they talked about us was \nwildly inflationary, and Gordon and I came to laugh about it. I think \nthe headline was, ``Oregon's Odd Couple Makes It Work.'' It was \nessentially all about how there were two Senators from Oregon; one of \nthem was a Mormon fellow. He was a Republican. He was from somewhere \ncalled Pendleton. Gordon and I were never convinced that folks in the \nNew York Times knew exactly where Pendleton was, but that is how Gordon \nwas described.\n  Then they said, the other Senator was a Jewish guy, and he was from \nPortland and he was a legal aide lawyer for the senior citizens, and he \nwas an activist with the Gray Panthers. What in the world would these \ntwo people ever have in common?\n  Well, I want people to know that gentle spirit, that Mormon from \nwheat and pea country taught this Jewish fellow from the city an awful \nlot about the too often forgotten voices, particularly those in our \nrural communities.\n  In his absence, I will do everything I can to remind colleagues, \nparticularly Democratic colleagues on my side of the aisle, of the \nchallenges faced in rural communities, of the people and the issues \nthat Gordon H. Smith championed every single day in the Senate. I wish \nGordon and Sharon well in whatever their future endeavors are. I have \nalready made it clear they will always have my friendship and \nassistance in any project they pursue in the days ahead. But most \nimportantly, I come to the floor and thank Gordon for his personal \nfriendship to me and his service to our State. I ask my colleagues here \nand the people of our home State to voice their thanks today to two \nvery special people, Sharon and Gordon H. Smith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have listened to the eloquent \ncomments of the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. I had planned to insert \na statement in the Record complementing Senator Gordon Smith on his \ntenure, but I would like to add my voice of laudatory comments at the \nconclusion of the statement of Senator Wyden. I agree with him that \nSenator Gordon Smith has made an enormous contribution to the Senate in \nhis two terms, and he will be sorely missed. He is a member of a small \nband of moderates on this side of the aisle. I suggest that Gordon \nSmith's brand of Republicanism is very much in need in this body. Very \nfrequently, Members on the Democratic side of the aisle seek \ncosponsors. I have been told on a number of occasions that the \n``pickins are slim.'' Gordon's absence will make it more difficult.\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\n  Gordon Smith has been outspoken on many of the very important causes \nwhich require bipartisanship. He was one of the few on this side of the \naisle to sponsor legislation to fight hate crimes, for example. At the \noutset, support for Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research \nwas limited. Gordon Smith was at the forefront of that effort, as I \nwas. Gordon Smith made a very eloquent speech from his chair a few rows \nbehind me on the Iraq war. He was moved one day to come over and spoke \nfrom the heart, something which happens relatively infrequently in this \nChamber. Sometimes people in this Chamber speak from the head. Even \nthat has its limited aspects, if we take a close look at the \nCongressional Record. But Gordon Smith was a big plus here.\n  I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Wyden. I \nknow Gordon is a young, vigorous man. He has a bright future ahead of \nhim. I think he will live to fight another day on the political wars. \nSome of us have had an election loss or two. It is a learning \nexperience, not one I recommend, but there are ways to move forward. \nThat can be a lesson which could stand anyone in good stead. I am sure \nSenator Gordon Smith has a great future ahead of him.\n\n\n                              John Sununu\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to pay tribute to my friend Senator John \nSununu for his service to the country and his contributions to the U.S. \nSenate. Senator Sununu's departure from the Senate will be a great loss \nto this body, as well as to the state of New Hampshire.\n  I have known Senator Sununu since he joined the Senate in 2002. I \nhave always found him to be an intelligent, engaged, and capable \nlegislator who cares deeply for the well-being of his constituents and \ndoing what is right for the Nation, regardless of the political cost.\n  Senator Sununu followed his father and mother into public service, \nwhen he ran for public office in 1996 and won the election in New \nHampshire's First Congressional District. John served three terms in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives where he quickly established a \nreputation as an innovative legislator. John effectively applied his \nextensive background in science, engineering, and small business during \nhis six years in the House of Representatives where he rose to become \nvice-chairman of the Budget Committee and took a leading role in \nshaping our Nation's annual budget priorities.\n  In 2002, John joined the Senate after defeating both an incumbent \nSenator and an incumbent Governor to become the youngest Member of the \nUnited States Senate. I have admired John's work on his committees: the \nFinance Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs Committee. On these committees, Sununu played a \nmajor role on the lobbying reform legislation, and he got the Bush \nAdministration to make some crucial changes in the Patriot Act before \nhe voted to reauthorize it.\n  Sununu has also gained a reputation as a well respected fiscal \nconservative.\n  On a personal note, Senator Sununu has been a very good friend to me. \nWhen I underwent chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease and lost my hair, \nSenator Sununu showed up one day on the Senate floor with a shaved \nhead. He said that he had shaved his head in a sign of solidarity for \nwhat I was going through.\n  I wish John, his wife Kitty, and his three lovely children the best \nof luck as they move forward. I have no doubt that Senator Sununu has a \nbright future and will continue to make important contributions to New \nHampshire and the entire Nation.\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  Senator Elizabeth Dole is a colleague leaving the U.S. Senate not in \ndefeat but in the wake of a career dedicated to public service and an \nunwavering commitment to her country. She has had an illustrious career \nas a two-time cabinet member, President of Red Cross, and U.S. Senator. \nElizabeth is a model for all young women considering a career in \ngovernment, for in times when the ceiling had but few cracks she bore \nthrough the naysayers and showed a woman belongs in the Nation's \nhighest positions.\n  After graduating from Harvard Law as one of just 29 woman in a class \nof 550, ``Liddy'' went to work in the White House Office of Consumer \nAffairs where she worked under both President Johnson and Nixon. \nPledging her allegiance to her job and duty to the country, Senator \nDole opted to switch parties in order to continue her stay in the White \nHouse. After a stint on the Federal Trade Commission, President Reagan \nappointed Elizabeth Secretary of Transportation in 1983. She served \nvaliantly in that position for 4\\1/2\\ years, proving her skill at \nmanaging a Federal Department, and became the Secretary of Labor under \nPresident George H.W. Bush. With this position, Elizabeth became the \nfirst woman to hold two different cabinet positions under two different \nadministrations.\n  In 1991 Elizabeth accepted a different challenge becoming the \nPresident of the American Red Cross, dedicating her time to building an \ninstitution whose impassioned mission is to aid our Nation's citizens \nwho are in need of emergency assistance. During her tenure with the Red \nCross, Elizabeth took a brief hiatus to stand by her husband, Senator \nBob Dole, as he represented our party as the nominee for President in \n1996. After a hard-fought race Elizabeth began looking into the idea of \nrunning for our Nation's highest office on her own right. This came to \nfruition in 1999 as she again led the way for women and became the \nfirst official female candidate for President. She exhibited toughness \nand political tact in a race that history had not been very welcoming \nto women.\n  In 2001 Elizabeth's path to the U.S. Senate took her through her \nbirth home of Salisbury, NC. Using her full career serving our Nation \nas a foundation, Elizabeth won her seat to the U.S. Senate and \nimmediately made her presence known. Spending her time on the Armed \nServices, Banking, Small Business and Aging committees, Elizabeth \nworked for North Carolinians with the same passion and dedication she \npossessed throughout her career. Her achievements were many, but to \nname a few she successfully opposed potential closings of U.S. military \nbases, protected delicate wetlands and woodlands in northeastern North \nCarolina from ruination from an ill-advised Navy landing strip \nproposal, and also served as the chairwoman of the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee for the 2004 election cycle.\n  I wish to thank Elizabeth for her service, friendship, and for being \nthere for my dear friend Bob throughout the years. Senator Dole, your \ncontributions to this chamber and our Nation will forever be \nremembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Ted Stevens\n\n  Madam President, the departure of the senior Senator from Alaska will \nsurely deprive the Senate of an exemplary leader who has made a \nprofound effect on this body. Being the longest serving Republican in \nSenate history, Senator Stevens has made countless contributions to \nthis body. His achievements include serving as the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, former chairman of the full \nAppropriations Committee, and President Pro Tempore.\n  Ted's temper is generally misunderstood except by those who know him \nbest. He doesn't lose it, but he does use it--and effectively. However, \nit is true that on occasion he makes Vesuvius look mild. I recollect \none all-night session during Senator Howard Baker's tenure as majority \nleader when Ted expressed himself in an unusually emphatic way. As I \nrecall it, the debate arose over Senator Proxmire's comments about \nsubmitting vouchers for travel expense in Wisconsin on his contention \nthat Washington, DC, was his home base. That prompted a reaction from \nTed, who was aghast at the thought of Washington, DC, being any \nSenator's home when he had the majestic Alaska to claim as his home.\n  Senator Stevens' service during WWII in the U.S. Army Air Corps has \ngiven him a special understanding of defense matters. He is a \ndistinguished veteran of the U.S. Army Air Corps, having flown support \nmissions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force during World War \nII, for which he was awarded numerous medals, including the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. Upon his arrival in the U.S. Senate in 1968 \nit became evident Ted would become a leader on military and defense \nissues. His hard work as the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee earned him high praise from \nPresident Bush for his management of $87 billion supplemental \nappropriations bill in 2003.\n  Recently, Senator Stevens has found himself in the midst of the \ndebate on energy policy and finding innovative approaches to our \ndependency on oil. He labored intensely over these matters which he \nbelieved so strongly to be best not only for the country in particular \nbut especially for Alaska. Ted's work ethic and tenacity always made \nthis Chamber a better place. His passion for serving his State and \ncountry will forever be remembered. Thank you, Ted, for everything you \nhave done for the United States and Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10705-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10705-S10706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUTO INDUSTRY BAILOUT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, earlier today, Senators Levin, Bond, \nVoinovich, Stabenow, Brown, and I announced a legislative proposal to \ndeal with the crisis being faced by the automobile manufacturers. For a \nprotracted period of time, Congress has wrestled with this issue. There \nhave been many conflicting points of view as to what ought to be done. \nThere has been little public sympathy for the plight of the auto \nmanufacturers because they have been on notice for a long while of the \nneed to reorganize and to approach the manufacture of automobiles \ndifferently in order to compete with foreign cars. There have been \nrepeated efforts in the Congress to impose mileage standards. Finally, \nthat was done last year. Now, with the severe economic problems facing \nthe country, the automobile manufacturers find themselves in dire \nstraits. The chief executive officers of General Motors, Chrysler, and \nFord have been on Capitol Hill with very gloomy predictions as to the \nfuture of their companies if they do not get economic aid.\n  It is a difficult matter to provide economic aid to all those who are \nin need. It is true the Federal Government has provided economic \nassistance to Bear Sterns and AIG, turned them down with Lehman \nBrothers. We are well aware of the fact that there could be very \nserious repercussions for the economy as a whole if the auto \nmanufacturers fail. There has been considerable talk that they could go \ninto a reorganization and bankruptcy and could emerge. That may well be \ntrue. But that could be risky as to what would happen.\n  The Congress authorized some $700 billion to assist on an economic \nrecovery. That legislation has not been warmly received by the American \npeople. During the month of October, I traveled broadly in Pennsylvania \nand found very strong public sentiment in opposition. The Congress \nacted in the face of having our backs to the wall or a gun at our heads \nor any other metaphor of a critical nature that one would choose.\n  On September 29, the House of Representatives failed to pass an \neconomic recovery program. Senators were notified to be in the Chamber \nat 7:30 on Wednesday evening to vote. Regrettably, that legislative \nprocess did not follow regular order. It started off with a bill with \npapers from the Treasury Department. It wasn't a bill. It was a 4-page \nmemorandum, later expanded to more than 100 pages, ultimately to more \nthan 400 pages. But when regular order is not followed, the consequence \nis likely to be not so good. Regular order requires a bill that one can \nread and study. It requires hearings before a committee where people \nare proponents and opponents. There is examination and cross-\nexamination to get at the facts. Then the committee--in this case, the \nBanking Committee--would sit down and have what is called a markup to \ngo through the bill line by line.\n  I explain this in some detail so there might be some understanding, \nif anybody is listening on C-SPAN this afternoon. Certainly, the \nChamber is customarily barren, as is frequently the case. Senators are \nbusy with other matters. Then after the markup, the committee files a \nreport. Then it comes to the floor. There is debate, discussion, \namendments. Then the Senate works its will. On the House side across \nthe Rotunda, down the hall, the House of Representatives goes through a \nsimilar process. Then representatives of the two bodies meet for a \nconference. Then that is presented to the President. So there is a \ngreat deal of refining.\n  That didn't happen with the $700 billion economic aid proposal. It \nturned out there was a lot of pork in the final draft that no one had a \nchance to strike, to offer amendments. It was embarrassing to have to \ndefend that kind of a bill as I traveled my State in October to explain \nit. So there is great skepticism, fairly stated, among the American \npeople as to the wisdom of the Congress in putting up $700 billion.\n  Now, with the automakers coming in asking for economic aid, the \nquestion arises, who next? Last Friday, I wrote to our leaders urging \nthat we not rush to judgment. I made a similar request, made an \nextensive floor statement earlier this week on Monday. That letter and \nothers are in the Record, and I will not encumber the Record further \nbecause they are available for anyone who cares to look at them.\n  Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has been unwilling to use the $700 \nbillion to assist the automakers. He may be right about that or he may \nbe wrong about that. But that is the position the Treasury Department \nhas taken, saying that money is for the economy generally.\n  Then the idea has been proposed--and has been embodied in what \nSenators Levin, Stabenow, Voinovich, Bond, Brown, and I announced \nearlier today--to use funds up to $25 billion from the 2007 \nappropriations which had been designated to meet the mileage \nrequirements but not a blank check. Before any of those funds could be \nutilized at the direction of the Secretary of Commerce, there would \nhave to be a plan. There would have to be a factual statement as to \nwhat the condition of the automobile manufacturers is, what would be \ndone with the additional funds, what would be undertaken to guarantee \nthat the moneys would not be used for increased executive pay or \ncorporate jets or golden parachutes. There would have to be some hard, \nconcrete facts laid out.\n  Last Friday, as I put in the Record this week, I wrote a letter to \nthe chief executive officers of the three companies. I got no response \nfrom General Motors. I got no response from Ford. Frankly, I'm a little \nsurprised that when an inquiry is made in that context, there is not an \neffort to respond, not to reach out but to respond. But executives from \nChrysler came to see me, and I raised the questions as to what their \ncondition was, how much cash they had on hand, how much cash they \nneeded, what they would do with an infusion of economic aid, and what \nwere the prospects for a recovery.\n  That matter has now been put over by the leaders until December 8. So \nwe now have 2 weeks, next week and the week after. Presumably, on the \nweek of December 1, there will be hearings. The automobile \nmanufacturers are going to have a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat there is a plan which will be viable, which would have a realistic \nlikelihood of success.\n  I understand the concern of the environmentalists. My record for \nenvironmental protection is very strong. But those in the environmental \ncommunity have raised the concern that the $25 billion ought not to be \ndirected away from changes on gas mileage. We are talking about a \nbridge loan. The concern is, if action is not taken now before a new \nadministration, that there could be a disastrous result. As Senator \nVoinovich pointed out, the recession or economic problems could be even \nmore serious. The expression he used, which I think is not \ninappropriate, it could go over the cliff. Nobody knows. But that is a \nrisk, if we are going to wait until January 20. It may even be a risk \nin waiting until mid-December, but that is the course which we are on \nnow. Of course, Secretary Paulson has the discretion, as he has \nconceded, to act with the funds which are now available. But in any \nevent, I believe the legislation which was announced today by the six \nSenators,--three Democrats, three Republicans, on a bipartisan basis--\nis a useful approach for the future. This is very important. This is \nnot an extra appropriation. We are not putting up more money. It is a \ndifferent use of moneys already put up. The environmental issues could \nbe safeguarded after January 20. With the Democrats in control of both \nHouses and the White House, they could write their own ticket to \nreplenish that fund, if they choose to do so. But at least we are on a \ncourse now in the reasonably\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\nnear future to provide a legislative approach if--and it is a big \n``if''--the auto manufacturers can come forward with a hard statement \nof facts as to where they are, a hard statement of facts of what they \ncould do with these funds to show their viability.\n\n  So we will await those hearings, and we will await what they do. But \nI would emphasize they will have to persuade the Congress to vote for \nthe plan. But in order to persuade the Congress, they are going to have \nto persuade the American people over the course of the next 2 weeks \nwith something a lot more specific than they came to town with over the \ncourse of the past several days and a lot more responsive than two of \nthe companies not even responding to my request for a statement as to \ntheir case, as to how they propose to remain viable with the economic \naid.\n  I thank the Chair, and, in the absence of any other Senator on the \nfloor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today may mark the last day of this \nsession, although I shall not try to make that prediction. However, I \nwould not want this day to pass without availing myself of the \nopportunity and the privilege to come to this floor and say a few words \non behalf of the very dear and valued friends whom I have served with \nin this Chamber as they depart and go on the road of life to, I expect, \nin each case great challenges.\n  Gordon Smith and I have become friends for ever so many reasons. One, \nwe both love the outdoors. He and his devoted wife Sharon and my wife, \nwe have all been close friends through these years. As I look back, I \nwill always remember Gordon. I remember when I was chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee and entrusted with the extraordinary \nresponsibilities--along with other committee members, as well as, \nindeed, every Member of this Chamber--entrusted with those decisions \nrelating to this Nation's Armed Forces who were fighting so valiantly \nthen, today, and for the foreseeable future--I hope the short future--\nin Iraq.\n  Gordon and I had many very quiet and private conversations about his \ndeep concerns and convictions. His convictions emanated from the depths \nof his heart. Politics played no role in his approach to the conflict \nin Iraq. He was gravely concerned about the loss of life and limb, the \nimage of this Nation, and, indeed, the families of the loved ones who \nare fighting in that conflict. So I say: Gordon, we had our \ndifferences, but I respected your stance. I can see him standing back \nthere as erect as he always was, standing and voting against me and \nvoting against others, but again, drawing on his own deeply held \npersonal convictions. Time will tell and history will tell if I was \nright or if I was wrong, but I found his counsel, his willingness to \nlisten, his willingness to share with me his most inner thoughts about \nthat conflict a very valuable asset as I and others in leadership \npositions carried the heavy burden of that conflict. So I am grateful \nto him. He is a very sensitive man, and he showed that sensitivity \nevery so often as he plunged into the complex issues with regard to \nhealth care, the almost insoluble problems--problems that he recognized \nhave to be solved, particularly so that people of lesser means can \nachieve a measure of health care equivalent to those who have the means \ncan receive for themselves. It is a hallmark of how this man proudly \nwalked his way through life, with a loving wife by his side and the \nfamily whom he loves so dearly, and always thinking about those who \nperhaps have not had the opportunities that he and I and others have \nhad, particularly as it relates to health care.\n  He also loves the outdoors. A great golfer, we played together from \ntime to time. His skill is far superior to mine in every way. He is a \nlover of art. We shared our interest in paintings, particularly \npaintings that had come from Scotland. To have had the friendship of \nGordon Smith is to have shared the life of a wonderful human being, and \nI thank Gordon for all that he has done for me and for this great \nNation, and for his beloved State. I wish him well in his next venture, \nand I look forward to meeting him along the way.\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  I have known her for quite a few years. We had a wonderful evening \nlast night where the leadership of the Republican Party--indeed, almost \nall of the Members of the Republican caucus--came to say not farewell, \nbut to listen to the words of those of us who are moving on and will \nnot be a part of the next Congress. Elizabeth got up, and she is such a \nvery forceful speaker. She truly speaks from the heart. She has a \nremarkable memory. She recalled how when both of us were bachelor and \nspinster, we danced together. My lovely wife, who is a dear friend of \nhers, kind of looked at me and I winked and said, She was the best. It \nis just one of her marvelous traits. Talk about glass ceilings: She \nshattered her share. She has taken on many challenges in the private \nand public sector, some of which only men have ever had, and performed \nher duties with great distinction, and always with a quiet sense of \nwhat we call southern humility. She is very proud of her roots and her \nfamily. How often she has referred to her mother.\n  She is a Phi Beta Kappa from Duke University and went on to Harvard \nfor a master's degree and a law degree. Secretary of Transportation, \nSecretary of Labor. Few women have had that much stamina, conviction, \nself-confidence to achieve those goals; and then, of course, to have \nbecome a U.S. Senator. That was a special challenge because she was \nfortunate to have as a husband Robert Dole, the Republican leader of \nthe U.S. Senate, if I can say with a deep sense of humility, one of the \nbest friends I ever had in this institution.\n  I remember talking to him one time, of course, concerning the events \nof that particular period, and I said he ought to think about running \nfor leader of the Senate. Oh, no, no. No, I don't think they will ever \nelect me. Well, this conversation went on for some period of weeks, \nmonths, it may have been, I don't recall. Finally, I said: I have so \nmuch faith that you can win that election that I would be happy to \nappoint myself as one of your managers of the campaign to get it. So I \ntook that, along with several other very fine colleagues, both of whom \nmoved on years ago from this Chamber. And he won. He was amazed that he \nhad won. I wasn't. I always recognized the leadership in him. He did a \nwonderful job as our Republican leader. His portrait proudly hangs \nright here in the corridor off of our Chamber. I never walk by that I \ndon't just quietly give him a hand salute, because I was a part of the \nWorld War II generation, but a very small part, serving only in the \nfinal year of the war and always in a training command, ready as a 17-, \n18-year-old kid to become a replacement for those serving abroad. Bob \nDole was truly one of those who earned the accolade of the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' He fought in Europe. He was a young lieutenant and in \nleading his men in the toughest of battles in Italy, he received what \nfor others I think would have been mortal and fatal wounds.\n  Because he had such an internal strength and constitution, he \nsurvived those wounds and came on to have a distinguished career. As I \nlook back on his Senate days--and they pass so quickly, as did my 30 \nyears--I remember taking trips with him. We went to Russia together, \nwhich was the Soviet Union at that time. He was a staunch believer that \none day Russia would become just Russia once again and those people \nwould have some measure of a voice in their Government. That did come \nto pass, and that was an extraordinary trip.\n  What I best remember is the time of the D-day anniversary. He was \nasked to speak in Italy, where he had fought. And then, together, we \ntraveled to the Normandy beaches to join the President and others. In \nthe course of that trip, we went back to the very ground on which he \nwas wounded. He walked over to the stone wall that is still there--he \nremembers it ever so well--where he dragged his badly wounded body to \ngive him a measure of protection until help could come, after which\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\nhe began that very long, arduous, challenging period of his life. It \ntook years to rebuild that body, but the mind was always there fully \nintact. But he would once again have an important role serving America \nas a public servant in the Senate.\n  I don't know of a husband and wife team who any admire with a greater \nlevel of affection than we do Bob and Elizabeth Dole. So I wish them \nboth very well. She was on our Armed Services Committee. She was a \nstrong advocate for the men and women in the Armed Forces. She had a \nplace in her heart for all who served at Fort Bragg and the Marines' \nCamp Lejeune, and Pope Air Force Base. But that is further evidence of \nthe deep affection she has for her husband Bob.\n\n\n                              John Sununu\n\n  Lastly, I turn to John Sununu. I confess not to have known him very \nwell. I had met him when he came from the House of Representatives to \nthe Senate. I suppose all of us who have been here for a period of \ntime, having been given that marvelous accolade of an old bull, presume \nwe can judge others quickly. I saw in John Sununu a man who would take \ncharge from the day he came, and that he did. From the very moment he \nwalked on the floor of the Senate, he was possessed of his own self-\nconfidence, his own driving, almost a fierce desire to be a leader--a \nleader in the sense of advocating as a true fighter, advocating for \nthose issues in which he had a belief in the principles that were dear \nto his heart.\n  The field of economics is quite a challenge, and with little \nprovocation he would give you a tutorial on the most complex issues as \nthey relate to economics. Indeed, in the weeks before the election, as \nthis body was coming to a close and we voted on such measures as the \nrescue package and so forth, he frequently stood. When he spoke, our \ncaucus and those around him listened very carefully. I mention this \nbecause he exhibited real academic strength at both MIT and Harvard. He \ndid a lot of interesting things in his short life before he came to the \nSenate, not the least of which was being in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  John also had a special niche for his interest in education. He \nwanted to make sure people less fortunate than we would have an \nopportunity to get an education and that those in the system and \nstruggling are given any help possible to succeed in their own goals of \neducating themselves. He also held--very unusual--a special regard for \nthe families of law enforcement officers, men or women in uniform, and \nparticularly those families who lost a spouse or loved one in the line \nof duty.\n  He is an extraordinary man, John Sununu--very sensitive, very \nthoughtful, a man who loves his State, particularly the rivers of his \nState. He commended me for leading the charge in my State to remove an \nold dam that, for 80 years, blocked the migration of a fish from the \nAtlantic Ocean to the Blue Ridge Mountains. He was challenged to try to \nremedy a similar situation that existed in his State. I will miss John, \nhis wife Kitty, and his lovely family. Kitty and my wife shared a few \nwords on our departure last night from the dinner.\n  I am not one who makes many predictions, but I predict this man \ncontinues to not walk but run down that road of life, one who makes \nthose twists and turns, climbs those mountains, and crosses those \nrivers. He will leave his mark on many successful ventures. We will \nhear from this man not once, not twice but many times again. I wish him \nwell.\n  Lastly, I simply say to my State two words: Thank you. I thank all \nthose Virginians who have supported me these 30 years. It was a humble \nchallenge for me. I accepted it and I look back on it with the deepest \nof respect for the trust and confidence you gave me--all Virginians--\nover these 30 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today there has been much discussion once \nagain here on the floor of the Senate and certainly in the news and in \nvarious other venues, I am sure at the Secretary of the Treasury's \noffice, about the economy and what is happening in this country.\n  One only has to look at the stock market--today it moved down very \nquickly and very aggressively once again; it has happened many times in \nrecent days. There are very serious problems. But it is not just the \nstock market that reflects those problems. It is perhaps if you were \nsitting in a home tonight or last night or last week or last month to \nhear someone come home from work to stay to the spouse: Honey, I have \nlost my job. And 1.2 million people did that in the last 10 months, \nhalf of them in the last quarter. There were 240,000 last month who \ncame home and said: I have lost my job.\n  No, not because they are bad workers; because people are being laid \noff. This economy is in a recession. It appears to be a very deep \nrecession, with a great deal of trouble coming from a range of \nactivities that went way beyond the pale.\n  The subprime loan scandal, an almost unbelievable economy that was \nproviding substantial additional benefits and salaries and bonuses to \npeople at the top of the economic ladder. It is almost unbelievable \nwhat has happened with the reckless behavior with respect to some of \nthe financial firms in this country. The result is that the amount of \nleverage and the development of a house of cards built on an illusion \nof assets has caused a collapse, and it is affecting virtually every \ncorner of this country.\n  Tonight there are people who will ask the question: What has happened \nto my retirement account? What about my 401(k) account? What about my \nindividual retirement account? How far has it gone down? How much have \nI lost? What will it mean to my retirement? How much longer will I have \nto work?\n  I have been on this floor plenty of times talking about what has \ncaused all of this. If you do not think about it and talk about it and \ntake steps to correct it, it will happen again.\n  The only way the American people will have confidence about the \nfuture is if they believe we are taking steps to correct that which \ncaused this problem. I have talked about the companies that started \nthis mess, the brokers, the mortgage companies, the folks who buy and \nsell securities, the hedge funds, those who trade in derivatives such \nas credit default swaps. I have talked about all of them. All of them \nmade massive amounts of money. Do you know the highest income earner in \nthe country last year earned $3.7 billion? One person. That is $10 \nmillion a day. If the spouse said: How did it go today? That person had \nto say, pretty well, I\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\nmade $10 million. That day and every day.\n  That is unbelievable to me. It is an example of what has been \nhappening at the top. Massive bonuses and salaries; everybody making \nmoney hand over fist by creating this financial house of cards. It \ncollapses and injures everybody in this country, and a whole lot of \nfolks are thrown out of work.\n  The source? Subprime loans, companies saying to people: Hey, how \nabout a loan? You do not have to pay even the principal at all. You do \nnot have to pay all of the interest. You have bad credit, you cannot \nget any credit, you have been bankrupt, you are a slow payer, you do \nnot pay your bills, but it does not matter. Come to us.\n  That was the advertising. Is it any wonder that all of this \ncollapsed? And as they put all of those bad loans together, they \nsecuritized them and chopped them all and sold them as securities. They \nsecuritize everything these days. They sold them as securities and \nmoved them around the country and around the world.\n  All of a sudden we have a bunch of firms that decided, hey, these are \npretty good-paying securities. They have a big return. We are going to \nbuy some of these. So they bought them all up. And now guess what. They \nhave got all of these rotten assets in their portfolio, and it is \npulling them all under and causing a massive problem.\n  So here we sit with a collapse of a financial system, names that are \nhousehold names, the biggest firms in the country going belly up, \ngetting bailed out.\n  The Treasury Secretary comes to us and says: I need $700 billion on \nan emergency basis in 3 days, and if not, the sky is going to fall in. \nSo the Secretary does not get it in 3 days or with a 3-page bill, but \nhe gets it in a couple of weeks.\n  Now he has $700 billion, but he does not know what he wants to do it \nwith it. He said: I need it and I need it urgently right now because I \nwant to buy toxic assets and I want to get these toxic assets off the \nbalance sheets of these companies.\n  Well, he got the money. Then he said: You know what, that is not \nright either. I do not want to buy toxic assets. What I want to do is \nprovide money, capital, to big banks. He takes $125 billion and aimed \nit at nine banks, some of whom did not want it. The problem was, it was \nthe biggest gift in the world. There were no strings attached. Can you \nimagine taking $125 billion and saying to nine big banks: You take this \nmoney, and, by the way, I will not require you to expand your lending. \nThat is the reason I am giving it to you, but I will not require it. I \nwill have no prohibition on you using it for bonuses. Go right ahead. \nAnd, by the way, my agency is also going to encourage you to merge \nbecause we like bigger banks; merging will be beneficial, we are told. \nIs it any wonder people do not have confidence? Is it any wonder people \nare not inspired by this? This is not a consistent, well-managed \napproach to deal with a crisis, in my judgment. I know it is easy to be \ncritical, but it is hard not to be critical of something that seems so \nrandom in terms of policy.\n  Now, I sat with a banker in North Dakota recently at a table. I said \nto him, a small town banker: Do you have money to lend? I said: They \nsay the credit markets are frozen. Do you have money to lend?\n  Oh, yes, he said. He said: If somebody comes in, I have got money to \nlend them, because he did business the old-fashioned way. He said: I \ntake deposits and I make loans. But when I make loans, I make sure \nthose to whom I lend the money are going to have a reasonable \nopportunity and are able to repay the money.\n  That is business the old-fashioned way. He said: I did not get \ninvolved in all of those reckless practices. I did not buy those \nsecuritized notes with subprime loans. I did not do all of that.\n  Well, the biggest financial companies in this country did. They were \nlike hogs in a corn crib, buying and selling, making lots of money, \neverybody is wading in cash. Now they are up to their necks in trouble, \nand the Treasury Secretary says if we do not bail them out, the whole \neconomy is going to collapse. So this bailout occurs without any \nconditions at all.\n  Did anybody say, with these hundreds of billions of dollars--and by \nthe way, it is not really hundreds of billions. If you take a look at \nwhat Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board have done, it is somewhere \nbetween $2 and $3 trillion that has been pledged to those big firms. \nNot many people know that. And you cannot get all of the details. But \nthe Federal Reserve Board opened up its window, first time in history, \nto say: We will do direct lending with investment banks whose assets \nare not insured by the Federal Government. First time in history. So we \nhave around $2 to $3 trillion out there extended on behalf of the \nAmerican people with some of these companies that were engaged in \nunbelievably reckless practices and behavior.\n  The issue, it seems to me, is what did the Treasury Secretary require \nof these companies that got this massive amount of money? What did the \nFederal Reserve Board require of these companies? The answer is \nnothing. No restrictions. No restrictions on bonuses. We now read that \nsomewhere around $20 to $30 billion of bonuses will be paid in the next \nmonth or two. Any restrictions on parking the corporate jets? No. Any \nrestrictions on income at all? No. No restrictions at all. No strings \nattached.\n  Now, there is a great discussion here on the floor of the Senate and \nin this town about bailing out the automobile industry. That proposal \nis $25 billion, about 4 percent of the $700 billion. As far as I am \nconcerned, the automobile industry has plenty to answer for. But if we \nare talking about a potential loss of 3 to 5 million additional jobs if \nthat industry goes belly up, at a time when this economy is in such \ndesperate condition, putting 3 to 5 million additional people out of \nwork would, I think, be devastating to this economy.\n  So that is a very important consideration. But I am not about to \npropose bailing out anybody unless there are tough restrictions and \nconditions. I know those executives from Detroit got a pretty tough \ntime, and should have, yesterday. They flew here in their private jets, \nmaking about $20 million a year, saying: We need help from the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Look, if we are going to lose 3 to 5 million jobs, I want to help for \na couple of reasons. No. 1, I don't want millions more people out of \nwork that would further jeopardize this economy. No. 2, I want to \nretain a strong manufacturing base. Part of that is the automobile \nindustry. You don't long remain a strong world economic power unless \nyou have a strong manufacturing base. But I am not about to support a \nbailout for anybody unless there are strong, tough, and rigorous \nconditions. Park those corporate jets, 24 roundtrip flights from \nDetroit to Washington, DC, and they flew in corporate jets, making $20 \nmillion a year, saying: Give us a little help. Where is the self-\nsacrifice?\n  I am not just talking on the part of that industry. They were singled \nout yesterday, and I am not excusing them. They got what they deserved \nin the House hearing. But did anybody ask the question, when the \nTreasury Secretary was ladling money around by the hundreds of billions \nof dollars or the Federal Reserve Board was ladling money around to the \npoint of $2 to $3 trillion, did anybody say to those biggest financial \nfirms: By the way, here are some restrictions. Maybe you ought to park \nyour airplanes. Maybe you ought to be concerned about these \nunbelievable incomes. Talk about $20 million a year for people running \nan automobile company, we are not talking about $20 million when we \ntalk about some of these hedge funds. We are talking about an average \nof the top 25 hedge funds, somewhere around $700 million a year. Did \nanybody impose conditions on them? No. Should they have? You darn right \nthey should have. If the automobile industry wants help from the \nAmerican people and this Congress to preserve 3 to 5 million jobs, then \nthey are going to have to be responsible to adhere to significant \nrestrictions.\n  Those restrictions ought to be rigorous and tough. There must be \nindependent oversight on anything that is given to that industry, or \nother industries for that matter. They ought to agree to a prohibition \non dividend payments so that money going to those companies isn't going \nto go out in dividends. That would make no sense. There ought to be \nprohibited golden parachutes for executives as well as executive \nbonuses during the duration of\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\nthe loan. Again, I say park those corporate jets. How about announcing \nthat you are willing to take $1 a year for the sake of trying to repair \nwhat is wrong with your company and trying to put that company back on \ntrack?\n  I understand it wasn't their fault that sales dropped 30 percent. \nThey are victims, as are all Americans, of this economic crisis. It is \nnot their fault that sales dropped 30 percent. So if they need some \nhelp to save 3 to 5 million jobs, I think most Americans would say: \nLet's save those jobs. But most Americans would also ask the question: \nWhere is the self-sacrifice on the part of those folks who are running \nthese companies? Let's see a little and let's hear a little self-\nsacrifice from people who say: I will own up to this. I will put \nsomething significant on the table in terms of trying to turn this \neconomy and these companies we run around.\n  Let me finally say, there are a whole lot of folks across the country \nwho are doing business the right way, Main Street businesses, community \nbanks. They come to work in the morning. They turn the key. They open \nthe lock on that door. They are at risk. They are just trying to make a \nliving. Yet they, too, are victims, not because they got engaged in the \nkind of behavior in which some of the biggest companies in this country \nwere engaged. Some of the biggest financial companies were engaged in \nreckless behavior. When the Financial Modernization Act passed the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate nine years ago, an act that was \na devastating piece of legislation that led us down this path to a \nfinancial collapse, I said back then when I voted against it--and I was \none of eight Senators to vote no--I said: If you want to gamble, go to \nLas Vegas. No, instead they were allowed to gamble by creating holding \ncompanies and merging bank enterprises with securities and with real \nestate and other risks.\n  We knew you shouldn't do that. We learned it in the Great Depression. \nIt caused the closure of massive numbers of banks. Some of my \ncolleagues brought a bill to the Congress and got almost everybody to \nagree to it that said: These lessons are old-fashioned. Let's let these \nfinancial institutions merge and fuse together risky things with \nbanking, securities, and real estate. What an unbelievably ignorant \nthing to do. We had learned that lesson before and forgot it.\n  Guess what. From that day on we began to see the kind of inherent \nrisk established in financial enterprises that someday most of us \nbelieved would create the house of cards that would collapse. And it \nhas. Now the question is, how do we put this back together?\n  Let me say this: If I didn't have great hope for the future of this \ncountry, I would hardly be able to get up and go to work, but I think \nthis is a resilient, wonderful place. We have made very big mistakes. A \nlot of people have made very big mistakes, perhaps all of us. But this \ncountry is a great place. Think about what America has been through: \nthe Civil War, the Great Depression, beating back the forces of fascism \nand nazism. We have done so much in this country to prevail. This \ngeneration of Americans is not about to lose. This generation of \nAmericans, too, will prevail. But it is going to require all of the \neffort of every one of us.\n  This isn't about politics. It is certainly not about Republicans and \nDemocrats. It is about creating good public policy that gives the \nAmerican people confidence and hope in the future. That is what will \nget us out of this rut. Those who caused the financial wreckage, who \ndrove this economy into the ditch, are not going to get us out. It is \ngood public policy by thoughtful people that will begin mirroring what \nhappens on Main Streets and community banks all across the country, \ndoing business the right way. When that happens, we will put this \ncountry back on track. I hope that is sooner rather than later. I hope \nthe American people do not lose hope because we believe, all of us \nbelieve, in the great promise of this country.\n  It is true that we face great challenges, but we are turning a page. \nWe will have a new Congress. We will have a new President and a new \ndetermination to try to fix what is wrong and put this country on a \nbetter path.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10709-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10709-S10710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has \nproclaimed November as National American Indian Heritage Month and the \nCongress has designated November 28, 2008, as Native American Heritage \nDay.\n  This is the time when our country traditionally offers thanks for the \nbounty and protections we enjoy. This year, Congress and the President \nhave chosen to specifically acknowledge and be thankful for the \ncontributions and achievements of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and \nNative Hawaiians. Together, we have called on Federal, State, and local \ngovernments, tribal governments, and others to come together to \ncelebrate and share with one another the cultures, traditions, and \nlanguages of more than 500 tribes.\n  In my home State of Nevada, our tribes represent three distinct \ncultures and languages Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe. Throughout my \ncareer, I have promoted programs and education efforts to preserve \nthese native languages and others and expand cultural programs for \nchildren, young adults and elders. Nevada's tribal leaders and youth \ntell me this cultural exchange with tribal members and with those in \ntheir school and local communities bridges differences and leads to \nindividual successes. Nevadans can be proud of our State's diversity.\n  And while Nevada's 26 tribes are distinct, they share goals common to \nnearly all sovereigns--to care for their people, to keep them safe, to \nhelp them prosper, to protect and use their resources wisely, to engage \nin the larger world while being mindful of their histories.\n  During this session, the Senate worked with tribal leaders and \nadvocates and our colleagues in the House to help tribes achieve these \ngoals. Working together, we reauthorized the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act, reauthorized the \nSpecial Diabetes Program for Indians, and amended laws to strengthen \nfamilies and improve the care and development of children in foster \ncare. We passed legislation that helps tribes develop their natural \nresources, expand their commercial activities, and encourage investment \nin Indian Country. During this time of war, we made it a priority to \nhelp our Native American veterans and their families--who continue a \nlong history of serving in our Armed Forces--by expanding benefits and \nservices under the G.I. bill. Under the leadership of Chairman Byron \nDorgan and Vice Chairperson Lisa Murkowski of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, the Congress has worked to honor our first Americans and \nfulfill our promises to them.\n  During this month especially, we recognize the leadership and efforts \nof tribes and others to improve the lives of Native Americans. But our \nwork is not finished and we will not rest on the accomplishments of the \n110th Congress. As majority leader, I am committed to work with my \ncolleagues to reform health care and reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. I hope that the Senate will be able to again consider \na package similar to one the Senate passed earlier this year.\n  As we approach the end of this Congress, I am pleased that we take a \nmoment to recognize and celebrate the gifts Native Americans and Alaska \nNatives share with all of us daily.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, each November we celebrate American \nIndian and Alaska Native Heritage Month to honor the first inhabitants \nof this land and recognize the relationship this country has with \nAmerican Indian people. In that same spirit, I would also like to \nspecifically recognize the nine treaty tribes that I am honored to \nrepresent in South Dakota.\n  American Indians are unique among other groups in this country \nbecause of the government-to-government relationship established \nthrough countless treaties--documents affirmed in article VI of our \nConstitution as the supreme law of the land. This special status and \nthe strength of these age-old contracts have enabled American Indians \nto shape this country's history in profound ways, as tribal history is \ndeeply entwined with America's. The continued fulfillment of our treaty \nand trust obligations along with a respect for the\n\n[[Page S10710]]\n\ntenets of tribal sovereignty are thus essential responsibilities of \nthis country.\n  South Dakota's tribes have a special place in this history due to \ntheir proactive leadership in the Federal-tribal relationship. For \nexample, the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie was entered into by Indian \ntribes in South Dakota that desired a peaceful relationship with the \nUnited States and a mutual recognition of sovereignty. In this treaty, \nlike many others, the United States entered an agreement to end \nhostilities and for the cession of land, in return entering into a \ncontract to provide assistance with education, health care, farming and \nother necessities; these responsibilities continue today. During this \nmonth of recognition and remembrance it is only appropriate to \nrecognize the special status of the treaty tribes.\n  In addition to this unique governmental relationship, American \nIndians actively enrich the fabric of our Nation's character in many \nways. Tribal members have courageously served to protect America in \nevery conflict since the Revolutionary War, and they have served at the \nhighest rate of any group in the country. Tribal educational models are \nrapidly gaining respect for an approach that stresses the importance of \nhistory and culture as well as the skills necessary for students to \nprosper in an increasingly global world.\n  American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month falls in the same \nmonth as Thanksgiving and I hope this affords us with the time to give \nthanks for the sacrifices of the first Americans. Once reduced to a \npopulation of less than 50,000, the American Indian population is now \nsome 4.5 million strong. Their story, like that of the country as a \nwhole, is a proud, resilient history and I am committed to supporting \ntribes as they continue to build a strong future. Observance of \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month honors the unique \nheritage of this country's first inhabitants, and most importantly \nreaffirms our responsibility to honor Indian treaties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10710-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF MARGO CONNOR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Margo Connor, who \nhas retired after 33 years of service to the Senate community. During \nthe past three decades, Margo Connor has assisted in providing catering \nfor Senate functions on Capitol Hill. In a fast-paced environment with \na high turnover rate, she remained dedicated and personal, with a keen \nability to establish close relationships.\n  Margo spent 17 years in the special functions office for the former \nDirksen Senate Dining Room. She compiled menus and prepared the former \nSenate Dining Room for functions. Meeting and interacting with many \ndifferent people were her favorite aspects of her service; she was on a \nfirst-name basis with former Senators such as David Pryor, Thomas \nEagleton, Gary Hart, and Jennings Randolph. Margo's commitment to \nproviding a pleasant, comfortable, and professional environment for \nSenate functions resulted in close friendships. Senator Randolph would \noften call her at home, making requests for a special bread with nuts \non it. After returning from their honeymoon, Senator Joe Biden and his \nwife shared their pictures with her. Instead of calling it the Senate \nDining Room, Senator Pryor referred to the Senate Dining Room as simply \n``Margo's Room.''\n  After working in the Senate Dining Room, Margo took a position in the \naccounting office processing bids for the Senate Restaurant. Several \nyears later, she moved to the Capitol Senator's Dining Room where she \nwas a hostess. After working as a hostess, she worked in the Senate \ncatering office, where she has been for the last 13 years.\n  In her years on Capitol Hill, Margo has seen a great variety of \nevents. She hosted functions with the NFL, the Dalai Lama, and a number \nof other notable people. Among others, she met Paul Newman, whose \nsuitcase she watched in the kitchen as he spoke at an event. During \nannual events at Union Station commemorating Columbus Day, Dr. David R. \nCurfman, president of the National Columbus Celebration Association, \ntold her that she was the only one who understood what he needed.\n  Margo will miss the people she works with, whom she considers to be \nlike family. In turn, I know she will be missed greatly by those who \nhave had the opportunity to know and work with her. In fact, Margo has \nbeen such a presence in the Senate, and has befriended so many over the \nyears, that it is difficult to express how much she will be missed. I \nam pleased to join the entire Senate community in thanking Margo for \nher years of service and wishing her a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10710-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JIM SHANE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to salute the service of a \ndistinguished Kentuckian. This gentleman recently ended a long career \ndevoted to the service of his country and our commonwealth.\n  His name is Jim Shane, and I am proud to say Jim is a friend of mine. \nJim recently stepped down as executive director of the Kentucky \nCommission on Military Affairs, a post he held since 1997. During his \ntenure, Jim can point to many accomplishments, but he was particularly \ninstrumental in preparing Kentucky for the rigors of the 2005 Base \nRealignment and Closure--BRAC--process. The commonwealth, in particular \nFort Knox, was a big winner in the BRAC process, and no one was more \ninstrumental in this success than Jim.\n  Jim had a vision for Fort Knox, one in which the installation would \nagain be a home to combat troops and to a number of major Army \ncommands. He then worked tirelessly with Federal and State officials, \nthe BRAC Commission and the Department of Defense to make that \nconception of Fort Knox a reality. The result was that Fort Knox \nemerged revitalized from the BRAC process. Consequently, central \nKentucky stands to gain immeasurably from the economic benefits \nstemming from the installation's enhancement, and our armed forces will \nbe the better for Fort Knox's improved stature.\n  Prior to his service for Kentucky, Jim served his country with great \ndistinction. He spent 27 years of commissioned service in the Army, \nrising to the rank of brigadier general. His career highlights include \nservice as Deputy Commanding General, United States Recruiting Command, \nin which he was responsible for manning the Army's all-volunteer force.\n  Jim also received numerous medals, awards and decorations for his \nefforts in the Army including the Distinguished Service Medal, the \nDefense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal, with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the \nJoint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army \nAchievement Medal, the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Identification badge.\n  I am proud to say that Jim is also a fellow alumnus of the University \nof Louisville.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring this fine \nKentucky patriot for his long and notable career of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10710-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10710-S10711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JOHN LEE McELROY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is never too late to honor great \nheroism and sacrifice. That is why I am proud to say that after 40 \nyears, a brave Kentuckian lost in battle will finally return home with \nhonor to American soil.\n  On May 12, 1968, MAJ John Lee McElroy of the U.S. Air Force undertook \nwhat would be his final mission. Stationed in the Quang Tin province of \nthe Republic of Vietnam, he was the navigator on a C-130 Hercules \naircraft when his plane was struck by intense enemy fire and crashed. \nThere were no survivors.\n  ``On this particular day [Major McElroy] was flying a most important \nmission of aerial evacuation for American and allied personnel,'' wrote \nCOL Marion F. Garuthers, the major's commander, in a letter to his \nparents. ``His example of Christian living significantly influenced all \npersons with whom he associated.''\n  Sadly, while the family of Major McElroy knew his final fate, they \ndid not get to say their final goodbyes. For four decades, his remains \nwent unrecovered. His wife, Regina M. McElroy, and his parents, Oscar \nL. and Gladys V. McElroy, passed away never knowing if\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\ntheir loved one's remains would be found and brought back to the United \nStates.\n  Now, thanks to the work of some dedicated men and women in the \nDepartment of Defense, Major McElroy's remains have been identified. \nAlong with the rest of his flight crew, Major McElroy will return from \nVietnam and join the honored few who rest in Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  Born in Eminence, KY, in 1932, Major McElroy served his country in \nthe Armed Forces for 12 years. Several months after his tragic death, \nhe was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air \nMedal and the Purple Heart for his valor in uniform.\n  At that medal ceremony were Major McElroy's three children--Russell \nLee McElroy, Mary McElroy Tucker, and Linda Anne McElroy Starnes. \nRussell, the oldest, was just 14 years old at the time.\n  Now every one of them is older than their father ever was. And now \nit's their turn to take care of the father who cared for them, by \nseeing him laid to rest this December 18 in a hero's grave.\n  Our Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky cannot be grateful enough \nfor MAJ John Lee McElroy's service and immense sacrifice. We owe the \nMcElroy family a debt that cannot be repaid, because he died defending \nall of us and our freedoms.\n  I know the entire U.S. Senate joins me in expressing comfort and \npride that this courageous airman has finally returned home. It is \nnever too late to honor our heroes. And it is never too late for one \nKentucky family to say their farewells and see a hero rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10711-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10711-S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Walker\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the life and heroic service of SSG Timothy H. Walker. \nStaff Sergeant Walker, a member of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort \nCarson, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq on November 8, 2008, when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was 38 years \nold.\n  A native of Tennessee, Staff Sergeant Walker joined the Army in 1990. \nHe served in Bosnia from 1999 to 2000, Kuwait in 2001, and also served \ntwo tours of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his \nmost recent deployment, Staff Sergeant Walker, a combat medic himself, \nwas actively involved in training Iraqis to treat combat wounds on the \nbattlefield, and he served as the medical material coordinator for the \nIraqi Security Forces logistics coordination team, which teaches Iraqi \npolice officers and soldiers how to track and receive medical supplies.\n  Throughout his 18 years of service, and in every capacity, Staff \nSergeant Walker distinguished himself through his courage, his \ndedication to duty, and his willingness to take on any challenge--no \nmatter how dangerous, no matter how big or small. His extraordinary \nbravery and talent earned him more than 20 awards and medals, including \nthe Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Staff Sergeant Walker is remembered by those who knew him as a \nconsummate professional and friend who they could turn to in times of \nneed, and who they could always count on to raise their spirits in \ntimes of sadness. They recall his knack for giving people nicknames, \nand the infectiousness of his laughter. And, most of all, they remember \nhis devotion to his wife and children, and to his country.\n  The Greek historian Thucydides wrote that ``the bravest are surely \nthose who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and \ndanger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it.'' Throughout \nour Nation's history, the bravest have gone out to meet every danger \nthat has imperiled our way of life. They stormed the beaches of \nNormandy and Iwo Jima facing long odds, and now, in 2008, they traverse \nthe mountains of Afghanistan and navigate the cities of Iraq under \nconstant threat of insurgent attacks. The bravest have kept us safe and \nstrong. They will always make us proud.\n  Staff Sergeant Walker's service was in keeping with this American \ntradition. At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat \nzones throughout the world to attend to the injuries of his men. And \nthough their fate on the battlefield was uncertain, his men knew that, \nin Staff Sergeant Walker, they were in good hands. For the lives he \nsaved, and for the lives he touched, Staff Sergeant Walker will be \nforever remembered as one of the bravest.\n  To Staff Sergeant Walker's mother Barbara, his father Wayne, his wife \nDawn, his children Gregory and Madison, his sister Shelly, and all his \nfriends and family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I \nhope that, in time, the pain of your loss is\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\nassuaged by your pride in Tim's service to his country and by your \nknowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his \nservice and his sacrifice.\n\n\n                         Sergeant Jon L. Stiles\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor \nthe life and heroic service of Sergeant Jon L. Stiles. Sergeant Stiles, \nassigned to the 927th Engineer Company, 769th Engineer Battalion, was \nkilled on November 13, 2008, when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his patrol in Shubhuyan, Afghanistan. He was 38 years \nold.\n  Sergeant Stiles grew up in Highlands Ranch, CO, and after graduating \nfrom high school, spent nearly 13 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and 2 \nyears in the Army. Two years following his discharge, he moved back to \nColorado, joined the Colorado National Guard, and was deployed to \nAfghanistan, where he worked to clear transportation routes of IEDs and \ninsurgents in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  This past October, Sergeant Stiles saved the lives of three fellow \nsoldiers when he rescued them from underneath a burning vehicle that \nwas struck by a suicide bomber, an act of incredible bravery that \nearned him the Bronze Star. He suffered serious damage to his lungs and \nvocal chords as a result of this incident, but instead of taking \nmedical leave, he insisted on returning to battle. He believed strongly \nin our mission in Afghanistan, cared deeply for his men, and wanted to \nmake a difference.\n  Sergeant Stiles' friends and family remember him as a soldier's \nsoldier with a passion for military service in his DNA. He was an avid \noutdoorsman known to brave sub-zero temperatures to get in a day of \nfishing. He was generous with hugs and incredibly loyal to his friends. \nHe was a loving husband who wanted to live peacefully with his wife in \nthe mountains of Colorado. And he was a proud American willing to \nsacrifice everything in defense of the country he held dear.\n  Adlai Stevenson once asked, ``what do we mean by patriotism in the \ncontext of our times? I venture to suggest that what we mean is a sense \nof national responsibility . . . a patriotism which is not short, \nfrenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication \nof a lifetime.'' Sergeant Stiles felt this sense of responsibility at a \nyoung age and served with the steady dedication that reminds us of what \nit is to be a true patriot. In his memory, and with his inspiration, \nmay we all continue to work to make our union more perfect, and our \nworld safer for all.\n  To Sergeant Stiles' mother Linda, his father Lynn, his wife Launa, \nhis sister Natalie, his brother Charles, his grandparents Maxine and \nKenney, and all his friends and family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you \nmust be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss is \nassuaged by your pride in Jon's service to his country and by your \nknowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his \nservice and his sacrifice.\n\n\n                         SPECIALIST JAMES CLAY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Arkansas is grieving for a young hero, a \ncourageous soldier who was serving in Iraq as a member of the 224th \nMaintenance Company. This team keeps our troops safe and their \nequipment and vehicles running. It is a mission paramount to our \nsoldiers' success.\n  A member of the National Guard for almost 7 years, SPC James Clay of \nMountain Home, AR, showed great commitment and patriotism throughout \nhis assignment with the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, 39th \nBrigade Combat team. Of his service, MG William Wofford, adjutant \ngeneral of the Arkansas National Guard recalls, ``He was called to \nserve, and he answered that call with valiant service. He was a true \npatriot and will not soon be forgotten.''\n  Specialist Clay's untimely death has brought me to the Senate floor \ntoday, but I want to take a minute to honor his life. He overcame major \nobstacles in his personal life, including the death of both his \nparents, yet he graduated from Cotter High School in 2002 where \nteachers describe him as outstanding, considerate, and spirited. \nFriends remember Specialist Clay as a role model who persevered with \ndignity and humanity. Everyone who knew this young hero recalled his \ngreat smile and his compassion for others. It is no surprise that he \ndied fighting for the peace and security of others.\n  My prayers go out to Specialist Clay's family and friends, \nparticularly his high school sweetheart and wife, Mellissa Clay. During \nhis second Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln pledged, ``to care for \nhim who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his \norphans.'' Mrs. Clay, we will never forget the sacrifice of your loved \none, and we work to honor his memory, courage, and service to our great \nNation.\n\n\n                         Corporal Adrian Robles\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine \nCpl Adrian Robles, who was killed in action in Afghanistan on October \n22, 2008.\n  Corporal Robles, who was a native of Scottsbluff, NE, was assigned to \nthe Second Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine \nExpeditionary Force, based at Twentynine Palms, CA. He had worked his \nwhole life to become a marine. At age 16, Corporal Robles told his \nparents about his plans to enlist and, at 17, asked that they sign \nforms which would allow him to join before his 18th birthday. His \nparents told him to wait, so he finished high school and then enlisted \nimmediately.\n  Corporal Robles had previously served in Operation Iraqi Freedom in \n2006, and was on a tour serving in Afghanistan at the time of his \ndeath. Corporal Robles received three good conduct medals--an unusual \nachievement for such a young marine--as well as medals for his service \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. He served as a rifleman, the backbone of the \nMarine Corps. Originally deployed to help train Afghan Army recruits, \nhis unit's mission changed as the security situation deteriorated; and \nCorporal. Robles was ``in the fight'' right to the end.\n  Fully aware of the dangers he faced, Corporal Robles made the \ncourageous choice to serve his country and help the people of Iraq and \nAfghanistan achieve peace and security. He made the ultimate sacrifice \nso that others might enjoy the freedoms he had known all his life.\n  Corporal Robles represents all that we have to be proud of in our \nArmed Forces. I commend his bravery and selflessness while offering my \ndeepest condolences to the family members he left behind. It is small \ncomfort for those who must now go on without one they loved so dearly, \nbut they know that Corporal Robles gave his life for a noble goal. I \njoin all Nebraskans--indeed, all Americans--in mourning the loss of \nsuch a fine young man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10715-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10715-S10720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I thank you for the opportunity today to \npay tribute to a very special man, caring husband and father, and great \nSenator Gordon Smith.\n  Sadly, he will be leaving this august body soon and returning to \nprivate life. The United States Senate will be losing a great leader, a \nman of high integrity, and a true statesman.\n  Gordon joined the United States Senate in January 1997, after winning \nan election as a rural conservative in a State defined by a more \nliberal landscape. After his election, Senator Smith quickly made his \nmark as someone both sides of the aisle could work with for the good of \nhis State and our Nation. He displayed the characteristics of what I \nbelieve makes a truly great Senator--someone who is willing to roll up \nhis sleeves and battle for what he believes is right.\n  His commitment to Oregon was exemplary. He focused on issues that \nwere critical to the citizens of his State including education, health \ncare, natural resources, and bridging the rural-urban divide. Along the \nway he displayed a true independent streak, bucking his party when he \nbelieved he needed to go a different direction for the good of those he \nrepresented.\n  Senator Smith's leadership and abilities were greatly appreciated by \nthe committee members he served with, and the positions he was asked to \nassume. As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging he \npresided over critical issues facing our Nation's aging population. In \naddition, he made tremendous contributions to four additional \ncommittees: Commerce, Science,\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\nand Transportation; Energy and Natural Resources; Indian Affairs; and \nthe Finance Committee.\n  He was also selected four times by the leadership of our party to \nbecome the Deputy Whip, an important position we could all look to for \nguidance and support.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of traveling with Senator Smith on two \noccasions to Iraq to assess the situation first-hand, visit with the \ntroops, and become more intimately familiar with the challenges facing \nour country overseas. We shared a genuine interest and concern in the \nevents taking place in that country, and I will forever be grateful to \nSenator Smith for taking that journey with me.\n  Before joining the Senate, Gordon made his mark in the business \nworld--assuming the helm of his family's frozen vegetable processing \ncompany. His strength and commitment steered this company to new \nsuccess, and established himself as a business leader with qualities to \nemulate.\n  You can't talk about Gordon Smith without talking about the love he \nhas for people, especially his wonderful family. Gordon and his wife \nSharon have raised three wonderful children: Brittany, Garrett, and \nMorgan. Even while meeting the demands of his job, you always knew his \nthoughts and actions centered on home.\n  During his second term in office, Gordon and Sharon had to face a \ntragedy almost impossible to bear. Their son, Garrett, lost his battle \nwith depression and grief. As I watched this deeply grieving father, I \nwas so powerfully reminded that life isn't always about what happens in \nthe walls of the United States Capitol but it is about our families, \nour friends, and the love we share with those closest to our souls.\n  Senator Smith didn't just let his grief consume him--he took action. \nPerhaps his proudest accomplishment in Senate service would be the \npassing of a suicide prevention law, named after his son. This law \npassed unanimously and has made a real difference in programs across \nthe country that are designed to help those in critical emotional need.\n  I am truly grateful that I have had the opportunity to serve with \nthis great man for 12 years. In a town where true friendships can be \nrare, I have been blessed to find a true friend in Gordon Smith. \nAlthough we didn't always agree, our deepest fundamental beliefs were \nshaped in the same bedrock of less government, opportunities for all, \nand integrity in public service.\n  I always knew that whether in times of trouble or success, I had \nfound a true comrade in service, someone I could trust to do what is \nright and hold fast to the notion of public service for the people.\n  Robert Louis Stevenson stated, ``We are all travelers in the \nwilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an \nhonest friend.'' Gordon has been just that friend to me.\n  I will miss working alongside this great Senator, and true American. \nHowever, I know that throughout his life he will continue to work for \nthe good of others in whatever endeavors he chooses to follow. I want \nto wish Gordon and his wife Sharon and their children many years of \ncontinued success, happiness and peace as they travel life's path \ntogether. Thank you for the opportunity to honor this extraordinary \nman.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak today in honor of my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia. As you know, Senator Warner is retiring \nat the conclusion of this the 110th Congress, and I wanted to take a \nmoment to express my appreciation for his friendship and his years of \npublic service.\n  Senator Warner's retirement marks the end of a career in the service \nof the United States that has spanned more than 6 decades. John, having \nbeen born in 1927 and raised right here in Washington, DC, enlisted in \nthe Navy during World War II in January 1945. After the conclusion of \nthe war, he left the military to pursue a legal education at the \nUniversity of Virginia, only to rejoin the Navy, this time with the \nMarines, to serve in the Korean War.\n  In 1953, he finished his legal studies while still serving in the \nMarine Corps Reserves and spent the next 7 years as a government \nattorney, first as a clerk for a U.S. appeals court judge, then as an \nassistant U.S. attorney. Senator Warner left the public sector in 1960 \nto pursue a career in private legal practice, though it would not be \nlong until he was called into service again.\n  In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve as the \nUnder Secretary of the Navy. Just over 3 years later, he succeeded John \nH. Chafee as the Secretary of the Navy. This, of course, was a unique \nera in the history of U.S. diplomacy and, as Naval Secretary, John was \ninvolved in a number of diplomatic efforts involving the Soviet Union, \nmost notably the Sea Executive Agreement.\n  John's political career began in 1978 when he was elected to \nrepresent the State of Virginia in the Senate. He is the second longest \nserving Senator in Virginia's history and, by a margin of many years, \nthe longest serving Republican from the State. Of course, John and I \nhave crossed paths many times during our years in the Senate. We served \ntogether on the HELP Committee and the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. But, for me, one of the most memorable times I shared \nwith John took place outside the Halls of the Senate.\n  During the August recess of 1985, my son Jess and I were joined by \nJohn and his son on a fishing and boating trip in Utah. During one day \nof the trip, after returning from a hike, I was surprised to see a \nghostly-looking creature sitting in our campsite. As it turned out, \nJohn and some of the others had formed a mud hole down near the river, \nand he had been diving in and out of it. By the time I had returned to \nthe campsite, John was covered head to toe in pumice mud. Apparently, \nthe mud was good for the skin, but at the time I was unaware of this \nfact.\n  On the last day of the trip, John and I were fishing on Lake Powell \nand I was lucky enough to catch an 8 pound 60 striped bass. He was \nimpressed with my catch and he asked if he could keep it, apparently he \nwanted it as a trophy. That evening, we flew up north to an event in \nDeer Valley, UT, but because we didn't have time to change after the \nflight, we showed up in our fishing clothes. John strode into the fancy \nski lodge to meet the shirt-and-tied crowd sporting his jeans and \ncarrying my fish around with him! Though I can't be certain, it sure \nseemed like he was proud of it.\n  But, seriously, Mr. President, Senator Warner will always be \nremembered for his even-tempered nature and for his work on behalf of \nour men and women in the military. He has never been one to follow the \ncrowd for partisanship's sake, always choosing to follow his own \nconscience. I must admit that, over the years, John and I have found \nourselves in disagreement over issues that I believed to be of vital \nimportance. But he was always one to respect the views of his \ncolleagues in either party, even if he went a different way in the end.\n  I wish John and his wife Jeanne the best of luck in all their future \nendeavors. I think I speak for all my Senate colleagues when I say that \nthe Senate will be a lesser place without John in it.\n\n\n                             Elizabeth Dole\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak today regarding Senator Elizabeth \nDole, who will be departing from the United States Senate. I have known \nSenator Dole well and I am sure I am joined by many of my colleagues in \nsaying that she will be missed.\n  Senator Dole has shown her enthusiasm and commitment firsthand \nthrough her vast contributions over the last 6 years. Her true courage \nis the powerful force behind her remarkable public service career. Most \nimportant, Senator Dole can conceive and articulate goals that lift \npeople and unite them in the pursuit of objectives worthy of their best \nefforts.\n  As we look back on the challenges of our economy, Senator Dole has \nbecome a robust leader in helping our country focus on creating jobs, \nstrengthening national security, improving education, and making \nquality health care more affordable and accessible. Her initial \ndetermination was demonstrated as she graduated from Duke University \nand Harvard Law School, then entering her public career by serving \nunder multiple U.S. Presidents, including Ronald Regan and George H.W. \nBush. Throughout her career, she served as Secretary of Transportation, \nSecretary of Labor, and head of the American Red Cross. She\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\ncontinued her public service by bringing her zeal to the Senate as the \nfirst female U.S. Senator from North Carolina.\n  As a fellow Senator, Elizabeth displays qualities of a true southern \nbelle. She is a powerful role model. Her efforts to make North Carolina \nand America safer, stronger, and healthier have not gone unnoticed. \nMost importantly, she has played a key role in serving on the Senate \nArmed Services, Banking, Small Business and Aging Committees.\n  Mr. President, I extend my deepest gratitude to Senator Dole. I can \nsay, without reservation, that she is a dedicated public servant and \nfriend.\n\n\n                              John Sununu\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the departure of my \nesteemed colleague from New Hampshire, Senator John Sununu. I have \nknown Senator Sununu and his family for many years now, and I have \nworked closely with Senator Sununu since he first joined Congress in \n1996 in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate since 2002. \nToday, I am sure that I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying \nthat his service, his thoughtfulness, and his friendship in this \ninstitution will be missed.\n  Often referred to as one of the smartest people in Congress, Senator \nSununu earned bachelor of science and master of science degrees in \nmechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n(MIT). Setting the bar even higher, he also went on to earn a Master of \nBusiness Administration from Harvard University. Armed with that kind \nof education, it would have been easy for Senator Sununu to spend the \nrest of his days on a career track that would have compensated him and \nhis family in ways that most of us only dream about. Instead, after \nonly a few short years in the private sector, Senator Sununu chose to \nput his mind to work in Congress at solving some of the most pressing \nproblems and issues of our day. It is for that dedication of service to \nhis country to which I pay tribute today.\n  In addition to being one of the smartest people in Congress, Senator \nSununu also holds the well-known title of being the youngest Senator \ncurrently serving in our legislative body. While that feat alone is \nimpressive in its own right, I also like to think of Senator Sununu as \none of the most thoughtful Senators currently serving in the Senate. \nSpecifically, Mr. President, I mention Senator Sununu's act of \nfriendship and solidarity in 2005 when he shaved his own hair and stood \nalongside our mutual friend, Senator Arlen Specter, as he underwent \nchemotherapy treatment. A simple act, indeed, but it is one that has \nnot gone unnoticed and it is one that illustrates the thoughtfulness of \na man and a Senator who stood by his colleague in a time of great need. \nIt is that compassionate thoughtfulness of which we will all miss.\n  From his thoughtful work on energy and climate change legislation to \nhis valued friendship while working together on the Finance Committee, \nSenator Sununu has done a tremendous job for the people of New \nHampshire and our nation. As a colleague, I appreciate his instrumental \nsupport of the Flag Desecration Amendment in 2006. As a friend, I \nconvey my highest admiration and respect for what he has been able to \naccomplish while here in the Senate. It is that spirit of friendship of \nwhich all of us could always gain a little something from.\n  I wish Senator Sununu and his lovely family the best and thank them \nfor the years of service Senator Sununu has been able to provide to \nthis body as a result of their sacrifice. Senator Sununu's journey in \nthe U.S. Senate would not be complete without their support, and I am \nsure that they will all be happy to have their loving husband and \nfather around the house a little more often. Without hesitation, Mr. \nPresident, I can say that our loss is their gain. To Senator Sununu and \nhis family, I extend my deepest gratitude for the countless hours of \nservice, the simple acts of thoughtfulness, and the years of friendship \nthey have extended to me, my colleagues, and the people of the United \nStates. Given Senator Sununu's track record, I am certain that we will \nbe hearing more about him for many years to come.\n\n\n                              WAYNE ALLARD\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when the final gavel brings an end to the \ncurrent session of Congress, my good friend Wayne Allard has chosen to \nretire from the U.S. Senate. I know we will all miss him and the strong \nand powerful voice he has been for Colorado and the West. His eye for \ndetail and focus on the issues that are of such great importance to his \nconstituents and mine will be very difficult to replace.\n  Wayne is quite a remarkable guy. He knew at a very young age that he \nwanted to be a veterinarian and so he directed all his efforts to \npursuing that calling. He graduated from Colorado State University with \na degree in veterinary medicine and opened a veterinary practice in \nLoveland, CO, with his wife Joan.\n  As he worked at the profession he loved he got to know the people of \nthe area and the problems they faced every day. He wanted to do more \nthan just take care of their animals and livestock, so he started to \nbranch out to a career in politics. He knew he could find the time for \nboth his practice and for politics and the challenge of learning \nsomething new interested him.\n  Wayne had one great advantage as he began--his family's deep Colorado \nroots. Wayne's great-great-grandfather was a trapper and an explorer \nand he was one of the first permanent settlers of northern Colorado. \nHis family was among the first to move into the area and establish a \nhome there.\n  Wayne grew up on the family ranch. He learned at an early age the \nimportance of a hard day's work and of always doing your best. His days \nwere spent baling hay and helping out with whatever needed to be done \naround the ranch from dawn to dusk. Life on the ranch taught him a lot \nand instilled in him the values and principles that have served him \nwell throughout his life and his political career.\n  Wayne is a strong believer in the idea of a citizen-politician. He \nbelieves that the more experience we have in the workforce, the better \nwe are able to find legislative solutions to address the problems faced \nby families across the Nation.\n  That philosophy guided Wayne's efforts in the House and helped him \nwin his present seat in the Senate in 1997. That was the same year that \nI came to Washington and Wayne was one of the first people I met. Our \nshared commitment to the people of the West made us natural allies.\n  It was soon after we were sworn in as freshman Senators that Wayne \ntold me about his plans to hold an annual conference to get his \nconstituents more involved in the day-to-day operations of the \nGovernment. His dream took shape as the Allard Capital Conference. This \nannual event gives those who attend an opportunity to learn more about \nhow their Government works, and to share their good ideas about how to \nchange things. When it is over, it sends all those who attend back home \nto Colorado with a hefty dose of encouragement to continue the dialogue \nthey began here. It has been a great success and Wayne has been able to \nattract many of Washington's leaders to participate along with an \nimpressive list of Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  History will show that Wayne has been so successful in the Senate \nbecause he is committed to getting things done--and not in making sure \nhe gets the credit. It is another philosophy we share. You can get just \nabout anything done if you don't care who gets the credit for it. Wayne \nhas been a workhorse more than a showhorse and that has always pleased \nhis constituents.\n  Over the years, Wayne's commitment to fiscal sanity has been so \nstrong and so compelling that it drove him to give up his seats on the \nArmed Services and Environmental and Public Works Committees to join \nthe Appropriations Committee. From there he took the reins of the \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee and began the difficult and demanding \ntask of overseeing the construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. Up \ntill then, the project had been the center of a lot of attention \nbecause there were so many cost overruns, delays in its construction, \nand questions about how the project was being managed. Wayne brought \nsome sanity to the process. He started checking in on the work being \ndone on a regular basis and his oversight brought a much needed sense \nof accountability to the project which is now about to open its doors \nto the people who come to visit our Nation's Capitol every year. In the\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nyears to come, the Capitol Visitor Center will be part of the legacy of \nWayne's service to the people of our Nation.\n  There is another area of achievement that Wayne is probably more \nproud of--and that is his work on the Great Sand Dunes National Park, \nhis successful effort to convert Rocky Flats, which was formerly a \nnuclear weapons facility, to a national wildlife refuge, and his \ndetermination to protect and preserve the area around the Rio Grande \nRiver. All these projects were important to him because they enabled \nhim to make a difference back home in Colorado.\n  Now that his Washington years are drawing to a close, Wayne would be \nthe first to give a lion's share of the credit for all he has \naccomplished to his wife Joan. She was there from the start, working \nalongside him in his veterinary clinic and she is still by his side, \nthe most important part of his work in the Senate. They have long been \na remarkable team and it can truly be said that he and I both \novermarried. Joan has been his best friend, his most trusted adviser, \nand his wisest political adviser and counselor.\n  Now they will return to Colorado and to the life that they love. I \ndon't know what Wayne's plans are for the future, but I hope and expect \nI will continue to hear from him whenever he thinks that we just aren't \ngetting it right when it comes to the budget, the environment, or any \nof the other issues that have driven him during his service in the \nSenate. Whatever he decides to do, I know we will continue to hear from \nhim and that is something that can only continue to serve us all well. \nWayne is a special guy who loves Colorado and his country and he has \ndedicated his life to making them better places for us and for future \ngenerations to live. He can retire secure in the knowledge that he has \nsucceeded because he cared enough to serve.\n  Thank you, Wayne, for your heartfelt commitment to Colorado and the \nNation, for your willingness to serve the people in the Senate and most \nof all, thank you for your friendship. Diana joins in sending all the \nbest for a continued rich and rewarding life to you and Joan. And \nWayne, for me, please keep track of and share the good fishing spots. I \nknow most of them will be in Wyoming.\n\n\n                              larry craig\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to wish \nLarry Craig all the best as he retires and returns home to his beloved \nIdaho. I have enjoyed having a chance to work with him on issues of \nconcern to the people of our States. He has been an important part of \nthe work we have done on many of the issues that have come to the floor \nof the Senate and he will be difficult to replace.\n  Ever since he first arrived in the Senate, Larry has been a champion \nfor the West and a strong and powerful voice on the issues that concern \nthe people of Wyoming and Idaho. His dedication to making his home \nState a better place to live and his determination to make a difference \nin the Nation through his service in the Senate has made him a force to \nbe reckoned with for many years.\n  Larry has long Idaho roots that date back to his family's arrival in \nIdaho more than a century ago. He was born on the family ranch that his \ngrandfather had homesteaded back in 1899. The ranch has been the proud \nhome of the Craig family ever since.\n  Sometime during the days when Larry was a young man growing up in \nIdaho, he was bitten by the political bug. It got him started on the \npath toward what would be a career of public service. Then, in 1974, \nLarry was elected to the Idaho State Senate. It set him on a path that \nwould take him to the United States Senate.\n  Because of his background as a rancher and a farmer, Larry knows the \nimportance of the land and the need for us to be good stewards of all \nthe resources under our control. After all, as we have heard so very \noften, when it comes to the land, they aren't making any more of it. \nThat is why Larry has always been determined to ensure that Idaho's \nnatural treasures were well taken care of. It is not an exaggeration to \nsay that Larry has been the guardian at the gate to ensure the Federal \nGovernment didn't overstep its boundaries and overregulate the land in \nIdaho during his watch.\n  His commitment to the land and to the people of Idaho who rely on it \nfor their livelihood particularly showed itself during his service on \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He took full advantage of \nthe opportunity to work against any effort that would adversely affect \nthe ability of the people of Idaho to make good use of their State's \nland. Also on his agenda was the Endangered Species Act and the \nproblems that had come with its application. It was a fight Larry was \ndetermined to win and he did more than just express his concern. He \nrolled up his sleeves and got to work. The new law he helped to write \nis not only more effective, but it is also designed to minimize its \nimpact on property rights, employment and our State and local \neconomies.\n  In the years to come I will most remember Larry for his ability to \npresent his case with power and emotion whenever he would speak in \ncommittee or on the floor. Larry's speaking and his debating skills are \nsecond to none. He has been called one of the most influential of all \nthe western Senators and his conservative style has proven to be one of \nhis greatest strengths.\n  Larry is probably best known for his work on immigration and his \nsupport for the ability of seasonal workers to come to the United \nStates to work on our farms. He knows the importance of developing \nsolutions to tough problems like immigration that do not hurt State \neconomies or make life harder for our family farms and ranches.\n  The habits that he learned on the family ranch have been with him his \nentire life and that is why you will usually find him hard at work in \nhis garden. It is his favorite activity when he is away from his office \nand it is one he can share with his grandchildren. As the grandfather \nof three children myself, I can identify with his interest and the time \nhe sets aside to be with his eight grandchildren.\n  Speaking of his favorite hobby, he once said, ``My wife knows she's \nnot a golf widow or a skiing or a hunting widow. She's a gardening \nwidow.'' Larry is also a tremendous artist. His ``works'' are widely \nprized and collected.\n  Larry, I will be sorry to see you and Suzanne leave, saddlebags \nflapping in the wind as you ride off into the sunset. Now there will be \ntime for all the things you have been putting off for some day, for now \nthere will be plenty of some days for you to share with Suzanne. Diana \nand I wish you all the best in whatever you choose to do in the coming \nyears. As we have found, the end of one great adventure is only the \nbeginning of the next. So it will be for you. Good luck and God bless.\n\n\n                             pete domenici\n\n  Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment in time for me when \nwe come to the close of a session of Congress. As the clock counts down \nthe final hours of our legislative activities, it also signals the day \nwhen several of our colleagues will be retiring and ending their \nservice in the United States Senate. When the current session ends, one \nof my good friends and great allies in the Senate will be returning \nhome to his beloved New Mexico. He is Senator Pete Domenici and I know \nwe will all miss him and his powerful presence in the Senate.\n  In the months to come, Pete may no longer be serving with us, but he \nwill not be forgotten. He has left his mark on the Senate and on us all \nin too many ways for us not to remember him and how hard he has been \nworking for the people of New Mexico, the West, and the Nation over the \nyears. Every day he came to the Senate he was focused on what he could \ndo today to make our tomorrows better for us all. The leadership he \nprovided on so many issues will be very difficult to replace.\n  Pete began his career right out of college when he was deemed to be a \ngood enough pitcher to be signed by a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team. It \nwas a good life, but it wasn't the one for Pete. He decided after the \nseason was over that baseball wasn't what he wanted to do and so he \ndecided instead to do a different kind of pitching--to the people of \nthe city he lived in. That pitch helped launch him on his true life's \nwork--serving the people of his State and helping to make New Mexico a \nbetter place to live.\n  When Pete decided to get involved in politics his friends told him he \nwas\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\nmaking a big mistake. They warned him that it was a tough way to make a \nliving and that it would be a rough life. Politics is a harsh affair, \nthey told him, and they warned him that people would attack him and his \nreputation. They wondered why a guy who had such great gifts wanted to \ntake on what would be a very difficult challenge.\n  We are very fortunate that Pete didn't take their advice. Instead, he \ndecided to run for the Senate and to bring his case to the people. To \nno one's surprise they liked what they heard and Pete came to \nWashington after the 1972 elections. They have been sending him back \nhere with enthusiasm ever since.\n  It is not an easy thing to sum up a career in the Senate that has \nspanned four decades. That is the mark of an individual who has dared \nto try to achieve great things--and succeeded. He came to the Senate \nwith a great awareness of what needed to be done and with a combination \nof his own brand of style and substance he has been part of a great \neffort to make those goals a reality.\n  Looking over his record in the Senate, it shows that Pete has been a \nkey player in our work to achieve energy independence. Together with \nhis New Mexico colleague, Jeff Bingaman, Pete worked to bring a \nnational energy bill that seemed doomed to be stalled forever to the \nfloor for a vote and on to the President's desk for his signature. Pete \nwas always willing to work with any Member, no matter their place on \nthe political spectrum, if it meant making progress on a key issue. \nThat is why I would sum up Pete's career in one word--success. Pete has \na knack of finding a way to make things happen and we have all \nbenefited from his abilities.\n  For my part, I also worked with him on the Mental Health Parity bill. \nFor too long the provisions of our health care system provided \nunequally for physical health and mental health problems. Pete knew \nthat was unfair, and he was determined to do something about it. \nWorking together with me and the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senator Edward Kennedy, Pete was \nable to help bring a bill to the floor that required health insurance \nplans that offer mental health coverage to provide it on an equal level \nwith that afforded to physical illnesses. It is a major change in \nhealth care coverage that will make life better for millions and \nmillions of Americans. It is a major accomplishment and it will serve \nas a special part of his legacy of achievements in the Senate.\n  In the months to come we will also miss Pete's leadership and his \nwise counsel as we continue to work on the economic problems facing the \nNation. Pete is an expert on budget issues and he has served as our \nBudget Committee chairman. As I have served alongside him over the \nyears, I have appreciated having the opportunity to observe him in \naction and work with him on measures of concern to us both. He has been \na tireless worker in the effort to bring the Nation's expense account \nto a biennial budget. He has also fought long and hard to try to put a \nrein on runaway Federal spending. He was willing to do whatever was \nnecessary to reach an agreement that would balance the budget. He got \nthat done by once again working with Members of both sides of the aisle \nand a Democrat administration. That was just like him. If there was a \nway to get something done, Pete usually found it, and the new way he \nhelped develop usually got the bill passed and signed into law.\n  For me and for most of us, what I will most remember is Pete's \npersonality and his great warmth. He is a genuine good guy who is very \ndown to Earth. He is a gentle man and a gentleman in every sense of the \nword. He is a man of great faith who believes that public service is \nthe rent we pay for the space we occupy on God's green Earth. Simply \nput, he is the kind of person you would want to have for a friend. That \nis why so many of us treasure his friendship. He is loyal and close to \nother Members and to all his staff. He treats his staff like Members of \nhis extended family and not like staff. I think that is why they work \nso hard for him. They love him like a father because he treats them, as \nhe treats everyone he knows, with kindness and respect.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention his wife, Nancy. She has been a \npillar of strength and a source of great support and encouragement to \nhim in his life. I like to say that Pete and I both overmarried. She \nhas been an essential member of his team since they met and I know he \nwould say that whatever success has come to him in his life he owes in \ngreat degree to her influence. She is his greatest friend, his wisest \ncounselor and his closest confidante. Together they have done a \ntremendous job for the people of New Mexico and the influence they have \nhad on it can be seen from one corner of the State to the other. She \nhas been a partner in the fight for mental health parity.\n  The story is told that when Pete was accepted into law school his \nfather made him a deal. I will finance your law school education, he \ntold him, but only if you agree to my terms. If you do well, I will be \nproud to pay your way. If you bring home an ``F'' I will expect to be \nrepaid.\n  Well, my friend, as you return home, your father would be very proud \nof the report card you will take with you from the Senate and from the \npeople of New Mexico. You have done a great job and everything you have \ndone in your life and in your career you have done very well. You take \nwith us our great praise and an ``A'' from us all for effort, for the \nwork you have done and for the results you have achieved. God bless and \nbe with you, Pete and Nancy. I know we will all miss you and think of \nyou often. Make sure you leave your number with us for I know we will \nbe reaching out to you for your advice and thoughtful suggestions in \nthe days to come. That is one thing that will never change.\n\n\n                              John Warner\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to join with my \ncolleagues in wishing John Warner all the best as he retires from the \nUnited States Senate after 30 years of service to the people of \nVirginia. John has had a long and distinguished career and he will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Like so many of us, John's early years had a great influence on his \nlife and helped to shape his character and mold his destiny. John's \nfather was a surgeon and he saw to it that John's education began at an \nearly age and included samples of just about everything there was to \nlearn. John was soon picking up on a course of study that included \nmath, music, science, Latin and much, much more.\n  During those early years, John felt the call to serve his country, so \nhe joined the Navy when he was 17 years old so he could be part of our \nNation's heroic effort in World War II. He then joined the Marines in \n1950 to be part of our forces fighting the Korean war.\n  John's service in our Armed Forces and his tenure as our Secretary of \nthe Navy has made him one of the Senate's strongest and most \nknowledgeable voices on the use of our Nation's military. He has been \none of the Congress' most respected and most sought after experts on \nour actions in Iraq, the war against terrorism, and our efforts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. His experience has also made him a leader in the \nSenate's oversight on defense spending.\n  Through the years, John has been an important part of the debate on \nglobal warming. His concern about the issue and the future of our \nNation led him to ask us for our good ideas and common sense proposals, \nregardless of our party affiliation, in an effort to reach a consensus \non the issue that would ultimately lead us to a workable solution.\n  There are two important reasons why John has been such a tireless \nworker on this and other similar issues. John shares my love of the \ngreat outdoors and all that it has to offer. He enjoys taking time from \nhis busy schedule to hunt and fish with his grandchildren. He remembers \nthe days he spent with his father taking part in those great activities \nand he wants to give his grandchildren the same gift. So do I. I think \nthat shows John Warner has a streak of Wyoming in him and has fished \nthere.\n  In the years that I have served with John I have always been \nimpressed with his unique style and his ability to present his \npositions on the issues with great power and force. John has always \nbeen one to reach out to members on both sides of the aisle, and his \nability to bring us together on the issues has helped us to develop \nanswers to problems that seemed to elude us. I don't\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\nthink anyone has a better grasp of the importance of finding a third \nway to do things than John. He knows that there are always three ways \nof beginning our work on the issues. The first two lead to gridlock as \nthey are the extreme positions on the issue. The third way is closer to \nthe middle and has elements in it that everyone can agree on. That is \nusually what gets things done.\n  That has always been John's measure of success. He has never been one \nwho was concerned about making points, he has always been interested in \nmaking progress.\n  John will always be remembered for the leadership he brought to the \nSenate on a number of issues that concerned him. As he worked on them \nall he showed his independence and his willingness to consider all \nviewpoints to find the one that he thought stood the best chance of \nsucceeding, on the floor and in the field. John would be an excellent \ndiplomat because he knows how to disagree without being disagreeable. \nHe has forged good working relationships with us all and that is why he \nhas so many friends in the Senate.\n  John has been a great public servant and his career shows the results \nhe has been able to achieve in every area of his life. I am proud of \nhis service in the Senate on behalf of the people of Virginia, his \nservice in our Armed Forces, and especially, I am proud to call him my \nfriend.\n  It is always difficult at the end of the session to say goodbye to \nour colleagues who are retiring. We have worked together for so many \nyears that we will miss their thoughtful suggestions, their well chosen \nwords and their commitment to the issues we have worked on together.\n  For John, the good part of goodbye is the knowledge that we will meet \nagain and, I am sure, we will work together again, laugh again, and \ncontinue to enjoy all that life has to offer again. This is not a time \nto say goodbye, just a reminder to be well until we see each other \nagain.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you, John and to Jeanne. \nYou deserve nothing but the best life has to offer and you shall have \nit. I look forward to the days ahead and a time when we can get out our \nfishing poles and explore some of Virginia's best rivers and streams. \nGood luck and God bless.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Mr. President, soon the last remaining items of business on the \nlegislative calendar will be taken up and the current session of \nCongress will draw to a close. When it does, several of our colleagues \nwill be returning home and leaving public service. We will miss them, \ntheir good ideas and the touch of creativity they brought to our work \nin the Senate during their years of service to the people of their home \nStates.\n  When I am asked about the members with whom I have had the privilege \nto serve during my Senate career, Chuck Hagel will certainly come to \nmind. I don't think anyone has a more interesting life story to tell \nthan Chuck and certainly few have achieved the level of success he has \nbeen able to attain in his public life and in the business world.\n  Chuck grew up in a small Nebraska town where he learned the value of \na day's work at an earlier than usual age. Chuck found his first job \nwhen he was only nine and he's been hard at work ever since. When he \nlost his father at the age of 16 it fell to him, as the oldest child, \nto help raise the younger ones of his family.\n  That was also about the time that Chuck made his first run for \noffice. When he was in high school he decided to run for Student \nCouncil President. He knew he would have to do something different in \nhis campaign to separate himself from the others who were running, so \nhe tied a chicken to the hood of his car and drove around the school \nannouncing the reasons why he was in the race. No one had ever seen \nanything quite like that before and he won quite easily I am sure.\n  After his high school years, Chuck heard the call to serve his \ncountry and he and his brother joined the Army and served in Vietnam. \nHe was seriously wounded twice and received two Purple Hearts during \nhis military service. During one of his missions, he and his brother \nwere trapped in their armored personnel carrier when an enemy mine \nexploded beneath them. Chuck pulled his unconscious brother to safety \nand probably saved his life. It took 10 years for him to fully heal \nfrom the effects of the injuries he suffered that day.\n  When he graduated from the University of Nebraska he began his \npolitical career in earnest. He joined the staff of a Republican \ncongressman from Nebraska and impressed him and his staff so much that \nhe steadily rose in responsibility to be his top aide.\n  Equally impressive has been Chuck's success as a businessman. He sold \nalmost all he had to begin a cellular phone company with two partners. \nHis hard work and determination to succeed paid off and his investment \nwas multiplied many times over.\n  That kind of success would have been enough for most people, but not \nfor Chuck. Chuck felt the call to bigger things and he set his sights \non going to Washington to make life a little better for the people back \nhome in Nebraska.\n  That was his platform when Chuck ran for the Senate in 1996. The \nexperts thought he was a long shot and a lot of people said he didn't \nstand a chance. Once again, Chuck defied the odds and relied on the \njudgment of the people of Nebraska instead of the predictions of the \nexperts. The people of Nebraska knew a good thing when they saw it and \nChuck was sent to the Senate to represent them.\n  Chuck and I were part of the same freshman class and when we arrived \nwe both looked forward to being named to the committees on which we \nwould serve so we could make a difference for our States and the \nNation. Chuck was very pleased and proud when Senator Lugar offered him \nan invitation to join the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Chuck took full advantage of the opportunity and made it the focus of \nhis efforts in the Senate. He made a point of visiting other countries \nand meeting with foreign leaders to increase his expertise on foreign \npolicy. Working closely with Senator Lugar and Senator Biden, he has \nbeen a voice on the committee that is sought after for his perspective \non the issues that involve our relations with other countries.\n  Over the years I have enjoyed serving with Chuck and working with him \non two of his top priorities, cutting Federal spending and making our \ntax system more workable and more responsive to the needs of our \nnational economy. He can be very proud of all he has achieved, \nespecially his support of fast track authority so the President could \nnegotiate trade deals that cannot be changed by the Congress. His work \nin the area of international trade has made a great difference \nthroughout the United States and helped improve our relationship with \nour trading partners.\n  Now Chuck's Washington years are coming to a close and he will be \nmoving on together with Lilibet to something new and different in their \nlives. Diana and I have always found that when one great adventure ends \nanother one takes its place. That is our wish for you. Whatever the \nfuture holds for you and Lilibet we wish you all the best. The only \ngood part about saying goodbye is the knowledge that you will keep in \ntouch with us and continue to offer your good advice and the unique \nbrand of common sense that you learned from your service in Washington, \nyour success in your business, and your years growing up in Nebraska, \nWyoming's neighbor to the East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10720-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10720-S10721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 223 of S. Con. Res. \n70, I previously filed adjustments to the 2009 budget resolution for \nH.R. 2095, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Those adjustments \nreflected the Congressional Budget Office's estimate at that time of \nthe budgetary effects of H.R. 2095.\n  CBO has since revised that estimate, increasing the amount of net \nsavings over both 5 and 10 years. As such, H.R. 2095 still meets the \nconditions required for the release of the reserve fund under section \n223, including being fully paid for over both the 6- and 11-year time \nperiods.\n  Consequently, I am revising the adjustments made on September 29 \npursuant to section 223 to reflect CBO's updated estimate. This \nadjustment affects both the budgetary aggregates\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\nand the allocation provided to the Senate Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nrevisions to S.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a subject that \nis near and dear to my heart, the Senate Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency Caucus.\n  Would the distinguished gentlemen from North Dakota and Idaho engage \nin a colloquy with me on this topic?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be pleased to engage in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would also like to join my colleagues in a colloquy on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank my colleagues. The need for a strong renewable \nenergy policy has never been more timely. This is something I have \nworked on for many years. As a member of the House of Representatives I \nwas a member of the House Renewable Energy Caucus, and when I was \nelected to the Senate, discovered that no such similar caucus existed \nhere. So I, along with Senators Jeff Bingaman, Tim Johnson, Jim \nJeffords, and Bob Kerry, founded the Senate Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency Caucus.\n  The caucus is still going strong today with leadership from Senator \nByron Dorgan, Senator Joe Lieberman, and myself. It is a nonpartisan \ngroup that strives to increase awareness of the various forms of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in the United \nStates.\n  I have been honored to serve as the Republican cochair since the \ninception of the Senate caucus, during this time we have seen the \ncaucus membership grow and today more than a third of the Senate is a \nmember. The caucus has hosted numerous events and briefings and helped \nhundreds of renewable energy groups display their ideas and \ntechnologies. It has also been a forum for sharing thousands of news \narticles relating to renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n  As many of you know, I am retiring from the Senate at the end of this \nterm and will no longer serve as cochair of the caucus. I am proud of \nthe work that the caucus has done, and I am confident it will continue \nto do great work in the future.\n  I know it will do great work in the future because it will have \nstrong leadership. I greatly appreciate the work of the other cochairs, \nSenators Dorgan and Lieberman. They have a remarkable dedication to \nrenewable energy. With the addition of the new Republican cochair, I \nhave no doubt that the caucus will be as strong as ever.\n  The man replacing me on the caucus is an ardent advocate for \nrenewable energy, Senator Mike Crapo. As a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Crapo has helped craft successful legislation to \nprovide tax credits for production and investment in renewable energy \nsuch as wind, solar, and geothermal, and as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, he supported expanded usage of renewable \nbiofuels.\n  Senator Crapo also represents a State that is passionate about \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency. The State of Idaho has received \nawards for its dedication to renewable energy and cutting edge research \nis taking place every day at the fine colleges and universities in \nIdaho.\n  Mr ALLARD. Senator Dorgan, you have helped me cochair the caucus for \nseveral years, and your efforts have been invaluable. Do you share my \nestimation that Senator Crapo will make a strong co-chair?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Senator Crapo you have been a strong advocate for \nrenewable energy for years, and I am sure are looking forward to \ncochairing the caucus. Do you have any comments?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes. I have long admired the work of Senator Allard in \nforming and developing the caucus over the years. I am honored to be \nchosen as the next cochair of the caucus and am eager to build on the \nwork he has accomplished thus far.\n  As you mentioned, my home State of Idaho is one of the Nation's \nleaders in renewable energy. Idaho has significant and developed \nhydropower, wind, and geothermal energy resources, which has led us to \nhave one of the five lowest per capita and total emissions profiles of \nany State.

Mr. President, in July, the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship passed S. 3362, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act \nof 2008, by a unanimous 19-0 vote. Since then, Senator Snowe, myself, \nand others have worked diligently to address concerns that have been \nexpressed to us by our colleagues and the administration, and we \nreached an agreement with the administration on the terms of the bill. \nUnfortunately, at the last minute, a colleague had objections and we \ncannot pass the bill.\n  As the title suggests, the purpose of S. 3362 was to reauthorize the \nSmall Business Administration's Small Business Innovation Research and \nSmall Business Technology Transfer programs, otherwise known as SBIR \nand STTR. The bill makes improvements to these programs that will allow \nthem to work better for small businesses, while contributing to our \neconomy, fulfilling the priority research needs of the nation, and \nexpanding and diversifying our military's supply base.\n  Small businesses continue to receive only about 4 percent of Federal \nresearch and development dollars despite\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\nthe fact that they employ nearly 40 percent of America's scientists and \nengineers, produce more than 14 times more patents than large \nbusinesses and universities, and produce patents that are of higher \nquality and are more than twice as likely to be cited. Unlike large \nbusinesses, which tend to focus more on improving existing product \nlines, and university research, which leans toward education and \npublications, America's small businesses and entrepreneurs are the ones \nwilling to take on the high-risk, high-reward research that truly \ndrives innovation.\n  The SBIR and STTR programs are two of the very few Federal programs \nthat tap into the scientific and technical community found in America's \nsmall businesses. These programs foster government-industry \npartnerships by making competitive awards to firms with the best \nscientific proposals in response to the research needs of our agencies \nand by helping to move technologies from the lab to the marketplace or \nfrom the lab to insertion in a government program or system.\n  Since the inception of the SBIR program in 1982, recipients of SBIR \nand STTR awards have gone on to produce more than 84,000 patents and to \ngenerate millions of well-paying jobs across all 50 States. Both \nprograms have garnered high praise from well-respected sources, \nincluding from the National Academy of Sciences, which completed its \ncomprehensive assessment of SBIR last year. Governments around the \nworld are increasingly adopting SBIR-type programs to encourage \ninnovation in their countries.\n  Among the technologies pioneered by SBIR-funded small businesses are \na machine that uses lasers and computer cameras to sort and inspect \nbullets at a much finer level than the human eye can manage, the \ntechnology that creates the ``invisible'' condensation trail of the B-2 \nbomber, a therapeutic drug to treat chronic inflammatory disease, and a \nnerve gas protection system. With regard to the bullet sorting \ntechnology, developed by CyberNet Systems, a small, women-owned \nbusiness located in Ann Arbor, MI, and currently in use in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, that SBIR technology is estimated to have saved taxpayers \nmore than $300 million. Those are real cost savings and tangible \ntechnological improvements and we could have more such technologies if \nwe increased the SBIR and STTR allocations, as the legislation that \npassed Committee proposed to do.\n  S. 3362 is the result of much deliberation and compromise and \nreflects a truly bipartisan effort to strengthen and improve the SBIR \nand STTR programs. I am proud that Senator Snowe, Senator Bond, myself, \nand others were able to come together to reach agreement on a number of \nvery difficult issues, including on the involvement of firms majority-\nowned and controlled by multiple venture capital companies in the SBIR \nprogram, and that we unanimously passed this legislation out of \ncommittee. And as I said at the start of my remarks, I am also proud \nthat we were able to resolve our differences with the administration to \ncraft a bill that would keep these programs going strong.\n  It is truly a shame that one Republican in this Chamber has blocked \nthis bill from passing, and that all of the effort and all of the \ncompromises that went into getting the legislation to this point will \nbe lost. I ask my colleagues to be aware that the SBIR program is \ntemporarily authorized through March 20, 2009, that the STTR program \nexpires on September 30, 2009, and that we should act fast in the new \nyear to extend or comprehensively authorize these programs to help keep \nour country ahead in technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10722-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTEREST ON LAWYERS' TRUST ACCOUNT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, last week, I joined Senator Cardin and \nSenators Specter, and others in sending a letter to the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, FDIC, in an effort to preserve the viability of \nthe Interest on Lawyers' Trust Account program, IOLTA. We have asked \nthe FDIC to ensure that the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, \nTGLP, through which the FDIC guarantees funds in bank accounts, will \nalso cover lawyer trust accounts. The IOLTA program, which distributes \ninterest on client funds held in lawyer trust accounts to legal aid \nprograms, has been an enormous success in securing legal representation \nfor lower-income Americans. All 50 States have IOLTA programs, and many \nStates mandate participation by practicing attorneys. This program \nprovides funding to important legal aid programs and helps ensure that \nno person goes without legal representation because of a lack of \nresources.\n  Our concern stems from the fact that the TGLP Interim Rule concerning \naccount insurance issued on October 23 would not extend unlimited FDIC \ninsurance to interest bearing lawyer trust accounts, ultimately hurting \nthe public benefit generated by these accounts. According to the FDIC's \nproposed rules for the TGLP, noninterest-bearing accounts would be \ninsured to protect an unlimited amount of funds. But the insurance for \ninterest-bearing accounts would be limited to $250,000. The lack of an \nexception for lawyer trust accounts threatens the IOLTA program because \nit poses a potential conflict for attorneys. Many lawyer trust accounts \ncontain pooled client funds, often in excess of $250,000. As a result \nof the FDIC's proposed rules, there is legitimate concern that \nattorneys would move client funds in excess of $250,000 to noninterest-\nbearing accounts in order to gain the insurance protection, and in an \neffort to manage client funds as responsibly as possible. This \npotential ethical dilemma could be prevented by a modification of the \nproposed rules.\n  Senator Cardin, Senator Specter, and I have suggested to the FDIC \nthat it modify its proposed rules to make an exception for lawyer trust \naccounts and provide unlimited insurance on interest bearing accounts \ncontaining client funds. This would be an important step towards \npreserving the success of the IOLTA program, and would remove any \npotential ethical dilemma for attorneys. Such a modification would \nensure that the interest generated by IOLTA accounts continues to be \ndistributed through local nonprofit organizations in each State to fund \ninvaluable legal aid services for low-income families.\n  I am hopeful that the FDIC will recognize the national importance and \nsuccess of this program, and will create the exception we have \nproposed. I would like to particularly thank the Vermont Bar \nAssociation for its advocacy in this regard, as well as the American \nBar Association for its attention to this issue. Legal representation \nfor everyone is an imperative for a fair and effective judicial system. \nThe IOLTA program has been successful in helping to ensure legal \nrepresentation for more Americans, and where these goals can be \naccomplished without the use of tax dollars, such a program should be \npreserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10722-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10722-S10723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING COLONEL JOHN W. RIPLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret to have to inform the Senate of \nthe passing of a truly great American: John W. Ripley, a retired Marine \nCorps colonel and hero of the Vietnam war.\n  Colonel Ripley will be best known for his achievements and self-\nsacrifice during the Vietnam war--particularly on April 2, 1972, when \nhe singlehandedly blew up the Dong Ha bridge. That bridge over the Cua \nViet River was a major thoroughfare for an invasion force from North \nVietnam. Colonel Ripley, serving with a marine unit from South Vietnam, \nmoved around the bridge like it was a trapeze and hung charges that \nwould blow it up and prevent the enemy's advance.\n  That story is the subject of innumerable books and articles. It is an \nabsolutely incredible feat, showing us how an act of individual bravery \ncan have a large strategic impact that affects an entire force. Indeed, \nthe removal of that bridge created a bottleneck that allowed allied \nforces to apply overwhelming air power and blunt that invasion.\n  After Vietnam, Colonel Ripley had a distinguished career that \nincluded going through some of the most challenging training programs \namong the world's militaries, including U.S. Army Ranger School. In his \nwillingness to undergo the ardors of combat and training, he emerged a \nmarine's marine, a steely and strong individual always ready to put his \ncountry and his fellow marines before himself.\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\n  John Ripley is a symbol for the vibrancy of the Marine Corps, one of \nthe most storied military forces in the globe's history, and a \ntestament to how--amid the enormity and vast confusion of war--a single \nperson can make a difference.\n  I will miss seeing him at various events, including those of the \nMarine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation. We will continue to honor his \nservice through support of the Marine Corps and of all of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an obituary on Colonel Ripley, which \nappeared in the November 4 edition of the New York Times, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 4, 2008]\n\n  Col. John W. Ripley, Marine Who Halted Vietnamese Attack, Dies at 69\n\n                           (By Dennis Hevesi)\n\n       John W. Ripley, a highly decorated former colonel who \n     entered Marine Corps lore when he single-handedly blunted a \n     major North Vietnamese offensive during the Vietnam War by \n     blowing up a strategically placed bridge, died Oct. 28 at his \n     home in Annapolis, Md. He was 69.\n       The cause has not been determined, his son Stephen said.\n       Colonel Ripley, who at the time was a captain and a \n     military adviser to a South Vietnamese Marine unit, blew up \n     the southern end of the Dong Ha Bridge over the Cua Viet \n     River on Easter Sunday, April 2, 1972. On the north side of \n     the bridge, which was several miles south of the \n     demilitarized zone, some 20,000 North Vietnamese troops and \n     200 tanks were poised to sweep into Quang Tri Province, which \n     was sparsely defended.\n       Going back and forth for three hours while under fire, \n     Captain Ripley swung hand over hand along the steel I-beams \n     beneath the bridge, securing himself between girders and \n     placing crates holding a total of 500 pounds of TNT in a \n     diagonal line from one side of the structure to the other. \n     The I-beam wings were just wide enough to form pathways along \n     which he could slide the boxes.\n       When the boxes were in place on the bridge, Captain Ripley \n     attached blasting caps to detonate the TNT, then connected \n     them with a timed-fuse cord that eventually extended hundreds \n     of feet.\n       ``He had to bite down on the blasting caps to attach them \n     to the fuses,'' John Grider Miller, author of ``The Bridge at \n     Dong Ha,'' said on Monday. ``If he bit too low on the \n     blasting cap, it could come loose; if he bit too high, it \n     could blow his head apart.''\n       Captain Ripley bit safely, and the timed-fuse cord gave him \n     about half an hour to clamber off the bridge. Moments later, \n     his work paid off with a shock wave that tossed him into the \n     air but otherwise left him unharmed.\n       By placing the crates diagonally along the bridge, Mr. \n     Miller said, Captain Ripley had created ``a twisting motion \n     that ripped the bridge apart from its moorings so it couldn't \n     fall back in place, but collapsed into the river.''\n       There were about 600 South Vietnamese marines near the \n     south end of the bridge. ``South Vietnam would have been in \n     big trouble,'' said Fred Schultz, senior editor of Naval \n     History Magazine, a publication of the United States Naval \n     Institute. ``The force numbers defending on that side could \n     not have held against that North Vietnamese force.''\n       The destruction of the bridge created a bottleneck for the \n     North Vietnamese, allowing American bombers to blunt what \n     became known as the Easter offensive.\n       Captain Ripley was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions \n     at the bridge. He served two tours in Vietnam and remained on \n     active duty until 1992, eventually rising to colonel. Among \n     other decorations, he received the Silver Star, two Bronze \n     Stars and a Purple Heart.\n       John Walter Ripley was born on June 29, 1939, and grew up \n     in Radford, Va., the son of Bud and Verna Holt Ripley. He \n     enlisted in the Marines out of high school in 1956, and a \n     year later received approval from the secretary of the Navy \n     to attend a preparatory school leading to his appointment to \n     the Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1962.\n       Besides his son Stephen, Colonel Ripley is survived by his \n     wife of 44 years, the former Moline Blaylock; a sister, Susan \n     Goodykoontz; two other sons, Thomas and John; a daughter, \n     Mary Ripley; and eight grandchildren.\n       ``Colonel Ripley is well known in marine circles,'' Mr. \n     Schultz said, ``but he's the most revered war hero no one's \n     ever heard of.''\n       ``This was 1972,'' he added, ``and people didn't pay too \n     much attention to war heroes at that time.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10723-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10723-S10725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been a champion of the \nintellectual property rights enshrined in the Constitution, and have \nsponsored much of the significant legislation in that realm over the \ndecades I have served in the Senate. On October 24, 2008, Judge Richard \nLinn of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the court \nentrusted exclusively with Federal appeals involving patent issues, \ngave the keynote address before the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation's annual meeting. In that address, Judge Linn discusses the \nchallenges facing the intellectual property system in the coming years, \noffers advice on moving forward as a nation to meet those challenges, \nand provides food for thought for anyone interested in this important \npart of our national economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Judge Richard Linn from \nOctober 24, 2008, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Challenges Ahead\n\n       I would like to thank the AIPLA for the invitation to speak \n     before you today. I am truly honored to speak before the \n     AIPLA, an organization I have belonged to since the late \n     60's. I see in the audience many of my friends and former \n     colleagues of the patent bar. I feel very much at home here, \n     and it is nice to be asked to speak before this distinguished \n     group.\n       Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to personally \n     recognize someone who has played a unique role in the \n     progress of the U.S. patent system for over 40 years, someone \n     who has led this organization for the past decade and a half, \n     someone who has been a special friend to so many of us, and \n     someone who is now moving on to a well deserved retirement--\n     Mike Kirk. Please join me in a round of applause to show our \n     appreciation for Mike and all that he has done.\n       We all know that Mike has done some very special things for \n     the AIPLA. But the best thing he did was to bring his wife, \n     Mary Catherine, into our AIPLA family. I think she, too, \n     deserves to be recognized for all she has done.\n       One measure of a leader is the caliber of the person \n     selected to replace him. And here again, the AIPLA has risen \n     to the challenge of Mike Kirk's departure in selecting one of \n     the few members of our profession who has the character, \n     knowledge, and recognized leadership skills to honor Mike's \n     legacy of accomplishment. That person is, of course, Q. Todd \n     Dickenson, and I think he deserves a vote of confidence with \n     a round of applause.\n       The program lists my topic as ``Challenges Ahead.'' I \n     selected that topic intentionally to give me lots of latitude \n     in what I might say. If that phrase was a limitation in a \n     patent claim, the meaning would be hard to discern with \n     specificity and no doubt would generate considerable \n     litigation. In a way, it's the perfect topic. So, what is it \n     that I am going to talk about?\n       John Whealan yesterday focused on recent history and ended \n     with a few comments on the future. Instead, I will focus on \n     some of the challenges I see for the future and will begin \n     with a few comments on the changes of the recent past.\n       We hear a lot about change these days. Change in our \n     economy, global climate change, and of course, change in our \n     government. Change has been in the air for some time. It \n     seems like the only thing we have heard, or seen, or read in \n     the media for the past 20 months or so has been about change. \n     And intellectual property law has been no stranger to it in \n     the past few years. While one can debate the extent of the \n     changes and the reasons underlying them, there is no question \n     that the rights of patentees have been impacted in one way or \n     the other by a number of recent decisions. And while the pace \n     of change may slow down at least for a while, the fallout of \n     all of this change will directly impact all of us. This is \n     evident, for example, from an examination of three key \n     decisions: KSR v. Teleflex, dealing with the test for \n     obviousness; eBay v. MercExchange, dealing with the test for \n     injunctive relief; and In re Seagate, dealing with the \n     standard applicable to prove willful infringement. There have \n     been others, such as Medlmmune v. Genentech, which made it \n     easier to challenge patents in declaratory judgment \n     actions, and DSU v. JMS, requiring proof of specific \n     intent for induced infringement, but I will limit my \n     remarks to the holdings and possible implications of KSR, \n     eBay, and Seagate.\n       In KSR, the Supreme Court reviewed the test for obviousness \n     under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 103. The Supreme Court began by \n     emphasizing that its 1966 decision in Graham v. John Deere \n     informed the obviousness inquiry. It went on to reject what \n     it perceived to be a rigid approach taken by our court in \n     applying the teaching, suggestion and motivation test. The \n     Supreme Court observed that ``when it first established the \n     requirement of demonstrating a teaching, suggestion, or \n     motivation to combine known elements in order to show that \n     the combination is obvious, the Court of Customs and Patent \n     Appeals captured a helpful insight.'' It then noted, however, \n     that helpful insights need not become rigid and mandatory \n     formulas, and ``when a court transforms a general principle \n     into a rigid rule that limits the obviousness inquiry, as the \n     Court of Appeals did here, it errs.''\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\n       The Supreme Court summed up its position on obviousness in \n     observing that what is important is to use common sense and \n     to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of \n     ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the elements \n     in the way the claimed new invention does. It added that any \n     need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of \n     invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason \n     for combining the elements in the manner claimed.\n       The court also made some interesting observations on the \n     propriety of summary judgment on issues of obviousness. The \n     court said that ``where, as here, the content of the prior \n     art, the scope of the patent claim, and the level of ordinary \n     skill in the art are not in material dispute, and the \n     obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these \n     factors, summary judgment is appropriate.'' ``The obviousness \n     of the claim is apparent in light of these factors?'' What \n     does that mean? Does this mean obviousness is sort of like \n     obscenity--you know it when you see it? I'm not sure what it \n     means, but I am sure someone is going to ask me for an answer \n     to that question in a brief in the not too distant future.\n       The net result of KSR is that defendants may have a renewed \n     interest in raising and pressing obviousness contentions, \n     despite the high ``clear and convincing'' standard that \n     applies to validity challenges. They can now argue that \n     ``reasons'' and common sense support a conclusion that the \n     claimed invention doesn't pass muster even when application \n     of a teaching, suggestion, and motivation test might \n     otherwise have failed. It also means that patentees will have \n     to be more prepared to gather up evidence to show secondary \n     considerations as a way to overcome expected challenges from \n     accused infringers. Finally, the Supreme Court's comments \n     about summary judgment will mean that patentees will have to \n     start thinking about how to assist courts in answering \n     questions about what the Supreme Court's comments on summary \n     judgment meant as to the way obviousness issues should be \n     presented to juries, if at all. For example, is it still \n     proper for a district court to present the ultimate question \n     of obviousness to the jury or is the district court required \n     to decide obviousness as a matter of law in every case, \n     leaving only the factual underpinnings for the jury? No \n     matter how all this is sorted out, KSR makes evident that \n     patentees are likely to face more challenges based on section \n     103. We are already seeing this in recent cases filed with \n     our court.\n       In eBay, the Supreme Court rejected the categorical grant \n     of injunctive relief in patent cases and held that in those \n     cases, just as in other cases, a plaintiff seeking a \n     permanent injunction must demonstrate that it has suffered \n     irreparable injury; that remedies available at law are \n     inadequate; that the balance of hardships warrants injunctive \n     relief; and that the public interest would not be disserved \n     by a permanent injunction. What the Supreme Court did not \n     tell us is what happens after infringement is found and a \n     court determines that the equitable remedy of a permanent \n     injunction is not warranted. This is already presenting \n     patentees and the courts with interesting new challenges. \n     eBay also leaves open the question of whether there remains a \n     rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm in patent cases. \n     The bottom line for patentees is that they, like all other \n     plaintiffs, will have to tow the line and be prepared to make \n     a convincing showing on each of the four equitable factors. \n     This will present new challenges, particularly to non-\n     practicing patentees and alters some of the leverage \n     patentees assumed they enjoyed before the eBay decision.\n       In re Seagate presented our court with the opportunity to \n     pick up where Knorr-Bremse left off and to reconsider the \n     question of the duty of due care owed to patentees and the \n     standard for determining when infringement is willful and \n     subject to treble damages. The case came to us on a motion \n     for a writ of mandamus seeking to overturn an order from a \n     district court that would have given the patentee's counsel \n     virtually unfettered access to all attorney-client \n     communications and work-product of the accused infringer. \n     That order stemmed from the patentee's assertion of willful \n     infringement and the accused infringer's good faith reliance \n     on the advice of counsel. Because of the abuses we perceived \n     in the routine allegation of willful infringement and the \n     tension it produced between assertion by the accused \n     infringer of the attorney-client privilege and reliance on \n     the advice of counsel, we overruled the duty of due care \n     standard set out in Underwater Devices and held that proof of \n     willful infringement, permitting enhanced damages, requires \n     at least a showing of objective recklessness. Because we \n     abandoned the affirmative duty of due care, we also remarked \n     that in the context of willful infringement, there is no \n     affirmative obligation to obtain an opinion of counsel.\n       Following Seagate, it can be anticipated that there will be \n     continuing debate over application of the objectively \n     reckless standard and the parameters of willful infringement. \n     The one thing that is no longer in debate, however, is that \n     patentees can no longer bank on a determination of \n     willfulness and enhanced damages merely because infringement \n     was found against an accused who had prior notice of the \n     patent.\n       The net result of all of these decisions is that patentees \n     are likely to have to confront more obviousness challenges, \n     patentees are less likely to obtain enhanced damage awards \n     based on willfulness, and patentees will be more challenged \n     to obtain injunctive relief than just a few years ago. These \n     cases thus will cause patentees to reassess their strategies \n     and to revalue their patent portfolios.\n       But patentees are not only struggling to cope with recent \n     decisions of the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit. \n     Patentees continue to suffer needlessly from self-inflicted \n     wounds. These are the walking wounded, who regularly report \n     to the MASH units-the district courts-for help. And if they \n     don't get the help they need at the district court MASH unit, \n     they come to the general hospital-the Federal Circuit, to \n     cure all that ails them.\n       What self-inflicted wounds am I talking about? There are \n     two in particular that I want to highlight. The first relates \n     to the continuing propensity of patentees, particularly in \n     the electrical and mechanical arts, to disclose in their \n     applications only one embodiment of the invention, while \n     arguing that the claims cover something broader than the one \n     disclosed embodiment might suggest. I have no idea why so \n     many patentees continue to limit the number of embodiments \n     disclosed when, in so many cases we hear, the entire \n     controversy is about the scope of a claim supported only by \n     a single disclosed embodiment. Patentees who desire broad \n     coverage and only disclose a single embodiment are \n     shooting themselves in the foot.\n       Scientists and engineers are familiar with the concept that \n     an area cannot be defined by a single point or even two \n     points. To define an area requires at least three points. It \n     is surprising, then, that patent attorneys, who are trained \n     both in the law and in science or engineering, often forget \n     this three-point concept in drafting patent applications. \n     Careful prosecutors follow a general rule and include in \n     patent specifications not merely one embodiment of an \n     invention, but multiple embodiments to better illustrate the \n     full area of the discovery embraced by the claims. This is a \n     sound practice that helps to inform the public of the proper \n     scope of the claims and avoids uncertainty and interpretive \n     disputes. The uncertainty of single embodiment specifications \n     has brought us a steady stream of cases, and I urge all of \n     you not to shoot yourselves or your clients in the foot by \n     disclosing only one embodiment, particularly in mechanical \n     and electrical cases.\n       The second example of a self-inflicted wound is the \n     continuing practice of adding terminology to claims, \n     particularly after an interview, to place the claims in \n     condition for allowance without explaining the reason for the \n     change or pointing out where in the specification support for \n     the added language can be found. Again, in case after case \n     before our court, we are called upon to construe the scope of \n     claim language which appears nowhere else but in the claims. \n     Without any support in the written description, we are left \n     to infer meaning from parts of the specification that often \n     do not directly relate to the limitation in question or from \n     the prosecution history of events leading up to the \n     amendment. These are often poor guides for interpretation and \n     frequently lead to protracted and costly litigation, not to \n     mention unpredictable outcomes. Here again, the wound is \n     self-inflicted and patentees are well advised to avoid \n     shooting themselves in the foot by leaving the meaning of \n     critical limitations to unguided inference.\n       The message for those who regularly write and prosecute \n     patent applications for clients is that while the swinging of \n     the patent pendulum of court decisions is largely beyond any \n     patentee's ability to alter, there are things that are \n     entirely within your control, such as including multiple \n     embodiments in patent applications to make broad construction \n     of claim terms more likely and providing support or an \n     explanation for claim terms added during prosecution. Those \n     things you can control. And they will help your client avoid \n     going through life as a walking wounded patentee.\n       I would like to turn now to some challenges I see for the \n     PTO. With a new administration soon to occupy the White \n     House, a change in leadership at the PTO can be expected \n     within the next year. The new leaders at the PTO will face \n     many difficult challenges. The past leadership has much to be \n     proud of. Director Dudas successfully oversaw the completion \n     of a modern new facility and the end to fee diversion. He and \n     his colleagues have upgraded technology resources for \n     examiners, have ramped up hiring, and have instituted \n     comprehensive training programs, to name just a few of their \n     many accomplishments. All of that is commendable.\n       But it seems to me that what is needed now goes beyond \n     facilities or finances to the heart of the PTO's mission to \n     thoroughly, carefully, and promptly examine the applications \n     of those who seek the protection of patents and who rely on \n     the effective operation of our patent system. With the solid \n     foundation of the achievements of the current Director, the \n     PTO now needs the leadership of those with intimate knowledge \n     of patents and patent law. People who understand first-hand \n     the problems faced by users of the system and who have the \n     ability to comprehensively relate to the practicing bar. That \n     leadership is best found in the ranks of experienced \n     practitioners, many of whom are in this very room.\n       The next group of leaders at the PTO will need to be \n     creative in finding new ways to improve not only productivity \n     but quality as\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\n     well. The number of new applications that are projected over \n     the next several years is staggering. Technology will \n     continue to get more complicated. And the demands of managing \n     such a sizable organization will be rigorous. To keep pace \n     will take bold new measures to improve efficiency and \n     effectiveness of almost every aspect of PTO operations. That \n     may entail cooperative efforts with other patent offices \n     around the world to find ways to share search results. It may \n     entail establishing a program of deferred examination to give \n     applicants an opportunity to fully evaluate the need for \n     patent protection before the office is called upon to conduct \n     any examination. My point here is not to suggest specific \n     initiatives. It is not my place to tell the PTO how it should \n     operate. I only cite these as examples of the kinds of things \n     the new leadership of the PTO will need to seek out if it is \n     to avoid getting buried in the avalanche of new applications \n     looming on the horizon.\n       I know the PTO has engaged in a vigorous effort to hire and \n     train new examiners. I have been privileged to speak at a \n     graduation ceremony for an impressive class of new examiners \n     from the PTO's new patent academy. But that's only half of \n     the equation. It serves no real purpose to hire new examiners \n     if an equal number of examiners--especially experienced \n     examiners--resign. The PTO will need to go back to basics and \n     creatively apply a new version of the Three R's we all \n     learned as kids. The rule for how to treat examiners couldn't \n     be simpler: Respect, Reward, and Retain. In this regard, it \n     may be time for the PTO to develop new standards of examiner \n     performance that mirror the standards of attorney performance \n     used by law firms and corporate law departments. Just as \n     attorney performance is not measured by billable hours alone, \n     examiner performance measured principally by the number of \n     disposals may not be the best approach. Counting disposals \n     may be a raw indicator of performance but does not recognize \n     the judgment, thoroughness, and legal skills provided by \n     first-rate examiners and expected by the public.\n       Other patent offices around the world are involved not only \n     in giving birth to patents but in assessing questions of \n     validity raised over the life of a patent. That may explain \n     why examiners in many countries are treated differently than \n     U.S. examiners. It is not that U.S. examiners are less \n     competent or any less dedicated. Far from it. But if the \n     primary role of an examiner is limited to ex parte matters \n     that end on the day the patent issues, there will \n     understandably be a different interest on the part of the \n     public in what examiners do and who they are than if they \n     played an essential role in the determination of validity \n     challenges throughout the life of the patent. One way U.S. \n     examiners would have a greater opportunity to be recognized \n     in much the same way as their counterparts in other countries \n     is if the new leadership at the PTO decides to energize the \n     current reexamination system to make it the attractive \n     alternative to litigation it was originally intended to be. \n     This would require a much expanded corps of experienced \n     reexamination examiners and the implementation of streamlined \n     procedures to accelerate the processing of all reexamination \n     applications.\n       While it is evident that the PTO will face unprecedented \n     challenges in the years ahead, the leaders and examiners I \n     know are capable, dedicated, and clearly up to the task. I \n     have every confidence that the PTO will meet the challenges \n     ahead and will continue to be a model for the rest of the \n     world.\n       Many have said that this is the golden age of intellectual \n     property. In the years to come, we can expect to see \n     significant advances in energy technology, green technology, \n     nanotechnology, and a host of other things. The need for \n     effective protection for the discoveries of tomorrow's \n     scientists, engineers, and researchers will be greater than \n     ever before. And the changing legal landscape and the pace of \n     technological progress will present us all with new and \n     difficult challenges. The challenges ahead are many, but we \n     are all fortunate to have the chance to enjoy the \n     opportunities and to confront the challenges the golden age \n     of IP offers to each of us.\n       I have enjoyed being with you and thank you for your \n     attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10725-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10725-S10727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     VERMONT'S 12TH ANNUAL WOMEN'S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to share with my friends \nin the Senate a great story of personal triumph and success as told by \nVermont Supreme Court Associate Justice Marilyn Skoglund, the keynote \nspeaker for Vermont's 12th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity \nConference.\n  Marilyn forged her own remarkable path to success. She received her \nbachelor's degree in fine arts from Southern Illinois University, and \nafter moving to Vermont, passed the bar exam on her first try all while \nraising her 7-year-old daughter. Marilyn continued to rise through the \nranks of the Vermont Office of the Attorney General where she served as \nboth chief of the civil law division and chief of the public protection \ndivision before her appointment in 1994 to the district court, and \nsubsequently the Vermont Supreme Court in 1997. In addition to her \naccomplishments, Marcelle and I admired Marilyn's candidness as she \nwalked us through her journey. She offered more than 300 Vermont women \na very honest and inspirational perspective on the realities of \nbalancing both a career and a family.\n  Marcelle and I have hosted the Vermont Women's Economic Opportunity \nConference for 12 years, and we look forward to attending each year \nbecause we consider it one of the most important events in which we \ntake part. Though our economy may be facing difficult challenges, this \nyear's conference, and Marilyn's story, showed that adversity can be \novercome and met with great success--especially by motivated and \ntalented women of all ages.\n  Vermont's economic future depends on the countless talented women who \ndrive it. According to the Vermont Center for Women's Business Studies, \nwomen-owned firms generate an impressive $1.5 billion annually and \ncurrently employ more than 35,000 Vermonters. In 2006, approximately 39 \npercent of all Vermont businesses were owned, or partially owned, by \nwomen. Even though the number of Vermont women-owned businesses is on \nthe rise, we must continue working to encourage greater growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Justice Skoglund's \nspeech, written for Vermont's 12th annual Women's Economic Opportunity \nConference, detailing her journey to success, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Senator Leahy's 12th Women's Economic Opportunity Conference\n\n       I begin with a disclaimer. In Senator Leahy's letter, \n     asking me to be the keynote speaker, he wrote as follows: \n     ``We invite you to share your compelling personal experiences \n     of how you molded your successful career path to the Vermont \n     Supreme Court, all the while raising two daughters as a \n     single mother.''\n       I was of course so excited to learn that Senator Leahy knew \n     my name. And, that he thought I had done a good job of \n     balancing a career and a family. But, after skipping around \n     the kitchen a bit, I settled down. Sen. Leahy did not really \n     know what those compelling personal experiences were. Perhaps \n     he was lured into inviting me because a staff member had \n     heard rumors that my ``successful career path'' was pretty \n     funny. Someday I will be old enough to know better than to \n     discuss my past in public just because I was so flattered \n     someone of Sen. Leahy's stature asked, but, here I am. Ready \n     to reveal. I accept Sen. Leahy's invitation to share my \n     compelling, maybe, but more accurately, my ridiculous, \n     oddball, clueless, experiences of how I managed to crawl my \n     way into the best job on the planet, all the while dragging \n     two innocent, courageous daughters along in my wake. The \n     journey through the thicket of experiences was not always \n     pleasant, and mistakes were made. Truth is; I may have \n     nothing to offer to this audience. This is an economic \n     conference. I am not an economist. I am not a psychologist. \n     So, if you all just want to go get coffee and skip the gory \n     details, I will understand.\n       To begin, how does one grade ``success'' in balancing work \n     and family? I am a justice on the Vermont Supreme Court. I \n     have a good reputation as a jurist. I was a very good lawyer. \n     I have no arrest record. So far so good. I raised one \n     daughter, let's call her Martha, who is an ObGyn doctor \n     delivering babies in New Hampshire. She seems very content \n     and satisfied with her life. She just got married to a \n     wonderful man on August 30th. Most important indicia of \n     success: She loves me. I raised another daughter; I will call \n     her Ruby, who is working on a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. \n     She is currently very annoyed at how hard life is, but feels \n     good about her work. She loves me. This sounds great! By the \n     way, I have changed their names to protect their privacy. \n     They each bear their father's last names, as do I, so \n     hopefully, I have shielded them from any further \n     embarrassment from their mother, at least for today.\n       Because, while they may be well adjusted women, the truth \n     is, they adjusted to what their mother put them through. And, \n     if ``successfully balancing'' includes a solid marriage, I am \n     not your girl. Two creative, interesting, unique men, neither \n     ever bored me. I love them to this day, I danced with each at \n     Martha's wedding, but it did not work out.\n       In addition to my inadequacies standing up here before you, \n     I would also point out that everyone in this audience is \n     clearly way ahead of where I was when I wandered into \n     adulthood. Obviously, you are all women with a high degree of \n     confidence in yourselves and your ideas, ambitions, and \n     goals. You are at an economic conference, for heaven's sake. \n     You have given some thought to your life. At the beginning of \n     my meandering\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\n     road to the Supreme Court, I had little concept of who I was \n     and had not considered who I wanted to be.\n       To begin, my parents were the Swedish equivalent of Ozzie \n     and Harriet. I was raised in a nice middle class home in a \n     nice midwestern suburb. There literally was a white picket \n     fence around the yard. And, a little dog. My mother wore a \n     dress every day of her life, so she did her house work \n     looking like Donna Reed. By the time I came along, my father \n     was working in a steel plant and Mom had stopped being a hair \n     dresser to raise two kids. There were no drugs in my school. \n     My father's biggest complaint about me was that my bangs were \n     too long. It was an idyllic childhood. Just like on T.V. So I \n     assumed everyone pretty much lived like I did. Father made \n     enough so I could go to college. Back in those olden days, \n     in-state tuition at SIU was $97 a semester. And, I had part \n     time jobs to help pay my expenses. After four years, I got \n     married, continued going to school and working part time, \n     because it was cheap and it was fun. Finally, after seven \n     years in college, I decided to graduate, mainly because I was \n     pregnant and did not know how long it would be until I could \n     get back to going to classes. That should give you some idea \n     of how totally clueless I was about the changes a child \n     brings to a life.\n       The baby was great, but then things quickly stopped being \n     cheap and fun. There is something about the arrival of a \n     child, and one parent not working, that causes money \n     problems. My husband was working, but not getting paid much. \n     I was not working (day care didn't exist in southern \n     Illinois). And, there came a time when I had to apply for \n     food stamps. Three months of food stamps. We were two middle \n     class kids and we thought this was shameful, so of course, we \n     never told our folks and we couldn't ask them for money for \n     the same reason. But, of course, we weren't middle class kids \n     anymore--we were young parents with very little money, \n     renting a grimy little house with giant slugs in the \n     basement.\n       I'll cut this gruesome chapter short. In 1973 we moved to \n     Vermont, my husband got laid off and then, after eleven years \n     of marriage, he left. The reasons are not important. By now \n     my daughter was in first grade. and I was working a part-time \n     job for very little money. Those seven years in college? I \n     walked out with a degree in fine arts--sculpture. See, I \n     didn't go to college with an actual career in mind. I \n     expected to become my mom, making lunches, and ironing in my \n     pearls. My father always said, if a woman has to work outside \n     the home, it should be in one of the helping professions: \n     teaching or nursing. Things were not working out. What would \n     Donna Reed do? I pondered.\n       I decided to be a lawyer. Now, I do admit to having a \n     selective memory about some things. I do not remember my \n     first husband asking me to marry him and I have no \n     recollection of why I thought I could become a lawyer. Law \n     school wasn't an option--there was no money for tuition and \n     besides, I had to work.\n       I got a job working as a paralegal, law clerk at the \n     attorney general's office and participating in that marvelous \n     Vermont jewel, the four year reading clerkship. This path to \n     the bar required me to apprentice myself for four years to a \n     lawyer, and if I passed the bar exam, I was a real lawyer. I \n     began work in the AG's office at a salary of $7,000 a year, \n     which quickly went up to $12,000. Here's an interesting fact: \n     I had to borrow a dress for the job interview at the attorney \n     general's office. Now, at the time I knew I didn't have any \n     money, but I never thought I was poor. I was doing all right.\n       But if you ask my daughter, Martha, you'd get a different \n     picture. While I was working all day every day in Montpelier, \n     she was walking half a mile home from the school bus stop to \n     the adorable tiny three-room, un-insulated cottage in the \n     country with the only source of heat being a wood burning \n     furnace in the cellar. Walking home to a cold, empty house. \n     But, the good news was that I rented this cottage from Walter \n     Smith. I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute \n     to my very own personal version of welfare: Walter Smith. \n     Walter was a beloved dairy farmer in Plainfield, about 68 \n     years old when I met him, who was my landlord for eleven \n     years and my friend for twenty. He died several years back. I \n     loved him.\n       So, at the age of eight, Martha was expected to stoke the \n     furnace when she got home. Sometimes, Walter would come over \n     to help her. But most times he could not. And, you know, I \n     did not agonize over this. Donna Reed and June Cleaver would \n     be horrified, but I had to work. It was that simple. Walter, \n     who by then had become my surrogate father, had the hired \n     hands bring over truck loads of free split wood--an early \n     version of ``fuel assistance.'' I could dip raw milk from the \n     bulk tank for free. My very own WIC program. He'd give me \n     meat when he butchered a cow whose milking days were over. \n     Very, very chewy, but free. Free eggs if I fought the hens \n     for them, and maple syrup. He would give me bushels of \n     tomatoes and I would put them up and give him half. If my \n     cupboard was really bare, Martha and I could always wander \n     over to the farm house where Walter had cases and cases of \n     chicken noodle soup, which he ate every day with mayonnaise \n     sandwiches. He was my food shelf. Once, when Martha was about \n     ten, I sent her to school with a coconut and a hammer for \n     snack as I hadn't had time to grocery shop. Walter had given \n     me the coconut as a joke, asking me what kind of turkey I \n     thought had laid the brown hairy thing? The teacher sent a \n     note home thanking me for providing an interesting project \n     for the class. I thought that was nice.\n       See, I was not poor. I had Walter. And, there was a certain \n     satisfaction about supporting myself and my child.\n       But, I was also in love. Madly and passionately in love \n     with the law. The law is amazing. It is the infrastructure of \n     society. Sensible, mostly. Logical, usually. Enduring. It \n     adapts to changing mores and technologies, but only slightly \n     faster than the movement of the earth's tectonic plates. How \n     did the founding father's accept the constitution to deal \n     with the development of cyber-space and artificial \n     insemination? Heavy stuff. I love it. I had decided to go \n     into law thinking I liked writing, words, and arguing. I \n     hadn't expected to discover that it felt like ginger ale \n     poured over my brain. This is how I can describe the joy, \n     excitement, and the thrill of learning and understanding the \n     basis of the rules that manage our civilized life.\n       If you have a passion, if you find your passion, you are a \n     very lucky person. And, I had found my passion while Martha \n     was stoking the furnace.\n       But, here is an amazing fact: children have their own \n     memories, and their own perceptions about life. When she was \n     in high school, unbeknownst to me, Martha applied for a \n     Horatio Alger Scholarship, given to kids who have endured \n     hardship and managed to be successful students in spite of \n     it. And, she got one. When she told me about this wonderful \n     thing, I was so proud and delighted. Eventually it dawned on \n     me to ask in perfect ignorance: ``What was your hardship?''\n       ``You,'' she answered. She had written about those days \n     when she came home to an empty cold house and had to face the \n     cellar and the furnace alone and cold. I have never read her \n     winning essay. I am not that strong.\n       So, eventually, I connected again with an interesting, \n     creative, blah, blah, blah man and Ruby came along. At this \n     time I am a lawyer in the civil law division of the AG \n     office. Yes, I had passed the bar. Ruby started day care at \n     six months of age. And, having found what I was supposed to \n     be doing with my life, I wanted to keep working. Oh the \n     guilt. Her father was on the road most of the time, and 2\\1/\n     2\\ years after Ruby was born, that road did not pass by our \n     house any more.\n       One day, the call came from the day care that Ruby was sick \n     and I needed to pick her up. Naturally, I was scheduled to \n     prosecute a physician before the Board of Medical Practice \n     that day. I had prepared the case for months. Witnesses had \n     answered subpoenas to appear. No other attorney in the office \n     knew the case. What I knew was that just outside the hearing \n     room in the Secretary of State's office was a couch. So, I \n     went and got Ruby, swung by the house for a blanket and \n     pillow and a juice box, and put her to bed in the hall of the \n     Secretary of State's office.\n       I know that bundling up a sick little girl in a hallway \n     will not win me any parenting awards. But, helpful, \n     understanding people working at the office kept an eye on \n     Ruby while she slept. Ruby, too, adjusted to me.\n       But, being a mom with a profession that really requires \n     adherence to a schedule also had benefits. My first oral \n     argument before the Vermont Supreme Court was scheduled. I \n     was a nervous wreck. ``Got to get plenty of sleep the night \n     before so I'm sharp.''\n       Instead Martha got the flu and we spent most of the night \n     with me holding her hair while she drove the porcelain bus. \n     As soon as Walter was done milking, I trundled Martha over to \n     his house, told him I would be back in two hours, and went to \n     Montpelier to the hearing. Being worried about Martha put the \n     argument into a manageable perspective--I just did the job \n     then ran home to be a mom.\n       Eventually, after 17 years at the Attorney General's \n     office, I applied to be a trial judge. I made it past the \n     Judicial Nominating board and my name was sent to Governor \n     Dean for consideration. Then, I got worried. Martha was 21 by \n     then, but Ruby was only 8 and I knew I'd be away from home \n     for long hours every day. I was scared so I withdrew my name \n     from consideration. When I told my daughters what I had done, \n     the outcry was loud. Ruby was really insulted and said she'd \n     be fine. Martha said she would help out. They convinced me it \n     could work. I called back the Governor's office and said I \n     had changed my mind. When I had my interview with the \n     Governor, I explained how my concerns for my children had \n     caused me to chicken out. He understood and appointed me as a \n     judge.\n       And, it was hard. On me, and on Ruby. I got home late and \n     left early. I was at least an hour away if she got sick or \n     hurt. There was one year when I was family court judge in \n     Washington county--where we live. Ruby was in sixth grade \n     when a big eighth grade boy approached and asked, ``Is your \n     mom a judge?''\n       She admitted I was.\n       ``She sent me to juvenile hall,'' he said.\n       ``I'm sorry,'' said little Ruby nervously.\n       ``Oh, that's all right, I screwed up.'' He reassured her. \n     ``She's the one with black nail polish, right?''\n       Finding herself in the familiar territory of mortification \n     by her mother's behavior, Ruby admitted, ``Yeah, that's \n     her.''\n       I used to wear something odd on juvenile day to relax the \n     kids, and this boy noticed. Of course Ruby was pretty much \n     always embarrassed by me. Now I am on the Supreme Court, but \n     what did Ruby say when she heard about the appointment at the \n     age of twelve?\n       ``Oh no, now you'll be home all the time!''\n       What did I learn that I can offer to you? I tried to think \n     of an inspirational saying or\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\n     two, but could not. I do get a lot of catalogs. One \n     particularly annoying one is chock full of heart warming \n     sayings like, ``Life isn't about waiting for the storm to \n     pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.'' Oh please. \n     Storms are scary, rain is cold and wet, and one can get \n     muddy. Let's get real. Life is hard, get over it.\n       Number 1: Take help that is offered. Would I have survived \n     without Walter Smith's care and kindness? I do not know. And \n     I am glad I did not have to find out.\n       Number 2: If you do not have a snack, send a coconut. In \n     other words, be flexible. When it came time to study for the \n     bar examination, I was on my own. I made little 3x5 filing \n     cards on all the subjects and set them around the house so \n     that whatever I was doing, I could incorporate a little \n     study. Some areas of law are governed by certain factors that \n     you just have to remember. Over the kitchen sink I placed the \n     filing card that listed the elements of a secured \n     transaction. Next to the toilet I posted the card that laid \n     out the parts of a bulk sale. I read them over and over and \n     over. And, poor Martha endured one pizza after another \n     because I did not cook much while I studied.\n       Number 3: Pity parties are a waste of time, and a breeding \n     ground for excuses. In other words, if your circumstances are \n     not the most conducive to success, try anyway.\n       Would I have liked to go to law school? Of course. Could I? \n     No. So what! Here's my favorite true example of making due \n     with what you have available. I watch the Canadian television \n     coverage of the summer Olympic games because it is so much \n     better than that of the U.S. coverage. They celebrate \n     individual athletes' ``personal bests'' rather than the medal \n     counts. And, they covered really weird events that I had \n     never heard of, like dory racing. I thought it was very cool. \n     They did a background piece on Jerad Connaghten, an athlete \n     training for the 200 meters in track and field. He was from \n     somewhere in Canada that had no running track. So he and his \n     coach improvised. To train for strength they did sand starts \n     taking off in deep sand on the sea shore. They set up their \n     own practice course. At the end of a dirt road was a little \n     cottage and that cottage marked 200 meters. The little \n     mulberry tree was 50 meters out and the larger mulberry tree \n     was the 150 meters mark. Competing against the world's best, \n     Jerad made it through the preliminary heats to the finals of \n     the 200 meter event. I was so impressed. Work with what \n     you've got. Excuses weigh you down.\n       Number 4: Do not insult your children by thinking life is \n     too hard for them. In other words, children are resilient. \n     What might appear to have been my heartless expectation of \n     little Martha's abilities to care for herself at a very young \n     age may have been influenced by my maternal grandmother, \n     Olga. All four of my grandparents were born in Sweden. Olga \n     was the daughter of a farm family the Dahlbergs--with too \n     many children to feed. First the Dahlbergs sent their oldest \n     daughter Margaret over to live with relatives in Chicago, the \n     Larsons. Margaret died within months of her arrival of \n     diphtheria. Then the Dahlbergs put there next daughter, my \n     grandma Olga, on the boat all alone at the age of 12 and sent \n     her to live with the Dahlbergs. Throughout my life, whenever \n     I thought life was too hard and I was scared, I thought of my \n     grandma traveling alone across the ocean to the family where \n     her older sister had died. How did she do that? What were her \n     nightmares? My grandmother was sweet, and kind, and patient, \n     and loving. Her early years did no apparent damage. I know I \n     could have done better by Martha. I wish I could have done \n     better by Martha. I did the best I could and that is my only \n     consolation.\n       Number 5: Play dough is far more important than doing the \n     dishes. Get your priorities straight. I was blessed with a \n     job I loved, and then had the added joy of coming home, \n     forgetting about the law, and playing with my daughters. Next \n     confession: My housekeeping would not win any awards either. \n     Sometimes the food in the refrigerator grew little sweaters. \n     What housecleaning I did happened when the children were in \n     bed. And, they had clean clothes and decent food and, most \n     importantly, they knew their mom loved playing with them. \n     Legos, play dough, Barbies, puzzles. Whatever activity that \n     allowed the analytical part of my mind to go into sleep cycle \n     was welcomed by me. So, don't get so busy making a living \n     that you forget to make colorful messes and memories.\n       Number 6: Never, ever coast. After a few years at the \n     Attorney General's office, the AG asked me to become chief of \n     the civil division. I was one of two women in the division \n     and all the men had more years of experience than I as \n     lawyers. Here's a John Wayne quote: ``Courage is being scared \n     to death but saddling up anyway.'' Well, I moseyed on into \n     the AG's office and said, ``Yes, I would be pleased to be \n     chief of the division. But, I would like a bigger badge.''\n       To maintain respect and to get the members of the division \n     to be their best, I had to set an example. I worked as hard \n     or harder than anyone else. I gave them no reason to complain \n     about the AG's choice. So if you're running your own business \n     or supervising employees, it is more important to the bottom \n     line the quality of work to set a positive example than to \n     offer token prizes to the employee of the month who actually \n     manages to get to work on time five days in a row. I expected \n     the attorneys to be terrific and so they were.\n       To conclude, what do I know? My children have forgiven me \n     for most of my blunders, they are fiercely independent, and \n     can think on their own. I'm proud of my work and even more \n     proud of my daughters. And, I am grateful for the chances I \n     have been given and the courage to take them. My main message \n     to you is: Work hard. Then work harder. And then, work harder \n     still.\n       But, I will leave you with another of those pithy homey \n     sayings from the annoying catalog, and one that makes no \n     sense to me at all.\n       ``May the light always find you on a dreary day. When you \n     need to be home may you find a way. May you always have \n     courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your \n     underpants.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10727-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10727-S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENTREPRENEURIAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF HARDWICK, VT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an emerging rural \neconomic model that some say serves as the perfect example of how rural \nAmerica can survive and thrive in today's global markets.\n  My good friend Marian Burros recently wrote an article in the New \nYork Times highlighting the sustainable agricultural economy of \nHardwick, VT, and Hardwick's surrounding communities. These Northeast \nKingdom communities have begun attracting the attention of local, \nregional and national media after the area began attracting some unique \ncharacters with great ideas. From a community-owned restaurant to \nrenowned cheese makers, Hardwick and its surrounding towns are at the \ncenter of an experiment in social agricultural entrepreneurship.\n  I ask unanuimous consent that the text of Marian Burros October 8, \n2008, New York Times article entitled ``Uniting Around Food to Save an \nAiling Town'' be printed in the Record to allow my colleagues an \nopportunity to hear about the future of Vermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Uniting Around Food To Save an Ailing Town\n\n       Hardwick, VT--This town's granite companies shut down years \n     ago and even the rowdy bars and porno theater that once \n     inspired the nickname ``Little Chicago'' have gone.\n       Facing a Main Street dotted with vacant stores, residents \n     of this hardscrabble community of 3,000 are reaching into its \n     past to secure its future, betting on farming to make \n     Hardwick the town that was saved by food.\n       With the fervor of Internet pioneers, young artisans and \n     agricultural entrepreneurs are expanding aggressively, \n     reaching out to investors and working together to create a \n     collective strength never before seen in this seedbed of \n     Yankee individualism.\n       Rob Lewis, the town manager, said these enterprises have \n     added 75 to 100 jobs to the area in the past few years.\n       Rian Fried, an owner of Clean Yield Asset Management in \n     nearby Greensboro, which has invested with local agricultural \n     entrepreneurs, said he's never seen such cooperative effort.\n       ``Across the country a lot of people are doing it \n     individually but it's rare when you see the kind of \n     collective they are pursuing,'' said Mr. Fried, whose firm \n     considers social and environmental issues when investing. \n     ``The bottom line is they are providing jobs and making it \n     possible for others to have their own business.''\n       In January, Andrew Meyer's company, Vermont Soy, was \n     selling tofu from locally grown beans to five customers; \n     today he has 350. Jasper Hill Farm has built a $3.2-million \n     aging cave to finish not only its own cheeses but also those \n     from other cheesemakers.\n       Pete Johnson, owner of Pete's Greens, is working with 30 \n     local farmers to market their goods in an evolving community \n     supported agriculture program.\n       ``We have something unique here: a strong sense of \n     community, connections to the working landscape and a great \n     work ethic,'' said Mr. Meyer, who was instrumental in moving \n     many of these efforts forward.\n       He helped start the Center for an Agricultural Economy, a \n     nonprofit operation that is planning an industrial park for \n     agricultural businesses.\n       Next year the Vermont Food Venture Center, where producers \n     can rent kitchen space and get business advice for adding \n     value to raw ingredients, is moving to Hardwick from Fairfax, \n     40 miles west, because, Mr. Meyer said, ``it sees the benefit \n     of being part of the healthy food system.'' He expects it to \n     assist 15 to 20 entrepreneurs next year.\n       ``All of us have realized that by working together we will \n     be more successful as businesses,'' said Tom Stearns, owner \n     of High Mowing Organic Seeds. ``At the same time we will \n     advance our mission to help rebuild the food system, conserve \n     farmland and make it economically viable to farm in a \n     sustainable way.''\n       Cooperation takes many forms. Vermont Soy stores and cleans \n     its beans at High Mowing, which also lends tractors to High \n     Fields, a local compositing company. Byproducts of High \n     Mowing's operation--pumpkins and squash that have been \n     smashed to extract seeds--are now being purchased by Pete's\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n     Greens and turned into soup. Along with 40,000 pounds of \n     squash and pumpkin, Pete's bought 2,000 pounds of High \n     Mowing's cucumbers this year and turned them into pickles.\n       For the past two years, many of these farmers and \n     businessmen have met informally once a month to share \n     experiences for business planning and marketing or pass on \n     information about, say, a graphic designer who did good work \n     on promotional materials or government officials who've been \n     particularly helpful. They promote one another's products at \n     trade fairs and buy equipment at auctions that they know \n     their colleagues need.\n       More important, they share capital. They've lent each other \n     about $300,000 in short-term loans. When investors visited \n     Mr. Stearns over the summer, he took them on a tour of his \n     neighbors' farms and businesses.\n       To expand these enterprises further, the Center for an \n     Agricultural Economy recently bought a 15-acre property to \n     start a center for agricultural education. There will also be \n     a year-round farmers' market (from what began about 20 years \n     ago as one farmer selling from the trunk of his car on Main \n     Street) and a community garden, which started with one plot \n     and now has 22, with a greenhouse and a paid gardening \n     specialist.\n       Last month the center signed an agreement with the \n     University of Vermont for faculty and students to work with \n     farmers and food producers on marketing, research, even \n     transportation problems. Already, Mr. Meyer has licensed a \n     university patent to make his Vermont Natural Coatings, an \n     environmentally friendly wood finish, from whey, a byproduct \n     of cheesemaking.\n       These entrepreneurs, mostly well educated children of baby \n     boomers who have added business acumen to the idealism of the \n     area's long established hippies and homesteaders, are in the \n     right place at the right time. The growing local-food \n     movement, with its concerns about energy usage, food safety \n     and support for neighbors, was already strong in Vermont, a \n     state that the National Organic Farmers' Association said had \n     more certified organic acreage per capita than any other.\n       Mr. Meyer grew up on a dairy farm in Hardwick and worked in \n     Washington as an agricultural aide to former Senator Jim \n     Jeffords of Vermont. ``From my time in Washington,'' Mr. \n     Meyer said, ``I recognize that if Vermont is going to have a \n     future in agriculture we need to look at what works in \n     Vermont, and that is not commodity agriculture.''\n       The brothers Mateo and Andy Kehler have found something \n     that works quite well at their Jasper Hill Farm in nearby \n     Greensboro. At first they aged their award-winning cheeses in \n     a basement. Then they began aging for other cheesemakers. \n     Earlier this month they opened their new caves, with space \n     for 2 million pounds of cheese, which they buy young from \n     other producers.\n       The Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese at the University \n     of Vermont is helping producers develop safety and quality \n     programs, with costs split by Jasper Hill and the producers. \n     ``Suddenly being a cheesemaker in Vermont becomes viable,'' \n     Mateo Kehler said.\n       Pete Johnson began a garden when he was a boy on his \n     family's land. Now his company, Pete's Greens, grows organic \n     crops on 50 acres in Craftsbury, about 10 miles north of \n     here. He has four moveable greenhouses, extending the growing \n     season to nine months, and he has installed a commercial \n     kitchen that can make everything from frozen prepared foods \n     and soup stocks to baked goods and sausages. In addition he \n     has enlarged the concept of the C.S.A. by including 30 \n     farmers and food producers rather than just a single farm.\n       ``We have 200 C.S.A. participants so we've become a fairly \n     substantial customer of some of these businesses,'' he said. \n     ``The local beef supplier got an order for $700 this week; \n     that's pretty significant around here. We've encouraged the \n     apple producer who makes apple pies to use local flour, local \n     butter, local eggs, maple sugar as well as the apples so now \n     we have a locavore apple pie.''\n       ``Twelve years ago the market for local food was \n     lukewarm,'' Mr. Johnson added. ``Now this state is primed for \n     anything that is local. It's a way to preserve our villages \n     and rebuild them.''\n       Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Stearns of High Mowing Organic Seeds \n     in Wolcott, who is president of the Center, knew he wanted to \n     get into agriculture when he was a boy. His company, which \n     grew from his hobby of collecting seeds, began in 2000 with a \n     two-page catalog that generated $36,000 in sales. Today he \n     has a million-dollar business, selling seeds all over the \n     United States.\n       Woody Tasch, chairman of Investors Circle, a nonprofit \n     network of investors and foundations dedicated to \n     sustainability, said: ``What the Hardwick guys are doing is \n     the first wave of what could be a major social \n     transformation, the swinging back of the pendulum from \n     industrialization and globalization.''\n       Mr. Tasch is having a meeting in nearby Grafton next month \n     with investors, entrepreneurs, nonprofit groups, \n     philanthropists and officials to discuss investing in Vermont \n     agriculture.\n       Here in Hardwick, Claire's restaurant, sort of a clubhouse \n     for farmers, began with investments from its neighbors. It is \n     a Community Supported Restaurant. Fifty investors who put in \n     $1,000 each will have the money repaid through discounted \n     meals at the restaurant over four years.\n       ``Local ingredients, open to the world,'' is the motto on \n     restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows. ``There's Charlie who \n     made the bread tonight,'' Kristina Michelsen, one of four \n     partners, said in a running commentary one night, identifying \n     farmers and producers at various tables. ``That's Pete from \n     Pete's Greens. You're eating his tomatoes.''\n       Rosy as it all seems, some worry that as businesses grow \n     larger the owners will be tempted to sell out to companies \n     that would not have Hardwick's best interests at heart.\n       But the participants have reason to be optimistic: Mr. \n     Stearns said that within one week six businesses wanted to \n     meet with him to talk about moving to the Hardwick area.\n       ``Things that seemed totally impossible not so long ago are \n     now going to happen,'' said Mr. Kehler. ``In the next few \n     years a new wave of businesses will come in behind us. So \n     many things are possible with collaboration.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10728-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10728-S10729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER CHERNIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to no one in my support of the \nfreedoms set out in the first amendment to the Constitution, and I have \ndevoted considerable time and energy to their protection and \npreservation. On October 21, 2008, I enjoyed a very special evening \nhonoring Peter Chernin, the CEO of Fox News, and a man who shares my \nbelief in the need to vigorously defend the first amendment. That \nnight, I congratulated Peter on receiving the Media Institute's First \nAmendment Award, an award that he richly deserved for his stand against \nrigid and unyielding application of so-called indecency rules at the \nFederal Communications Commission. I believe that his words in defense \nof the first amendment should be heard and heeded by all Americans, not \njust by those who were fortunate enough to attend that event.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Peter Chernin from \nOctober 21, 2008, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Politics, Indecency, and the First Amendment\n\n       Thank you so much for that introduction, Senator Leahy. \n     Your strong and unambiguous support for the First Amendment \n     is legendary on Capitol Hill, and I could not be more pleased \n     to have you, a former recipient of this award, as my \n     presenter tonight. And thank you to the Media Institute for \n     bestowing this honor on me. As the head of a media company, I \n     am at times painfully aware of how important the First \n     Amendment is to our ability to create thought-provoking and \n     controversial content. And as a citizen of this country, I am \n     thankful every day for the freedoms that we too often take \n     for granted: the freedom to speak freely, the freedom to \n     pursue our religious beliefs without persecution, and the \n     freedom of the press to criticize our government.\n       We live in a pluralistic society. One where diversity \n     rules, where disagreement is a constant, and where there is \n     more than one right answer for every question. It's messy. \n     And for creators of content, if we're doing our jobs right, \n     we sometimes offend people. It's that simple. And, believe \n     me, we wrestle with that fact. We struggle with complex \n     issues every day. Are we guilty of contributing to the \n     vulgarization of our society or simply of mirroring it? Is it \n     our responsibility to be the arbiters of good taste, or is it \n     our duty to push boundaries? Is it even possible to create \n     innovative programming for a mass audience that is diverse on \n     every level--from age, to religious affiliation, to \n     ethnicity?\n       We don't take these issues lightly. We are constantly \n     thinking about the important role we play in shaping our \n     culture. Whether we're creating television shows, making \n     films, or working at a newspaper or publishing house. \n     Certainly, we must entertain, we must inform and we must \n     provoke. But, at the same time, we must take very seriously \n     the power we have to affect millions through our work. That's \n     why we stress the importance of individual editorial \n     responsibility across all of our businesses. But, yes, \n     sometimes we do make mistakes. Everyone does. The \n     alternative? Well, it's chilling. If the media is ruled by \n     fear of crossing an ambiguous line, our product will be less \n     vital and more homogenous. Our ability to create news and \n     entertainment that is thoughtful, provocative, and accurately \n     reflects our society will be compromised. And Americans will \n     have far fewer choices. That's why it's so critical that we \n     don't chip away at the First Amendment until it becomes \n     toothless. It must remain absolute in its protections.\n       Two weeks from today the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing \n     arguments in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, the first \n     indecency case it has heard since the ``7 Dirty Words'' case \n     was decided in 1978. At issue is whether Fox violated the \n     indecency law when it aired two live award programs in which \n     actresses blurted out one or two so-called ``fleeting \n     expletives.'' While a case with Cher and Nicole Richie at its \n     center is probably not one we would have chosen to argue \n     before the Supreme Court, the truth is, we don't get to\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\n     pick our cases. In fact, if anyone had told me that my \n     company would be before the U.S. Supreme Court defending \n     inane comments by Cher and Nicole Ritchie, I would have \n     said you're crazy. But I would contend that the nature of \n     this speech, and who said it, makes absolutely no \n     difference. Because at the core of this case is an \n     absolute threat to the First Amendment. It hinges on \n     utterances that were unscripted on live television. If we \n     are found in violation, just think about the radical \n     ramifications for live programming--from news, to \n     politics, to sports. In fact, to every live broadcast \n     television event. The effect would be appalling.\n       There is a certain symmetry to the fact that the oral \n     argument in this case and the election of the 44th President \n     of the United States are taking place on the same day: The \n     Fox case, if successful, is an affirmation of the First \n     Amendment. The election is an affirmation of our democratic \n     process. And the two are inextricably intertwined. The First \n     Amendment is central to our democratic process because it \n     ensures a full and open dialogue about the candidates for \n     office. Without the First Amendment, our democracy could not \n     be sustained.\n       But the truth is, people don't think about defending \n     broadcasters' right to utter expletives in the same way they \n     think about defending one's right to speak critically of our \n     government. But they should. The First Amendment is at stake \n     in both cases. As a media company, we have not just a right \n     but a responsibility to stand up to the government when it \n     crosses that First Amendment line in the sand--even if the \n     content we are defending is in bad taste. And in the \n     indecency context, that line has not only been crossed, it \n     has been obliterated. That is why Fox is fighting the FCC in \n     this and several other indecency cases.\n       I'll admit: some of the content we are defending is not \n     particularly tasteful: the expletives, the brief nudity, the \n     carefully placed whipped cream and, of course, the pixels. I \n     would not have allowed my own children, when they were \n     younger, to watch some of these shows. But, I vow to fight to \n     the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial, \n     offensive, and even tasteless content on the air.\n       Why? Because, if the government gets its foot in the \n     censorship door with respect to unpopular entertainment \n     content, it is the beginning of the steep slide toward \n     censoring unpopular political content. And we have seen the \n     beginnings of this downward slide in a recent case where the \n     FCC initially found indecent content in a news program. If we \n     allow our government to intrude into the creative process to \n     censor the ``bad words'' at issue in the Fox case, I am \n     afraid we will soon reach the bottom of the slide--to \n     America's detriment.\n       Groups that claim to be interested in ``protecting \n     children'' are helping the government along in its attempts \n     to censor television. While I don't agree with these groups, \n     I do fully support their right to criticize what's on \n     television. But the job of protecting children is far too \n     important to leave to government bureaucrats or so-called \n     public interest groups. The job of protecting children lies \n     with parents. The job of the government is to resist the \n     views of interest groups with particular agendas and instead \n     to enforce the law in a way that is consistent, fair, and \n     constitutional. So I don't blame these groups for the \n     degradation of the First Amendment. I blame our government, \n     which has succumbed to the views of a particularly vocal \n     minority.\n       Look, I am not insensitive to the fact that young children \n     need to be protected. And that's difficult in an era of \n     single parent, or two working parent households. But the \n     protection of children must be considered in a Twenty-First \n     Century light. Nearly every TV set sold today includes a V-\n     Chip, which allows parents to block content they think may be \n     inappropriate for their children. Cable, satellite, and telco \n     video providers have finely-tuned, comprehensive parental \n     controls. And let's not forget the most powerful technology \n     available to parents: the on-off switch. These tools allow \n     adults to protect their kids while still being able to access \n     shows they love.\n       We as media companies also have a responsibility: to rate \n     shows accurately and consistently so the V-Chip works as it \n     should. And, as I said earlier, we need to be responsible \n     with our creative output. This is something we do on a daily \n     basis through our Standards and Practices departments, not \n     only by exercising editorial judgment but by constantly fine-\n     tuning and improving our internal controls.\n       Let's step back for a minute and get some perspective on \n     this issue. The indecency law applies only to broadcast TV: \n     that's a handful of channels. Over 85 percent of the country \n     receives their broadcast channels through a cable, telco \n     line, or satellite signal. Sitting right next to the \n     broadcast channels on these multichannel systems are hundreds \n     of other channels that are not subject to the indecency law.\n       And those other channels are just a click away on the \n     remote control. Nor does the indecency law apply to video-on-\n     demand, pay per view, DVDs, or the mother of all content \n     providers: the Internet. Does it really make sense to \n     continue government censorship of the occasional bad word, \n     brief nudity, or sexual innuendo on a handful of broadcast \n     channels when we live in an environment of infinitely \n     unregulated choices? In the media-rich world we live in, \n     singling out a few channels for indecency enforcement is not \n     legally sustainable.\n       Quite simply, it is time for the government to get out of \n     the business of regulating ``indecent'' speech on broadcast \n     TV. The threat it poses to core First Amendment values cannot \n     be justified in our technologically diverse world. Parents \n     have the tools to decide what is appropriate for their \n     children. Let's let parents do their job and fire the \n     government from the job of censoring speech. The First \n     Amendment is too important to our democratic society--in this \n     and future elections--to allow any encroachments to threaten \n     our country's critical freedoms.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10729-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10729-S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We are glad to hear that at least one of our politicians is \n     concerned about how the gasoline prices are affecting the \n     middle class. Most of us feel that our government is \n     extremely out of touch with the majority of the country.\n       We are retired on a fixed income and we worked hard all our \n     lives and saved to get a motor home for vacations, but \n     unfortunately we now cannot use it because of the price of \n     gasoline and it just sits there. We try to go out shopping \n     for groceries and any other necessities just once a week, \n     making a list of items and stores, color coding so we do not \n     forget anything. The cost of energy also has increased the \n     price of groceries tremendously, so basic foods and produce \n     are the norm--doing away with any treats. We have never seen \n     the price of gasoline increase day by day and a nickel to a \n     dime at a time.\n       We desperately need to have alternate sources of energy, \n     such as coal, windmills, solar and nuclear. We should have \n     been building new refineries and recovering oil off all of \n     our coasts since the 1970s when this same problem came up at \n     that time, but, to our shame, we did not.\n       Automobiles should get a lot more than the 35 mpg that we \n     have heard mentioned for future vehicles. It should be at the \n     very least 60 mpg, and there is no reason in this world with \n     our technology that this could not be a reality. Something \n     should be done to increase the mileage on all of the vehicles \n     that are already on the road. This is never mentioned. We \n     cannot just go out and buy a hybrid or other fuel efficient \n     vehicle at the drop of a hat to help the situation. We drive \n     our 2002 Honda 4 cylinder between 55 and 60 mph on the \n     highway to increase our fuel efficiency and you should see \n     the bad looks we get. Highway mileage should be lowered to 55 \n     mph like in the 70s to help conserve.\n       We do hope that our government does something quickly to \n     improve this situation and that it is not handled like it was \n     in the 70s--all talk and no action. We need to be dependent \n     on no one but ourselves for our energy needs. No one is going \n     to take care of the USA and its citizens but the USA itself.\n       We need some action now--Please.\n     Robert and Roberta, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity to respond to your e-letter \n     regarding energy costs and gasoline prices. I agree that we \n     in the US are far too dependent on petroleum for energy. But \n     I think it is a selfish and short-sighted view to defeat the \n     climate change legislation. Our focus should be, as you \n     mentioned, on using less petroleum, not searching for \n     petroleum everywhere we can, no matter the ecological cost. \n     It is true; we do not have good mass transit in Idaho and \n     especially in the more densely populated Treasure Valley. I \n     think tax dollars would be well spent to improve the mass \n     transit situation in the Valley.\n       We need to give tax incentives to clean, renewable energy \n     sources and rescind the tax breaks given to the huge oil \n     companies who have been reaping record profits at the expense \n     of all Americans. The answer is in conservation which \n     includes improved mass transit and in alternative \n     transportation where there would be improved avenues for \n     bicycling and walking.\n       It is true. I will not be driving as far for vacation this \n     year, though I would like to explore areas in Idaho I have \n     not yet seen. It\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\n     now becomes an expensive venture just to get to the Sawtooths \n     or White Clouds.\n     Tim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am contacting my Congressman about energy just as you \n     have encouraged your constituents to do. I am in dismay, \n     however, at the continued opportunism and political \n     grandstanding. That is, the only answer I see from many is to \n     drill more oil. Every credible energy scientist and economist \n     knows that this will do little or nothing to curb our foreign \n     oil imports and zero to reduce the cost of fuel. Yet, despite \n     this ever-predictable call for more domestic oil production, \n     you flatly concede that ``speculation [is] now driving up the \n     cost of oil.'' So I ask: why are you and your colleagues \n     still calling for more drilling when you know what it is you \n     can do now to reduce fuel costs? Why are you not regulating \n     ``the speculation now driving up the cost of oil''? \n     Commodities speculators are at the heart of extreme oil \n     prices, not supply and demand imbalances. We do not want to \n     hear any red herring arguments about the average Joe's \n     retirement portfolio owning the bulk of oil company shares. \n     The issue is speculation; the answer is regulation of \n     speculation.\n     Jason, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       Last week I heard on the news that you have received many \n     letters and e-mails related to high gas prices. Hence, I have \n     decided to write in and give you my two cents on the matter.\n       I believe that the primary culprit that is causing high gas \n     prices is globalization; particularly in the emerging \n     economies of China and India. The rapid growth of their \n     economies has drastically increased their demand for \n     petroleum.\n       Along with developing a comprehensive energy policy, the \n     executive and legislative branches of our federal government \n     need to re-examine our economic policies, particularly in \n     areas of foreign trade. During the past two decades, the \n     American middle class has gotten the short end of the straw \n     when it has come to previous trade policies. One does not \n     have to look farther than our orchard industry in the \n     Treasure Valley. These trade policies have really only \n     benefitted the very wealthy in our country. When I was in \n     college ten years ago, we talked about globalization in one \n     of my classes and how if China copied the U.S.'s consumption \n     then we would be paying a premium for gas. This is now \n     reality.\n       In conclusion, too often our government fails to look long-\n     term. It is time for a change. We need to do in-depth \n     independent analysis on our trade policies to determine what \n     the long term effect will be on the average American. \n     Government policies need to benefit society as a whole rather \n     than a few. Our society is too self-centered on the ``me'' \n     rather than on the collective ``community''. We also need to \n     have a comprehensive energy policy. This policy needs to be \n     long term and address conservation, efficiency, alternative \n     and renewable sources of energy, and possibly take into \n     consideration additional domestic production of oil with \n     stringent environmental safeguards and firm consequences for \n     those companies that fail to comply with those safeguards.\n     Brent Danielson, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a single father of two sons, 3 years and 13 months \n     old. I am a truck driver. I make decent money and have good \n     benefits. But these fuel prices have gone too far for our \n     society! I am lucky I work at a place where I can get a free \n     bag of potatoes every once in a while because I cannot go \n     grocery shopping because it is all too expensive! Wages have \n     not changed a bit. I am sick of it and I am losing almost all \n     of my faith in our government and the people representing the \n     common people like me. One of my best friends who was an \n     owner-operator had to quit because diesel got too high for \n     him to profit much at all. Now it is been three weeks and \n     they just got their phone shut off two days ago and their \n     power shut off today. My stimulus money has gone to my power \n     bill, gas bill, rent etc. Sure you do not like to fill up \n     your gas tank but does it cripple you financially like it \n     does many, many people?! I think not. I have always stuck up \n     for our local and federal government on many issues and \n     criticized them on other issues, but this time I as well as \n     many people are fed up. Seriously this time, I am to the \n     point now where I am struggling to make ends meet. I have \n     spent over $60 in the last three days in gas just to get to \n     work and back--that is it! And I am close to empty again and \n     I have to get diapers for my son before I go to work \n     tomorrow. The diaper money is coming out of the power bill \n     money I had put back. You need to sound off and be heard. At \n     least make it known to us that you are voicing our concerns!\n     Cameron, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are retired, he is military retired and we \n     recently purchased a small travel trailer since he can no \n     longer ride his motorcycle and our maiden voyage with it cost \n     $300 in gas to go 200 miles round trip! Between gas and food \n     prices, we cannot afford to go anywhere, much less eat out. \n     We have changed our daily living dramatically, and it is not \n     a happy way to be in your retirement years.\n       We urge you and all of Congress to start drilling in our \n     nation and bring back more nuclear power plants. We must \n     relieve ourselves of dependence on foreign oil ASAP. Lord \n     only knows what our grandchildren have to look forward to at \n     this insane rate!\n     Angelo, Hayden Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       I will get right to the point--my wife and I are out of \n     money. Our incomes have not changed and our incomes used to \n     pay our bills with money to spare. We have a 91 Honda wagon \n     and a 99 minivan, we pay $50 and $70 to fill them up. Grocery \n     prices are up 100% in the last couple years because gas \n     prices are killing the trucking industry. Expensive gas has \n     made almost everything else expensive. Today, after filling \n     both our cars with gas and grocery shopping, (with a list, \n     mind you), we ran out of money. For the first time ever, we \n     put groceries on a credit card. We are not credit card \n     people, so this is anathema to us.\n       When I turn on the TV or radio I hear some politician \n     telling us that drilling will not make a difference for ten \n     years. As an engineering student, I cannot stomach that level \n     of [deception]. First of all, I do not believe that is true \n     and second, if it were true, then we sure better get started. \n     What if every time an education bill were introduced, we \n     responded by saying that we would not see the results for 12 \n     years so let us not do it. What if I told my child not to go \n     to college because they would not see a payoff for at least \n     four years so do not bother. We are financially dying and our \n     so-called leaders are regurgitating some of the stupidest \n     things I have ever heard.\n       The bottom line is this: This planet does not exist for its \n     own sake, it exists for ours. We are not here by some cosmic \n     accident; we are here by design and our designer gave us the \n     tools we need to live and prosper. The failure to drill for \n     new oil and create new refineries is the result of \n     environmental philosophies, which are based on evolutionary \n     thinking. To the environmentalist, our purpose here is no \n     more significant than that of any other animal, and we, by \n     accident of evolution, happen to have the power to sustain or \n     destroy this environment. Without a cosmic caretaker, the \n     earth itself becomes our only god and the environmentalist \n     shows his worship by reducing or eliminating human impact \n     upon it and by treating humans as vermin. It is an old \n     religion and I am tired of suffering at the hands of it is \n     misguided priests.\n       Please do your best to release energy, specifically nuclear \n     and oil, to the free market system. Irrational environmental \n     policy and regulation have prohibited natural market forces \n     from creating more supply and oil-pricing based on \n     speculation has prevented the market from determining price. \n     Imagine going to Wal-Mart to buy a t-shirt and finding that \n     they now cost $100; and when you ask the owner why this was \n     so, he replies that speculators determined that cotton crops \n     would fail next year, so in preparation they have raised \n     prices early. As you know, this is not how prices are \n     determined. The cotton producer charges as much as he can \n     based on his costs and competitors prices and Wal-Mart \n     charges a markup. If cotton crops indeed fail next year, then \n     the buyer pays more for the rare product and they pass the \n     increase to the consumer. When oil speculators set price, we \n     pay increases at the pumps whether those speculations came \n     true or not. There is no real connection to supply. Please \n     work to make this kind of price setting illegal and please \n     work to release drilling and refinement. The further we \n     remove a commodity from the free market grid by socialist \n     controls and uneducated environmental policy the more the \n     people, you claim to represent, are hurt. Make the American \n     dream possible by making it affordable.\n     Jason, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The rising cost of fuel has a tremendous effect on my \n     household consisting of my husband and myself. I am sole \n     support for our family. Senator, as you know, wages in Idaho \n     fall behind many other states. The cost of gas is outrageous \n     and I blame the Congress for a lot of it. Why are we not \n     drilling in Alaska? Why are we not building refineries away \n     from coasts where hurricanes have a tendency to hit? Why are \n     not all of our refineries running full bore?\n       There was a Democratic senator from the South who retired, \n     I forget his name but he wrote a book, ``A Grand Party No \n     More''. Before he retired, he went to see for himself where \n     we would drill in Alaska. He said there would be no harm to \n     anyone or anything, it is so far out in no man's land. He \n     said if there was a leak it would be of no consequence as it \n     would freeze the minute it hit the ground. It is time we push \n     the environmentalists to the wall and out of the way. I \n     believe in saving trees and wildlife, but there is no danger \n     to any of these where we would drill. I recognize that we \n     need to become independent of so much oil but how do we do \n     that. I drive a `95 Forerunner and it is paid for. Not the \n     best gas mileage but it is paid for. I cannot afford any kind \n     of a car payment for one of those new hybrids. Rebates are \n     nothing, $2,000 in exchange for $26,000? The cost of a new \n     car buys an awful lot of gas. My income does not allow for \n     any car payment.\n       Everything is going crazy! A loaf of bread that cost $2.89 \n     last year is now $4.29. Anything with corn or wheat is gone \n     out of sight. We pay farmers not to grow wheat and now I hear \n     we have to import it? How sad for America. America has sold \n     its soul to China, Mexico, Japan. If we were ever to go into \n     another world war, we could not even build what we would need \n     to fight it. Is there a steel mill left in America? Is there \n     a textile mill left in America? You would be pretty\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n     hard pressed to find one, a sad statement on us.\n       As to what I do? No trips during the week except to work \n     and back. If I can do any errand on the way, great, \n     otherwise, it waits till the weekend. I plan one trip, one \n     circle. If something is missed, too bad, it is missed. The \n     real clincher is this, I tithe to my church, I give the Lord \n     10% of my gross income. It costs me almost as much, $10 less, \n     to keep my car in gasoline between paychecks. Now I think it \n     is pretty awful when I have to give the gas company as much \n     as I give the Lord. He gives me everything I have, the gas \n     company gives me nothing except anger when I hear of the \n     profits they make. And I think that pretty well sums it up, \n     10% to the Lord vs. almost as much to the gas company!\n     Dianne, Hayden Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a taxi driver here in Boise. In a year's time, the \n     cost to fill my tank has increased nearly 100% but my average \n     fare has remained static. If it were not for my military \n     retirement, I would no longer make enough to cover basic \n     costs and make a profit.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Wayne Riddle, who is retiring at the end of this year from the \nCongressional Research Service. Wayne is the model of a dedicated and \ntalented public servant. He has spent his career working out of the \npublic eye for the greater good, providing excellent assistance to all \nof us in Congress for over three decades, and also taking time to \nmentor younger staffers.\n  Wayne is a graduate of the University of Virginia. He earned a \nmaster's degree in economics from George Washington University while \nworking at the Congressional Research Service, where he has spent the \npast 36 years serving as a key analyst on elementary and secondary \neducation, and twice as head of the Education and Labor Section at CRS.\n  Throughout that time, Congress has given high priority to \nstrengthening the Nation's schools, and Wayne has been helping us \nimmensely every step of the way. He began not long after the passage of \nthe original Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--the \nFederal Government's major program to improve educational opportunities \nfor low-income students. Wayne has been indispensable in our work on \nevery subsequent reauthorization of the act and on all our other \nefforts on elementary and secondary education, including the Goals 2000 \nAct during the Clinton administration and the No Child Left Behind Act \nduring the current Bush administration. His guidance, support and \nknowledge on issues big and small have been invaluable to us time and \nagain.\n  As Wayne retires to devote more time to his family, I know that his \ncolleagues at CRS will miss him, and so will we. I wish him a long, \nhealthy, and happy retirement. He certainly deserves it, because he has \nserved our country well, and made a very real difference in the lives \nof countless children who have benefited in their education because of \nhis expertise and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10731-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING TONY DEAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of \na very close friend of mine, Tony Dean. As one of this Nation's \nforemost conservationists, one would be hard put to find someone who \ncared more about wildlife and the environment. Tony passed away on \nOctober 19.\n  I had known Tony for years with his radio and television \nbroadcasting, but I was fortunate enough to get to know him much better \nin my 2002 Senate campaign. He told me that he was willing to do \nwhatever I needed him to do, and he was honest to his word. With his \nnatural and effective connection to television viewers, Tony starred in \ntwo commercials that were critical to the success of my 2002 campaign. \nI have no doubt that Tony's support was crucial, though it resulted in \nmany tests to his courage. Even amidst the backlash of his supporting \nmy campaign, he said, ``Tim, I know I did the right thing, and I'd do \nit again in a second.'' Tony stared down the people who threatened him, \nand he refused to blink.\n  During Senator Ted Kennedy's eulogy of his brother Robert, Senator \nKennedy stated that, ``Few are willing to brave the disapproval of \ntheir fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their \nsociety. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or \ngreat intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for \nthose who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to \nchange.'' Tony had all those qualities, though most importantly, moral \ncourage. And Tony Dean had moral courage in spades.\n  It was my pleasure to have worked with Tony and I would like to offer \nmy condolences to his family, friends, and fellow advocates. They have \nmuch to be proud of, and it is my hope that their memories will be rich \nwith the great many accomplishments he achieved during his career. \nThose of us who loved him pray that what he was to us and what he \nwished for others will someday come to pass for the world. We will miss \nyou, Tony. More than any of us can say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10731-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10731-S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FORT POLK BARRACKS PRIVATIZATION PILOT PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on September 27, the Senate passed the \nDuncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, \nwhich the President signed into law on October 14. The legislation \nincludes critical provisions that will directly improve the quality of \nlife for our men and women in uniform, support needed reforms in the \noperations of the Department of Defense and provide our soldiers, \nsailors, Air Force personnel and marines with the tools they need to \ndefend our freedom. I thank and commend Senator Levin and our \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee for the thorough work on \nthis detailed legislation and their perseverance in crafting the \nlegislation in a difficult and at times uncertain process.\n  There were a number of filed floor amendments to the bill that were \nnot\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\nable to be considered because of the procedural situation on the floor \nin September. The managers of the bill, Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner, stated that they had prepared a set of over 90 cleared \namendments in a managers' package for which they believed they had \nunanimous consent to include in the bill. It is my understanding that \none of those amendments was the provision I had filed to expand the \nexisting pilot authority in section 2881a of title 10, to authorize the \nArmy to carry out a pilot program using the private sector for the \nacquisition or construction of military unaccompanied housing for all \nranks in an arrangement similar to what we have carried successfully \nwith the privatization of family housing and senior unaccompanied \nsoldiers. While I was very disappointed that the amendment could not be \nadopted because of the procedural situation, I want to thank Senator \nLevin and the other members of the committee for their willingness to \nsupport inclusion of the public-private sector partnership approach for \nensuring improved housing for all ranks of our single soldiers.\n  The Army already has five similar privatization projects underway for \nsenior unaccompanied enlisted personnel or officers. The business case \nfor these projects shows that they are not only less costly than \ntraditional government-funded construction and sustainment, but more \nimportantly, the living conditions are vastly improved as soldiers have \naccess to larger, modern apartments on post. The living conditions for \nthese soldiers and officers will be enhanced to the same level as that \nof military members with families.\n  Given our Nation's current financial crisis, defense spending is \nlikely to come under great stress over the next few years. Historically \nthe Army and the other services have had great challenges in \nmaintaining even minimum levels of housing sustainment and \nrevitalization funding to keep our barracks fit for our soldiers. I can \nspeak from personal experience about the serious deficiencies in the \nbarracks at Fort Polk in Leesville. Despite the recent increase in Army \nfunding for barracks revitalization there, I worry that needed long-\nterm funding will be difficult to secure under the traditional model to \nprevent deterioration in the longer run. Improved quality of life, \nincluding housing, is critical to the retention of our enlisted \nsoldiers, and critical to keeping our All Volunteer force strong. \nPartnerships between the Army and the private sector for this segment \nof our military housing will be needed as a fundamental long-term \nsolution to providing the best housing for our soldiers.\n  Despite the procedural setback in September, I appreciate the support \nwe received for our amendment and am committed to continue working with \nthe Armed Services Committee to advance this issue in 2009. We are also \nhopeful that the Army will use its existing authorities to begin \nextending the successful privatization model to construction and \nrevitalization of Barracks for all of our soldiers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10732-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. XIAOMING TIAN\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \noutstanding achievements of Dr. Xiaoming Tian. For many years, Dr. Tian \nhas been recognized as a leading practitioner of Chinese medicine, \nacupuncture and alternative medicine in the United States. I am very \npleased that Dr. Tian's recognition was extended worldwide when he \nreceived the prestigious World Federation of Chinese Medicine \nSocieties, WFCMS, world award for distinguished physician earlier this \nyear.\n  This award is the highest honor the WFCMS can bestow, and it is only \npresented to a handful of physicians each year. This year, only 10 \nclinical physicians worldwide were honored and Dr. Tian received the \ndistinction of the only recipient in the United States.\n  The World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies was founded in \n2003 and is headquartered in Beijing. Currently, the federation is \nchaired by Dr. She Jing, Vice-Minister of Health and Director of the \nState Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's \nRepublic of China. The WFCMS includes 174 Chinese medical associations \nfrom 55 countries and is the highest global organization of Chinese \nmedicine.\n  In honoring Dr. Tian, the WFCMS reports, ``Dr. Xiaoming Tian's great \ncontributions include many different areas such as clinical medicine, \nresearch, new Chinese herbal medicine development, education and health \ncare policy. Dr. Tian is highly respected by medical professionals and \npatients in the United States.''\n  As the WFCMS noted, in May of 1991 Dr. Tian established the first \nChinese acupuncture clinic at the National Institute of Health, NIH, \nClinical Center. This clinic represented the first time that the NIH \nhad formally recognized acupuncture as a routine treatment and had \ndeveloped a procedure code for it. Dr. Tian became the first clinical \nconsultant on acupuncture within NIH's medical staff.\n  In addition to his work at NIH, Dr. Tian has taken part in a variety \nof different research endeavors including an intramural study on the \nefforts of using acupuncture to treat cancer patients from 1992-1993 \nand an appointment by President Clinton as one of 20 members of the \nWhite House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy \nset up to report on policy changes that would ensure the potential \nbenefits of complementary and alternative medicine from 2000-2002.\n  More recently, as a co-investigator, Dr. Tian participated in a \nGeorgetown University Medical Center study of using acupuncture to \ntreat fibromyalgia. The study, conducted under the auspices of an NIH \ngrant, was a pioneer study in rheumatism research. Dr. Tian has also \nserved as an adjunct professor in the Department of Internal Medicine \nand Rheumatology at Georgetown University Medical School. He has been \nthe Director of the Wildwood Acupuncture Center and Academy of \nAcupuncture and Clinical Medicine since 1986 and, with Professor \nShangaing Chen, Dr. Tian established an osteoporosis and osteoarthritis \nresearch center at Beijing Medical University in China. Finally, in \n2006, Dr. Tian was appointed to a four-year term on the Cancer \nComplementary and Alternative Medicine Editorial Board of the National \nCancer Institute's Physician Data Query, PDQ, system, the comprehensive \ncancer database.\n  It is fitting that we pay tribute to the achievements of Dr. Xioming \nTian, who has done so much to help patients with his groundbreaking \nresearch and treatment in the emerging field of complementary and \nalternative medicine. I congratulate Dr. Tian on his distinguished \naward and ask that he continue his fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10732-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10732-S10733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES TEGNELIA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nDr. James Tegnelia who will be retiring from his position as the \nDirector of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, in February 2009 \nand returning to New Mexico.\n  The DTRA is charged with safeguarding the United States and its \nallies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, WMD, and \nconsists of a 2,000 member team. Dr. Tegnelia has been the Director of \nthis prestigious Agency since February of 2005 and has been an integral \npart of its many accomplishments.\n  Prior to his appointment as the Director of the DTRA, Dr. Tegnelia \nwas the vice president, Department of Defense Programs, at Sandia \nNational Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, starting in 1998. He has been \ninvolved in defense-related fields since 1971 and has a long and \ndistinguished career in championing innovative causes. From increasing \nthe DTRA's efforts in science and technology investment in nuclear \ndetection, nuclear forensics and advanced energetic capabilities, to \nworking on the global stage in the international effort to counter \nWMD--in part through the establishment of regional and global \nnonproliferation partnerships--Dr. Tegnelia has been a true leader in \nprotecting our great Nation.\n  In addition to his leadership in securing our country and its allies \nfrom the threat of WMD, Dr. Tegnelia has worked to strengthen the \ncapabilities of the DTRA, transforming the Agency into a combat \nsupport-focused, technically agile and operationally relevant \norganization.\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\n  Dr. Tegnelia has been a great asset to the DTRA and to the protection \nof our Nation.

Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year is well underway. As you know, Iowa public \nschools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' \ntest scores are among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute several \ndedicated public servants at the Iowa Department of Education, and to \nreport on their successful involvement in a unique Federal partnership \nto repair and modernize school facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the Iowa Department of Education, which selects worthy \nschool districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and \nrepair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to \nbuilding new schools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, \nthis Federal funding is used to leverage public and/or private local \nfunding, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local \nschool district.\n  The Federal funding has made a real difference for the 304 Iowa \nschool districts that have received Harkin grants over the past decade. \nThe grants have helped school districts from Waukon to Glenwood and \nfrom Keokuk to Rock Rapids build new schools, add new classrooms, \nrenovate facilities and bring buildings up to fire codes.\n  The progress we have witnessed is due, in large part, to the hard \nwork and leadership of the Iowa Department of Education. When this \nprogram began, the department did not have experience in administering \na grant program of this kind, but key personnel stepped up to plate to \ncreate and implement the successful program we have today.\n  In the last 10 years, department staff have received, reviewed, \nprocessed and scored 1,370 grant applications which resulted in 820 \ngrant awards and completion of 773 projects. The department processed \nthousands of payment requests for project costs, conducted more than \n300 site visits to monitor the program and provided the professional \nadministration that taxpayers deserve.\n  I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance of the Iowa \nDepartment of Education for their excellent work. In particular, I \nwould like to recognize C. Milton Wilson, Leland Tack, Ann McCarthy and \nTed Stilwill for their leadership in helping create the program in \n1998. They provided a strong foundation that was built on by their \nhighly capable successors--Gary Schwartz, Janice Evans, Jeff Berger, \nJim Addy and Judy Jeffrey.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the individuals who \nhave served on the School Budget Review Committee--Cynthia Eisenhauer, \nMichael Tramontina, Charlie Krogmeier, Clark Yeager, Wayne Drexler, \nMarilyn Perkins, Connie Cook, Su McCurdy, Don Hansen, and Jane \nBabcock--for their skilled oversight of the program and to the Iowa \nState Board of Education for their leadership and support.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultra modern shopping malls and \ngleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in \nrundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message \nto our young people about our priorities. We have to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals at the Iowa \nDepartment of Education. There is no question that a quality public \neducation for every child is a top priority in our state. I salute them \nand wish them well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10733-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE WASHINGTON PAVILION OF ARTS AND SCIENCE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

His extraordinary career spanned the entire \nspectrum of government service, from the local level to the Federal \nlevel.\n  Dr. Wagoner began his career in service by teaching history and \npolitical science at a public high school in Clarkston, MI. He went on \nto earn his master's degree in urban planning and his doctorate in \npublic administration.\n  For 18 productive years, he served as assistant city manager in \nBerkley, MI, a large suburb of Detroit, and for the past 16 years has \nbeen director of planning and community development for Livingston \nCounty, the fastest growing county in Michigan. Dr. Wagoner has written \nseveral books on urban planning and emergency response, and has served \nfor decades as an instructor for the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.\n  President Kennedy asked a generation of Americans to give of \nthemselves for our country and for its future. Dr. Wagoner answered \nPresident Kennedy's call and has inspired countless others, who have \nworked with him or who have been his students, to do the same. I \ncongratulate Dr. Wagoner for his remarkable public service, and I wish \nhim a long and healthy and happy retirement.

REED\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to honor and recognize over 25 years of service by Stanley \nE. Reed to our great State of Arkansas. A third-generation cotton \nfarmer from Marianna, AR, Stanley has served the Arkansas agriculture \ncommunity with steady leadership for over 20 years as a member of the \nArkansas Farm Bureau Federation board, including the last five as \npresident. At the upcoming Farm Bureau State Convention on December 4, \nStanley will hand over the gavel as president, and I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to recognize his many contributions to our State.\n  Born in Marianna in 1951, Stanley attended the University of Arkansas \nwhere he graduated in 1973 with a degree in Agricultural Engineering \nand was awarded Highest Honors. Although Stanley was a tremendous \nstudent, he also displayed his leadership skills\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\nearly on, serving as President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, \nPresident of the Inter Fraternity Council, and President of the \nCardinal XX Honorary Society. Upon graduation, Stanley attended the \nUniversity of Arkansas School of Law were he received his Juris \nDoctorate in 1976 and was also awarded Highest Honors. Upon taking the \nArkansas Bar Exam that year, Stanley scored the highest grade in the \nState.\n  Although licensed as an attorney, Stanley returned to the family \nfarm, producing cotton in Lee and St. Francis Counties. He soon became \nactive within the agricultural community and served as president of the \nLee County Farm Bureau from 1982-1984. Soon after, he joined the board \nof directors of the Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation in 1988, later \nserving as secretary-treasurer for 6 years, vice president for 4 years, \nand, as I mentioned before, president for the past 6 years. He has also \nserved on the American Farm Bureau Board of Directors since 2004.\n  His involvement in the Arkansas agriculture community has led him on \ntrade missions to Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, South \nKorea, and Peru. In addition, I had the good fortune to be joined by \nStanley and other Arkansas farmers on a trade mission to Cuba in 2000 \nto discuss the opening of the Cuban market to Arkansas goods.\n  What makes Stanley so unique, though, is that his service to Arkansas \nextends beyond the agriculture world. Education has always been a \npriority for him. He served for 4 years on the Lee Academy School \nBoard, where his children attended, and he just recently completed a \n10-year term on the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, where he \nserved as chairman for 2 years. He is a member of the Arkansas Academy \nfor Agriculture Engineers and has been honored as Distinguished Alumni \nof the College of Engineering. Additionally, he has served on the board \nof directors for Baptist Health and as a board member of Simmons First \nNational Bank.\n  Faith is an important part of Stanley's life. A member of the First \nBaptist Church in Marianna, Stanley has served as a Deacon in the \nchurch and taught youth and adult Sunday School classes for over 20 \nyears. More importantly, he has been involved in prison ministries \nlocally and oversaw the fundraising and construction of the prison \nchapel at an Arkansas Department of Corrections facility.\n  And last but certainly not least, Stanley's family--his wife Charlene \nand three children, Haley Davis, Nathan, and Anna--has been a \ntremendous source of pride and inspiration for him. In fact, Nathan is \ncarrying on the family farming tradition and works with Stanley on the \nfarm. Stanley is also the proud grandfather to Anna Kate, Jack, and \nHaven Davis.\n  As you can see, Stanley Reed is Arkansas through and through. So as \nhe steps down as president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, I want to thank \nhim for all that he has done for Arkansas and in particularly, the \nArkansas agriculture community. Stanley, although you are ending your \ntenure, I know you will not be far away. I look forward to working with \nyou and know you will continue to make your impact felt in your \ncommunity and in the State you love so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10734-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. CHARLES E. LEA\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the \nlife of a truly outstanding Missourian. On October 7, 2008, this nation \nlost a son, a soldier, and a community servant when Dr. Charles E. Lea \nof Lexington, MO, passed away. While we mourn his passing, we are \nextraordinarily grateful for all that he gave to his community, his \nState, and his country during his lifetime.\n  I believe that Dr. Lea is a wonderful example and reminder of the \nbrave men and women who have served our country in the past and \ncontinue to serve it today in this time of great need.\n  In 1957, Dr. Lea graduated from the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, and after putting himself through medical school at the \nUniversity of Missouri, volunteered for service in Vietnam. Widely \nregarded and recognized as a humble servant, Dr. Lea was awarded the \nBronze Star, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier's Medal, four Air Medals, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, the Combat \nMedical Badge, and the Parachutist Badge for his service.\n  While awards and commendations obviously show a great deal about a \nperson, I am a believer that the strength of a person's character is \nrevealed in his or her daily actions. Those who knew Dr. Lea best \nshared an anecdote with me regarding his time in Vietnam. Dr. Lea was \nfeatured in newspapers and on television here at home for his efforts \nduring the war to save a village elephant that had been shot. Seemingly \ninsignificant at the time, those efforts placed the United States, and \nour servicemen and women, in high regard in the eyes of the Vietnamese \nvillage. This small effort, not part of his duty or orders, but \nundertaken by a man trying to make a difference, had an extensive \nimpact.\n  Following his military service, Dr. Lea became a general practice \nfamily physician and served countless families in Oklahoma and Missouri \nthroughout his medical career.\n  As I reflect on Dr. Lea's life today, I am reminded not only of the \nvalue of his personal service and sacrifice, but of the committed \nservice and selfless sacrifice of all the men and women who have served \nthis country in uniform. America owes a large debt to all of the \nremarkable men and women who have served this great nation. I would \nlike to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Lea and his family, and in \nremembrance of his life and his service, my utmost gratitude goes to \nall those who have served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10734-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. RONALD DAVIS\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I honor a truly great man \nand a good friend, Dr. Ronald Davis, who died on November 6, 2008 at \nhis home near East Lansing, MI.\n  Dr. Davis was an outstanding physician, a great leader, and an \neffective, impassioned advocate for the uninsured. As President of the \nAmerican Medical Association, Ron helped focus our attention on making \nsure health care was available and affordable for all Americans.\n  We worked together earlier this year on the Farm Bill--an unusual \nissue for physicians to get involved in--but Ron and I were committed \nto making sure our Federal farm policy promoted health and nutrition. \nWith his help, we passed a truly groundbreaking farm bill that \nincreased the Federal commitment to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n  Last February, Ron was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. This cancer, \nwhich affects over 37,000 Americans each year, is unfortunately one of \nthe hardest to treat. But Ron didn't see it that way. He told his \nfellow doctors, ``Never take away someone's hope,'' and he lived by \nthose words.\n  Even while undergoing painful and difficult cancer treatments, Ron \nwas on the front lines, educating the public about support Web sites \nfor cancer patients that allow families to stay informed while building \na support network for the patient.\n  A champion for preventative medicine and public health, Dr. Davis was \na leading advocate for healthier lifestyles. He traveled the country \nurging Americans to quit smoking, exercise more, and eat better.\n  He also led the effort for the historic apology by the AMA to \nAfrican-American doctors for the organization's past exclusion of Black \nphysicians. He believed that ``by confronting the past we can embrace \nthe future,'' and pushed to increase enrollments by minorities in \nmedical schools and health professions.\n  I want to express my deepest sympathies to his wife Nadine and his \nthree sons, Jared, Evan, and Connor. America has lost a great doctor, \nand his family has lost a great man. Ron's extraordinary record of \ncommunity service, dedication, and courage should serve as an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10734-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10734-4", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10734-S10735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nand a treaty which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10735-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 1238(b)(3) of the Floyd D.

Mr. President, the purpose of introducing this bill today \nis to start the process of granting the Burns-Paiute Tribe of Eastern \nOregon land in trust. This is an opportunity to allow this tribe to \nbecome self-sufficient by producing a viable gaming operation. The \nproject would be designed to have a minimal component tied to gaming \nwith a much larger share of the development related to entertainment \nand tourism. One of the goals would be to develop activities and bring \nin components that enhance the overall Treasure Valley and southwest \nIdaho economic environment. The goal is to create new reasons for \npeople to travel to the region and to work with local businesses to \ngenerate ongoing supply and support ongoing business opportunities. \nThis legislation, should it be implemented, will create new jobs and \nprovide an economic boost for eastern Oregon and western Idaho.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 18. A bill to improve the authority of the Special Inspector \nGeneral charged with overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with the size and complexity of the \nTreasury Department's efforts to administer the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, TARP, which is unprecedented in recent U.S. history, it is \nessential to have a Special Inspector General, IG, who is focused \nexclusively on conducting effective oversight. When Congress passed the \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act, I was proud to join Senator \nBaucus, as well as 31 of my other colleagues, to insist that the \nlegislation direct the Treasury Secretary to appoint a Special IG as \nsoon as possible. Notably, we tasked the Special IG with ensuring \nprogram transparency by collecting data on the Treasury's actions and \nreporting regularly to Congress. One might say that the Special IG is \nthe cop on the beat dedicated to protecting taxpayers' interests.\n  Many would argue that the Treasury's current authority is almost \ncompletely unrestrained. There is a saying about what absolute power \ndoes to people and organizations, namely that absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely. We must not allow unrestrained power to corrupt the \nTreasury Department's authority or mission. It is essential that proper \noversight exists so that the Treasury Department is held accountable \nfor how it expends taxpayer dollars.\n  A strong IG is even more critical now that the Treasury Department is \ndirectly injecting capital into banks, as well as potentially aiding \nother entities that provide consumer credit. The oversight requirements \noriginally designed by Congress to scrutinize the purchase of toxic \nassets do not accurately or adequately describe the Treasury's equity \ninvestments and, therefore, do not provide the strong taxpayer \nprotections Congress requires.\n  With the Treasury Department changing the plan day-by-day, there is \ngrowing market uncertainty about how best to address the economic \ncrisis. The Treasury needs to inspire confidence. It must not follow \nWall Street's example and play fast and loose on the public's dime. The \nbottom line is we must ensure the government respects the public's \nmoney more than Wall Street ever did. That will be the Special \nInspector General's job. It is imperative then that the Special IG be \nadequately equipped with authority and resources to carry out this \nmission.\n  On Monday, the Finance Committee held a hearing to consider the \nnomination of Neil Barofsky to be the Special IG for TARP. Mr. Barofsky \nhas had a distinguished career as a Federal prosecutor investigating \nwhite-collar crimes, but regardless of how impressive his resume might \nbe, he cannot succeed at his job if his hands are tied with inadequate \nauthority and resources. At this hearing, I noted a number of concerns \nthat I have with the authority, or lack thereof, given to the Special \nIG, and for this reason, I rise today, to offer legislation, the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program Inspector General Improvement Act, that \nwill give the Special IG the teeth that he needs to provide the \noversight that taxpayers deserve with their precious tax dollars at \nstake.\n  Time is of the essence with the Treasury already having committed \n$290 billion without the Special IG's oversight. We cannot afford any \nfurther delay in the office of the Special IG becoming operational. \nAccordingly, because the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) \ndid not specify the timing the Treasury Department must observe to \ntransfer $50 million to the Special IG to set up his office, my \nlegislation would direct the Treasury Secretary to provide the TARP IG \nwith $50 million within three days after he is confirmed by the Senate. \nIn addition, because the TARP IG must hire personnel to get up and \nrunning, my bill includes a proposal to waive applicable civil service \nrules that could delay that process. I am concerned that without this \nchange, it may be summer before the TARP IG's office is sufficiently \nstaffed to discharge its responsibilities.\n\n  Notably, EESA requires the TARP to address deficiencies that the \nComptroller General identifies, or to certify to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress that no action is necessary, but it places no \nsimilar requirement on the TARP regarding audit findings by the Special \nIG. My bill would place the same requirements on the TARP to address \nrecommendations by the Special IG as are required by the findings of \nthe Comptroller General.\n  Additionally, now that the Treasury Department has changed course and \ndecided to inject capital directly into financial institutions rather \nthan purchase toxic and illiquid assets as originally contemplated, \nCongress must be sure that the Special IG has the authority to fully \ninvestigate any other type of transaction undertaken by TARP. Although \nmany contend that the underlying statute provides the Special IG with \nthe ability to investigate equity injections, with Treasury Secretary \nPaulson hinting that TARP may be expanded to benefit credit card, \nstudent loan, and car loan companies, and with the possibility that the \nincoming administration might enlarge the program further still in ways \nthat we are not fully able to anticipate, it is imperative that the \nSpecial IG have the ability to conduct oversight over whatever way \nfunds are ultimately expended. My legislation mandates that the Special \nIG can go wherever necessary to protect taxpayers.\n  Last but not least, as there is tremendous concern in many quarters \nthat financial institutions will use the $250 billion in equity \ninjections they have been allocated pursuant to TARP to either purchase \ntheir weaker competitors or simply pay dividends to shareholders, I \nbelieve it is absolutely critical that the public understand exactly \nhow these funds are being committed. Although I hope the funds will be \nused to promote lending, which is so critical to restoring economic \ngrowth and job creation, we must be sure that such lending occurs. \nAccordingly, my bill would require the TARP IG to prepare by July 1, \n2009, an analysis for Congress of what exactly banks did with the $250 \nbillion they have received.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss not to acknowledge similar \nlegislation introduced yesterday by my colleagues Senators McCaskill, \nGrassley, Collins, and Lieberman. Although their legislation would \nspeed the hiring process to allow the TARP IG to quickly begin \noperations, as well as allow the IG to investigate any initiative \ncreated as part of the program, it would not make some of the other \nchanges I believe are absolutely vital. All that said, I hope that we \ncan work together on a consensus, bipartisan package that can \nexpeditiously clear the Senate.\n  Mr. Prsident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 18\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the implementation 'or enforcement of \ncertain regulations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as this session comes rapidly to a \nclose, my colleague Senator Murray and I are introducing critical \nlegislation to suspend the Bush administration's latest attempt to put \nideology before women's health. The rule being proposed by the \nadministration would limit patients' access to basic reproductive \nhealth care services and information.\n  The Protecting Patients and Health Care Act would prevent HHS from \nimplementing this ill-conceived, midnight regulation.\n  As you know, Senator Murray and I have been speaking out against this \nrule since July. The rule, as it was then proposed in August by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, is a serious threat to \npatients' access to information and care.\n  Then in September, Senator Murray and I had a very frank conversation \nwith Secretary Leavitt about how this rule could create a slippery \nslope leading to patients being denied access to contraception and \nother important information or care. However, despite the important \nconcerns we raised to the Secretary, the New York Times reported this \npast Monday that in the coming days, HHS plans to release a final \nregulation that would undermine women's health.\n  I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nwill join me today in supporting this important piece of legislation to \nprotect patients' rights and health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 3709. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to expand the Rural Energy for America Program to include \nschools in rural areas; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith my colleague Senator Harkin, to create opportunities for schools, \nlocated in rural communities across this country, to compete for grants \nand loans to purchase energy systems or make energy efficiency \nimprovements.\n  The recently passed Farm Bill authorized roughly $1 billion in \nmandatory spending for renewable energy programs. One of those programs \nis The Rural Energy for America Program, REAP. This program provides \nloans, loan guarantees, and grants to agricultural producers and rural \nsmall businesses to invest in energy saving improvements to their \ncurrent energy systems or to purchase renewable energy systems. \nExamples include purchasing or replacing equipment with more efficiency \nunits, such as lighting or insulation, or the wholesale installment of \nenergy projects that produce energy from wind, solar, biomass, \ngeothermal, and hydrogen-based sources to produce any form of energy \nincluding, heat, electricity, or fuel.\n  My legislation would authorize an additional $100 million over 5 \nyears for these grants and in effect expand the scope of the program, \nallowing it to better meet the needs of rural communities and creating \nimportant incentives for institutions to invest in renewable \ntechnology. It is my hope that Congress will support this legislation \nand its goal of helping rural communities play a key role in our \nNation's energy future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 9007 of the Farm Security and \n     Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8107) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and rural small businesses'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``, rural small businesses, and \n     rural schools''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(6) and (c)(3)(A), by striking ``or \n     rural small business'' each place it appears and insert ``, \n     rural small business, or rural school''.\n       (b) Definition of Rural School.--Section 9007(a) of the \n     Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. \n     8107(a) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively, and indenting \n     appropriately; and\n       (2) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Definition of rural school.--In this section, the \n     term `rural school' means a school in a rural area (as \n     defined in section 343(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1991(a))).\n       ``(2) Establishment.--The Secretary''.\n       (c) Mandatory Funding.--Section 9007(g)(1) of the Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. \n     8107(g)(1) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (D) as \n     clauses (i) through (iv), respectively, and indenting \n     appropriately;\n       (2) by striking ``Of the funds'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Of the funds''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Funding for rural schools.--In addition to amounts \n     made available under subparagraph (A), of the funds of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation, the Secretary shall use to \n     provide assistance to rural schools under this section, \n     $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2013, to \n     remain available until expended.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to cosponsor this \nlegislation to expand the Rural Energy for America Program, REAP, to \ninclude schools in rural areas. This amendment to the program will \nencourage our rural schools to carry out energy efficiency projects and \ninstall renewable energy systems, thus reducing their dependence on \nfossil energy and reducing future energy costs. I am proud to join my \ncolleague, Senator Reid of Nevada, as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The Rural Energy for America Program, enacted in the 2008 farm bill--\nthe Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008--is an expansion of the \nvery successful section 9006 program which was established by the 2002 \nfarm bill. The program has supported over 2,000 renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency projects for farmers, ranchers, and rural small \nbusinesses since its enactment. Most impressive is the fact that the \nFederal investments in these projects were matched by almost 10 times \nas much in funding from the developers of the projects and other \nsources. This truly is a hallmark of a\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nsuccessful Federal program, exactly the kind of program that deserves \nexpansion, especially because it supports rural economic development \nwhile helping to provide us with cleaner and more sustainable energy \nsystems. Expanding this program to rural schools just makes sense--they \nfoster rural economic development and should be able to take part in \nthis transition to better energy systems and to realize the associated \nenvironmental and economic benefits.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in passing this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3711.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure that \nall agreements, contracts, and transactions with respect to commodities \nare carried out on a regulated exchange, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation--the \nDerivatives Trading Integrity Act--which calls for establishing \nstronger standards of openness, transparency and integrity in the \ntrading of financial swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives as a \ncritical step toward rebuilding and restoring confidence in the \nfinancial system. With the total face value of swaps reaching a high of \nsome $531 trillion at the middle of this year--8-and-a-half times the \nworld GDP of $62 trillion--it is long past time for accountability in \nthese markets. Over the years, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nand Congress have responded to concerns of the the swaps industry by \nallowing instruments that are in form and function futures contracts to \nbe privately negotiated without the safeguards provided through \nexchange trading.\n  The economic downturn in this country is forcing us to examine all \ncontributing factors to the crisis in our financial markets. By \nrestoring reasonable safeguards and regulation of swaps, including \ncredit default swaps, along with all other futures contracts, this \nlegislation will go a long way to restore confidence in the markets and \nreestablish soundness and integrity in the financial system. My bill \nwill end the unregulated ``casino capitalism'' that has engendered \ngreat risks in swaps trading. And it will bring these transactions out \ninto the sunlight where they can be monitored and appropriately and \nresponsibly regulated. This legislation will establish authority and \nsafeguards to ensure that parties can meet their obligations to manage \nand reduce danger and risk to the entire financial system and economy.\n  Virtually all contracts now commonly referred to as swaps fall under \nthe definition of futures contracts and function basically in the same \nmanner as futures contracts. This bill amends the Commodity Exchange \nAct to eliminate the distinction in futures contracts among \n``excluded'' and ``exempt'' commodities and regulated, exchange-traded \ncommodities; futures contracts for all commodities would be treated the \nsame.\n  In addition, the bill eliminates the statutory exclusion of swap \ntransactions from regulation, and it ends the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission's authority to exempt such transactions from the general \nrequirement that a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for \nfuture delivery can only trade on a regulated board of trade. In \neffect, this means that all futures contracts must trade on a \ndesignated contract market or a derivatives transaction execution \nfacility.\n  Last month, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry heard dramatic testimony about the impact of unregulated \nfinancial derivatives on the U.S. economy. We have seen large negative \nconsequences from the lack of price transparency and the failure to \nproperly measure and collateralize the risk in trading over-the-counter \nderivatives. The problems have not been in the trading of financial \nfutures on regulated futures markets, subject to the oversight of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  This legislation I am introducing will establish the standards that \nall futures contracts trade on regulated exchange. The regulated \nexchanges will work with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nensure that trading on the exchange is fair and equitable and not \nsubject to abuses.

A bill to provide for emergency bridge loan assistance to \nautomobile manufacturers and component suppliers; to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues the Auto \nIndustry Emergency Bridge Loan Act.\n  This legislation is the product of a bipartisan effort to provide \nbridge loans of up to $25 billion to the auto industry. Auto industries \naround the world, including China and Europe, are requesting loans from \ntheir governments because of the dramatic decline of the global economy \nand the drastic reduction in car purchases and the availability of \ncredit.\n  Our proposition is not only bipartisan. It is a hybrid proposal \ncombining provisions from many sources.\n  We incorporate Leader Reid's provisions on strong taxpayer \nprotections, including stock warrants for the government, provisions \nrestricting executive compensation, including bonuses and golden \nparachutes, and provisions requiring long term plans for financial \nviability. Suppliers are also made eligible for the loans.\n  The language of Chairman Barney Frank, of the House Financial \nServices Committee, was heavily utilized including retention of Section \n136's environmental standards, such as 25 percent improvement in fuel \neconomy and Tier II emissions standards. His oversight board membership \napproach is also included.\n  The White House opposed the use of any of the $700 billion, already-\nappropriated stabilization fund, and the Majority Leader said yesterday \nthat there were not enough votes in the Senate to pass an amendment \nusing those funds. We cannot allow the issue of which source of already \nappropriated funds will be used for the essential purpose of preventing \nthe economy from sliding into a depression, which is a real possibility \nif one or more of the domestic auto companies goes under, given the \nimpact of the auto industry on millions of jobs, on suppliers that are \nin most of our States and on all of our communities which have Big 3 \nauto dealers.\n  So we agreed that the only alternative which can prevent those \ndisastrous results is for the funding stream for the loans to come from \nthe so-called Section 136 appropriation that we provided earlier this \nyear in the consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing \nAppropriations Act, 2009. However, the structure of Section 136 is \npreserved in permanent law for the balance of its appropriation not \nutilized for loans, and the environmental standards of section 136, \nincluding strengthened fuel economy and emissions standards, are \npreserved. Also, loan repayments will be used to replenish Section 136, \nalong with any proceeds from the sale of company stock owned by the \ngovernment.\n  Under our proposal, this emergency bridge loan program would be \nadministered by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  The time for Congress to act on this pressing issue is growing short. \nPeople in communities across this country are anxiously watching to see \nwhat we are going to do. They are sick with worry. Not acting on a \nsolution will provoke anger and frustration in hundreds of communities \nwhich supply components or have auto dealers. This is a Main Street \nissue--a direct jobs issue for millions of families.\n  I know there is frustration with the past actions of the U.S. auto \ncompanies. Some blame them for the quality problems of the 1970s, or \nfor paying their executives and their workers too much, or for not \nmoving aggressively enough to produce advanced technology, fuel \nefficient cars. But we can't throw millions of jobs, a vital segment of \nour industrial base and our economy overboard just because of this \nfrustration.\n  President Bush, President-elect Obama, and the leadership and \nprobably a majority of the Congress all agree that we needed to provide \nbridge loans to support the U.S. auto industry, and I am pleased that \nthe leadership of the Congress has said that we will address this issue \nbeginning December 8.\n  The stakes for our future economic security and well-being are \nenormous. One way or another, we must provide the bridge loans for the \ndomestic auto industry--for the sake of millions of workers and their \nfuture and to keep our economy from being pushed into a depression.\n  I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation, Senator Bond, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Voinovich, Senator Brown, Senator Specter and \nSenator Casey for their assistance in preparing this bipartisan \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\n                                S. 3715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008 (Public Law 110-343) to provide the Special Inspector General with \nadditional personnel, audit, and investigation authorities; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, seven weeks ago Congress faced an \nextremely difficult decision of whether or not to pass an unprecedented \n$700 billion economic stabilization bill to help our Nation's economy \nand financial markets. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the \nAct, passed by Congress and signed into law by the President, was \ndesigned to provide new, expanded authority to the Department of the \nTreasury to take immediate action to stabilize our financial markets by \npurchasing troubled assets through a program called the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program or TARP. This new authority was designed to stop the \ncontinued declines in the financial services industry and the credit \nmarkets.\n  Like many of the thousands of constituents from Iowa I've heard from, \nI shared their concerns that the stabilization plan put hundreds of \nbillions of taxpayer dollars at risk. During the debate on this \nlegislation I made it clear that I would only support this package if \nit included significant checks on the spending through various \noversight mechanisms. I wanted to make sure the legislation wasn't a \nblank check for Government bureaucrats to spend taxpayer dollars with \nimpunity. I'm glad that Congress listened to my concerns and I'm glad \nthat specific oversight reforms I recommended were included in the \nfinal package. For instance, the creation of a Special Inspector \nGeneral for the Troubled Assets Relief Program (Inspector General) was \nsomething I worked to include in the final legislation to ensure that \nan independent watchdog would be looking out for taxpayer funds \nallocated to the TARP.\n  The legislation also has a number of additional oversight provisions \nsuch as the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Board that is \nresponsible for reviewing the exercise of the program to ensure the \nTreasury is operating as\n\n[[Page S10751]]\n\nenvisioned. Additionally, the legislation included provisions requiring \nregular reports from the Treasury to Congress, Tranche reports \noutlining any assets Treasury chooses to purchase, and reports from the \nComptroller General at the Government Accountability Office. The Act \nalso places controls on executive compensation and corporate governance \nat participating entities. Taken together, these provisions were aimed \nto provide a sturdy foundation for ensuring the program is properly \noverseen.\n  However, despite these controls, many of these oversight provisions \nhave been slowly implemented or outright ignored until recently. To \ndate, the Senate has only held hearings on the nomination for the \nSpecial Inspector General and it is unclear when the nomination will be \napproved. Until then, the Inspector General at the Department of the \nTreasury has devoted some resources to overseeing the TARP, but we need \nto act expeditiously to approve the Special Inspector General to ensure \nsomeone is watching over all these taxpayer funds.\n  I do believe once we confirm a nominee to be the Special Inspector \nGeneral that this office will face an uphill battle to work quickly to \nhire staff and to get operations moving to find out where all the \nbillions of dollars are and how they were spent. This isn't an \nimpossible task, but it is one that will take serious effort and great \nleadership to accomplish.\n  One concern I have with the Special Inspector General is the lack of \nauthority that office will have to oversee the TARP and new, evolving \nprograms under the TARP such as the Capital Purchase Plan, or CPP. The \nSecretary of the Treasury has indicated publicly that he intends to \ncontinue utilizing his authority under the Act to use the TARP and the \nCPP to continue to provide taxpayer funds via equity injections and \nstock warrant purchases to banks, financial institutions, and other \nentities, as opposed to purchasing distressed assets as the TARP was \noriginally envisioned. While the Secretary is acting within his \nauthority, this change was not necessarily envisioned from the \noversight perspective when the Special Inspector General authorization \nwas drafted. Instead, the current Act could be construed to only give \nthe Special Inspector General the authority to review purchases of \ndistressed assets and not the purchases and equity injections currently \nongoing under the CPP. As a result, the Special Inspector General could \nbe limited in authority to review the TARP before he takes office.\n  To rectify this, Senator McCaskill and I are here today to introduce \na simple legislative fix to this provision that would amend the Act to \nallow the Special Inspector General to review all actions taken under \nthe TARP, including those of the CPP. This is a straight forward \nsolution to ensure that the Special Inspector General has all the \nauthority necessary to oversee the taxpayer dollars that are being used \nto stabilize the financial industry.\n  This legislation makes one other change to the Act that will help the \nSpecial Inspector General hit the ground running once the Senate \nconfirms the nomination. Looking back to the last Special Inspector \nGeneral Congress created, the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction, SIGIR, we noted that Congress provided SIGIR the \nauthority to utilize special hiring authority to fill these important \njobs quickly and not have them tied up in bureaucratic red tape. This \nsection of our bill simply states that the Special Inspector General \nmay utilize special expedited hiring authority authorized under 5 \nU.S.C. Sec. 3161 for the first six months after the date of enactment \nto get the office up and running. Further, the section also removes \nstatutory limits for how long these special appointments may serve \nbecause we do not want to limit the length of time these employees can \nwork for the Special Inspector General given we don't know how long \nthey will be needed to oversee this program.\n  Taken together, these two simple provisions are necessary to ensure \nthat the Special Inspector General is the aggressive, independent \nwatchdog we envisioned when we passed the Act and not just a paper \ntiger. As a long time supporter of Inspectors General, I believe this \nlegislation is necessary to ensure the success of the Special Inspector \nGeneral. I urge my colleagues to support this urgent legislative fix to \nhelp ensure that American taxpayer dollars are not lost to fraud, \nwaste, or abuse because of a simple oversight in the drafting of the \noriginal legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 3717. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nreimbursement from flexible spending accounts for certain dental \nproducts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Ms. \nStabenow, in introducing the Dental Health Promotion Act of 2008. This \nbill would make expenditures on dental products used to prevent or \ntreat diseases of the mouth to be considered ``qualified'' medical \nexpenses eligible for reimbursement from a flexible spending \narrangement, FSA. It is identical to H.R. 3109, which was introduced in \nthe House of Representatives in July 2007.\n  FSAs are vehicles that allow individuals to use pretax dollars to pay \nfor ``qualified'' medical and dental expenses that are not reimbursed \nby other sources, such as a health insurance plan. Qualified medical \nand dental expenses are defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal \nRevenue Code and its accompanying regulations and include prescription \nand over-the-counter products. For example, an individual can use FSA \ndollars to pay for items such as cold medicine, Band-Aids, or pain \nrelievers. In addition, some dental expenses are currently \nreimbursable, such as a crown or a regular dental checkup. But the \nmoney spent on dental products such as fluoride toothpaste, a spin \ntoothbrush, or dental floss is not currently reimbursable, even though \nthey help prevent tooth decay. In fact, toothpaste is specifically \nexcluded from the definition of a qualified expense.\n  I believe this is an inequity in our tax law that needs to be \ncorrected. More and more medical research is demonstrating the link \nbetween good oral health and overall health. For example, research \nshows that pregnant women with poor oral health tend to deliver lower \nbirth rate babies. Unfortunately, the definition of dental expenses has \nnot kept up with medical research.\n  The legislation Senator Stabenow and I are introducing today would \nupdate the rules governing FSAs to ensure that funds spent on dental \nproducts used to treat or prevent oral disease are treated the same as \nother over-the-counter medical expenses. For those concerned about \nabuse, this bill makes it clear that money spent on cosmetic products \nwould not be considered a qualified expense that can be reimbursed by \nan FSA.\n  Mr. President, it makes sense to invest in disease prevention on the \nfront end.

Res. 711\n\n       Whereas a child from Somalia, identified as Aisha Ibrahim \n     Duhulow, was raped by 3 men, and when her family reported the \n     rape to authorities of the al-Shabaab militia that control \n     the city of Kismayu, Somalia, she was accused of adultery and \n     ordered to be stoned;\n       Whereas, in October 2008, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was stoned \n     to death by 50 militant men before 1,000 witnesses in a \n     public stadium;\n       Whereas al-Shabaab, some of whose members are affiliated \n     with al Qaeda, is a violent and brutal extremist group that \n     has used intimidation and committed human rights violations \n     to undermine the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia \n     and threaten activists in civil society working to bring \n     about peace through political dialogue and reconciliation;\n       Whereas, on February 29, 2008, Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab as a foreign terrorist \n     organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189) and placed the organization \n     on the list of specially designated global terrorists \n     established under the International Emergency Economic Powers \n     Act and initiated under Executive Order 13224;\n       Whereas the 2007 Country Report on Human Rights Practices \n     in Somalia, released on March 11, 2007, by the Department of \n     State, cited the ``poor human rights situation'' in Somalia, \n     including ``unlawful and politically motivated killings, \n     official impunity, and discrimination and violence against \n     women'';\n       Whereas stoning is a grave and serious violation of human \n     rights law, in which the victim is killed in an especially \n     brutal way;\n       Whereas stoning is practiced particularly on girls and \n     women accused of adultery;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom has condemned the death of Aisha Ibrahim \n     Duhulow and called on the United States Government to join \n     other states in speaking out decisively in international fora \n     against such grave human rights abuses; and\n       Whereas the United States Government continues to support \n     the efforts of those working to transform the troubled region \n     of Somalia through commitment to sound human rights \n     practices, democratic and representative government, economic \n     recovery, and lasting peace and reconciliation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the tragic and senseless death by stoning of \n     Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow;\n       (2) urges the international community to join the Senate in \n     speaking out against this brutal act; and\n       (3) urges the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia--\n       (A) to undertake robust efforts to protect women and \n     children and to prevent acts of institutionalized violence \n     against women in Somalia;\n       (B) to work to strengthen the rule of law as part of the \n     effort by the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to \n     establish its authority;\n       (C) to promote equal and fair treatment of women; and\n       (D) to end the culture of impunity in Somalia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10752-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 712--CONGRATULATING THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES ON \n                     WINNING THE 2008 WORLD SERIES\n\n  MR.

Res. 712\n\n       Whereas, on October 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies \n     defeated the Tampa Bay Rays to win the 2008 World Series;\n       Whereas the 4 to 3 Phillies victory in Game 5 of the Fall \n     Classic secured for Philadelphia a World Series title for the \n     first time since 1980, and for the second time in team \n     history;\n       Whereas the Tampa Bay Rays deserve congratulations for a \n     stellar 2008 season, in which, after 10 consecutive losing \n     seasons, they posted a regular season record of 97-65 and won \n     the American League Championship Series;\n       Whereas Tampa Bay Rays Manager and Hazelton, Pennsylvania-\n     native Joe Maddon established himself as among the premier \n     managers in Major League Baseball during the 2008 season, and \n     aptly was named American League Manager of the Year;\n       Whereas Philadelphia sports fans have consistently \n     demonstrated their love for, and devotion to, Philadelphia \n     teams, even after 25 years without winning a major sports \n     championship;\n       Whereas, since taking the helm as manager in 2005, Phillies \n     Manager Charlie Manuel has guided the young Phillies team to \n     become the best in Major League Baseball;\n       Whereas recently-retired General Manager Pat Gillick, who \n     joined the Phillies in 2006, played an integral role in \n     assembling the World Series-winning team;\n       Whereas 24-year old pitcher Cole Hamels was named the Most \n     Valuable Player for both the National League Championship \n     Series and the World Series, with a 4-0 record and 1.80 \n     Earned Run Average in the post-season;\n       Whereas starting pitchers Cole Hamels, Brett Myers, Joe \n     Blanton, and Souderton, Pennsylvania-native Jamie Moyer \n     delivered outstanding performances throughout the post-\n     season;\n       Whereas the Phillies' bullpen distinguished itself as among \n     the greatest in Major League Baseball, particularly closer \n     Brad Lidge, who finished the 2008 season with 48 out of 48 \n     save opportunities, including the final game of the World \n     Series;\n       Whereas the Phillies were led by a talented and tough group \n     of players including: 2006 MVP Ryan Howard; All-Star Chase \n     Utley; 2007 MVP and 2007 and 2008 Gold Glove winner Jimmy \n     Rollins; third baseman Pedro Feliz; veteran outfielder Pat \n     Burrell; 2008 Gold Glove winner, the ``Flyin' Hawaiian'', \n     Shane Victorino; outfielder Jayson Werth; and catcher Carlos \n     Ruiz;\n       Whereas numerous reserve players made significant \n     contributions to the Phillies' World Series title run, \n     including Geoff Jenkins, Chris Coste, Eric Bruntlett, Greg \n     Dobbs, and Matt Stairs; and\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 fans packed the streets of \n     Philadelphia on October 31, 2008 for a parade along Market \n     and Broad Streets ending at Citizens Bank Park;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates--\n       (A) the Philadelphia Phillies for winning the 2008 World \n     Series;\n       (B) the Phillies manager, coaches, and support staff, whose \n     commitment to the Phillies franchise has sustained this proud \n     organization and allowed the team to reach the pinnacle of \n     success in 2008;\n       (C) all Phillies fans, whose tenacity, perseverance, and \n     enthusiasm are matched only by that of the team to which the \n     fans are dedicated; and\n       (D) the Tampa Bay Rays on an outstanding 2008 season; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) Phillies manager Charlie Manuel;\n       (B) Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr.;\n       (E) Phillies advisor Pat Gillick.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10753-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 713--CALLING ON ALL PARTIES TO THE ESCALATING \n   VIOLENCE IN EASTERN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO IMPLEMENT AN \n  IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE AND WORK WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL \n  COMMUNITY TOWARD A COMPREHENSIVE AND LASTING SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, \nMr. Isakson, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Nelson of Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 713\n\n       Whereas the Democratic Republic of Congo was devastated by \n     civil wars lasting from 1996 to 1997 and 1998 to 2003, \n     spawning some of the world's worst human rights violations \n     and involving at least 6 neighboring countries;\n       Whereas, despite the signing of a peace agreement and \n     subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, eastern \n     Congo has continued to suffer from high levels of poverty, \n     insecurity, and absent or inadequate institutions, allowing \n     armed and criminal groups to operate freely;\n       Whereas continuing abuses committed by the national \n     military against civilians in Congo and apparent ties between \n     the military and armed groups in the region have tainted \n     attempts to restore the rule of law in the eastern region of \n     the country;\n       Whereas, according to a study by the International Rescue \n     Committee released in January 2008, the conflict and related \n     humanitarian crises in the Democratic Republic of Congo have \n     taken the lives of an estimated 5,400,000 people since 1998 \n     and continue to cause as many as 45,000 deaths each month;\n       Whereas sexual violence and rape remain a pervasive tool of \n     warfare used by all parties in eastern Congo to terrorize \n     communities, affecting hundreds of thousands of women and \n     girls and frequently resulting in traumatic fistula and other \n     severe genital injuries;\n       Whereas the continued plunder and trade of eastern Congo's \n     rich mineral base, notably cassiterite, coltan, and gold, by \n     armed groups and members of the national military make war \n     profitable and undermine peace efforts;\n       Whereas the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo \n     and Rwanda signed the Nairobi Communique in November 2007, \n     committing to work together to address the continued activity \n     of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and \n     other armed groups operating in their shared border region;\n       Whereas, on January 23, 2008, with the active support of \n     the international community, the Government of the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo, and 22 armed groups in the eastern region \n     signed the Goma accord, committing to an immediate ceasefire \n     and buffer zones for troop disengagement and ultimately \n     disarmament;\n       Whereas these agreements together provided the first \n     working framework in years for peace and lasting stability in \n     eastern Congo, but a continued culture of impunity and \n     suspicion has impeded their implementation;\n       Whereas the United Nations reported more than 200 \n     violations of these agreements between January and July of \n     2008, as well as 2,000 cases of rape and hundreds of people \n     killed;\n       Whereas hate speech inciting ethnic violence by local and \n     national leaders in Congo continued during this period, \n     feeding the concerns and perceived insecurity of minority \n     Tutsi communities;\n       Whereas, since August 28, 2008, fighting has resumed in \n     North Kivu Province between the national military and the \n     forces of General Laurent Nkunda, known as the National \n     Congress for the Defense of the People, the latter of which \n     has taken control of several government military bases and \n     major towns around the city of Goma;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, an estimated \n     250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a \n     result of this renewed fighting in eastern Congo, often \n     without access to shelter, water, food, and medicine, and \n     adding to the over 1,000,000 people already displaced from \n     North and South Kivu;\n       Whereas the United Nations Mission in Congo, known by its \n     French acronym MONUC, has proven unable to protect civilians \n     in light of this new offensive by General Nkunda's forces, \n     causing resentment and protests by local communities;\n       Whereas allegations of troops from Angola, Rwanda, and \n     Zimbabwe crossing into eastern Congo have strained existing \n     regional tensions and increased fears of a wider war that \n     could draw other countries from the region into the fighting, \n     as happened in 1998;\n       Whereas the United Nations' Special Representative of the \n     Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Alan \n     Doss, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have \n     called for more troops and better capabilities for MONUC to \n     stop the rebel offensive and protect civilians;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n     traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, on November 7, 2008, and convened \n     a summit of regional leaders, including the heads of state of \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, which led to a \n     joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire and the \n     creation of humanitarian corridors; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Congress passed the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of \n     2006, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush \n     on December 22, 2006 (Public Law 109-456), stating that it is \n     the policy of the United States to work for peace and \n     security throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo by \n     supporting efforts to protect civilians, to disarm illegal \n     armed groups, and to hold accountable individuals, entities, \n     and countries working to destabilize the country: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the continuing violence, forcible recruitment \n     of children as soldiers, and abuses against civilians in \n     eastern Democratic Republic of Congo;\n       (2) calls on the national military in Congo, the National \n     Congress for the Defense of the People, and all armed groups \n     operating in eastern Congo to cease hostilities, end all \n     human rights abuses, and respect an immediate ceasefire based \n     on the principles of the Goma agreement;\n       (3) calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo to meet its obligations under the Lusaka Agreement of \n     1999, the Pretoria Agreement of 2002, and the Nairobi \n     Communique of 2007 to take action to end the threat posed by \n     the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda;\n       (4) calls on the Governments of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo and Rwanda--\n       (A) to fully restore bilateral relations;\n       (B) to work together to mitigate escalating tensions in the \n     region; and\n       (C) to break any ties that still exist between them and \n     illegal armed groups in eastern Congo;\n       (5) calls on all governments in the Great Lakes region of \n     Africa and those of the Southern African Development \n     Community to support a peaceful resolution to the crisis \n     while ensuring that the volatile situation does not spark a \n     wider regional war;\n       (6) supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-\n     General, his newly appointed United Nations Special Envoy, \n     former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo, and the \n     international facilitation team to bring all parties to the \n     negotiating table and establish a clear roadmap to implement \n     the signed peace agreements;\n       (7) encourages the international community to take \n     immediate measures to enhance the effectiveness of the United \n     Nations Mission in Congo to protect civilians, specifically \n     through increased troops and additional capabilities as \n     requested by the Secretary-General;\n       (8) urges the President to sustain high-level diplomatic \n     engagement together with the African Union, the European \n     Union, and the United Nations to avert a wider regional war \n     and revive a comprehensive peace process in eastern Congo;\n       (9) urges the United States and the international community \n     to develop and support monitoring and verification mechanisms \n     that can hold the parties in Congo accountable to the signed \n     peace agreements, investigate alleged ceasefire violations, \n     and ultimately challenge the continued culture of impunity in \n     Congo; and\n       (10) urges the President and the international community to \n     adopt measures to help the regional governments to identify \n     and ultimately address the factors underlying the conflict in \n     eastern Congo, especially weak governance and the \n     exploitation of the region's lucrative minerals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10753-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10753-S10754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 714--HONORING THE FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY WORKERS \n          WHO COURAGEOUSLY FOUGHT FIRES IN CALIFORNIA IN 2008\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on October 30, 2008, President Bush issued \na proclamation designating November 2008 as National American Indian \nand Alaska Native Heritage Month. The President follows a tradition of \nPresidents since 1990 of issuing proclamations making November the \nmonth for recognizing the significant contributions of tribal \ngovernments and individual Native Americans to our Nation's history and \ndevelopment.\n  Congress also has traditionally recognized the contributions of \nNative Americans to the United States in the form of resolutions, \nfindings, coins and medals. The resolution, which I am sending to the \ndesk to ask for its immediate consideration, continues in that \ntradition.\n  This resolution recognizes some of the many contributions that Native \nAmericans have made to help build our great Nation as well as the \ncontinued contributions of Native Americans to the growth of the United \nStates. From contributions to the United States and the world in the \nfields of agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art to \ninfluencing the founding documents of our Federal Government to the use \nof native languages to develop an unbreakable military code that helped \ndefeat the Axis powers in World War II, Indian Tribes and individual \nNative Americans have shaped our Nation's history in remarkable ways.\n  Through this resolution, we celebrate these and many other \ncontributions of tribal governments and Native Americans during the \nmonth of November. I urge all citizens, and local, State, tribal and \nFederal Governments and agencies to take time this month to learn more \nabout the many facets of Native American history, traditions, and their \nimportant contributions to the formation of the United States.\n  This year, the United States Senate and the Congress as a whole acted \non two important pieces of legislation that seek to meet our Nation's \nlegal, treaty and trust obligations to promote health care and housing \nfor the residents of Indian Country.\n  S. 1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2008, passed the \nSenate in February of this year with a margin of 83-10. As Chairman of \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs, this legislation has been the priority \nfor the Committee in the 110th Congress. The Indian health care act was \nlast authorized in 1992, and this bill would help bring Indian health \ncare into to 21st century. I am proud to report that we were able to \npass this legislation out of the Senate for the first time in almost a \ndecade. A number of Senators were instrumental moving this legislation \nforward in the Senate. Unfortunately, our work was not completed. The \nHouse was unable to pass the legislation and it remains unauthorized as \nthe health care needs of Native Americans remain sorely under-funded \nand services remain outdated. Indian health care will continue to \nremain a priority for the committee and every effort will be made to \nreauthorize this legislation as soon as possible.\n  In addition to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the Senate \napproved a $1 billion authorization for additional funding for the \nIndian Health Service as a part of the Senate Budget Resolution. \nCongress also passed a $250 million authorization for Indian health \ncare through an amendment to the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United \nStates Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nReauthorization Act of 2008.\n  In September of this year, Congress succeeded in enacting the Native \nAmerican Housing and Self-Determination Assistance Reauthorization Act \nof 2008. This bill makes long needed improvements to Native housing \nprograms, and authorizes the flexible use of funding to strengthen \nNative communities through economic and community development.\n  While health care and housing are critically important to Indian \nCountry and represent significant steps forward in fulfilling the trust \nobligation between Congress and the First Americans, it is important to \nacknowledge several other achievements in the 110th Congress.\n  Congress passed into law the Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008 \nwhich provides well-deserved Congressional gold medals to each tribe \nthat had members who were Code Talkers in any foreign conflict. Each \nnext of kin to the valiant Code Talker who served their country will \nreceive a silver duplicate.\n  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act was passed into law, which \nreauthorized the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities \nAssistance Act, increasing the amount of money per student in tribal \ncolleges and universities. A study has been requested of the General \nAccountability Office which will allow for an evaluation of public \nschools on Indian lands to assist Congress in meeting its obligations \nto Indian education.\n  Congress also passed the Fostering Connections to Success and \nIncreasing Adoptions Act allowing Tribes for the\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\nfirst time to directly administer foster care and adoption programs \noffered by the Federal government, allowing tribes to continue \nstrengthening their communities by ensuring safe and caring homes for \ntheir Native children.\n  Congress passed the Native American $1 Coin Act, which recognizes the \ncontributions of Native Americans to the development of the United \nStates through an annually changing image on the reverse of the \nSakakawea $1 coin that is now in circulation.\n  Congress also passed into law a joint resolution designating November \n28, 2008 as Native American Heritage Day, honoring the contributions \nand achievements of our First Americans.\n  The Treaty of Fort Laramie and other treaties acknowledged the \nspecific obligations that the United States owes to the Tribes located \nin my State of North Dakota. Much has been done this Congress to begin \nto fulfill this legal responsibility and the more general trust \nresponsibility that Congress owes to all Indian Tribes.\n  However, as is evident with Congress' failure to pass the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2008, much still remains to be done. The \nresolution before the Senate today would simply honor the hard work, \ntraditions, culture, and contribution of the First Americans.\n  I ask that this resolution be adopted quickly and that it act as an \nencouragement to all people of the United States to observe the month \nof November as National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10756-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 720--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PANCREATIC \n                         CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Specter) submitted the \nfollowing resolution, which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am introducing a resolution \nin the Senate that touches on one of the tragic cases of a Floridian, \nBob Levinson, who has been missing in Iran since he visited Kish Island \noff the coast of Iran in the Persian Gulf in early 2007. I have spoken \non this issue ad infinitum before to call the attention of the Congress \nto the plight of Mr. Levinson as well as to the difficulties that are \nfaced by his wife Christine and their seven children.\n  Bob Levinson, a businessman and a former FBI agent, vanished after \nchecking out of his hotel on the resort island of Kish on March 9, \n2007. It is no doubt the wish of everyone who knows this man that Bob \nLevinson be reunited with his loved ones. It has been very difficult to \nget information out of the Government of Iran. The State Department has \ndelivered a number of requests for information and cooperation to the \nIranian Government through our diplomatic intermediary, which is the \nGovernment of Switzerland. Unfortunately, Iran continues to claim it \nhas no information on the fate of Bob Levinson.\n  Mrs. Levinson and her eldest son, Daniel, and her sister, Ms. Halpin, \ntraveled to Tehran and Kish Island in December of last year in the \nhopes of finding information about Bob Levinson's disappearance. The \nIranian authorities, to their credit, extended courtesies to her and \nthey promised her at the time they would help in the case, but those \npromises have not been fulfilled.\n  This resolution I am introducing urges Iranian officials to fulfill \ntheir promises of assistance to the Levinsons. It calls for Iranian \ninvestigators to meet with the FBI to discuss the Levinson case. It \ncalls for the U.S. Government and our allies to\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\npress Iran on this case at every opportunity and at every level--\nsomething I think the U.S. Government is beginning to do. Also, this \nresolution thanks the Swiss for their continued assistance in the case. \nIt furthermore expresses appreciation for the efforts of Iranian \nofficials who have ensured the safety of the family during their visit \nof December of last year. This resolution also expresses sympathy to \nthe Levinson family during this trying period. This is a wife and seven \nchildren of a missing former FBI agent in the country of Iran, missing \nnow since the early part of 2007.\n  In this year, on July 28, the President of Iran stated during an \ninterview with NBC that Iranian officials were willing to cooperate \nwith the FBI on this case. Why is the FBI involved? The FBI is involved \nbecause he is a former FBI agent. This resolution calls upon the Tehran \ngovernment to make this meeting happen as soon as possible to discuss \nthe evidence the Iranians have uncovered about Mr. Levinson's \ndisappearance.\n  Now, I wish to underscore that because on July 28 of this year the \nPresident of Iran stated in an NBC interview that Iranian officials \nwere willing to cooperate with the FBI on this case. They have not.\n  I wish to be blunt. We obviously have serious disagreements with Iran \non its nuclear program and a whole range of other issues. I haven't \nhesitated over the years, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, to express my opposition to a number of Tehran's \npolicies--and I will continue to press for change in Iran's positions \nand activities--but I am calling on the Government of Iran out of human \ncompassion and humanitarian assistance to a family of a wife and seven \nchildren to come forth and cooperate in trying to find and get evidence \nof the whereabouts of Bob Levinson.\n  We want to see an Iran where individuals are respected, not locked up \nin Evin Prison--we want to see an Iran that is respected--for signing a \npetition calling for women's rights. We want to see an Iran that \nchampions the Middle East peace process rather than supporting \nterrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. We want to see an Iran \nwhose leaders do not make despicable threats to ``wipe Israel off the \nmap.''\n  We clearly have our differences with Iran, and those differences, \nespecially under a new administration, can start to be bridged with \nIran stepping forth with discussions regarding the safe return of an \nAmerican citizen whose family desperately wishes to be reunited with \nhim, that American citizen being former FBI agent Bob Levinson.\n  So this resolution calls upon the U.S. Government and our friends and \nallies to engage with Iranian officials to raise Mr. Levinson's case at \nevery opportunity and at every level. I understand many of our allies \nalready have raised Mr. Levinson's case on our behalf, and I wish to \nencourage them to continue to do so. This Senator has done it as well, \nboth publicly and privately, and I will continue to do so.\n  The resolution I have filed additionally commends the Swiss for their \nongoing assistance to the U.S. Government and to the family of the \nLevinsons. The assistance of the Swiss Ambassador and his staff at the \nAmerican Interests Section in Tehran was essential during Mrs. \nLevinson's visits in the past, and will be, I think, to her visits in \nthe future.\n  I wish to express--the word ``sympathy'' does not conjure up what I \nam trying to express to Christine Levinson and to her family. No one \nshould have to experience what they have been through. I have met with \nher on a number of occasions. She is a loving mother. She is clearly an \neloquent advocate. She is a tough fighter on behalf of her husband. She \nis relentless. She is not going to give up, nor should she. I deem it a \ngreat privilege that I may in some little way try to assist her and her \nfamily.\n  I want to bring more of our colleagues into this issue of trying to \nfind Bob Levinson in Iran and get the world's attention focused on this \nmissing American. I am going to ask Mrs. Levinson to come back in \nJanuary when we reconvene, and I want some of our colleagues to meet \nher.\n  Remember, Senators, that as representatives of the American people, \nthat means we have to help individual American citizens in distress. \nThis is clearly a family who is in distress. We cannot--and I believe I \ncan speak for the Senate--we are not going to forget Bob Levinson and \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10757-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5696.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3711, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3711) to authorize a cost of living adjustment \n     for the Federal judiciary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to express support for a bill \nintroduced by myself, the minority leader, and others to provide a \ncost-of-living salary adjustment to Federal judges.\n  The Framers of our Constitution were men of great vision and \nforesight. One of their great innovations was the establishment of an \nindependent judiciary, which is to function as a coequal branch of \ngovernment.\n  The Framers knew that justice and the rule of law would only prevail \nif judges are free from executive and legislative interference. In \norder to preserve the autonomy of judges, the Framers established \nsafeguards. One of these safeguards was the assurance that judicial pay \ncould not be diminished during a judge's service on the bench. This \nsafeguard was important enough that it was included in the first \nsection of article III of the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, in terms of real dollars, we in Congress have allowed \njudicial pay to dwindle. Since 1969, the salaries of Federal judges \nhave significantly declined when adjusted for inflation. The Office of \nthe United States Courts estimates judicial pay has declined by 25 \npercent.\n  Preserving judicial integrity is a bipartisan goal. Earlier this \nCongress a\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\nbipartisan bill was put forward which would have given judges a long-\nawaited pay raise. The Federal Judicial Salary Restoration Act of 2008 \nwould have brought judicial salaries more closely in line with what the \nposition merits. Although this bill had support on both sides of the \naisle, we were unable to pass it this year. We will return to that \nproposal in the very near future.\n  The bill we have introduced today simply provides a cost-of-living \nincrease for this year. I favor a proposal, included in the Salary \nRestoration Act, which would guarantee judges a cost-of-living \nadjustment every year. But at the very least, we must provide such an \nincrease for this year.\n  Between 1993 and 2001, the Federal judiciary has received only three \nout of eight proposed cost-of-living adjustments. Because of Congress's \nfailure to act, judicial pay has declined relative to the rest of the \neconomy, and judicial independence is threatened. It is time we stop \nallowing judicial pay to diminish.\n  If we are to preserve the judicial independence envisioned by our \ncountry's Founders, we must not allow judicial pay to continue to ebb. \nPassage of this bill would be a small downpayment on the more \nmeaningful steps we need to take to treat judges with the respect they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the very beginning of the 110th \nCongress, I joined with Senators Reid, Specter, Feinstein, and Cornyn \nto pass legislation to authorize a cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, for \nthe salaries of U.S. Justices and judges for fiscal year 2007. Now as \nwe wrap up this session, we are again compelled to take remedial \naction, because a COLA for our Federal judiciary was not included in \nthe continuing resolution for fiscal year 2009.\n  Earlier today, we attempted to pass a bipartisan bill to repeal the \nsection of the U.S. Code that is a barrier to Federal judges receiving \nan automatic cost-of-living adjustment. The Administrative Office of \nthe United States Courts notes that when adjusted for inflation the pay \nrate for Federal judges has declined by 25 percent since 1969. In 1975, \nCongress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, \nintended to give judges, Members of Congress, and other high-ranking \nexecutive branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded other Federal \nemployees unless rejected by Congress. However, in 1981, Congress \nenacted section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific \ncongressional action to give COLAs to judges. This action has resulted \nin judges failing to receive a cost-of-living adjustment when other \nFederal employees have received one. Unfortunately, there was an \nobjection on the other side of the aisle that prevented passage of the \nmeasure to repeal this antiquated section and to ensure that the wages \nof our Federal judges can keep up with inflation.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are now trying to move provides a COLA \nfor Federal judges consistent with the law and with fairness. I hope \nthat this measure, providing judges with a COLA for fiscal year 2009, \ncan pass by both sides of the aisle by unanimous consent. I had \nsincerely hoped that we could have passed a more comprehensive judicial \npay bill this Congress given all the work we dedicated to the issue in \nthe Judiciary Committees of both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives but at a minimum we should not allow judicial salaries \nto slip even further behind.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, a strong and independent judiciary is \nessential to the administration of justice in our country.\n  It is my understanding that the Senate has been unable to clear \nbipartisan legislation introduced by Senators Reid and McConnell which \nwould repeal the requirement that Congress specially authorize a cost-\nof-living increase each year for the Federal judiciary. Repealing this \nprovision, which is known as section 140, would in essence ensure that \nFederal judges are treated in the same manner as Members of Congress \nregarding salary adjustments.\n  I am disappointed that this bipartisan effort is being blocked, but I \nam pleased that the Senate is expected to pass another measure, which I \nhave cosponsored, that would provide a cost-of-living increase to \njudges for at least the next year. Without this fix, Members of \nCongress will receive a COLA increase in January along with most of the \nFederal workforce, but not the judiciary. I don't see any reasonable \njustification for giving Members of Congress and the Federal workforce \na cost-of-living increase and denying the judiciary a similar \nadjustment.\n  There are ongoing discussions about the extent we should provide for \nan overall increase in judicial compensation, but the issue we are \ndiscussing today isn't about making major adjustments to judicial \nsalaries. I support reforming judicial salaries, and I hope the next \nCongress will be able to pass legislation to this end, but in the \nmeantime I believe it is important that we don't deny the judiciary a \nreasonable cost-of-living increase.\n  Leaving the judiciary behind would be wrongheaded and shortsighted. \nBy denying these dedicated public servants adequate compensation, we \nare making it more difficult to attract and retain judges of the \nhighest caliber.\n  I would also like to note my appreciation for the majority leader's \nefforts to address this issue. Although attempts to repeal section 140 \nhave stalled at this point, I know Senator Reid, along with Senator \nLeahy, are committed to ensuring that we maintain a strong judiciary \nand to enacting necessary reforms. I will continue to do everything I \ncan to support these efforts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very \nimportant change that is set to occur all across America on February \n17, 2009: The final switch from analog to digital broadcast television \ncalled the DTV, or Digital TV, Transition.\n  In many respects this is not a new issue. The wheels have been in \nmotion on this change since 2005--spurred by the horrible tragedy of \nSeptember 11th which starkly highlighted our desperate need for a \nnational, interoperable communications network. The transition to \ndigital TV will free up spectrum for public safety use so the national \nemergency communications network America needs can be put in place.\n  But there have been serious concerns about our readiness to make the \nshift to digital TV, and several of my colleagues and I have been \nraising red flags about them for years now. Not because we believe the \nchange is a mistake, but because we believe that not enough has been \ndone to prepare, to educate, and to help American consumers so that the \nscreens on their television sets do not go black 88 days from now.\n  What is the change from analog to digital broadcast? Over-the-air \nbroadcasters will send their signal over digital spectrum, not analog \nspectrum that is currently used. The change won't affect consumers with \ncable or satellite TV or those who have a converter box for their older \nanalog TV set. And the switch to digital will improve the definition \nand clarity of the TV picture.\n  Why are we making this change? Primarily to modernize our airwaves \nand use the more efficient digital spectrum for a smarter use of our \nlimited spectrum resources for the public good. The change will, again, \nfree up critically needed spectrum so that we can move toward the \nnationally interoperable public safety communications network we need. \nIt will also allow over-the-air broadcasters to offer new and \ninnovative programming and provide new spectrum for wireless \ntechnologies.\n  The DTV Act was enacted as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. \nIt directs the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, to require all \nfull power television stations to cease analog broadcasting following \nFebruary 17, 2009. That day is 88 days from now. What this means--and \nlet me be very clear--is that any consumer with traditional analog \ntelevisions--regular TV sets that use an antenna to get a signal--will \nnot be able to watch free, over-the-air television without taking one \nof three steps to adapt their TV to receive a digital signal. The most \ncommon and least expensive way that consumers can adapt their TV will \nbe to buy a digital-to-analog converter box to hook up to their analog \ntelevision set. While seemingly a highly technical issue to some, this \nis no small matter to the 10-13 million Americans who might well lose \ntheir TV signal on February 18th of next year.\n  I firmly believe that our Nation is not ready to make this transition \nwithout substantially more involvement from every level of government, \nthe entire communications industry, and willing community organizations \nacross America. At present, most experts agree that the transition will \nunleash a massive amount of consumer confusion. And when people are cut \noff from their televisions, it is not just a matter of convenience, but \nit is a matter of public safety. We simply cannot stand by and let \npeople lose access to emergency alerts and public safety \ncommunications.\n  I am especially concerned because this transition is going to hit our \nmost vulnerable citizens--the poor, the elderly, the disabled, and \nthose with language barriers--the hardest. We risk leaving those who \nare most reliant on over-the-air broadcast television for their contact \nwith the outside world literally in the dark. These consumers are \ndisproportionately rural.\n  In 2005, the outgoing administration and its proponents decided to \nleave almost all of the implementation of the transition to the private \nsector--broadcasters, cable and satellite companies, and consumer \nelectronics retailers. While there are claims that hundreds of millions \nof private sector dollars have been spent making Americans aware of the \nDTV transition, it seems that most Americans have no idea what it \nreally is even if they have heard of it. New surveys suggest more \nconsumers are growing aware of the transition, but that consumers \nremain confused about what steps they need to take to get ready for it. \nConsumer Reports has found that 63 percent have major misconceptions \nabout what steps they need to take to prepare.\n  The recent DTV transition test market of Wilmington, NC demonstrated \nthat, even with extraordinary levels of outreach, some still did not \nknow anything about the DTV transition. I would note that Wilmington \nreceived far more attention than any market in West Virginia is likely \nto receive, or any other part of the country for that matter.\n  Even in the test market, several thousand people called into the FCC \nfor assistance--they could not set up their converter box, they could \nnot receive certain digital signals, or their antennae needed \nadjustment--just to name a few of the problems. Consumers, especially \nthe elderly and those with limited English proficiency, are going to \nneed help in managing the transition. On February 18, 2009, those \nthousands of calls will become millions.\n  There is no question the transition to DTV could have and should have \nbeen far better managed and far better planned. But at this point, we \nmust focus on fixing it, not laying blame.\n  Last night, I asked unanimous consent for the Senate to take up S. \n3663, the Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act, as \namended. This piece of legislation will help make sure those consumers \nwho fail to make the DTV transition by February 17, 2009 are not left \nwithout access to emergency information. This bill will also allow \nthose consumers to understand what steps they need to take in order to \nrestore their television signals by allowing an analog signal to \ncontinue to be broadcast in each regional market for an additional 30 \ndays past February 17th.\n  Let me be clear: This bill is far from a silver bullet that will fix \nall the problems associated with the transition.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the new Democratic leadership in \nCongress and the White House is committed to protecting the American \nconsumer. Over the next few months, I will work with my colleagues on a \nmore comprehensive plan of action to make sure millions of Americans \nreceive the support and assistance they need to make this transition.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Rockefeller \nsubstitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the bill be \nread a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate; and any statements \nrelated to the bill be placed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5698) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the short-term partial extension of analog \n                             broadcasting)\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 709) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 709\n\n       Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery is valuable \n     commercially and recreationally in the United States and many \n     other countries;\n       Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation \n     of Atlantic Tunas entered into force on March 21, 1969;\n       Whereas the Convention established the International \n     Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to \n     coordinate international research and develop, implement, and \n     enforce compliance of the conservation and management \n     recommendations on the Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly \n     migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent \n     seas, including the Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first \n     conservation and management recommendation to ensure the \n     sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the \n     Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the \n     maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission \n     adopted a working hypothesis of 2 Atlantic bluefin tuna \n     stocks, with 1 occurring west of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``western Atlantic stock'') \n     and the other occurring east of 45 degrees west longitude \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean stock'');\n       Whereas, despite scientific recommendations intended to \n     maintain bluefin tuna populations at levels that will permit \n     the maximum sustainable yield and ensure the future of the \n     stocks, the total allowable catch quotas have been \n     consistently set at levels significantly higher than the \n     recommended levels for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock;\n       Whereas despite the establishment by the Commission of \n     fishing quotas based on total allowable catch levels for the \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery that \n     exceed scientific recommendations, compliance with such \n     quotas by parties to the Convention that harvest that stock \n     has been extremely poor, most recently with harvests \n     exceeding such total allowable catch levels by more than 50 \n     percent for each of the last 4 years;\n       Whereas insufficient data reporting in combination with \n     unreliable national catch statistics has frequently \n     undermined efforts by the Commission to assign quota \n     overharvests to specific countries;\n       Whereas the failure of many Commission members fishing east \n     of 45 degrees west longitude to comply with other Commission \n     recommendations to conserve and control the overfished \n     eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has \n     been an ongoing problem;\n       Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and \n     Statistics noted in its 2006 report that the fishing \n     mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     stock may be more than 3 times the level that would permit \n     the stock to stabilize at the maximum sustainable catch \n     level, and continuing to fish at the level of recent years \n     ``is expected to drive the spawning biomass to a very low \n     level'' giving ``rise to a high risk of fishery and stock \n     collapse'';\n       Whereas the Standing Committee's 2008 report recommended \n     that the annual harvest levels for eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna be reduced from 32,000 metric tons \n     to 15,000 metric tons or less to halt decline of the resource \n     and initiate rebuilding;\n       Whereas the Standing Committee has stated that time and \n     area closures could greatly facilitate the implementation and \n     monitoring of rebuilding strategies and recommended a closure \n     of the Mediterranean Sea in May, June, and July, as well as a \n     minimum size limit of 25 kilograms;\n       Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the \n     ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual \n     Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean'' containing a wide range of management, \n     monitoring, and control measures designed to facilitate the \n     recovery of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin \n     tuna stock;\n       Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows \n     overfishing and stock decline to continue, and initial \n     information indicates that implementation of the plan in 2007 \n     by many eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna \n     harvesting countries has been poor;\n       Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional \n     and more restrictive conservation and management \n     recommendations for the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock, \n     and these recommendations have been implemented by Nations \n     fishing west of 45 degrees west longitude, including the \n     United States;\n       Whereas despite adopting, fully implementing, and complying \n     with a science-based rebuilding program for the western \n     Atlantic bluefin tuna stock by countries fishing west\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\n     of 45 degrees west longitude, catches and catch rates remain \n     very low;\n       Whereas many scientists believe that mixing occurs between \n     the western Atlantic bluefin tuna stock and the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean stock, and as such, poor \n     management and noncompliance with recommendations for one \n     stock are likely to have an adverse effect on the other \n     stock; and\n       Whereas additional research on stock mixing will improve \n     the understanding of the relationship between eastern and \n     western bluefin tuna stocks and other fisheries, which will \n     assist in the conservation, recovery, and management of the \n     species throughout its range: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States delegation to the 16th Special Meeting of the \n     International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic \n     Tunas, should--\n       (1) pursue a meaningful assessment of Commission member \n     compliance with the ``Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a \n     Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern \n     Atlantic and Mediterranean'' (Recommendation 06-05), \n     including seeking detailed explanations from Commission \n     members that have failed to effectively implement the terms \n     of the recommendation;\n       (2) pursue the adoption by the Commission of measures \n     designed to eliminate non-compliance, including, as \n     appropriate, deducting a portion of a future quota for a \n     party to compensate for such party exceeding its quota in \n     prior years, and where appropriate, steps should be taken to \n     link non-compliance with reductions in fishery or market \n     access;\n       (3) seek a temporary suspension of the eastern Atlantic and \n     Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, including all trade, if \n     significant progress toward establishing science-based \n     management measures, improving monitoring and control \n     measures, and addressing compliance issues is not made at the \n     Commission this year;\n       (4) seek to strengthen the conservation and management of \n     the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making \n     recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to \n     rebuild it, including reducing annual harvest levels so that \n     they do not exceed recommendations of the Standing Committee \n     and expanding the time and area closure for the Mediterranean \n     purse seine fleet to include May, June, and July; and\n       (5) pursue additional research on the relationship between \n     the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \n     bluefin tuna stocks and the extent to which the populations \n     intermingle.\n\n

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 712, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 712) congratulating the Philadelphia \n     Phillies on winning the 2008 World Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution congratulating the Philadelphia Phillies on winning the 2008 \nWorld Series. On October 29, 2008, the Phillies defeated the Tampa Bay \nRays 4 to 3 in Game 5 to secure a World Series title for the first time \nsince 1980 and second time in team history.\n  This historic victory was the culmination of a hard-fought 2008 \nregular season and an exhilarating postseason run for the Phillies. On \nSeptember 27, the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals to clinch the \nNational League East Division for the second consecutive year. They \nwould go on to defeat the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers in \nthe Division Series and National League Championship Series, \nrespectively, to advance to their first World Series since 1993.\n  In the World Series, the Phillies faced a young and talented Tampa \nBay Rays team, led by Manager, and Pennsylvania native, Joe Maddon. \nWith strong performances from their starting pitchers, an outstanding \nbullpen and well-timed hitting, the Phillies beat the Rays in five \ngames to clinch the title.\n  On behalf of the Senate and as an ardent Phillies fan myself, I \ncongratulate the Philadelphia Phillies on winning the 2008 World Series \nand bringing to my hometown of Philadelphia a major sports championship \nfor the first time in 25 years. In particular, I offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to manager Charlie Manuel, who, since taking the helm \nas manager in 2005, has guided this young Phillies team to become the \nbest in Major League Baseball. Further due special recognition is 24-\nyear-old pitcher Cole Hamels, who was named the Most Valuable Player \nfor both the National League Championship Series and World Series with \na 4-0 record and 1.80 earned run average in the postseason.\n  Also deserving of much praise are the 2008 American League \nChampionship Rays. Though they had endured 10 consecutive losing \nseasons and the worst record in baseball last season, the Rays won \ntheir division and the 2008 American League Championship Series. The \nRays have a bright future and I wish them continued success.\n  Finally, and perhaps more importantly, I congratulate all Phillies \nfans, who could finally enjoy that parade\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\ndown Broad Street they so well deserve. Philadelphia sports fans have \nconsistently demonstrated their love for and devotion to Philadelphia \nteams, even after 25 years without winning a major sports championship. \nWhile we have a reputation of being somewhat rough around the edges, \nPhiladelphia fans are enthusiastic about sports and fiercely loyal to \nour teams. We also have a reputation for not resting on our laurels and \ndemanding a lot from those players and coaches privileged to wear our \nteams' uniforms. I therefore urge my Phillies to keep fighting and \nbring home another title next year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions, to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 713, which was \nintroduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 713) calling on all parties to the \n     escalating violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of \n     Congo to implement an immediate ceasefire and work with the \n     support of the international community toward a comprehensive \n     and lasting solution to this crisis.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my deep concern about \nthe rapidly deteriorating situation in the eastern region of the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo. Over recent weeks, eastern Congo has been \nmaking international headlines since new fighting broke out between the \nCongolese military and rebels loyal to General Laurent Nkunda. The \nrebels overran several government military bases and major towns as \nthey surrounded the strategic city of Goma. Meanwhile, the Congolese \nmilitary--a feckless force that often rapes and pillages the very \npeople it is meant to protect--retreated, leaving UN peacekeepers to \nfend off the rebels' advance and attempt to protect civilians. \nFortunately, the rebels stopped before marching on Goma, but the \nsituation remains extremely volatile.\n  I traveled last year to the very region, North Kivu Province, where \nthis violence is taking place and saw firsthand the grave suffering of \npeople who have lived through a decade of conflict and humanitarian \ncrisis. The numbers are staggering: an estimated 5.4 million deaths \nover the last decade and 1,500 people still dying each day. In \naddition, millions have been displaced from their homes, living in \nsqualid camps where children are subject to forced recruitment and \nwomen suffer unspeakable levels of sexual violence.\n  In my travels to many parts of Africa over the years, the suffering \nof women and girls in eastern Congo particularly stands out. I met with \nwomen and girls who had been gang raped, often leaving them with \nirreparable physical and psychological damage. I met with women who had \nlost their husbands, their homes, and their livelihoods and yet against \nall odds they refused to give up--if only for the sake of their \nchildren. There may be no worse place to be female than eastern Congo. \nAnd yet it is the strength of these women that continues to give hope.\n  The renewed fighting in eastern Congo is worrisome not only because \nit will further exacerbate this humanitarian tragedy, but also because \nit risks engulfing the neighboring countries in a new regional war. \nLast month, the Congolese Government accused Rwanda of sending troops \nacross the border in support of Nkunda's forces. The rebels in turn \nhave recently alleged that Angolan and even Zimbabwean troops are \nsupporting the Congolese military. Despite vows by these governments to \navoid another regional conflict, tensions remain high. It is not hard \nto imagine a minor incident sparking a repeat of 1998 when at least six \nneighboring countries were drawn into Congo's war.\n  Such a scenario would destabilize the Great Lakes region of Africa. \nOver recent years, the United States and our international partners \nhave made significant investments--both financial and diplomatic--to \nassist in consolidating peace and restoring the rule of law in this \nregion. No one wants to see those investments lost and the progress \nmade reversed, and we may not have to. If we take bold and strategic \naction now, we can prevent a new regional conflict and revive the peace \nprocess in eastern Congo.\n  I was pleased that our top diplomat for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, \ntraveled to the region with high-level diplomats from the UK and France \n2 weeks ago. In addition, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon convened an \nemergency summit of regional leaders in Nairobi. But this diplomatic \nengagement must remain consistent and get all key actors, including \nRwanda, to commit to a clear roadmap for implementing the already \nsigned peace agreements. To be successful, we must also establish \nmonitoring and verification mechanisms to hold the parties accountable \nand challenge the continued culture of impunity.\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\n  At the same time, while achieving a political solution is vital to \nending the crisis in eastern Congo, the international community should \nalso take measures to help protect civilians and enforce a ceasefire in \nthe short term. The UN Secretary General has called for an additional \n3,000 troops and police specially trained and equipped for rapid \nresponse to reinforce the peacekeeping force in Congo, known by its \nFrench acronym MONUC. The United States and other Security Council \nmembers should act immediately to fulfill those requests. In addition, \nthe Security Council should clarify MONUC's mandate to prioritize \ncivilian protection and conflict prevention in the east and ensure it \nis implemented equally by all brigades. A renewed MONUC will not only \nsave lives, but can also deter military involvement from neighboring \ncountries.\n  Ultimately though, lasting peace in eastern Congo and the wider \nregion will require measures to transform the underlying causes of \nconflict. The continued exploitation of Congo's rich mineral base, \nparticularly cassiterite, coltan, and gold, makes war a profitable \nenterprise. The international community should work with governments in \nthe region to bring greater transparency and regulation to the trade in \nthese minerals. The next administration and Congress must look \nseriously at how the United States can contribute meaningfully to this \nprocess as it is a critical step toward the larger goal of reforming \nCongo's economic and political institutions.\n  Congo has vast potential and its stability can have a positive impact \nacross Africa. We have made notable progress in that direction over \nrecent years, but we are once again standing at a precipice. In the \nface of a potential regional war, we can no longer rely on piecemeal \ntactics and half-measures. It is time for a comprehensive and concerted \ninternational effort to ensure protection and basic rights for all \nCongo's people. It is for that reason that\nI am today introducing a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire \nin eastern Congo and a comprehensive solution to this crisis. I am \npleased to introduce this resolution with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Kansas, who has long been a champion on this issue, and I \nhope our colleagues will join us in this urgent plea for peace.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements related to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 713) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 713\n\n       Whereas the Democratic Republic of Congo was devastated by \n     civil wars lasting from 1996 to 1997 and 1998 to 2003, \n     spawning some of the world's worst human rights violations \n     and involving at least 6 neighboring countries;\n       Whereas, despite the signing of a peace agreement and \n     subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, eastern \n     Congo has continued to suffer from high levels of poverty, \n     insecurity, and absent or inadequate institutions, allowing \n     armed and criminal groups to operate freely;\n       Whereas continuing abuses committed by the national \n     military against civilians in Congo and apparent ties between \n     the military and armed groups in the region have tainted \n     attempts to restore the rule of law in the eastern region of \n     the country;\n       Whereas, according to a study by the International Rescue \n     Committee released in January 2008, the conflict and related \n     humanitarian crises in the Democratic Republic of Congo have \n     taken the lives of an estimated 5,400,000 people since 1998 \n     and continue to cause as many as 45,000 deaths each month;\n       Whereas sexual violence and rape remain a pervasive tool of \n     warfare used by all parties in eastern Congo to terrorize \n     communities, affecting hundreds of thousands of women and \n     girls and frequently resulting in traumatic fistula and other \n     severe genital injuries;\n       Whereas the continued plunder and trade of eastern Congo's \n     rich mineral base, notably cassiterite, coltan, and gold, by \n     armed groups and members of the national military make war \n     profitable and undermine peace efforts;\n       Whereas the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo \n     and Rwanda signed the Nairobi Communique in November 2007, \n     committing to work together to address the continued activity \n     of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and \n     other armed groups operating in their shared border region;\n       Whereas, on January 23, 2008, with the active support of \n     the international community, the Government of the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo, and 22 armed groups in the eastern region \n     signed the Goma accord, committing to an immediate ceasefire \n     and buffer zones for troop disengagement and ultimately \n     disarmament;\n       Whereas these agreements together provided the first \n     working framework in years for peace and lasting stability in \n     eastern Congo, but a continued culture of impunity and \n     suspicion has impeded their implementation;\n       Whereas the United Nations reported more than 200 \n     violations of these agreements between January and July of \n     2008, as well as 2,000 cases of rape and hundreds of people \n     killed;\n       Whereas hate speech inciting ethnic violence by local and \n     national leaders in Congo continued during this period, \n     feeding the concerns and perceived insecurity of minority \n     Tutsi communities;\n       Whereas, since August 28, 2008, fighting has resumed in \n     North Kivu Province between the national military and the \n     forces of General Laurent Nkunda, known as the National \n     Congress for the Defense of the People, the latter of which \n     has taken control of several government military bases and \n     major towns around the city of Goma;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, an estimated \n     250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as a \n     result of this renewed fighting in eastern Congo, often \n     without access to shelter, water, food, and medicine, and \n     adding to the over 1,000,000 people already displaced from \n     North and South Kivu;\n       Whereas the United Nations Mission in Congo, known by its \n     French acronym MONUC, has proven unable to protect civilians \n     in light of this new offensive by General Nkunda's forces, \n     causing resentment and protests by local communities;\n       Whereas allegations of troops from Angola, Rwanda, and \n     Zimbabwe crossing into eastern Congo have strained existing \n     regional tensions and increased fears of a wider war that \n     could draw other countries from the region into the fighting, \n     as happened in 1998;\n       Whereas the United Nations' Special Representative of the \n     Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Alan \n     Doss, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have \n     called for more troops and better capabilities for MONUC to \n     stop the rebel offensive and protect civilians;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n     traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, on November 7, 2008, and convened \n     a summit of regional leaders, including the heads of state of \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, which led to a \n     joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire and the \n     creation of humanitarian corridors; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Congress passed the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of \n     2006, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush \n     on December 22, 2006 (Public Law 109-456), stating that it is \n     the policy of the United States to work for peace and \n     security throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo by \n     supporting efforts to protect civilians, to disarm illegal \n     armed groups, and to hold accountable individuals, entities, \n     and countries working to destabilize the country: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the continuing violence, forcible recruitment \n     of children as soldiers, and abuses against civilians in \n     eastern Democratic Republic of Congo;\n       (2) calls on the national military in Congo, the National \n     Congress for the Defense of the People, and all armed groups \n     operating in eastern Congo to cease hostilities, end all \n     human rights abuses, and respect an immediate ceasefire based \n     on the principles of the Goma agreement;\n       (3) calls on the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo to meet its obligations under the Lusaka Agreement of \n     1999, the Pretoria Agreement of 2002, and the Nairobi \n     Communique of 2007 to take action to end the threat posed by \n     the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda;\n       (4) calls on the Governments of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo and Rwanda--\n       (A) to fully restore bilateral relations;\n       (B) to work together to mitigate escalating tensions in the \n     region; and\n       (C) to break any ties that still exist between them and \n     illegal armed groups in eastern Congo;\n       (5) calls on all governments in the Great Lakes region of \n     Africa and those of the Southern African Development \n     Community to support a peaceful resolution to the crisis \n     while ensuring that the volatile situation does not spark a \n     wider regional war;\n       (6) supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-\n     General, his newly appointed United Nations Special Envoy, \n     former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo, and the \n     international facilitation team to bring all parties to the \n     negotiating table and establish a clear roadmap to implement \n     the signed peace agreements;\n       (7) encourages the international community to take \n     immediate measures to enhance the effectiveness of the United \n     Nations Mission in Congo to protect civilians, specifically \n     through increased troops and additional capabilities as \n     requested by the Secretary-General;\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\n       (8) urges the President to sustain high-level diplomatic \n     engagement together with the African Union, the European \n     Union, and the United Nations to avert a wider regional war \n     and revive a comprehensive peace process in eastern Congo;\n       (9) urges the United States and the international community \n     to develop and support monitoring and verification mechanisms \n     that can hold the parties in Congo accountable to the signed \n     peace agreements, investigate alleged ceasefire violations, \n     and ultimately challenge the continued culture of impunity in \n     Congo; and\n       (10) urges the President and the international community to \n     adopt measures to help the regional governments to identify \n     and ultimately address the factors underlying the conflict in \n     eastern Congo, especially weak governance and the \n     exploitation of the region's lucrative minerals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA IN 2008\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, with a view to receiving the advice and consent \nof the Senate to ratification, the Treaty between the Government of the \nUnited States of America and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda \nConcerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, \nsigned at Kigali on February 19, 2008. I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report prepared by the Department of \nState with respect to the Treaty.\n  This is the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) concluded between \nthe United States and a sub-Saharan African country since 1998. The \nTreaty will help to promote cross-border investment by providing legal \nprotections for investors of each country for their investments in the \nother country. The Treaty underscores the shared commitment of both \ncountries to open investment and trade policies.\n  Rwanda has opened its economy, improved its business climate, and \nembraced trade and investment as a means to boost economic development \nand help alleviate poverty. The U.S.-Rwanda BIT will reinforce these \nefforts.\n  The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy to secure protections \nfor U.S. investment abroad and to welcome foreign investment in the \nUnited States. Under this Treaty, the Parties agree to accord national \ntreatment and most-favored nation treatment to investments. They also \nagree to customary international law standards for expropriation and \nfor the minimum standard of treatment. The Treaty includes detailed \nprovisions regarding the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective \ncompensation in the event of expropriation; free transfer of funds \nrelated to investment; freedom of investment from specified performance \nrequirements; prohibitions on nationality based restrictions for the \nhiring of senior managers; and the opportunity for investors to resolve \ndisputes with a host government through international arbitration. The \nTreaty also\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\nincludes extensive transparency obligations with respect to national \nlaws and regulations and commitments to transparency in dispute \nsettlement. The Parties also recognize that it is inappropriate to \nencourage investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded \nin domestic environmental and labor laws.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, November 20, 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/20/senate-section/article/S10776-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
