Mr. President, I, of course, welcome everyone back for what \nwe hope to be a short period of time before Thanksgiving. We, of \ncourse, have completed this election. We still have three Senate \ncontests where we are waiting to get the results. One of them should be \ndecided in the next few days, the one in Alaska; the one in Georgia \nwill be decided on December 2; and the one in Minnesota will take, I am \ntold, a month or 6 weeks. In that race they have 3 million hand \nballots, and Minnesota is going to count every one of them. So that is \ngoing to take a while.\n  In the summer of 1858, a young State legislator from Illinois \naccepted his party's nomination for the Senate with a timeless speech \nthat echoed from coast to coast. That speech has been recited many \ntimes. He said:\n\n       ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.'' . . . I do \n     not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the \n     house to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.\n\n  That is what he said. One hundred fifty years later, a young Senator \nfrom the land of Lincoln stood on the very same steps on which Abraham \nLincoln stood to announce his pursuit of his party's nomination for \nPresident by calling upon our country to not just believe in his \nability to change Washington but to believe in what we can do together \nif we set aside what divides us and embrace a common purpose.\n  Over the past 21 months, Barack Obama has had a message of hope much \nlike Abraham Lincoln's which has spread across this country like a \ntidal\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\nwave. Two weeks ago tomorrow--it seems like a long time ago; it was \nless than 2 weeks ago, Mr. President--Americans waited on lines that \nstretched for blocks to answer Senator Obama's call to cast their vote \nfor change.\n  Yesterday, Barack Obama officially ended his term in the Senate and \ntraded up to a new title: President-elect of the United States. It has \nbeen a pleasure to get to know this fine young man and work with his \nremarkable intellect during his short tenure in the Senate. His \npresence in these Halls and on the Senate floor will be missed. But the \nSenate's loss is America's gain. I look forward to working with \nPresident-elect Obama, as we all do, as he concludes one chapter and \nbegins another in his life. But, as no one knows better than the \nPresident-elect, our joy in his election is tempered by a sober \nrealization of the challenges, great and grave, that lie ahead.\n  In the 6 weeks since we have been gone, our economic crisis has \ndeepened. We have seen numerous bankruptcies, hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands of jobs lost, consumer confidence plummet, and unemployment \ngo up to 6.5 percent. Major companies and some minor companies have \ngone bankrupt, such as Mrs. Fields cookies, one of my favorite places \nto go in a busy mall in Las Vegas--because nearly every mall you go to \nhas declared bankruptcy. That is only one example.\n  This morning we learned that Citigroup intends to cut an additional \n50,000 jobs. They have already cut 20,000. We are seeing a potential \nmeltdown in the auto industry, with consequences that could impact \ndirectly upon millions of American workers and cause further \ndevastation to our economy. If ever there were a time for working \ntogether, this is it. Senators have a choice to make. We can wait until \nJanuary when we have a new Congress and a new President or we can start \ntrying to work on some of these problems now. If we work together in \nthe coming days, perhaps we can begin delivering solutions for the \nAmerican people.\n  Today we will introduce a comprehensive economic stimulus plan worked \nout with the Appropriations, Finance, and Agriculture Committees. This \nlegislation will invest in infrastructure to create jobs, extend \nunemployment insurance for those who are out of work, provide food \nstamps to help those struggling families make ends meet, and provide \nState fiscal relief to prevent States from being forced to cut services \nand raise taxes. There are other things in it, and I need not go \nthrough all of that. It is a package of some $100 billion.\n  We also put in aid for the ailing U.S. auto industry. The Treasury \nDepartment has acknowledged they could provide the auto companies the \ntemporary assistance to keep automakers solvent by taking money out of \nthe $700 billion we have already provided to the Treasury Department. \nBut the Secretary of the Treasury said he chooses not to do that \nbecause all it would take is one stroke of a pen, and that problem \nwould be solved.\n  We also know that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has authority to \nprovide funds to the automobile industry, but thus far neither the \nTreasury Department nor the Federal Reserve has done so, and from what \nwe have heard, they have no intention of doing so in the near future. \nBut this week we can, Congress can, if we move forward, protect and \ncreate American jobs, help working families, and prevent our economy \nfrom falling even further into recession. In the event there is \nobjection to passing this important legislation, we will have an \nopportunity to vote on a second piece of legislation that consists \nsolely of unemployment insurance and relief for the auto industry and \nthe auto industry's workforce. So we have the big stimulus package. If \nwe can't get that, then we will move to the unemployment compensation \nextension together with the auto bailout.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to show the American people in the face of \ntremendous economic pain and uncertainty we will not have to wait until \nJanuary.\n  On another matter, Senator Bennett and I have made a decision that \nrather than move forward on the lands package, which is hundreds of \nbills that are so important to a lot of people, a lot of Senators, and \ncertainly a lot of people around the country, we are better off waiting \nuntil we come back in January. Senator Bennett and I believe we will \nhave more votes then. It will be easier to do it at that time.\n  But one of the first things we are going to do is, there will be a \nbipartisan piece of legislation introduced that will include all the \nstuff that has been held up these past 2 years, the so-called lands \nbills. That will be the first or second thing we do when we come back \nin January. We will move forward on that package by using rule XIV. I \nthink that serves everyone's interests. We have been told that if we \nbring it up today there would be a requirement to read that bill. It \nwould take more than 24 hours to do that. It is obvious that likely \nthere would not be the votes for that.\n  So, as I said, Senator Bennett and I believe that is the best way to \nproceed, and I am convinced that is right. I have spoken to other \npeople here who are very interested in this, Senator Salazar and others \nwho believe this was so important to get done, but I think discretion \nis the better part of valor and I alert everyone we will do this when \nwe get back.\n  So I look forward to this week. We have these bright new Senators \ncoming. In just a few minutes I will meet the new Senator from Idaho, \nwhom I have not met. I have heard such good things about him. He has a \nremarkable record. He served as a Governor of the State of Idaho and \nthen Lieutenant Governor of the State of Idaho and now is the new \nSenator replacing Senator Craig.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Johanns, the new \nSenator-elect from Nebraska. What an outstanding person he is. I am \nsure he will be a great addition to the Senate. And I have had an \nopportunity to meet some of the Democrats who are coming in.\n  I think this is an opportunity for us to become closer as a Senate \nfamily. I certainly hope we can do that. I hope we can look forward to \nworking together, not as partisans but as public servants, all devoted \nto delivering the change this country needs and these difficult times \ndemand.\n  For me personally, I think this is also a time not to look back. This \nhas been a very difficult 2 years that will end come January 1. The \nSenate was evenly divided. I mean, how much more evenly divided could \nit be, with Tim Johnson taking ill and the fact that he was not here, \nable to operate. So we had a Senate where we didn't have a majority. \nThere were other things that came up where we as the majority didn't \nhave a majority.\n  But there is no need to look back; we need to look forward. There \nwere reasons for everyone doing what they did. We can let the \nhistorians write about what took place in the past. Let's look forward \nto what we can talk about as a better future for our country. With the \nmargin coming in January not being as close as it has been, I want \neveryone within the sound of my voice to know that we don't know how \nthese three Senate races are going to come out. They are still counting \nthe votes. We don't know what our majority is going to be. But whatever \nit is, if it is what it now appears to be or we pick up one of the \nSenate seats or two of them or all of them or whatever it is, I make a \ncommitment to everyone that the only way we can succeed is by working \ntogether.\n  Everyone realizes the House of Representatives has different rules \nthan we have. They can push things through because they have a \nmajority. Perhaps we can push through some things because we have a \nmajority, but I don't want to do that. I want to pass things because it \nis good for the country and we do it on a bipartisan basis. We need to \nwork together.\n  We have Senators of goodwill who are willing to set aside their \npartisan differences and move forward. That is what we need to do. I \nhave said many times, if we are able to accomplish things here there is \ncredit to go around to every Senator. But if we continue to fail in our \naccomplishments, there is blame to go around for everyone.\n  I hope we all look forward to the coming year, one of hope and \nnecessity to change things because we obviously have a big hole, and we \nhave to try to find our way out of it. The best way to do that is to \nhave 100 people working in the same way.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10537-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I would like to congratulate \nPresident-elect Obama on his victory. It is a rare honor for the Senate \nto send one of its own to the White House. In fact, I think it has only \nhappened two other times, Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy, who \nwent directly from the Senate to the White House. Regardless of party, \nevery one of us, I am sure, feels a certain institutional pride in the \nevent.\n  I called the new President shortly after his victory to offer my \ncongratulations, and he was gracious in congratulating me on my own \nvictory when he returned the call. As it happened, when he returned the \ncall, I was grocery shopping in the local Kroger and enjoying the \npeople passing by saying ``Congratulations.''\n  There I was in front of the cereal talking to the new President on my \ncell phone. What I told him was we would all be here to work with him \nonce he takes office. I think both of us are eager to confront the \nchallenges ahead. I told him he can expect cooperation on the \nconfirmation of qualified nominees to key Cabinet posts. Faced with two \nwars overseas and a complex financial crisis at home, the American \npeople should not have to worry about a power vacuum at places such as \nthe Pentagon, the State Department, Treasury or the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Now, history offers a fairly clear path to success or failure for new \nPresidents. It is there for every new President who comes in to \nobserve. The path I have discussed with the President-elect is one that \ncan lead to success. As I see it, we face a simple choice: We can \neither work together to confront the big issues, the big issues of the \nday that neither party is willing to tackle on its own or the majority \ncan instead focus on narrow partisan issues that appeal to a tiny \nsliver of the populace but which lack the support of the American \nmainstream.\n  In my view, the choice is rather simple, but the work that follows \nwill not be. So I hope President-elect Obama will go after the big \nthings and go after them early. If he does, our chances of achieving a \npositive result for the American people will be greatly increased.\n  We can start with some of the things President-elect Obama spoke \nabout on the campaign trail, such as cutting spending, paying down the \nnational debt, providing speedy tax relief, committing to a long-term \nstrategy for energy independence, and reining in our out-of-control \nentitlement spending that threatens to consume 70 percent of the \nFederal budget in 9 years. Let me say that again: Our out-of-control \nentitlement spending will consume 70 percent of the Federal budget in 9 \nyears.\n  These are the challenges on which Senator Obama campaigned. They also \nhappen to be issues upon which Republicans and Democrats should be able \nto reach some agreement. The American people are looking to us to \nresolve these issues, and Senate Republicans are eager to get that work \ndone.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say through the Chair to my \ndistinguished counterpart, congratulations on your victory. As George \nWill, the esteemed columnist, wrote over the weekend, he compared your \nvictory to Henry Clay, and I know the Senator is from the State of \nKentucky. So I congratulate you on years of hard work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, Ohio is home to more than 1 million \nveterans, dedicated men and women who have served in every branch of \nour Nation's Armed Forces and every major conflict in the modern era. \nThey have served to keep our freedoms, so our Nation could remain \nsecure. Ohioans have a longstanding tradition of service to our \ncountry. Ohio's veterans include Presidents and generals, from Grant to \nSherman, and pioneers of American advancement, such as Neil Armstrong, \nJohn Glenn, and James Lovell.\n  But for every well-known American veteran, there are, of course, many \nmore heroes who have quietly served this Nation and my State of Ohio \nwith honor and distinction.\n  As our Nation looks forward to the return of our loved ones from the \nbattlefield, all of us remember the tremendous contributions our \nveterans have made to Ohio and to our country. We are humbled by their \npatriotism and their bravery.\n  On Veterans Day and every day, it is my honor to thank Ohio veterans \nand their families for their service to our great State and our great \nNation.\n  The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame was created in 1992 to recognize the \nlifetime contributions of veterans, not just those who serve their \ncountry in the Armed Forces but also those who continue to give back \nsince they left the service.

I am appreciative of \nthe work of my colleagues on that issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10538-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, when I think about the debate over \nextending unemployment insurance, some questions come to mind.\n  Does anyone in Congress want more American families to lose their \nhomes?\n  Does anyone in Congress want more American children to go to bed \nhungry?\n  Does anyone in the House or Senate want more American families to \nstop paying their heating bills, to delay their credit card payments, \nto skip out on their health care bills?\n  Does anybody in the House or Senate want consumer spending to slow \neven further, dragging our economy from recession to something even \nworse?\n  Assuming the answer to any of these questions is no, then voting to \nextend unemployment insurance for current job seekers should not be a \nfight, it should be a formality.\n  This Chamber approved a massive bailout of the financial industry, \nnot because investment bankers might have to forsake that second or \nthird Mercedes, not because Wall Street bonuses might drop from eight \nfigures to seven figures. We approved that bailout because when credit \nmarkets freeze, businesses cannot get working capital, and when \nbusinesses cannot get working capital, Americans lose jobs, and when \nAmericans lose jobs, their families suffer, their communities suffer, \nand our Nation suffers.\n  It all comes down to Main Street Americans who want to work, who want \nto pay their bills, who want to take care of their families; their \nwell-being is tied to the well-being of our economy and our Nation. \nUnemployment insurance is the mechanism by which Americans looking for \njobs but who have lost their jobs can sustain their families, can keep \ntheir financial commitments, can afford the tools needed to find a new \njob.\n  I have heard too many cases where people could not even fill their \ngas tanks to go out searching for jobs, particularly in rural northwest \nand rural southeast Ohio.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is key to getting the economy going. \nIt injects dollars into the economy and helps people meet their \nobligations, raise their kids, and do what they need to do in the \ncommunity. It is one of the most important and immediate ways to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Relief for financial institutions was intended to prevent massive job \nloss, to stabilize the economy, to stem foreclosures. Extending \nunemployment insurance is intended to promote job growth, to stabilize \nthe economy, and to stem foreclosures. It is the smart thing to do. It \nis the right thing to do. It holds one important advantage over the \nfinancial bailout. The people who benefit directly from an extension of \nunemployment compensation, from an extension of unemployment insurance, \nlive on Main Street, with not a single Wall Street CEO in sight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3685 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \ntwo issues relating to our current economic problems which are so \nwidespread in our country. One is the proposed economic aid to the \nautomobile manufacturers and the second is the proposed assistance to \npeople who are threatened with foreclosure.\n  The suggestion has been made that there should be very substantial \nFederal economic aid to the automobile manufacturers, focusing at the \nmoment on General Motors. I am prepared to consider that issue \nproviding we have a factual and evidentiary basis which would warrant \nsuch economic aid, with an analysis of the current financial situation \nof General Motors, with an analysis of what the proposals are to assist \nGeneral Motors in a way which would be realistically calculated to keep \nGeneral Motors in operation, and with an evidentiary base to show that \nthere is not some preferable alternative with respect to letting the \nmarket take its course.\n  It seems to me indispensable that if Congress is to undertake that \nkind of analysis that there is going to have to be regular order \nfollowed as to how we legislate in this body. And that was not done on \nthe recent $700 billion proposal which was passed by the Congress last \nmonth. Our regular order requires that there be a legislative proposal, \na bill written down which can be read, studied, and analyzed. After \nthere is a bill, to have hearings with the appropriate committee and to \nhear proponents of the plan and to hear opponents of the plan and then \nto have in regular order a committee markup where the members of the \ncommittee sit down--in this case the Banking Committee, which has \njurisdiction--look over the bill and then mark it up--that is goes over \nthe bill line by line. Then a report is written. The report comes to \nthe full membership, the Senate has debate, amendments may be offered, \nand then the Senate works its will on passing a bill, if the Senate \nchooses to do so.\n  A similar proceeding occurs in the House of Representatives, and then \nthere is a conference with Members of the two bodies coming together \nfor a presentation to the President, who then has ideas maybe involved \nin the legislative process, and he signs or vetoes.\n  Regrettably, that was not done during the passage of the $700 billion \neconomic aid proposal, and it was not done, I submit, much to the \ndisadvantage of the country. When this issue was under consideration, I \nwrote to the majority leader and the Republican leader by a letter \ndated September 21 urging that we not rush to judgment; saying that we \nought to follow regular order in the way we handle this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have inserted in the Record \na copy of this letter following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. On September 23, I wrote to Secretary of the Treasury \nPaulson and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke raising \nquite a number of issues looking to what the merits of the proposal \nwere. On September 27, I wrote again to Secretary Paulson, Chairman \nBernanke, also again to the leaders of the House and Senate, and also \nto the key members of the committee raising a series of questions. I \nhave yet to receive an answer to any of these letters.\n  On September 29, I was informed that we would have a session after \nthe House of Representatives defeated the proposal, which was a \nsurprise; that there would be a session on Wednesday, October 1, at \n7:30 in the evening, and the Senate was then confronted with a \nproposition to either take it or leave it. No amendments could be \noffered. By this time, the original proposal had expanded from 4 pages, \nwhich Secretary Paulson had initially submitted, and it had expanded to \nmore than 100 pages, then to more than 400 pages. It was unknown \ngenerally that there was a good bit in the legislative proposal of what \nwe refer to as grants or pork, which turned out to be very, very \nembarrassing. But faced with that kind of an emergency situation, my \nvote was cast in the affirmative.\n  The vote was 474 to 25, a very heavy margin in support of the \nlegislation, and it was a rush to judgment, without following regular \norder and without considering so many of the critical issues which \nshould have been taken up in the regular course of Senate business.\n  I traveled my State during the course of the month of October, as it \nis my custom to touch each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties each year, and \nthe number one item on the agenda was the $700 billion economic aid \nprogram. And candidly, the temperature of my constituents was boiling--\n212 degrees Fahrenheit--and the thermometer was broken. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, nodding in the \naffirmative that that was the situation in her State as well. Now we \nare asked to have economic aid for General Motors. There has been a \nfigure of some $25 billion which is talked about. I am prepared to \nconsider that, but only if there is an understanding of what are the \nfacts, what is the evidence; is there a factual and evidentiary base \nfor Congress to do this?\n  I am told informally that it takes $11 to $14 billion in cash to \noperate General Motors.\n  But they now have $16.2 billion. They have $50 billion in bonds that \nare perhaps worth in the range of $20 billion or a little more in the \nmarket that yield 9 percent in interest. On the market value, that \nwould put their borrowing somewhere over 20 percent. The question comes \nto my mind: Isn't that expensive? Couldn't that be modified? But I have \nyet to see any semblance of a plan for General Motors to become viable. \nWhat are the prospects?\n  General Motors and the automobile industry generally--the industry \nhas been on notice for a long time that they were in a very difficult \ncompetitive situation; that the standards on gas mileage were about to \nbe imposed and were imposed in legislation last year. What have they \ndone?\n  We have been told it is not advisable to consider chapter 11 \nproceedings under bankruptcy. But we know that Continental and U.S. Air \nhave gone through that.\n  We are told that the warranties would not be sustainable and that \npeople would lose confidence. There may be ways to address that kind of \nissue with a fund set up for warranties to be funded.\n  All of these are questions which, it seems to me, need to be \nanswered. When we were informed through a variety of sources that we \nwould be in a lame duck session starting today, there was a projection \nfor a Senate vote on Wednesday. I wrote to Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell, a letter very similar to the one I wrote on September 21, \nurging that we not rush to judgment and asking that there be \nconsideration of a great many of these issues if we were to make some \nsensible determination as to financial aid to the automobile industry. \nI sent copies of this letter, again, to Treasury Secretary Paulson and \nto Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and also to the chief executive \nofficers of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of these letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2008.\n     Henry M. Paulson, Jr.,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Department of the Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Ben S. Bernanke,\n     Chairman of the Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke: I write to \n     you because I am in the process of deciding how to vote on \n     legislation to deal with the economic crisis. I agree that \n     there is need for federal action; but I am concerned that we \n     not rush to judgment without giving sufficient attention to \n     the many complex issues which are involved.\n       At the outset, the, or a, precipitating cause was the fact \n     that hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps as many as five \n     million, faced an inability to make their mortgage payments \n     and eviction from their homes. These mortgages were \n     ``securitized,''\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\n     divided up and sold in packages to many people or entities. \n     As a result, it was not always clear who had the authority to \n     adjust these mortgages, and when it was clear, adjustments \n     were not made quickly enough. Last November, Senator Durbin \n     introduced S. 2136 and I introduced S. 2133 to give the \n     bankruptcy courts authority to revise homeowners' financial \n     obligations. Keeping people in their homes should be a, if \n     not the, fundamental object of congressional action.\n       After assisting homeowners, a decision should then be made \n     as to what additional federal aid is necessary to unclog the \n     lending pipelines and restore confidence and stabilize the \n     economy. I am very skeptical about granting authority to \n     spend $700 billion on other aid without standards as to who \n     should get the funds and a requirement that there be \n     demonstrated necessity that such additional expenditures are \n     indispensable to stabilizing the economy.\n       Then there is the question of oversight and regulation. \n     Obviously, there must be oversight and some regulation to \n     prevent a recurrence. As I see it, the regulation must be \n     calibrated to those objectives and not go too far. Vigorous \n     enforcement of our laws to prevent market manipulation, as \n     well as added transparency, should be a priority.\n       I hear tremendous resentment from my constituents on this \n     matter. In a free enterprise society, entrepreneurs may \n     undertake whatever risks they choose to secure big profits, \n     but when there are losses, they should not turn to the \n     government for a bailout which puts the burden on the \n     taxpayers. The firms/corporations and their executives who \n     created the crisis should not profit from a federal bailout. \n     If it is not already a part of your proposal, you should \n     consider structuring the funding in a way that gives the \n     Government a preferred creditor position and a share in \n     ultimate profits, rather than simply buying up debt which has \n     declined in value. And any aid should be conditioned on the \n     elimination of golden parachutes or large compensation \n     packages.\n       Also, I am concerned about reports that foreign \n     corporations, with a United States affiliate, will \n     participate in a federal bailout. If foreign corporations are \n     to get funding, then foreign governments ought to bear their \n     fair share.\n       I know there is concern that Congress must act promptly or \n     the economy may deteriorate further. It seems to me that Wall \n     Street should and would understand that legislation on this \n     complex matter requires some time. If it is seen that \n     Congress is moving as swiftly as practicable, that ought to \n     stem the tide. But we can only do it as fast as realistic to \n     work through the legislative proposals and resolve these \n     intricate issues.\n       These are issues which come to my mind at the moment and I \n     am sure there will be more as the hearings progress and the \n     debate occurs. I would appreciate your responses as promptly \n     as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, November, 14, 2008.\n     Hon. Henry Paulson,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ben Bernanke,\n     Chairman, Federal Reserve Board.\n       Gentlemen: With this letter, I am enclosing a copy of a \n     letter which I am sending today to Senate Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\n       I would appreciate your views on the issues which I have \n     raised in that letter. By letter dated September 23, 2008, I \n     wrote to the two of you asking questions about the September \n     bailout proposal and have never received an answer.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Harry and Mitch: In considering what action, if any, \n     to take on financial aid to General Motors and the other auto \n     manufacturers, I urge that the Senate follow regular order \n     and not rush to judgment.\n       By letter dated September 21, 2008 I wrote to you two \n     leaders with the same recommendation on following regular \n     order on the bailout plan then under consideration, and then \n     Congress proceeded to act precipitously without appropriate \n     consideration for all the complex issues involved. It is true \n     that the Senate was faced with an emergency situation on \n     October 1st when the Dow had plunged 777 points after the \n     House of Representatives rejected the proposed legislation on \n     September 29th. Senators were then faced with voting yes or \n     no without having the customary hearings, committee markup, \n     floor debate and an opportunity to offer amendments. As a \n     result, the legislation was filled with pork since no one had \n     an opportunity to strike it and the Congress endorsed a plan \n     which had not been given appropriate consideration.\n       There are many complex questions which need to be answered \n     before the Senate can even begin to make a preliminary \n     assessment on aid to the auto manufacturers. We need to know \n     the specifics on General Motors' financial situation. It is \n     reported that GM has sufficient cash to keep it afloat for a \n     substantial period of time so that immediate financial aid is \n     not indispensable.\n       It has been further reported that General Motors has \n     sufficient cash and liquidity to continue to operate if it \n     was not for the servicing of the debt estimated to be about \n     $50 billion. That debt is said to have a market value perhaps \n     as low as $20 billion and currently calls for an interest \n     rate of 9% annually so that General Motors is paying well \n     over 20% on the realistic value of the bonds. Some \n     readjustment on that debt and interest might alter \n     significantly General Motors' need for federal aid.\n       We further need to know what are the realistic prospects \n     that financial aid will solve the problem without having GM \n     and the other automakers come back for more. The automakers \n     have certainly had sufficient notice for years, if not \n     decades, that they had to make major changes to become \n     competitive and yet failed to do so. It was well known that \n     at some point Congress would mandate mileage standards but \n     the automakers did not act aggressively until faced with a \n     congressional mandate. We have now approved $25 billion in \n     federal aid to assist in meeting mileage standards. Why \n     couldn't there be a change in legislation to allow those \n     funds to be made available faster and to broaden their use \n     beyond retooling factories? It would be preferable from the \n     taxpayer point of view to utilize funding already available \n     in a more efficient manner, rather than devoting additional \n     resources to this industry.\n       Beyond these surface questions, there needs to be a great \n     deal of analysis through the hearing process of many other \n     complex questions.\n       If the federal government had not bailed out Bear Stearns, \n     AIG and passed the $700 billion bailout, the auto-makers \n     might not now be asking for the same treatment. If the auto-\n     makers are bailed out, it is a virtual certainty that \n     Congress will next hear bailout requests from other sections \n     of the economy. Insufficient consideration by the Treasury \n     Department and the Federal Reserve followed by the rush to \n     judgment by Congress on the $700 billion has left my \n     constituents perplexed about the competency of the federal \n     government to respond rationally to the current problems. In \n     a series of town meetings in October, I found the temperature \n     of my constituents at 212 degrees Fahrenheit over the $700 \n     billion bailout legislation. In extensive discussions with \n     economists, bankers and other financial experts, I have heard \n     a virtually unanimous adverse reaction to bailing out General \n     Motors and/or other automakers. My constituents are \n     frustrated with the lack of transparency in doling out the \n     $700 billion and the change of course from purchasing \n     ``troubled assets'' to one of injecting funds directly into \n     banks. What assurances would we have that these funds for the \n     auto industry would be spent wisely, and as intended by \n     Congress? Isn't it wiser to let the market make those \n     decisions?\n       I will be looking for answers to these and other questions \n     when the Senate returns for the lame duck session next week. \n     I voted for the bailout on October 1st because of the ominous \n     prospect of a domino effect and its severe impact on our \n     economy. I am prepared to give fair consideration to economic \n     aid to General Motors and other automobile manufacturers \n     because of the national interest including the many jobs at \n     stake in Pennsylvania; but I am not prepared to vote for \n     another massive bailout unless a solid case is made following \n     regular Senate order with hearings, committee mark-up, floor \n     debate and an opportunity to offer amendments.\n       I am sending a copy of this letter to Treasury Secretary \n     Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke. When the \n     September bailout was under consideration, I wrote to Mr. \n     Paulson and Mr. Bernanke by letter dated September 23, 2008 \n     raising a number of questions. I have yet to receive an \n     answer to that letter. I would like the views of Mr. Paulson \n     and Mr. Bernanke on the issues raised in this letter.\n       I am also sending copies of this letter to General Motors \n     Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner, Ford President and CEO Alan \n     Mulally, and Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli with \n     the request that they give me their views on the issues \n     raised in this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Chair has been asked to note \nthat the Senate is in a period of morning business, with comments \nlimited to 10 minutes. The Senator from Pennsylvania has spoken for 11 \nminutes and the senior Senator from Maryland is on the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me these are key questions which need to \nbe answered. The automobile industry obviously is of enormous \nimportance in our country. Not to have the automobile industry would \nhave very severe economic consequences. But we do have to have answers \nto these questions in regular order. We need to take these matters up \nso we can cast an intelligent\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\nvote on this kind of economic aid. The question I would supplement is--\nI heard it from my constituents--Who is next? Bear Stearns was given \neconomic aid, Lehman Brothers was not, and perhaps that was a mistake--\nperhaps not. AIG was given considerable economic aid. Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac were given considerable economic aid. If we are to make an \nintelligent decision, we are going to have to take a look at these \nimportant questions.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2008.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Harry and Mitch: As you project the Senate's schedule, \n     I urge that we not rush to judgment and take whatever time is \n     necessary on any proposed legislation to deal with the \n     nation's economic problems. The public, our constituents, \n     have a great deal of skepticism, which I share, about \n     legislation which will let Wall Street ``off the hook'' and \n     pay insufficient attention to Main Street, middle class \n     Americans.\n       It is important to focus the legislation on the hundreds of \n     thousands of homeowners who are at risk of losing their \n     residences to foreclosure.\n       In deciding what additional powers to give to the federal \n     regulators, I believe we should give careful consideration to \n     not extending those powers beyond the current crisis and take \n     steps to prevent a recurrence.\n       I have read reports that some Wall Street firms, whose \n     conduct has created the crisis, will benefit from a \n     congressional legislative fix. We should do our utmost to see \n     to it that those responsible for the crisis bear the maximum \n     financial burden on any bailout in order to minimize the \n     taxpayers' exposure.\n       There are reports that the bailout might be extended to \n     foreign firms with United States affiliates. In my view, the \n     legislation must be carefully tailored for United States' \n     interests and if foreign firms, even if United States \n     affiliates are to be involved, then consideration should \n     given to appropriate contributions from those foreign \n     governments.\n       I realize there is considerable pressure for the Congress \n     to adjourn by the end of next week, but I think we must take \n     the necessary time to conduct hearings, analyze the \n     Administration's proposed legislation, and demonstrate to the \n     American people that any response is thoughtful, thoroughly \n     considered and appropriate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 3686 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski and Mr. Bond pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3684 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10541-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10541-S10542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL LOAN TO THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, later this week the Senate is \ngoing to consider this question that befalls our American automobile \nindustry and the question of whether to extend assistance to the \nAmerican automobile industry and its workforce. What we are going to \ndo--either this week or whether it is postponed into January--is going \nto determine the future of a key manufacturing sector and millions of \nAmerican jobs.\n  Some of our colleagues have said we should not interfere with the \nfree market, that we should allow businesses that have acted \nirresponsibly to fail and to be replaced by more efficient competitors. \nI must say I have some sympathy for that view. For too long, our U.S. \ndomestic automakers have sailed against the winds of change and have \nfailed to produce vehicles for the 21st century--for that matter, for \nthe last half of the 20th century.\n  This is not the first time this Senator from Florida has faced this \nissue, for, as a young Congressman years ago, we had a similar issue \nfacing us with the bailout of the Chrysler Corporation. I voted for \nthat bailout, which included some $4 billion. In retrospect, that was \nthe right decision because Chrysler did reinvent itself. But the \ncircumstances were different because Chrysler had at its helm a man who \nwe believed would go in and reform Chrysler, and that was Lee Iacocca. \nAs I look across the landscape of the American automobile industry, I \nam wondering, where are the Lee Iacoccas? We do not see them.\n  It is this Senator's judgment that there should be no bailout of the \nAmerican automobile industry. There should not be a reward for poor \nmanagement. But because of the American jobs at risk, because of \nAmerican manufacturing at risk, I support a Federal loan with serious \nrestrictions.\n  I want to discuss some of those restrictions. I come to this position \nhaving fought tooth and nail against the automobile companies when they \ndragged their feet on implementing responsible fuel economy standards. \nThey insisted, sometimes with crocodile tears, they could not meet \nthose miles-per-gallon requirements, and: Oh, by the way, let the \nconsumers decide. Those automobile makers are now coming to us asking \nfor our assistance.\n  But that is not the full picture. As the President-elect has said, a \nfailure of the American auto industry would be disastrous not just for \nmany Americans who work for the industry but for the entire economy \nbecause those jobs ripple with the multiplier effect through the \neconomy. So whether you are considering assembly plants or suppliers or \ndealerships, we would face significant layoffs in all 50 States. It \nwould push us further and further into an economic hole. We simply \ncannot let that happen, but we cannot allow a bailout. It has to be a \nFederal loan with a workout, and that is a financial term to \nrestructure how a company can get out of its economic problems. We need \nto bring all of the stakeholders to the table--management, labor, \nlenders, suppliers--to figure out how to revitalize the American auto \nindustry to make it competitive in the future while saving those good \nAmerican jobs.\n  So this Senator's conclusion is that any Federal assistance we \nprovide for the American auto industry is going to have to include \nthese conditions.\n  First, we must insist that the automakers increase average miles per \ngallon to 40 miles per gallon in 10 years and to 50 miles per gallon by \n2020. Why do I say this? There are cars, fleets in Japan, that are \nalready driving at 50 miles per gallon. In Europe, the cars are being \ndriven at 40 miles per gallon. We are talking about 12 years in the \nfuture to achieve this. Technically, it can be done if we but have the \nwill.\n  Look, in the 8 years this Senator has been in the Senate, every year \nwe have gotten beaten by the U.S. automakers as we have tried to \nincrease the miles per gallon in the fleet average. They beat us one \nway or another, and they would always say: Let the consumer decide--all \nalong while the foreign automobile makers were getting prepared to eat \ntheir lunch. As their lunch was being eaten, year by year, they \ncontinued to still fight us on the miles-per-gallon standards. Finally, \nwe had a little victory, just a year ago, that was conditioned upon \ngiving them--giving them--$25 billion in return for them agreeing they \nwould move to 35 miles per gallon but not until the year 2020. We have \nto stop this kind of foot-dragging that has gotten them to the place \nthey are now. So for any Federal assistance in the form of a loan we \nmust insist they increase their miles per gallon.\n  Second, the automakers must increase the production of flex-fuel, \nelectric, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Prices of gasoline at the pump \nhave obviously fallen in recent weeks, but they are not going to stay \nlow forever, and that is another whole subject. As soon as all the \nspeculators start getting back into the oil futures contracts market \nagain--which have been deregulated, so there is no regulation on the \nspeculators--they will run the price right back up. Remember, the price \nof a barrel of oil is down in the range of $50 or\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\n$60 now. It went all the way to $147 a barrel. When the world economy \nstarted getting into trouble and they needed cash, they started bailing \nout of those futures accounts, so that brought the price of a barrel of \noil down. While sure as shootin', if we do not impose some regulations \non the commodity futures trading market, those speculators are going to \ntake over in the future, the price of oil is going to go back up, and \nthe price at the pump--which I just filled up my car for $2.12 a gallon \nback in Orlando, FL--is going to go back up.\n  We need to end our dangerous addiction to oil, and we need to find \nnew and renewable sources of energy. American automobile makers ought \nto be leading the way instead of the opposite of what has happened over \nthe last three decades.\n  Third, we must place limits on executive compensation and eliminate \nthe executives' golden parachutes. Taxpayer money should not be used to \nreward individual executives until the taxpayers have been repaid.\n  Let me divert from the automobile industry for a minute. There is a \nsimilarity about executive compensation and golden parachutes and what \nwe have done with the big economic bailout of Wall Street, which this \nSenator voted against. Well, lo and behold, over the course of the \nweekend, I happened to be talking to a major bank CEO. This banker told \nme his bank is in good shape; he doesn't need any of the bailout money. \nBut because some of his competitors are in bad financial shape and need \nthe money and are taking it from the Secretary of the Treasury, he \nneeds to take it, too, because they would be at a competitive \ndisadvantage against the ones that are hurting that need to take the \nmoney. He says: We don't want to take it, but we don't want to be at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. Because of that, whenever they do take it--\nremember, there are supposed to be some rules in there on executive \ncompensation and golden parachutes. This CEO is retiring before the \nmoney comes in, so the bank still pays out the huge compensation. What \nwe are dealing with, with the Wall Street $700 billion bailout, has to \napply to automakers as well. We should not reward those executives \nuntil the taxpayers have been repaid.\n  Fourth, the automakers should not pay dividends to shareholders until \nthey have returned to financial health. It is a simple, straightforward \ncondition on us giving them taxpayer money in order to get them back to \nfinancial health.\n  Fifth, I wish I didn't have to say this, but there are no Lee \nIacoccas now. The current senior management should be replaced. We need \nnew leadership. We need fresh thinking. We need new people, new eyes, \nnew ears to steer us out of this mess. We cannot reward those leaders \nwhose poor decisions and poor judgment and sometimes selfishness got us \nto where we are now.\n  We are going to face difficult choices. There are going to be tough \ntimes. Again, to quote a phrase from the President-elect: We need to \nact with all deliberate haste but with an emphasis on deliberate. We \ncannot simply provide our automakers with enough cash to continue their \ncurrent operations for another 3 months or even another 6. We must \ninstead put them on a path that leads to global competitiveness.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10542-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10542-S10544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think it is obvious to all Americans \nthat we face a very severe and difficult financial crisis. We have had \nan election. The American people have voted for change. We now face \nsignificant challenges. I was thinking, as I was walking over to the \nfloor of the Senate, about a visit I had recently at a nursing home in \nNorth Dakota.\n  This financial crisis is probably the most significant financial \ncrisis since the Great Depression. We don't know where this will go. We \ndon't know how many will ultimately be unemployed. We don't know how \nlong it will last. This is a recession. We hope it is not \nextraordinarily deep. We hope we can find the menu to overcome it and \nthe kinds of policies to try to make certain we move from this position \nto a position of economic strength and economic growth, once again.\n  But I went to a nursing home in North Dakota because North Dakota's \noldest citizen was there. She had a birthday. She is a 110-year-old \nwoman; very lucid, very conversational. We talked about the Great \nDepression, as a matter of fact. We talked about the tough times in her \nlife. She was born in 1898. By the way, her niece was there at the \nnursing home who had put on a birthday party for her in August. Her \nniece is 103 years old and her son, who is still farming, is 80 years \nold.\n  I had a chance to talk to them all about what life was like from 1898 \nto 2008. One of the significant things she remembered was the \ndifficulty of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when it was hard to \nfind jobs and people had soup lines in the major cities and people were \nstruggling to try to make ends meet.\n  Well, I think a lot of folks from the 1930s forward felt we would \nnever again see these days because we put in place economic stabilizers \nand we put in place provisions in law that prohibited the kind of \nactivities in the roaring 1920s that led us to the 1930s and the \nexcess, the unbelievable debt, the greed that resulted in the economic \ncollapse of the 1930s. So we put in place things such as the Glass-\nSteagall Act and other provisions that prevented banks from being \nengaged in real estate and securities and things that were inherently \nrisky that caused major problems and collapse in the 1930s.\n  It is easy to forget lessons. The Congress over the years, Presidents \nover the years, and certainly the financial services industry moved \nahead. I harken back to 1999, when something called the Financial \nModernization Act was passed by the Congress. I said then it was a \nterrible thing to have done. It stripped apart the Glass-Steagall Act \nand essentially said you can create big bank holding companies, you can \nput firewalls in, you can merge real estate and securities with \nbanking; it will all be fine. That was in 1999.\n  In fact, here is what I said during that debate on the floor of the \nSenate: I say, to people who own banks, if you want to gamble, go to \nLas Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God bless you. Do it \nwith your own money. Don't do it through deposits that are guaranteed \nby the American people.\n  When we passed the Financial Modernization Act--and I was one of \neight Senators to vote no, I said this during debate: The bill will, in \nmy judgment, raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts. \nIt will fuel the consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial \nservices industry at the expense of customers, farm businesses, and \nothers.\n  I regret I was right. Massive taxpayer bailouts. It didn't take quite \na decade. It took 9 years. Now we see the largest proposed bailouts in \nthe history of our country.\n  It was a time of self-regulation. Alan Greenspan, the head of the \nFederal Reserve Board, said the financial services industry will \nregulate itself. Well, not quite. Here is what Alan Greenspan said last \nmonth:\n\n       I made a mistake in presuming that self interests of \n     organizations, specifically banks and others, were best \n     capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity \n     in the firms.\n\n  What an unbelievable mistake. Regulators that were willfully blind \nsaying: You know what. We will pass the Financial Modernization Act \nallowing real estate, securities, and banking to come back together, \nforgetting the lessons of the Great Depression. Then, those who were \nhired to regulate decided self-regulation will work. We don't have to \nregulate. We will be willfully blind. So what happened? Well, the \nsubprime loan scandal happened. The subprime loan scandal, of course, \nis at the root of this because it is most evident of the greed that \nexists in our economy in recent years. It resulted in bad mortgages \nspread all around this country and around the world. They were put into \nsecurities and sold up\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nthrough banks into hedge funds, into investment banks, and then all of \na sudden it all turned sour.\n  Here is what the subprime loan scandal is all about. The biggest \nmortgage bank in America, just to show you what they were saying: Do \nyou have less than perfect credit?\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? If you have been denied by other lenders, \n     well, call us.\n\n  It is a new business model, apparently.\n\n       Are you a bad credit risk? Call us.\n\n  Countrywide said that. The CEO of Countrywide was given the Horatio \nAlger award--until it all collapsed.\n  Millennium Mortgage said:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payments. That's right, we'll \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     us in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program \n     will reduce your current monthly payment by 50 percent and \n     allow you no payments for the first 12 months.\n\n  Zoom Credit, another mortgage company, said this:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--\n     who cares?\n\n  That is the bottomless pit of greed that resulted in massive numbers \nof mortgages being put out there in this country. Then the brokers were \nmaking an enormous amount of money. The mortgage bankers were making \nmoney and business fees, and then they securitized it, like they put \nsawdust in sausage in the old days--good loans and bad loans. They \nwrapped them into securities and chopped them up and sold them \nupstream. By the way, what they did, when they locked people into that \nkind of credit, those loans, they put in resets of higher interest \nrates in 3 years, where they would have known the homeowner wasn't \ngoing to be able to pay the monthly mortgage, and they put in \nprepayment penalties so they could not pay it off if they wanted to. \nThat is how they made these attractive investments with high rates of \nreturn.\n  So the subprime loan scandal made everybody rich, like hogs in a \ntrough grunting and shoving and making lots of money. Then one day it \ncollapsed like a house of cards. The hedge funds that were investing in \nthese--the credit default swaps that surrounded them with massive \namounts of leverage, it all collapsed. When you create a house of \ncards, it is destined to collapse.\n  I mentioned hedge funds. Some of you may have seen the hearing held \nin the House a few days ago. The highest income earner in the hedge \nfund industry last year earned $3.7 billion.\n  So we create this crisis, get rid of the protections that existed \nfrom the Great Depression, abolish Glass-Steagall, and create a \nFinancial Modernization Act, and say everything will be great. Then the \nregulators turn into willfully blind public servants, and the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve says let them regulate themselves, and it all \nturns sour and the house of cards collapses.\n  What is happening now is, the Treasury Secretary came to the Congress \nand said: We face very serious problems. I must have $700 billion in 3 \ndays and, if not, I believe there is going to be a financial \ncatastrophe of sorts. So the Congress didn't do it in 3 days, or with a \nthree-page bill, as the Treasury Secretary suggested. But the Congress \npassed a $700 billion bailout proposal. The Treasury Secretary said he \nwanted to do that because he wanted to purchase toxic assets from the \nbalance sheets of the firms that invested in all of this. So he got the \n$700 billion. Then he said: I have changed my mind. That is not what I \nam going to do with the $700 billion. I want to purchase capital from \nbanks to extend their credit or lending opportunities because the \ncredit markets are frozen. He took $125 billion of the $700 billion and \ngave it to nine banks, some of whom didn't want it. But he gave it to \nthem with no strings attached, no requirement that they expand lending \nor not use it to pay substantial bonuses. We have seen examples of \nbonuses, with $33 billion in bonuses on Wall Street in 1 year. So no-\nstrings-attached money was given to nine banks with no requirement to \nexpand lending, no requirement to cut back on dividends, and no \nrequirement that they not provide hefty bonuses.\n  So the question is, is that going to inspire confidence out there \nsomeplace? Now we discover there has been no expansion of credit as a \nresult of $125 billion of taxpayer money being put into those nine \nbanks because it was no strings attached.\n  So the next piece that occurs is unemployment. We hear constantly--\nnearly 24 hours a day--about the financial sector. I agree the \nfinancial sector is unbelievably important to an economy such as ours, \nno question about that. How about the manufacturing sector, the working \nfolks? Is that important?\n  About a week ago there was almost an apoplectic seizure over the \nnotion that consumption was down. Consumers weren't consuming. It is \nnot a surprise when there are more people out of work and people have \nless money that they are going to consume less. Does it concern anybody \nout there as they listen to Mr. Paulson say the $700 billion that \nCongress gave him is destined only to be used for the financial \nindustry? Does it concern anybody out there that the consumers losing \ntheir jobs are not going to be able to consume? That is part of this \neconomy as well.\n  Here is what we see on unemployment. The U.S. employment ranks have \nshrunk by 1.2 million in the first 10 months of this year--more than \nhalf of those jobs lost in the past 3 months alone. Last month, 240,000 \njobs gone. About 800,000 workers exhausted their extended unemployment \nbenefits, and more than 350,000 will exhaust theirs in November and \nDecember.\n  This chart shows what is happening in the industry in 2008. \nManufacturing, down nearly a half million jobs. Construction, nearly \n400,000 jobs. Business services, 361,000 jobs gone, vanished. These are \nhundreds of thousands. Behind every one is somebody coming home at \nnight to his or her family and saying: Honey, I have lost my job. I \ndon't know why. I did a good job. I worked there for 10 years, but I \nwas told the job doesn't exist anymore.\n  This is about heartache by a lot of families. We experienced this \nbefore. Will Rogers, one of the interesting commentators on American \nlife in the Great Depression, said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  I wanted to visit a moment about these issues and ask the question, \nis there going to be a laser-like focus on working people just as there \nhas been on the financial services sector? There are a good many in the \nfinancial services sector that caused this wreck. They are the ones who \nsteered this country into the ditch with all kinds of financial \nengineering and exotic new products that turned out to create a house \nof cards.\n  It seems to me that one of the things we ought to look at is creating \nprotection with respect to these new exotic financial products that \nturned out to be enormously risky and dangerous to our economy. Some \nhave talked about creating a financial products safety commission. We \nhave a Consumer Product Safety Commission to worry about unsafe \nproducts. That turned out to have been a commission without much teeth \nbecause of the person who currently runs it. Perhaps we can have a \nfinancial products safety commission that would take a look at \nderivatives, credit default swaps, and the kind of sophisticated \nengineering going on on Wall Street which might produce a lot of money \nfor some in the short term but pose a great deal of danger for this \neconomy in the intermediate and long term. That all makes a lot of \nsense.\n  I just described the Treasury Secretary talking about the $700 \nbillion he has now been provided, and that it is going to go to the \nfinancial service industry exclusively, he says. So it is not available \nto those who might be creating jobs out there or trying to avoid losing \njobs. At the same time, the Treasury Secretary is saying: I have this \npot of money, and we are going to use it to try to unfreeze the credit \nmarkets. The Treasury Department is saying they favor new bank mergers, \nwhich is exactly the last thing this country needs. We already have big \nbanks that are too big to fail, which means if they are set to fail, we \nhave to rescue them. Now the Treasury Department says the solution is \nbigger banks; let's have more mergers.\n\n  It is unbelievable to me that the Treasury Department would not have\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nlearned a lesson. Instead, they are out there promoting more mergers. I \nguess those mergers will be promoted with the very money appropriated \nby the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the action we have to take now, it seems to me, is to \ntry to find ways to establish some confidence in this country. I have \nsaid often that I used to teach a bit of economics in college, briefly. \nI was able to overcome it. Economics is not a science; it is psychology \npumped up with helium, and you can call yourself an economist, but \nnobody really knows.\n  The economy in this country is not about dials, gauges, knobs, \nlevers, and all of the things like investment tax credit, depreciation, \nM-1B, and all those things economists study. It is about confidence. \nWhen people are confident in the future, they do things that manifest \nthat confidence. They buy a car, buy a new suit of clothes, take a \ntrip, or maybe buy a house. They do the things that you do when you are \nconfident about your future and your job. That is called economic \nexpansion. It is not sophisticated. It is about how people view the \nfuture.\n  When they view the future with great alarm and less confidence, they \ndo exactly the opposite. They defer the purchase or decide not to buy \nthat suit of clothes or buy that car until next year, or we will not \nmove into that other home or take that trip. That is the way an economy \ncontracts. It is all about confidence.\n  The question is, what can provide that confidence now? One of the \nconcerns I had about the original bailout was that it did nothing to \nprovide a set of regulations that stops the very behavior that caused \nall of this. You have to learn from it. It seems to me you have to \nprovide the regulation and say to the American people that we will not \nlet this happen ever again.\n  So there are a number of things we have to do. Any recovery plan--and \nI think we need a recovery plan, and some call it a stimulus. I think \nwe need a recovery plan that gives people a sense that we care about \nwhether they have a job. For example, there is discussion about the \nautomobile industry. I don't view this as three companies or one \nindustry. I view it in the context of what do we do to deal with this \neconomy, especially as it relates to jobs. We are told that industry \nrelates to about 3 million to 5 million jobs. That is the connector all \nthe way through the industry. If that is the case, what would it mean \nif 3 million to 5 million jobs are lost in the next few months, coming \nfrom America's manufacturing base? It seems to me it would be \ndevastating to an economy already at great risk.\n  So the question is, when will we also ask whether we will be willing \nto support, through a recovery program, the kinds of jobs that we need \nin this country and willing to support a world-class manufacturing base \nwithout seeing that base decimated as the economy gets weaker? I don't \nthink you will long remain a world economic power unless you have \nworld-class manufacturing capabilities.\n  When we look at those sectors of the economy that have that \ncapability and then decide, as some suggest, that it doesn't matter who \nloses their job or gets laid off, well, it sure does matter. It matters \nto me. If there is all this concern about the financial sector, what \nabout the concern about the job-creating sector in the manufacturing \narea? I think we need to do a number of things. No. 1, I think we need \na stimulus or a recovery plan that would make significant investments. \nI don't think you do that by just giving people checks. That is not the \nway forward, in my judgment. I think you do it by putting people to \nwork on public works projects, by investing in roads, bridges, schools, \nand libraries--the infrastructure needs that have been so long deferred \nin this country.\n  All of those projects are ready across this country to be done. It \nwill put people back to work, and give people confidence about the \nfuture.\n  Second, we ought to take action this week so that we say to the \nTreasury Secretary: If you are going to continue to move money out of \nthat $700 billion pot, you have to put conditions on it. We don't want \nthe American people to have to read that they are anteing up money so \nthe Treasury Secretary can move it to Wall Street and Wall Street can \nthen pay bonuses in December and January and they can use that in any \nway they want without conditions that require them to expand lending or \nany other conditions that ought to be attached to that money. We ought \nto insist those conditions exist.\n  Third, we ought to require regulations be put in place as soon as \npossible to prevent the kind of things that we have seen happen that \ncaused this financial wreck in the first place. Those regulations do \nnot now exist. I know the former Fed Chairman Greenspan said he \nbelieved in self-regulation. He sure got a bellyful of self-regulation, \nand it completely collapsed this economy. We need to put in place a \nregulatory approach that gives people confidence that this kind of \nthing is not going to happen again.\n  We also ought to say to the Treasury Department: Stop the nonsense \nabout more bank mergers. It is the last thing we need. Nor should we \nwant the public money to be used to accommodate more bank mergers. I \nknow some have celebrated the news of bank mergers. Not me. I think it \nweakens this country, not strengthen it.\n  I also believe we ought to create immediately an investigative task \nforce of sorts that will begin to investigate and prosecute, if \nnecessary, criminal behavior that was engaged in some of the practices \nthat I described earlier.\n  All of that, I think, is necessary. I believe if and when we begin \ndoing those kinds of things, we will give, once again, the American \npeople the confidence about the future that they must have in order for \nthis economy to get back on track.\n  There is, I know, a lot of discussion about what went wrong, and some \nmight say: You know what, that is pretty irrelevant. It is not \nirrelevant at all. We are destined to repeat mistakes unless we \nunderstand the mistakes we have made. The route out of this \ncircumstance where there is great economic peril to this country and \nits future, the route ahead, in my judgment, must be an active, \naggressive set of actions by the Congress, working with this President \nand the new President, to understand the urgency of the things I have \ndescribed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10544-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10544-S10545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC CRISIS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, given the recent news about Secretary \nPaulson's execution of the TARP program, I firmly believe action is \nrequired by Congress. This morning, I introduced S. 3683. That is \nlegislation that would do two things. It would freeze remaining money \nof the first $300 billion that has not already been expended and, \nsecondly, it would change the process by which Secretary Paulson would \naccess the second $350 billion.\n  When Secretary Paulson first came to the Senate and explained his \nplan, it was on a conference call. I happened to be in on that \nconference call. It was September 19. At that time, he was talking \nabout the crisis that is upon us, that we have to do something, we have \nto do something big. It has to be $700 billion. It has to be done right \nnow. The only way to do it is to buy troubled assets.\n  At that time, I asked some questions. One question was: If there are \nassets that are going to be bought, what is the criteria that will be \nused to determine which assets should be bought? There was not an \nanswer to that question.\n  The second question was: Which institutions that are holding these \nassets would be the ones that would be eligible for this buyout? There \nwere no answers to that question either.\n  That was on a Friday. Then as the next few days went by, we had \nseveral conversations. I didn't have any personal conversation with him \nexcept in one conference lunch, and that is, Is this the only way to do \nit? Yes, it is going to be buying out troubled assets. Still the \nanswers were not there to those questions.\n  In my statement opposing--I voted against the Paulson plan last \nmonth--\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\nin my statement opposing it, I laid out three primary reasons I voted \nno. The first is that I was not convinced that the asset purchase \nprogram was the right way to do this. Apparently, he didn't think so \neither because that is not what he did.\n  The second is that it would lead to increased lobbying for handouts \nand bailouts by any industry facing financial trouble. Now we are \nseeing that. We are seeing the auto industry coming in, some insurance \ncompanies and others coming in. It is kind of a new way of life: If you \nare not successful, don't worry about it because you have the Federal \nGovernment there to help you.\n  The third is that we were handing over, as I read it--and I don't \nblame Secretary Paulson for this because I suppose if this is what he \nwanted, somebody else was willing to put it together. He was not the \none, I suppose, who drafted it. But it gave one person, in this case \nSecretary Paulson, the sole authority over $700 billion.\n  I have a hard time with big numbers, putting them into perspective \nthat is understandable. But it is my understanding that there are 139 \nmillion American families who file tax returns. If you do your math, \nthis would be $5,000 per family. We are talking about any family out \nthere who files taxes. This is a huge thing. So it does require \nextraordinary thought in addressing it.\n  As I stated at the time, my vote was against the Paulson plan, not \nagainst taking action to provide necessary confidence in financial \nmarkets. I do know and agree that there is a problem out there. I am \nnot convinced that is the way to address it.\n  We critics were right. On October 14, in a significant shift, \nTreasury outlined a plan to directly purchase equity stakes in major \nfinancial institutions. The Wall Street Journal noted that ``critics . \n. . say Treasury should have formulated a comprehensive plan earlier in \nthe crisis.'' This past week, Secretary Paulson announced that he has \ncompleted a remarkable about-face, as summarized by the November 13 \nInvestors Business Daily front-page headline which read: ``Major \nReversal, Treasury Won't Buy Bad Mortgage Debt.'' This is a complete \nreversal. Why did Paulson reverse course? Last Thursday's Los Angeles \nTimes provides the answer:\n\n       Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson's decision to abandon \n     plans to buy troubled bank assets shows that he has come to \n     two conclusions about what was once the chief focus of the \n     government's $700-billion bailout: The first is that it \n     wouldn't work.\n\n  That is kind of full circle. This is what we thought at the time, and \nthis is where we are today. I know many have serious concerns about how \nSecretary Paulson has executed the financial rescue program, and I \nshare those concerns. Congress completely abdicated its responsibility \nby signing a truly blank check.\n  If we look at this and if we read it, there is nothing in there that \nsays we have to do this. Never before in the history of America has \nanyone--elected or, in this case, unelected--been given a blank check \nor a check in the amount of $700 billion to do with as he wishes. It \nhas never happened before. It is unprecedented. But that is exactly \nwhat happened.\n\n  Now we are faced with a lameduck session. We can do something about \nresolving this problem now, and that is supporting and passing the \nlegislation I introduced this morning. It is officially introduced. I \nbelieve I requested it be sent to the Senate Banking Committee. I am \nsure there are several there who want to resolve this problem before we \nrecess.\n  My concern is this: The way it is set up by law, there is $350 \nbillion already out there, and he has been spending that money. \nFrankly, I don't know how much has already been spent. There was an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago that said all \nbut $60 billion has been spent. That may be true; it may not be true. I \nhave no way of knowing. That alone is enough concern that a senior \nMember of the Senate doesn't even know how much of the taxpayers' money \nhas been spent or what percentage of the $350 billion has been spent.\n  We have a second $350 billion to make up the $700 billion that will \ncome, but it is rather nebulous, it is rather vague as to how that \nwould be put into the hands of Secretary Paulson. My interpretation is \nthat he would indicate, yes, we do need to have the second $350 \nbillion, and if there was not a resolution to stop that, to preclude \nthat from happening, then he would be able to do that.\n  My concern is that we will stall around and do nothing. We will \nadjourn and not come back until January. That would give him the \nopportunity of stating his intention, what he wants to do, and then \nhave 15 days go by when we are not even in session. I think the only \nway to do this is to do it the way we are planning to do it now; that \nis, to bite the bullet.\n  I know it is difficult. It is difficult for members of any body, \nparticularly the Senate. This legislation, as I recall, passed 75 to \n24. Those of us who are among the 24, who voted against it, are fine in \nterms of doing something such as this, but at least a third of those \nwho voted for it would have to say he didn't do what he said he would \ndo, he didn't buy the troubled assets. Therefore, that gives me reason \nto change. I can't help but think that at least half or even more of \nthose who voted for this legislation would find themselves in that \nposition. When we look at where we are today and see that there is \nsomething that can be done, I think it is necessary that we go ahead \nand do it. One of the things that is going on now--and this bothers me \na little bit--is that there is an argument going on right now between \nsome of the committees--the Finance Committee and the Banking \nCommittee--as to who has jurisdiction. Then there is a debate as to \nwhether a special inspector general should be appointed, and they have \ntalked about some names. If they do that, confirmation probably would \nnot take place for another couple months. By that time, all the money \nis gone. So we are sitting around twiddling our thumbs doing nothing. \nOur last shot to do something is to do something while we are here. \nThis lameduck session, I suspect, is only going to last 3 or 4 days. So \nwe have that length of time to stop this from happening.\n  If the American people are concerned about this, concerned as I am \nand as many Members of this body are, that this was done without the \nconsideration it should have had, this amount of money, $700 billion is \nout there now in the hands of one person to do with as he wishes, that \nis not good Government and it needs to be stopped. We can stop it by \nthe passage of the legislation I introduced this morning.\n  Again, it will do only two things. It will preclude and freeze any \nfurther expenditure by the Secretary of the Treasury and, second, it \nwould preclude the second $350 billion from coming up for \nconsideration. In other words, that would stay in the Treasury. I think \nthis is the only chance we have to get it done. We better do it now or \nit is going to be too late and we will be out of here and it will be \nhistory by the time we come back at the end of January.\n  With that happy note, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.

Mr. President, in the 2 years since I have been privileged \nto be in this body, I have spoken frequently about my concerns with \nrespect to the balance of power between the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch and the atrophy of the powers and the influence of \nthe Congress. There are two issues that are before us this week that I \nthink illuminate the dangers of that atrophy.\n  The first is in respect to the powers we gave to the Secretary of \nTreasury in our vote at the beginning of October, before we went into \nrecess, as he addressed the issues of the bailout. Many Senators, \nincluding myself, wrote letters of concern immediately after this \nbailout was proposed, noting that it was unprecedented for one \nindividual in the executive branch of Government to be given the broad \ndiscretion the present Secretary of the Treasury has been given.\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\n  I voted to support this bailout, as did most of my colleagues, as we \nwere assured, not only by members of the administration, but also with \na great deal of hesitation by members of our own party in the Senate, \nthat this was an essential act to avert an international calamity in \nthe financial markets. We were told by the Secretary of the Treasury \nthat we needed to reinforce the good will and the concerns people had \nby allowing him to take certain actions. We ensured oversight over the \nSecretary of the Treasury, but he still retained the total discretion \nthat has been used over the past several weeks.\n  At the same time, we all know now--it has been said several times \nalready this afternoon--the decisions that were made, as to where this \nmoney has been going, were not in line with the reassurances that were \ngiven this body when the legislation was brought forward. There has \nbeen a great deal of inconsistency coming from the Secretary of \nTreasury, and it has created a mood of unpredictability that we have \nseen reflected in the markets and in the confidence of investors.\n  I would agree with the concept that was recently put forward by the \nSenator from Oklahoma about slowing down the amount of money that is \navailable to be spent under this bailout. I also would propose, in \nexamining legislation to that effect, that we as a body revisit the \nwhole idea of giving this kind of power to one individual in the \nexecutive branch.\n  There are plenty of precedents in history which create a small body \nof honest brokers, perhaps three individuals who collectively can make \ndecisions for the good of the country and who would not be burdened by \nconflict of interests because of their own background, either real or \nimagined, or the burden that goes with the discretion of one \nindividual. I hope to place something to that effect before this body \nrelatively soon. I hope other Members of the Congress will consider \nthat idea as well.\n  The second issue with respect to the abrogation of power by the \nlegislative branch to the executive branch concerns the relationship \nthat we are now about to finalize with Iraq. We have seen it reported \nin the media today that the Iraqi Cabinet has given a near unanimous \nagreement to a strategic framework agreement--which is very little \ndiscussed, and a status of forces agreement--which has been much \ndebated, that ostensibly would define the future relationship between \nthe United States and Iraq.\n  I find it more than ironic, and I have mentioned it several times on \nthis floor, that the Congress has not been invited to participate in \nthis process. The Iraqi Cabinet is going to present this agreement to \nthe Iraqi Parliament for a vote. The Congress of the United States is \nhardly even getting a look.\n  If you turn to article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, it \nsays the President:\n\n       . . . shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent \n     of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the \n     Senators present concur. . . .\n\n  The question is, Is this a treaty? It is going to define the long-\nterm relationship between the United States and Iraq in a situation \nwhere we are going to have military bases of some sort in Iraq and a \nsecurity relationship with Iraq. That sounds quite a bit like a treaty \nto me.\n  The administration has been claiming this is simply an executive \nagreement and, as a result, the Secretary of State can sign this; the \nCongress can be consulted but does not have to have a vote. But let us \nremember, at the end of this year, on December 31, the legal authority \nfor the United States to be operating in Iraq ends under international \nlaw with the expiration of the U.N. mandate. So under what authority, \nlegal authority, will we be operating in Iraq? An executive agreement \nis only constitutional when it is implementing a law. So what law or \nconstitutional authority will this executive agreement be implementing?\n  The members of the administration, when I raised this issue nearly 8 \nmonths ago, claimed that the 2002 authorization to go to war in Iraq \nwas their legal authorization to negotiate an executive agreement \nlooking to the future relationships in Iraq. I have strong questions \nabout that. First, if the 2002 authorization to go to war would be good \nin terms of an executive agreement to define our future relationship, \nthen why did we even need the U.N. mandate in the first place? The \nsecond is, the 2002 authorization to go to war in Iraq took place at a \ntime when the present Government of Iraq did not even exist.\n  So I would state my strong belief, again, that the Congress needs to \nassert its constitutional authority on this matter. The Congress needs \nto concur with the strategic framework agreement in order for us as a \nnation under the Constitution to properly define our relationship with \na government and a country where we are going to have military forces \nin place, and where we are going to have security guarantees.\n  In that regard, I conclude by stating my strong hope that the \nincoming administration, under President-elect Obama, will, early on, \ntake a comprehensive diplomatic approach to all the issues that affect \nthe United States in that particularly troublesome spot in the world. \nWe should be fostering the right kind of diplomatic environment with \nother countries such as Russia and China that have interests in this \nregion. We should be exploring ways to formally and aggressively \nexplore our relationships with countries such as Iran. We need to put \nthe whole issue of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other countries in \nthe Middle East on the table early on and forcibly. Reality indicates \nand history proves that the longer the new administration waits, the \nmore strongly they are going to be embedded in the policies that have \npreceded them, and the more difficult it is going to be to put a \ncomprehensive approach to the future into place.

Mr. President, I wish to address a matter that is supposedly \nbefore us, although to my knowledge there is not yet a bill on the \nfloor that we can read and, therefore, debate. But I think the general \nconcept of some kind of a so-called bailout for the auto companies is \nthe reason why we have come back to Washington in this so-called \nlameduck session. I wish to address that and talk about the best way \nforward to assist the companies involved as opposed to what I \nunderstand the concept of this punitive legislation to be.\n  Let me begin by saying that ordinarily in the Congress we have \nhearings. We develop legislation on big matters. We try to do it in a \nbipartisan way. We then mark up the bill in committee by discussing it, \namending it, rewriting it. Then it comes to the floor of the Senate \nwhere we debate it and can amend it again and ultimately pass it to the \nother body.\n  That is not what is happening today. We are told there is going to be \nlegislation presented at some point to provide $25 billion to the three \nU.S. automakers. Beyond that, we know nothing. What I want to do is \ntalk about the concept of it, and later we can talk about how the bill \nwill actually get here, whether we can seek to amend it, and whatever \nelse might be appropriate to try to conclude work on this matter.\n  Obviously, everyone is hurting these days. The car companies aren't \nthe only folks who are hurting. Every family is hurting, especially as \nwe have leveraged our debts. We have home mortgage debt, credit card \ndebt, perhaps car loan debt. All of us are tightening our belts, \nbecause we appreciate the fact we have to get that debt down. That is \nhappening in the business sector as well. One of the reasons Congress \npassed the so-called TARP legislation, the stabilization package that \nwas designed to assist financial institutions, was because in some \nrespects the financial institutions are the blood that courses through \nthe entire economy. They provide the cash; in many cases, the credit. \nUnfortunately, our country runs on credit. You don't buy anything\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\nthese days without a credit card. You certainly don't buy anything big, \nsuch as a car or refrigerator, without a credit card. As a result, the \nquestion was whether banks were going to stop lending to consumers and \nbusinesses because the assets on their books were of such dubious value \nthat they had to keep all the cash they could accumulate just to meet \nthe law's requirements for their reserves.\n  What the administration decided originally was that the $700 billion \ncould be used to buy these troubled assets, get them off of the banks' \nbalance sheets and, by giving them money to buy them, the banks would \nthen have money to loan to a car dealer or the car dealer to loan to \nthe car purchaser and the like. Ultimately, it was decided that the \neconomy was in such a sorry state that we had to get the money infused \ndirectly into the banks and didn't have time to set up the rather \ncomplicated procedure of buying these assets. Instead, the loans \ncurrently being made are going directly to the banks and other \nfinancial institutions. Of course, the hope is that money will then be \nlent out to us and to businesses so that the blood which keeps the \neconomy going, called cash, can continue to enable us to buy things.\n  There is some indication that is beginning to happen, although the \nprocess takes a while. There are many folks in the economy who get hurt \nwhen people don't buy as much, whether it is from lack of credit or \ntrying to tighten their belts. I think of one company that laid off \n10,000 people in one small town in Ohio. The company is called DHL. I \nthink of Circuit City which went bankrupt recently. A lot of folks are \nworried about Christmas season and consumers not buying. There are all \nkinds of folks who are in trouble economically, businesses and \nfamilies. The question is whether we should respond to those with the \nlargest voice in Washington, DC. Certainly the three big automakers \nhave a big voice here and a constituency that would like to make their \ncase that they should be bailed out and that is where we should draw \nthe line.\n  I have a hard time with that. Not because I don't like the car \ncompanies. I readily buy cars from them. I think it is great that they \nbuild the kind of cars I like to buy. I am not faulting them for the \ndecisions they have been making in what they manufacture. The fact is, \nthey are in trouble pretty much for reasons that relate to their own \ndecisions rather than a lot of consumers out there who have gotten \ncaught up in this credit crunch, in effect through no fault of their \nown, except perhaps going into debt more than they should have. The car \ncompanies have made some contracts with the United Auto Workers labor \nunion that are literally dragging them down. It is like asking somebody \nto swim with a 50-pound weight around their neck. It is no wonder they \ncan't meet their obligations under the contracts and need taxpayer \nassistance. But the question is whether an average family or small \nbusiness should be asked to cough up the money to transfer to an auto \ncompany that has made these deals with the union or whether the car \ncompany should find an alternative way of dealing with it.\n  Here is the order of magnitude I am talking about. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, the average hourly wage cost for the big \nthree auto manufacturers is $73 an hour. The average for the Japanese \nautomakers building cars in the United States is between $45 and $48--\nsubstantially less. For the average manufacturing company in the \ncountry or average company, it is about $28.48. So you can see that \nthese legacy costs of the big auto companies are like the 50-pound \nweight dragging them under. It does no good for taxpayers to pour $25 \nbillion into the car companies and find a year later that money has \nbeen spent and yet nothing has changed to diminish their obligations. \nWhere are they going to get the next $25 billion and then $25 billion \nafter that?\n  The reality is, they have to change the way they are doing business \nin order to warrant asking taxpayers for anything. This is where the \nalternatives come into play. There is already a law on the books that \npermits companies in financial straits such as this to reorganize their \nbusiness, get rid of much of their debt obligation and start over \nagain. You are required to slim down, to be sure, in order to be more \ncompetitive. It is called reorganization under chapter 11, sometimes \nchapter 11 protection. It falls under the Bankruptcy Code. When this is \naccomplished, the contracts that the car companies have made are \nrenegotiated in such a way that the company can show it has the ability \nto emerge and make money, that the contracts are not going to continue \nto weigh them down. That would be the benefit of taking this \nreorganization.\n  Some are more intent on preserving the status quo than being able to \ncompete because they say things such as: Well, restructuring the \nbusiness might mean there would be fewer employees. There might well \nbe. It might be 10 percent or maybe even 20 percent fewer employees, if \nthat is what it takes to compete successfully. There may be a number of \ndealerships cut. Maybe 10 or 15 percent of the dealerships will have to \ngo away. If that is what it takes for them to compete with the Japanese \nautomakers, then that is what should be done. We should not say those \nlegacy costs or those built-in costs of operation should be retained \nand then ask the taxpayers to throw in $25 billion to maintain \nsomething that isn't working. It is true that these costs represent \nfuture obligations as well as current and so they are going to continue \nunless they are wiped out by the reorganization that is provided by \nchapter 11.\n  Some people say: Well, what they need is better management, and we \nhere in Washington know how to manage them better. That is the last \nthing we want, for Congress or folks in Washington to tell them how to \ndo their business. Under reorganization, a committee of experts assists \nthem in designing a business plan. They have 18 months to develop a \nplan to move forward. They have breathing room. Basically all of the \nobligations are stayed. They have the opportunity to fix what is wrong, \nplan for the future, and then implement that plan. We wouldn't have any \nof that if we simply gave them the $25 billion. They wouldn't be \nprotected at all from any of the obligations that they have either on \nan ongoing basis or their future obligations.\n  In all chapter 11 reorganizations, prefiling debts become \nunenforceable except to the extent that they are incorporated into the \nreorganization plan. GM has $40 billion in long-term debt; Ford about \n$136 billion. A reorganization plan, a business plan would be set forth \nthat provides how each of those obligations is treated and, if they are \ntoo much to enable the company to go forward, then they are reduced \naccordingly.\n  A taxpayer bailout would provide none of that protection. Protecting \nthe workers would still require negotiation with the labor unions, but \nsome of the amount of those legacy costs could be reduced in the \nprocess. I mentioned the fact that there might be fewer dealerships. \nThey might decide to reduce the number of brands. They would be doing \nso under the protection of chapter 11 rather than the current \nsituation. A taxpayer bailout wouldn't give them any protection from \nState franchising laws that make it very costly to reduce the number of \nbrands and dealerships. I have some information that when GM eliminated \nthe Oldsmobile brand, it reportedly cost $1 billion, and there are \nstill litigation proceedings about whether they can do that with their \ndealerships.\n  Some are concerned about whether they could receive financing if they \ntook chapter 11, the so-called debtor in possession financing. This is \nan area where the Federal Government might provide some assistance. The \nadministration, as a matter of fact, has been talking about such \nassistance. But a pure taxpayer bailout wouldn't guarantee any \nstructural reforms or provide the possibility of debtor-in-protection \nkind of financing. It would, in fact, through the reorganization, at \nleast provide taxpayers with the assurance that they could get repaid \nif they did provide some of this money as opposed to the current \nproposed bailout which has absolutely no guarantee that taxpayers would \nreceive any of their money back.\n  A final two quick points I wish to make. There is an argument by the \ncar companies of who would buy a car from a company that is in chapter \n11 protection. The answer is, probably the same people who are buying \ncars today. If I\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\ndrive down Camelback Road in Phoenix, where we have a lot of car \ndealerships, 6 months from now and some of those companies have asked \nfor chapter 11 protection, I guarantee you, I will not know which ones. \nThey will all have the same bright lights, the same eager salesmen \nready to sell me something. With reorganization, you don't go out of \nbusiness.\n  One of the myths is that this would put you out of business. If you \ntake bankruptcy under chapter 7, you do go out of business. That is not \nwhat chapter 11 protection is at all. In fact, you are able to \nreorganize, and that is precisely why people would continue to buy the \ncars.\n  Not everybody is going to lose their job through reorganization. I \ndoubt that it would be more than a fraction of the people who would \nlose their jobs. Doug Baird, a bankruptcy professor at the University \nof Chicago, recently said, in response to the number 3 million which \npeople have been bandying about:\n\n       This three million figure is laughable . . . modern \n     bankruptcy law is designed to protect against that.\n\n  The bottom line is, there is a law that provides protection, \nbreathing room, and an ability to get rid of the kind of debts \nburdening these companies. If all we do instead is throw $25 billion at \nthe problem, none of this protection comes into play. None of the \nability to renegotiate what is dragging them down now would occur. It \nwould simply literally be throwing good money after bad without a \njustification of why these companies, as opposed to many other \ncompanies in the country, were to receive that help.\n\n  The money has to come from somewhere. It has to come from people who \nare working hard to make a go of it themselves. So we have to ask the \nkind of hard questions like this before we ask our fellow citizens to \ncough up the money for this kind of a bailout. I hope we will be able \nto do that during the debate on this legislation, which I hope we will \nsee soon, assuming we are going to be deciding whether to vote on it \nthis week.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate this historic \ntime in the history of the United States of America.\n  I give my accolades to President-elect Obama and to Vice President-\nelect Biden for their transformative and historic campaign and \nelection.\n  I also recognize Senator John McCain as a friend and for his \nextraordinary contributions to our Nation. I am certain Senator McCain \nwill continue to serve as a force for good on the floor of this \nChamber, as he has for so many years. I look forward to working with \nhim.\n  Just a few short years ago, President-elect Barack Obama arrived in \nthe Senate in the 109th Congress as an unlikely occupant from the \nIllinois State Senate.\n  President-elect Obama's story is an American story. The son of a \nmother from Kansas and a father from Kenya, he learned the values of \nhard work and service to others. He studied at some of our Nation's \nfinest schools but chose to apply his immeasurable talents to serving \nthe people: a community organizer, an Illinois State senator, a U.S. \nSenator, and soon to be the President of these United States of \nAmerica.\n  President-elect Obama is, in fact, the personification of the \nAmerican dream and the idea of what it is to be an American. His \nelection is also a reminder of just how far our country has come.\n  America has always been a work in progress--an idea that generation \nafter generation has worked to perfect. We must never forget that for \nover 250 years on this continent, and through the first century of this \nNation, we lived in a society where slavery was allowed.\n  It took the bloodiest war of our country's history--the Civil War--\nwhere over a half million Americans were killed on our own soil, to \nbring about an end to slavery and to usher in the 13th, 14th, and 15th \namendments of our Constitution. These three amendments, in my view, are \na significant part of the bedrock proposition that all constitutional \nliberties are endowed upon all Americans without exception.\n  Unfortunately, neither the Civil War nor these amendments brought an \nend to the division or discrimination that were a part of our Nation's \npast.\n  In 1896, in Plessy v. Ferguson, our U.S. Supreme Court sanctioned a \nsystem of segregation under the law. The Court upheld an 1890 Louisiana \nlaw which mandated racially segregated but equal railroad carriages. It \nwas a dark period in our Nation's history.\n  ``Jim Crow'' laws extended across the South. In the Southwest, \nMexican Americans were also systematically denied access to ``White \nOnly'' restrooms and other public places. In the South, the signs read: \n``No Blacks Allowed.'' In the Southwest in many places the signs read: \n``No Mexicans Allowed.''\n  There were, however, many voices who knew that an America divided by \nrace was an America which could not stand. In the now infamous Plessy \ncase, Justice Harlan, in the dissent to that case that sanctioned \nsegregation under the laws, said the following:\n\n       The destinies of the races, in this country, are \n     indissolubly linked together and the interests of both \n     require that the common government law shall not permit the \n     seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law.\n\n  It took more than a half century of an America in progress to revisit \nits decision in Plessy v. Ferguson and to begin achieving the vision of \nJustice Harlan. It was not until 1920 that our Constitution guaranteed \nthe right to vote to women. In fact, for the first several hundred \nyears women were not entitled to vote in the United States of America. \nIt was not until 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, that the Supreme \nCourt, under the able leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, struck \ndown the ``separate but equal'' doctrine as unconstitutional under the \n14th amendment. Thurgood Marshall, another American hero of ours who \ngave his life for equal opportunity for all Americans, argued that case \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  But even after the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, \nthere was much more work to do. The 15th amendment, ratified in 1870, \nguaranteed all citizens the right to vote regardless of race. But \nalmost a century later--in 1965--only a very small percentage of \nAfrican Americans were registered to vote in States such as Mississippi \nand Alabama.\n  In 1965, for example, in Mississippi, only 6.7 percent--6.7 percent--\nof African Americans were registered to vote. In Alabama, less than 20 \npercent of African Americans were registered to vote.\n  To prevent people from voting, there were literacy tests, poll taxes, \nand language barriers, not to mention voter intimidation and \nharassment, which occurred in those days in the 1960s.\n  But the 1960s also brought change to America and ensured that we \ncontinued as an America in progress. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson \nsigned the Civil Rights Act. In signing that law, he said:\n\n       We believe that all men are created equal, yet many are \n     denied equal treatment. We believe that all men have certain \n     unalienable rights, yet many Americans do not enjoy those \n     rights. We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings \n     of liberty, yet millions are being deprived of those \n     blessings, not because of their own failures, but because of \n     color of the skin.\n\n  Our work, President Johnson said that day, was not done. He was \nright.\n  In early 1965, Jimmy Lee Jackson was shot by a State trooper during a \ncivil rights demonstration.\n  On March 7, in Selma, AL, more than 500 nonviolent civil rights \nmarchers attempting a 54-mile march to the State capital to call for \nvoting rights were confronted by an aggressive assault by authorities. \nThat day, still known and remembered as Bloody Sunday, stirred a nation \nto do what it knew was right.\n  President Johnson, in those days, called for the country to summon \nits better angels. He said:\n\n       At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single \n     place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for \n     freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a \n     century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, \n     Alabama.\n\n  President Johnson continued:\n\n       This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no \n     hesitation and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot, we \n     must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\n     vote in every election that he may desire to participate in.\n\n  On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the landmark \nlegislation--the Voting Rights Act--that opened the doors of democracy \nto all Americans.\n  In our country's history, yes, we have stumbled. But yet at each \nstumble, leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and Cesar \nChavez, and many others, have encouraged us to get up, to stand up, to \nmove America forward.\n  We, like them, believe America truly is an America in progress. \nToday, thanks in large measure to their work, we are at the dawn of a \nnew America, an era in which doors of democracy and opportunity are \nopen to all Americans.\n  We are waiting today for the inauguration of the first African-\nAmerican President in the history of the United States. That in itself \nis history. But what is also historic about this reality is that as \nPresident he will be President for all 325 million people of America.\n  In his election, I think you see the statement that is truly the \nAmerican ideal: that no matter who you are, no matter where you are \nfrom, anything is possible in this America of ours. That is what makes \nus a great nation. That is what we have seen as an America in progress \nwhich has brought us to this point in our Nation's history.\n  We have much work to do ahead. But I am very confident that America's \nbest days are still ahead, as we continue to be the beacon of hope and \nopportunity and human possibilities for the entire globe.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, throughout the past few months, I have \nhad the opportunity to talk to literally thousands of Mainers, and the \nNo. 1 issue that has been on their mind is the financial crisis, the \npoor state of the economy.\n  Public confidence in our Nation's financial system has been shaken \nbadly by the extent, the scope, and the rapidity of the financial \nmeltdown. As a former financial regulator in the State of Maine, a \nposition I held for 5 years, I have become convinced that significant \nregulatory reforms are required to restore public confidence and to \nensure that the absence of regulation does not allow a crisis like the \none we are engulfed in now to happen ever again.\n  Therefore, today I will introduce a bill that would close two \ndangerous gaps in the Government's system for overseeing financial \nmarkets. The bill would also establish a formal process for developing \nadditional, comprehensive reforms of our financial regulatory system.\n  Our economy has struggled with a credit crisis spawned by mortgage \ndefaults in the subprime mortgage market and their ripple effects \nthroughout markets for mortgage-backed securities. Complex financial \ninstruments that were poorly understood, not transparent, and, in many \ncases, not regulated have exacerbated the crisis.\n  What was once thought of as America's mortgage crisis has \nmetastasized into a nightmare of converging forces that could lead to a \ndeep and global recession. As we have so painfully learned, financial \nmarkets are truly global, and the hopes and fears that affect these \nmarkets move with the speed of light through electronic communications \nand electronic trading.\n  The consequences in our country have been dire: falling home prices, \nrising foreclosure rates, plunging consumer sales, increased \nunemployment, a tremendous erosion of retirement savings, and billions \nof dollars for emergency stabilization programs. We are even looking at \na Federal deficit that could reach the extraordinary figure of $1 \ntrillion.\n  The Maine lobster industry, the paradigm of hardy, small town \nentrepreneurship, has also felt the blows of the crisis in high finance \nand a terrible economy. It is not only that consumers have reacted by \nreducing their purchases of lobsters--although that is one factor--it \nis also that the lobster industry is an innocent victim of the global \nfinancial crisis.\n  It is extraordinary that the global financial crisis is putting the \nvery existence of Maine's centuries-old lobster industry in jeopardy.\n  Here is what happened. In addition to plunging demand, many \nlobstermen in Maine send their lobsters to Canadian processors. Well, \nit turns out that those Canadian processors are, in turn, financed \nlargely by financial institutions in Iceland--in Iceland.\n  When the Iceland financial system collapsed, credit was terminated to \nthe Canadian processors, which, in turn, stopped processing Maine \nlobster. Who would have guessed that the failures of banks in Iceland \nwould claim as victims the lobstermen in the State of Maine? But that \nshows how integrated our financial system is worldwide. A lobster \ndealer in my State said:\n\n       This is as devastating to the State of Maine as Hurricane \n     Katrina washing away all the boats and blowing down all the \n     wharves.\n\n  Nor is the fallout from the financial crisis confined to our shores. \nThis past weekend, leaders of the G-20 nations who represent 85 percent \nof the world's economic activity met in Washington to address this \ncrisis. Clearly, we need a coordinated global response to the downturn, \nbut we also must take action to right our own ship. As we close out the \n110th Congress and prepare to reconvene for the 111th, we must consider \nhow to protect our financial system from the shortfalls in regulation, \nreporting, and transparency that helped lay the groundwork for a sudden \nand traumatic onslaught of bad economic news.\n  Consider that less than a year ago, the American financial system \nboasted five huge investment bank holding companies: Bear Stearns, \nLehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. \nToday, those institutions no longer exist as we had long known them. \nThey have failed or are being acquired or, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan \nStanley demonstrate, have converted themselves to bank holding \ncompanies subject to Federal Reserve supervision. What is astonishing, \nhowever, is that current Federal law assigns no agency responsibility \nfor supervising these enormous institutions, even though experience has \nshown their safety and soundness could have vast implications for the \nfinancial system and the broader economy. Think about that. Your local \ncredit union, your small community bank is subject to safety and \nsoundness regulations, but these enormous Wall Street financial \ninstitutions that arguably have a far greater impact on our economy \nhave not been subject to safety and soundness regulations. Instead, \nthey participated in a completely voluntary program of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission--a program that was later deemed as inadequate \nby the SEC Chairman as he canceled it this fall.\n  My legislation would apply safety and soundness regulation to \ninvestment bank holding companies by assigning the Federal Reserve this \nresponsibility. Although the five big firms have left the field, this \nis a necessary step. Any new investment bank holding company that might \nbe organized would fall into the same regulatory void as its \npredecessors. The SEC would be able to regulate its broker-dealer \noperations, but no Federal agency would have the explicit authority to \nexamine its operations for safety and soundness or for systemic risk. \nThe collapses at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers illustrate the \ntremendous hardship that can result under the recent voluntary system.\n  Federal financial officials have also pointed to a ``massive hole'' \nin their ability to monitor and manage systemic risk. That is the \nrapidly expanded markets in private, over-the-counter contracts known \nas ``credit default swaps.'' These are contracts that involve paying \nfor protection against\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\ndefault, loss of value, or another credit event that might affect a \nfinancial asset such as a government or corporate bond or a mortgage-\nbacked security.\n  As government officials and financial experts have pointed out, there \nis nothing perhaps inherently wrong with such contracts. The problem, \nhowever, is that credit default swaps are not traded on regulated \nexchanges, are not officially reported to our Nation's financial \nregulators, and are not even subject to recordkeeping requirements. \nSome are visible to bank examiners who may take them into account when \nconsidering a bank's risk exposure and others are summarized in \nvoluntary publications, but that is only a partial glimpse into a \nmarket whose total national value has been estimated as high as $60 \ntrillion.\n  As the cases of Lehman Brothers and AIG insurance holding company \nshowed this year, serious problems can arise when a major credit event \nsuddenly reveals that massive claims for collateral posting or payment \nare converging on credit default swap parties who cannot meet their \nobligations. But under the current system, it is often impossible for \nregulators and even market participants to know in advance how all the \ntangled webs of contract commitments overlap and affect any particular \nparty. This leaves regulators unable to take action against excessive \ndebt, inadequate reserves, or other threats.\n  For example, Bear Stearns had a financial leverage ratio of 35 to 1. \nIn other words, the firm borrowed $35 for every dollar of its own \nmoney. That level of debt financing can generate fabulous profits for \nshareholders and mind-boggling bonuses for top executives when \ninvestments flourish but can whipsaw disastrously if they drop in \nvalue. If your equity capital is $1 and you borrow $35 more to buy an \nasset worth $36 and the value of that asset declines by only $2, to \n$34, you are insolvent.\n  Although credit default swaps are contracts rather than asset \npurchases, they can also overwhelm sellers and leave buyers unable to \nget payment for the protection they thought they had secured. Excessive \nleverage and excessive risk exposure can combine to ruin even giants \nsuch as Lehman Brothers and AIG.\n  The fallout from such collapses extends far beyond the firms' \ninvestors, employers, and business partners--and this is the important \npoint. It would be one thing if the bad decisions made by Wall Street \nfirms only affected those firms, but that is not the case, as we have \nlearned all too well. People in Maine and other Main Street Americans \nhave felt shock and despair in reviewing the statements for their \n401(k) accounts. For these people, the fact of their loss is far more \nimportant than its cause. But for us who are assigned the role of \npolicymakers, understanding the cause of the problem is critical if we \nare to prevent its recurrence.\n  We now know that a fundamental source of trouble was the lack of \neffective oversight, of regulation for safety and soundness for the \nhighly leveraged investment bank holding companies. And we know that \nthe second problem is the lack of transparency and coordination in the \nenormous market for credit default swaps.\n  My bill would address the second problem in two ways. First, it sets \na reporting requirement. For any U.S. entity that buys or sells a \ncredit default swap contract, it must report that fact to the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. This simple step will go a long way to \nincreasing the transparency and allowing us to identify potential \nrisks. Second, my bill would add the force of law to the clearinghouse \ninitiative being jointly pursued by the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork, the SEC, and the CFTC.\n  The clearinghouse, however, should be codified. We can't rely on a \nvoluntary arrangement. The SEC's top risk-management official \nrecommends such a statutory mandate to ensure participation, and that \nis what my bill would do. As two NYU finance professors wrote in a \nrecent essay for Forbes: It is time to ``lift the veil'' from these \nderivatives with more reporting and with centralized clearing \noperations.\n  Correcting those gaps are important steps toward preventing \nrepetition of the painful financial collapses we have seen. But we must \nalso look in the long term at comprehensive financial reform. The \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act that was signed into law last \nmonth calls for two reports to advance that goal. One is due in January \nand one in April. Those will be useful, but I believe our deliberations \nwould benefit from having the advice not only of a small panel on a \nshort deadline and of the new administration but also from a special \ncommission modeled on the one created to examine the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, 2001. Fortunately, a plan for such a commission \nexists. It has been developed by my colleagues, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Cantwell, and that has been incorporated into my bill as well.\n  I believe this issue of restoring confidence to our financial markets \nthrough a strong and effective regulatory reform bill is so critical to \nour Nation--critical for promoting growth and job creation, for \nprotecting retirement savings and public services, for restoring credit \nto households and small businesses, and for promoting transparency and \naccountability in financial markets--that we should focus on it in a \nspecial session in December.\n  But regardless of the decisions made by our leadership on that issue, \nI hope the introduction of the Financial Regulation Reform Act of 2008 \nwill prompt a much-needed debate on the fundamental changes needed to \nmodernize and strengthen our system for monitoring and regulating the \nimmensely complicated financial markets that supply the lifeblood for \ngrowth for our country.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10550-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10550-S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam Presdient, November 11 marked the 54th anniversary of \nVeterans Day. It is an occasion when we must remember the great debt \nthat we owe veterans and members of the armed services who fight to \nmaintain our freedom around the world. Throughout history, our soldiers \nhave risked their lives to defend our freedom, and we must not forget \ntheir sacrifices.\n  For my State of Arizona, Veterans Day is particularly special because \nit is home to over 560,000 veterans. Each one has worked to maintain \nour freedom. Whether as a medic administering aid to a fallen soldier, \na soldier rooting out the enemy in a safe house, or a mechanic \nservicing the military equipment, every veteran played an integral role \nin our military and thus strengthened our Nation. Our veterans \nshouldered this great responsibility with courage, dedication and \nhonor. We, as a Nation, cannot forget the countless sacrifices our \nveterans have made for this country.\n  Brave men and women in our Armed Forces continue to fight the war \nagainst terrorists. It is important to remember that the troops \ncurrently working to defeat the terrorists all volunteered for our \nNation's military. Young people today are presented with many \nopportunities when they begin their careers, and many serving in the \nmilitary could have chosen a more lucrative career that would not put \nthem in harm's way or take them away from their families. This act of \nselflessness not only underscores the patriotism of our Nation, but \nalso highlights the dedication of our Nation's youth. We should be \nthankful that so many Americans are willing to serve their Nation, \nparticularly at such a critical and dangerous time.\n  In the coming year, Congress will be called upon to preserve care and \nservices to our veterans, as well as to support our men and women who \nare engaged in the missions abroad. We cannot forget those who have \ngiven up so much to fight for our Nation, and we will work to ensure \nthat our veterans and soldiers are recognized for their service.\n  My family and I pay respect to all soldiers who have sacrificed to \nensure America remains free, safe, and the symbol of democracy for the \nworld. I\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\nam immensely grateful to all who have served this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10551-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Larry Craig\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

His distinguished career spans 36 years, \nmaking him the first New Mexican to serve six full 6-year terms and the \nlongest serving Senator of his State.\n  Senator Domenici has been a devoted champion of the State of New \nMexico. His relentless commitment to the people of New Mexico is \nevident to all who know him. As a respected leader in the Senate, he \nhas pushed to strengthen energy security, curb nuclear proliferation, \npromote fiscal responsibility in the Federal budget, and has \ndemonstrated profound leadership skills in his desire to continuously \nimprove New Mexico's economy.\n  Among his many accomplishments and priorities, Senator Domenici has \nplaced the importance of our future generation at the forefront. He \nrecognizes the necessity of cultivating the young minds of today to \nensure a bright future. Over a decade ago, Senator Domenici introduced \nthe Character Counts Program into New Mexico's school curriculum. Under \nthe guidance of this program, schoolchildren learn the value of \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship as they build their character. Such traits are reflected in \nSenator Domenici. His legacy of public service has truly left its mark \non Congress and will forever remain in the hearts of New Mexicans.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nthis magnificent Senator and friend.\n\n\n                              Chuck Hagel\n\n  Madam President, I rise to recognize the service of a great public \nservant and an outstanding leader.\n  Senator Hagel has been a committed and avid servant to his home State \nof Nebraska. He has served in Congress for two consecutive 6-year terms \nwith ardent fervor for the welfare of Nebraskans and all Americans.\n  Senator Hagel has always placed the well-being of Nebraska and our \nNation ahead of partisanship and personal feelings. He has been an \nearnest supporter of bipartisanship, recognizing the productivity that \ncan accompany joint labor. His devotion to the people of his State and \nthis Nation is apparent to any who know him.

Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator John Sununu, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this \nterm. Senator Sununu has represented the great State of New Hampshire \nfor 12 years in Congress, serving six of those years in the Senate. \nSenator Sununu and I both served on the Finance Committee. Although we \ndid not always agree, I found John to be willing to work in a \nbipartisan manner to confront the major challenges that our great \nNation faces.\n  Raised in Salem, NH, John Sununu became interested in public service \nearly in life when his mother served as chair of the local school \nboard. John attended public school in Salem and later earned advanced \ndegrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard \nGraduate School of Business.\n  John Sununu was elected to represent New Hampshire's First Electoral \nDistrict in the House of Representatives in 1996. In the House, John \nserved on the Budget and Appropriations Committees. He quickly rose in \nrank on the Budget Committee, becoming its vice chairman. In 2002, he \nwas elected to represent the Granite State in this Chamber, becoming \nits youngest Member.\n  John and I worked together on numerous occasions. We both served on \nthe Finance Committee This summer, John joined the so-called ``Gang of \nTen'' as it expanded from 10 to 20 members. Together, we sought \npragmatic, bipartisan solutions to our Nation's energy crisis. Senator \nSununu also joined me in standing up for our Nation's senior citizens \nand opposing cuts to Medicare-financed nursing home care.\n  John will be remembered for his commitment to individual liberties \nand limited Government. In the uncertainties of today's world, Senator \nSununu has been a voice for preserving civil liberties in the light of \nincreased law enforcement needs.\n  I thank Senator Sununu for his years of public service and wish him \nand his family the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10551-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10551-S10552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Michael K. Clark\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to the life and service of SGT Michael Clark. A \nmember of Fort Carson's 3rd Brigade Combat Team, Sergeant Clark was \nkilled on October 7 when his foot patrol was ambushed in Mosul, Iraq. \nHe was 24 years old.\n  Sergeant Clark was on his second deployment to Iraq and in his fourth \nyear of service in the 3rd Brigade. He was assigned to the brigade's \n1st Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, and served as a fire support \nspecialist, a job that requires quick thinking, unusually strong \nstamina, and a mastery of the techniques of target processing. In this \nurban, guerrilla-style conflict, where\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\nthe enemy's location is often difficult to acquire, Sergeant Clark \nplayed a vital role as the eyes and ears of his team.\n  Sergeant Clark's dedication and talent earned him a number of awards, \nincluding the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the Combat Action Badge. He was \nalso a two-time recipient of the Army Commendation Medal, which \nrecognizes exemplary service.\n  Sergeant Clark and his team were charged with maintaining security in \nthe eastern portion of Mosul, which is Iraq's second largest city and \none of the remaining centers of operation for al-Qaida in Iraq. They \ncarried out their mission--one of the most dangerous and important of \nthe war--with courage and tenacity.\n  As a result of their efforts, security conditions in Mosul have \nmarkedly improved, and neighborhoods in the city that were once under \ncontrol of extremists have been reclaimed and turned over to the Iraqi \npeople. Two days before Sergeant Clark's death, American forces in \nMosul killed Abu Qaswarah, the second-in-command for al-Qaida-in-Iraq \nwho coordinated operations in the region. Thanks in large measure to \nthe incredible courage and skill of Sergeant Clark and his men, the \ntide in Mosul is turning.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that, ``the characteristic of genuine \nheroism is its persistency. All men have wandering impulses, fits and \nstarts of generosity. But when you have resolved to be great, abide by \nyourself, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world. \nThe heroic cannot be common, nor the common heroic.''\n  Sergeant Clark possessed the persistence and dedication to duty that \nis the mark of a genuine hero. He enlisted at a young age. He deployed \nand he redeployed. He served every day in Iraq committed to his \ncountry, his men, and his mission. He carried out his mission with \ndistinction and honor. He was anything but common, and we are all \nbetter for it.\n  To Sergeant Clark's mother Cherie, his father Bradley, his wife \nNalini, his son Lucas, and all his friends and family, I cannot imagine \nthe sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your \nloss is assuaged by your pride in Michael's service and by your \nknowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his \nservice and his sacrifice.\n\n\n                         Corporal Adrian Robles\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise to express my sympathy over the \nloss of United States Marine Corps Corporal Adrian Robles of \nScottsbluff, NE. Corporal Robles died on October 22 from injuries he \nsustained while supporting combat operations in Helmand province in \nsouthern Afghanistan.\n  A graduate of Scottsbluff High School, Corporal Robles, who was 21 \nyears old, was an exemplary marine. Throughout his service, which \nincluded a tour in Iraq during 2006, Corporal Robles received three \nmedals of Good Conduct from the Marine Corps; two Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbons; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Iraq Campaign \nMedal; the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; the National Defense \nService Medal; and the Purple Heart.\n  All of Nebraska is proud of Corporal Robles' service to our country, \nas well as the thousands of brave men and women serving in the U.S. \nArmed Forces.\n  Corporal Robles is remembered as a devoted son and brother. He is \nsurvived by his parents Cesar and Yolanda; sister Beatriz; and \nstepsiblings Cesar and Ricardo Robles and Yovana Chaparro.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. \nMarine Corps Corporal Adrian Robles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10552-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today to recognize National \nMentoring Month. The designation of January as National Mentoring Month \nallows us to focus national attention on the need for mentors, as well \nas how each of us--individuals, businesses, schools and community \ngroups--can work together to ensure brighter futures for our young \npeople.\n  Mentors serve as role models, advocates, friends and advisers. \nNumerous studies show that mentors help young people augment social \nskills, enhance emotional well-being, improve cognitive skills and plan \nfor the future. For some children, having a caring adult mentor to turn \nto for guidance and encouragement can make the crucial difference \nbetween success and failure in life.\n  As a longtime mentor myself, I certainly know that there are few \nthings more rewarding than making a difference in the life of a child. \nMentoring programs are not only advantageous to our students, but they \nare also rewarding to the mentor. In Delaware, mentoring has become an \nintegral part of our school system and is one of the keys to improving \nacademic achievement among at-risk students.\n  As Governor, I helped recruit 10,000 mentors as part of a statewide \neffort and was actively involved in encouraging individuals, churches, \nservice clubs, students and corporations to help mentor Delaware's at-\nrisk children. However, at the national level, 15 million children are \nstill in need of mentors, and it is imperative that we continue to \nexpand grant programs.\n  I am proud that Congress has been working toward increasing the \nfunding for mentoring. I have cosponsored two pieces of legislation \nthat support mentoring including the Mentoring America's Children Act, \nwhich was introduced by Senator Clinton. This bill is based on joint \nrecommendations of the MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, Big \nBrothers Big Sisters of America and the National Collaboration for \nYouth. The act would broaden the reach of mentoring programs to include \na number of specific populations of young people--including children in \nfoster care and those living in communities with high rates of youth \nsuicide. The Mentoring America's Children Act would also help students \ngain professional skills by implementing internship programs during the \nschool year.\n  The second piece of legislation I have cosponsored is the Mentoring \nfor All Act. This bill, introduced by Senator Kerry, would create a \ncompetitive grant fund to strengthen and grow mentoring infrastructure \nacross the country and provide additional support and funding to direct \nservice mentoring organizations, both at the national and local levels.\n  In addition to cosponsoring these two bills, I also signed onto a \nletter to Senators Harkin and Specter encouraging increased funding for \nmentoring to be added into the fiscal year 2009 budget. The letter \nencourages the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education to include $100 million in their appropriations bills for \nmentoring.\n  There are literally millions of students in our schools who would \nbenefit greatly from having another positive role model in their lives. \nI pledge to continue to fight for increased funding of mentoring \nprograms all year, not just during National Mentoring Month. I am proud \nand grateful to our Nation's mentors who realize that less than an hour \nof our time each school week can make a lifetime of difference to a \nchild and to each of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10552-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10552-S10553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF TIM LITVIN\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, today I rise to make a few comments about \na longtime staffer in my office, Tim Litvin.\n  A native of Manchester and a graduate of Central High School, Tim \ncame to work for me first as an intern from Colgate University and then \njoined the office full time in 2001. Through his 7 years of service, \nTim rose through the ranks from manning the front desk to becoming a \nlegislative aide on critical defense and military issues, as well as on \nother matters. From making sure our veterans and soldiers received the \nhighest level care and attention, to his work with the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard, Tim gained respect from all those who crossed his path.\n  In my office, Tim always came to work with a smile, a willingness to \nhelp, and a good sense of humor. At office functions in the conference \nroom or on the softball field, Tim would always crack a few jokes among \nhis coworkers, sometimes at his own expense to add a bit of levity. \nThis low-key, low-ego approach helped keep things in the office light \nand upbeat. Where there was laughter in my office, Tim was usually \nthere and we all appreciated it.\n\n[[Page S10553]]\n\n  But humor aside, Tim's passion for public service and military \nmatters, especially defense appropriations, has been his strongest \nattribute. While working full time in my office, Tim attended evening \nclasses at the Naval War College and obtained a master's degree. When \nGranite State servicemembers were recuperating at Walter Reed, Tim \nwould often drive out there, visit them, and make sure that they \nreceived the best care possible. Time and again, he went above and \nbeyond the call of duty.\n  Although Tim's new job will not be taking him too far from the Hill, \nhe will be missed. Whether it be his good cheer, his expertise, or his \ndedication to service, Tim will be hard to replace. Fortunately, it is \ngood to know that the Federal Government will still benefit from his \ntalents as he works for our men and women in the Armed Forces at the \nPentagon. I am sure Tim will make us all proud there and I wish Tim \nbest of luck on this new chapter in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10553-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LYNN BAKER\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish today to express my deep \ngratitude and heartfelt best wishes to my administrative director, Lynn \nBaker, who will be retiring at the end of the month after 27 years of \ndistinguished service in the U.S. Senate.\n  Lynn is a perfect example of the countless people who serve the \nSenate as dedicated, nonpartisan employees. Whether it has been as a \nmember of committee staff or in personal offices, the Senate could not \nfunction without professional staff such as Lynn Baker.\n  Over the past 27 years, Lynn has worked with many staff and interns, \nall of whom have benefitted from her experience, wisdom, and guidance. \nWhen asked about Lynn, many current and former staffers will tell you \nthat she is always willing to listen and offer advice. She takes great \npride in encouraging junior staffers to develop their abilities and \npursue their goals. One former staffer remembers that Lynn made her \nfeel like part of the family when she opened her home to this staffer \nuntil appropriate housing could be found. It is no wonder that Lynn \nstays in touch with so many of those with whom she has worked \nthroughout her tenure in the Senate.\n  Lynn graduated with a degree in history from Lake Forest College in \nIllinois, including a semester abroad in Florence. She subsequently \nworked in a Washington law firm for 2 years before joining Senator \nCharles H. Percy of Illinois' staff on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. During a 7-year period on Senator Percy's staff, Lynn \nalso served as office manager for his personal office before she became \nchief clerk of the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and \nGovernment Process.\n  Following a 4-year absence from the Senate, Lynn returned in 1987 as \nexecutive assistant and scheduling director for Senator Kent Conrad of \nNorth Dakota. When she became office manager for Senator Mark O. \nHatfield of Oregon, Lynn worked closely with senior Disbursing Office \nstaff to develop the first electronic financial management system and \ntime and attendance system for personal Senate offices. Following \nSenator Hatfield's retirement, Lynn worked as office manager for Max \nBaucus of Montana before returning to the Senate Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs as chief clerk in 1998. Lynn was financial clerk \nof the committee when I assumed the chairmanship in 2001, and then \nmoved to my personal office as administrative director in 2003.\n  As administrative director, Lynn has made a number of contributions \nthat have helped my office better serve Connecticut. Always open to new \nideas, Lynn implemented the acquisition and use of new technologies \nthat enabled my staff to perform their duties more efficiently. She \nalso took the initiative to update and rewrite my office policy manual, \nand played a leading role in integrating my office with a new software \nsystem that will revolutionize the way my staff communicates and works \ntogether. Lynn was instrumental in the redesign of my Senate office in \n2005, which resulted in an attractive, comfortable, and functional work \nspace.\n  Lynn has formed many lasting friendships throughout the Senate \ncommunity, where she is beloved and respected for her character, \njudgment, and professionalism. I know I speak for my staff and many in \nthe Senate family when I say how difficult it will be for us to bid a \nfond farewell to Lynn. Her patience, warmth, and wise counsel will be \ngreatly missed. However, we all wish Lynn good health and happiness \nalways as she begins her well-deserved retirement. I know that she has \nmuch to look forward to with her loving husband, Steve Nousen, and \ntheir son, Daniel Baker.\n  I extend to Lynn Baker my personal thanks and congratulations for 27 \nyears of exemplary public service to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10553-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10553-S10555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We are glad to hear that at least one of our politicians is \n     concerned about how the gasoline prices are affecting the \n     middle class. Most of us feel that our government is \n     extremely out of touch with the majority of the country.\n       We are retired on a fixed income and we worked hard all our \n     lives and saved to get a motor home for vacations, but \n     unfortunately we now cannot use it because of the price of \n     gasoline and it just sits there. We try to go out shopping \n     for groceries and any other necessities just once a week, \n     making a list of items and stores, color coding so we do not \n     forget anything. The cost of energy also has increased the \n     price of groceries tremendously, so basic foods and produce \n     are the norm--doing away with any treats. We have never seen \n     the price of gasoline increase day by day and a nickel to a \n     dime at a time.\n       We desperately need to have alternate sources of energy, \n     such as coal, windmills, solar and nuclear. We should have \n     been building new refineries and recovering oil off all of \n     our coasts since the 1970s when this same problem came up at \n     that time, but, to our shame, we did not.\n       Automobiles should get a lot more than the 35 mpg that we \n     have heard mentioned for future vehicles. It should be at the \n     very least 60 mpg, and there is no reason in this world with \n     our technology that this could not be a reality. Something \n     should be done to increase the mileage on all of the vehicles \n     that are already on the road. This is never mentioned. We \n     cannot just go out and buy a hybrid or other fuel efficient \n     vehicle at the drop of a hat to help the situation. We drive \n     our 2002 Honda 4 cylinder between 55 and 60 mph on the \n     highway to increase our fuel efficiency and you should see \n     the bad looks we get. Highway mileage should be lowered to 55 \n     mph like in the 70s to help conserve.\n       We do hope that our government does something quickly to \n     improve this situation and that it is not handled like it was \n     in the 70s--all talk and no action. We need to be dependent \n     on no one but ourselves for our energy needs. No one is going \n     to take care of the USA and its citizens but the USA itself.\n       We need some action now--please.\n                                                 Robert & Roberta,\n     Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity to respond to your e-letter \n     regarding energy costs and gasoline prices. I agree that we \n     in the US are far too dependent on petroleum for energy. But \n     I think it is a selfish and short-sighted view to defeat the \n     climate change legislation. Our focus should be, as you \n     mentioned, on using less petroleum, not searching for \n     petroleum everywhere we can, no matter the ecological cost. \n     It is true; we do not have good mass transit in Idaho and \n     especially in the more densely populated Treasure Valley. I \n     think tax dollars would be well spent to improve the mass \n     transit situation in the Valley.\n       We need to give tax incentives to clean, renewable energy \n     sources and rescind the tax breaks given to the huge oil \n     companies who have been reaping record profits at the expense \n     of all Americans. The answer is in conservation which \n     includes improved mass\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\n     transit and in alternative transportation where there would \n     be improved avenues for bicycling and walking.\n       It is true. I will not be driving as far for vacation this \n     year, though I would like to explore areas in Idaho I have \n     not yet seen. It now becomes an expensive venture just to get \n     to the Sawtooths or White Clouds.\n     Tim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am contacting my Congressman about energy just as you \n     have encouraged your constituents to do. I am in dismay, \n     however, at the continued opportunism and political \n     grandstanding. That is, the only answer I see from many is to \n     drill more oil. Every credible energy scientist and \n     economists knows that this will do little or nothing to curb \n     our foreign oil imports and zero to reduce the cost of fuel. \n     Yet, despite this ever-predictable call for more domestic oil \n     production, you flatly concede that ``speculation [is] now \n     driving up the cost of oil.'' So I ask: why are you and your \n     colleagues still calling for more drilling when you know what \n     it is you can do now to reduce fuel costs? Why are you not \n     regulating ``the speculation now driving up the cost of \n     oil''? Commodities speculators are at the heart of extreme \n     oil prices, not supply and demand imbalances. We do not want \n     to hear any red herring arguments about the average Joe's \n     retirement portfolio owning the bulk of oil company shares. \n     The issue is speculation; the answer is regulation of \n     speculation.\n     Jason, Moscow.\n                                  ____\n\n       Last week I heard on the news that you have received many \n     letters and e-mails related to high gas prices. Hence, I have \n     decided to write in and give you my two cents on the matter.\n       I believe that the primary culprit that is causing high gas \n     prices is globalization; particularly in the emerging \n     economies of China and India. The rapid growth of their \n     economies has drastically increased their demand for \n     petroleum.\n       Along with developing a comprehensive energy policy, the \n     executive and legislative branches of our federal government \n     need to re-examine our economic policies, particularly in \n     areas of foreign trade. During the past two decades, the \n     American middle class has gotten the short end of the straw \n     when it has come to previous trade policies. One does not \n     have to look farther than our orchard industry in the \n     Treasure Valley. These trade policies have really only \n     benefitted the very wealthy in our country. When I was in \n     college ten years ago, we talked about globalization in one \n     of my classes and how if China copied the U.S.'s consumption \n     then we would be paying a premium for gas. This is now \n     reality.\n       In conclusion, too often our government fails to look long-\n     term. It is time for a change. We need to do in-depth \n     independent analysis on our trade policies to determine what \n     the long term effect will be on the average American. \n     Government policies need to benefit society as a whole rather \n     than a few. Our society is too self-centered on the ``me'' \n     rather than on the collective ``community''. We also need to \n     have a comprehensive energy policy. This policy needs to be \n     long term and address conservation, efficiency, alternative \n     and renewable sources of energy, and possibly take into \n     consideration additional domestic production of oil with \n     stringent environmental safeguards and firm consequences for \n     those companies that fail to comply with those safeguards.\n     Brent Danielson, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a single father of two sons, 3 years and 13 months \n     old. I am a truck driver. I make decent money and have good \n     benefits. But these fuel prices have gone too far for our \n     society! I am lucky I work at a place where I can get a free \n     bag of potatoes every once in a while because I cannot go \n     grocery shopping because it is all too expensive! Wages have \n     not changed a bit. I am sick of it and I am losing almost all \n     of my faith in our government and the people representing the \n     common people like me. One of my best friends who was an \n     owner-operator had to quit because diesel got too high for \n     him to profit much at all. Now it is been three weeks and \n     they just got their phone shut off two days ago and their \n     power shut off today. My stimulus money has gone to my power \n     bill, gas bill, rent etc. Sure you do not like to fill up \n     your gas tank but does it cripple you financially like it \n     does many, many people? I think not. I have always stuck up \n     for our local and federal government on many issues and \n     criticized them on other issues, but this time I as well as \n     many people are fed up. Seriously this time, I am to the \n     point now where I am struggling to make ends meet. I have \n     spent over $60 in the last three days in gas just to get to \n     work and back--that is it. And I am close to empty again and \n     I have to get diapers for my son before I go to work \n     tomorrow. The diaper money is coming out of the power bill \n     money I had put back. You need to sound off and be heard. At \n     least make it known to us that you are voicing our concerns.\n     Cameron, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are retired, he is military retired and we \n     recently purchased a small travel trailer since he can no \n     longer ride his motorcycle and our maiden voyage with it cost \n     $300 in gas to go 200 miles round trip! Between gas and food \n     prices, we cannot afford to go anywhere, much less eat out. \n     We have changed our daily living dramatically, and it is not \n     a happy way to be in your retirement years.\n       We urge you and all of Congress to start drilling in our \n     nation and bring back more nuclear power plants. We must \n     relieve ourselves of dependence on foreign oil ASAP. Lord \n     only knows what are grandchildren have to look forward to at \n     this insane rate!\n     Angelo, Hayden Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       I will get right to the point--my wife and I are out of \n     money. Our incomes have not changed and our incomes used to \n     pay our bills with money to spare. We have a 91 Honda wagon \n     and a 99 minivan, we pay $50 and $70 to fill them up. Grocery \n     prices are up 100% in the last couple years because gas \n     prices are killing the trucking industry. Expensive gas has \n     made almost everything else expensive. Today, after filling \n     both our cars with gas and grocery shopping, (with a list, \n     mind you), we ran out of money. For the first time ever, we \n     put groceries on a credit card. We are not credit card \n     people, so this is anathema to us.\n       When I turn on the TV or radio I hear some politician \n     telling us that drilling will not make a difference for ten \n     years. As an engineering student, I cannot stomach that level \n     of [deception]. First of all, I do not believe that is true \n     and second, if it were true, then we sure better get started. \n     What if every time an education bill were introduced, we \n     responded by saying that we would not see the results for 12 \n     years so let us not do it. What if I told my child not to go \n     to college because they would not see a payoff for at least \n     four years so do not bother. We are financially dying and our \n     so-called leaders are regurgitating some of the stupidest \n     things I have ever heard.\n       The bottom line is this: This planet does not exist for its \n     own sake, it exists for ours. We are not here by some cosmic \n     accident; we are here by design and our designer gave us the \n     tools we need to live and prosper. The failure to drill for \n     new oil and create new refineries is the result of \n     environmental philosophies, which are based on evolutionary \n     thinking. To the environmentalist, our purpose here is no \n     more significant than that of any other animal, and we, by \n     accident of evolution, happen to have the power to sustain or \n     destroy this environment. Without a cosmic caretaker, the \n     earth itself becomes our only god and the environmentalist \n     shows his worship by reducing or eliminating human impact \n     upon it and by treating humans as vermin. It is an old \n     religion and I am tired of suffering at the hands of it is \n     misguided priests.\n       Please do your best to release energy, specifically nuclear \n     and oil, to the free market system. Irrational environmental \n     policy and regulation have prohibited natural market forces \n     from creating more supply and oil-pricing based on \n     speculation has prevented the market from determining price. \n     Imagine going to Wal-Mart to buy a t-shirt and finding that \n     they now cost $100; and when you ask the owner why this was \n     so, he replies that speculators determined that cotton crops \n     would fail next year, so in preparation they have raised \n     prices early. As you know, this is not how prices are \n     determined. The cotton producer charges as much as he can \n     based on his costs and competitors prices and Wal-Mart \n     charges a markup. If cotton crops indeed fail next year, then \n     the buyer pays more for the rare product and they pass the \n     increase to the consumer. When oil speculators set price, we \n     pay increases at the pumps whether those speculations came \n     true or not. There is no real connection to supply. Please \n     work to make this kind of price setting illegal and please \n     work to release drilling and refinement. The further we \n     remove a commodity from the free market grid by socialist \n     controls and uneducated environmental policy the more the \n     people, you claim to represent, are hurt. Make the American \n     dream possible by making it affordable.\n     Jason, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       The rising cost of fuel has a tremendous effect on my \n     household consisting of my husband and myself. I am sole \n     support for our family. Senator, as you know, wages in Idaho \n     fall behind many other states. The cost of gas is outrageous \n     and I blame the Congress for a lot of it. Why are not we \n     drilling in Alaska? Why are not we building refineries away \n     from coasts where hurricanes have a tendency to hit? Why are \n     not all of our refineries running full bore?\n       There was a Democratic senator from the South who retired, \n     I forget his name but he wrote a book, ``A Grand Party No \n     More''. Before he retired, he went to see for himself where \n     we would drill in Alaska. He said there would be no harm to \n     anyone or anything, it is so far out in no man's land. He \n     said if there was a leak it would be of no consequence as it \n     would freeze the minute it hit the ground. It is time we push \n     the environmentalists to the wall and out of the way. I \n     believe in saving trees and wildlife, but there is no danger \n     to any of these where we would drill. I recognize that we \n     need to become independent of so much oil but how do we do \n     that. I drive a `95 Forerunner and it is paid for. Not the \n     best gas mileage but it is paid for. I cannot afford any kind \n     of a car payment for one of those new hybrids. Rebates are \n     nothing, $2,000 in exchange for $26,000? The cost of a new \n     car buys an awful lot of gas. My income does not allow for \n     any car payment.\n       Everything is going crazy! A loaf of bread that cost $2.89 \n     last year is now $4.29. Anything with corn or wheat is gone \n     out of sight. We pay farmers not to grow wheat and now I hear \n     we have to import it? How sad for\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n     America. America has sold its soul to China, Mexico, Japan. \n     If we were ever to go into another world war, we could not \n     even build what we would need to fight it. Is there a steel \n     mill left in America? Is there a textile mill left in \n     America? You would be pretty hard pressed to find one, a sad \n     statement on us.\n       As to what I do? No trips during the week except to work \n     and back. If I can do any errand on the way, great, \n     otherwise, it waits till the weekend. I plan one trip, one \n     circle. If something is missed, too bad, it is missed. The \n     real clincher is this, I tithe to my church, I give the Lord \n     10% of my gross income. It costs me almost as much, $10 less, \n     to keep my car in gasoline between paychecks. Now I think it \n     is pretty awful when I have to give the gas company as much \n     as I give the Lord. He gives me everything I have, the gas \n     company gives me nothing except anger when I hear of the \n     profits they make. And I think that pretty well sums it up, \n     10% to the Lord vs. almost as much to the gas company!\n     Dianne, Hayden Lake.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a taxi driver here in Boise. In a year's time, the \n     cost to fill my tank has increased nearly 100% but my average \n     fare has remained static. If it were not for my military \n     retirement, I would no longer make enough to cover basic \n     costs and make a profit. I am 61 years old and am not \n     practiced in a marketable skill so the prospect of making a \n     move to another occupation is nil. My only reasonable hope is \n     that Boise will increase our per mile fees in the near \n     future; it is unlikely that fuel prices will decrease in the \n     near future.\n       I have been watching your position on domestic drilling \n     with interest. Though alternative energy sources are \n     imperative for the future of America, I am pleased to see \n     that you share my position that energy self-reliance is the \n     immediate solution to our present crisis. I applaud you and \n     urge you to continue your good work and prosecute this agenda \n     with rigor.\n     Earle, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Not only is the fuel much too high but I cannot find \n     employment. I am over 60, have experience, but it seems I am \n     ``over-qualified'' or I need more ``experience''. What a lot \n     of rubbish! I call it age discrimination, but that is \n     difficult to prove. With the fuel prices so high, if I do \n     find employment, it will take a huge chunk of my pay just to \n     get back and forth to work.

Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the \ncareer and contributions of University of California, Davis, Chancellor \nLarry Vanderhoef for his 25 years of service to the university.\n  Chancellor Vanderhoef was born in a small Wisconsin town and was the \nfirst person in his family to graduate from high school. After high \nschool, he attended the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he \nearned a B.S. and M.S. in biology and later earned a Ph.D. in plant \nbiochemistry at Purdue University. Chancellor Vanderhoef began his \ncareer in education at the University of Illinois in 1970 as a faculty \nmember and was appointed provost at the University of Maryland, College \nPark, in 1980. He spent the next 4 years at the University of Maryland \nbefore heading west to California and the University of California, \nDavis, in 1984.\n  Chancellor Vanderhoef began his career at U.C. Davis serving as \nexecutive vice chancellor and later as provost/executive vice \nchancellor. In April 1994, Larry Vanderhoef was named the fifth \nchancellor of the University of California, Davis.\n  Under Chancellor Vanderhoef's leadership, U.C. Davis experienced a \nperiod of dramatic growth, adding 4 million square feet of office, \nclassroom, lab, and clinical space to support its 8,000 additional \nstudents and 44 percent more faculty. He revitalized the south end of \ncampus with the additions of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Performing \nArts Center, the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, \nand the Graduate School of Management.\n  During Chancellor Vanderhoef's tenure at Davis, the university was \ninvited to join the Association of American Universities, recognizing \nDavis's standing as a top research university. The campus has also been \nrecognized by U.S. News and World Report as the 11th best public \nuniversity and Washington Monthly recognized it as the 8th best \nuniversity for their contributions to society.\n  Over his career, Chancellor Vanderhoef has been honored for his \ndedicated leadership at U.C.

Madam President, I am honored to remember a great \nAmerican activist, environmental leader, mentor, and woman of service--\nDorothy Green, who passed away on October 13, 2008, at the age of 79.\n  Dorothy's career as a leading environmental activist for clean and \nsound water policy spanned three decades. She was well known for her \nself-taught expertise on clean oceans and responsible water management. \nShe also founded several well-known organizations that continue to make \nan impact on California's environment.\n  Dorothy Green was born in Detroit to Polish immigrants in 1929. She \nmoved to California where she graduated from the University of \nCalifornia, Berkley, with a degree in music. She married her husband \nJacob in 1951. For many years, Dorothy stayed home and took care of her \nchildren. In 1962, she began dedicating her life to volunteerism with \nher involvement in the Exceptional Children's Foundation, committed to \nhelping children with developmental disabilities--like her son, \nHershel.\n  Dorothy began advocating for water quality in 1972 when she \nvolunteered in a campaign to establish the California Coastal \nCommission. From there, Dorothy became president of the Los Angeles \nLeague of Conservation Voters, where she focused primarily on sewage \ntreatment. However, Dorothy is best known for forming one of the \nlargest, nonprofit environmental groups in Los Angeles in 1985, Heal \nthe Bay. Heal the Bay has grown to 15,000 members and fights to protect \ncoastal waters, clean up beaches, and reports on the\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nwater quality conditions of over 500 California beaches through its \nannual Beach Report Card.\n  Dorothy's work did not stop with Heal the Bay. She went on to found \nthe Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers Watershed Council to preserve, \nrestore, and enhance the economic, social, and environmental aspects of \nthe local watersheds. She also went on to help establish the Public \nOfficials for Water and Environmental Reform and the California Water \nImpact Network--both dedicated to water sustainability.\n  Even to the very last days of her life, when she was bedridden and \nunder hospice care, Dorothy fought for positive change. She wrote an \neditorial for the Los Angeles Times, pleading for sensible water \npolicy, and she even provided specific guidance on how to obtain it. \nDorothy inspired others to take action on environmental issues through \na life of dedicated leadership and service.\n  Green is survived by three sons, Joshua, Avrom and Herschel; two \nbrothers, Morris and Gerald; and three granddaughters, Jessica, \nKatherine and Tara. I send my deepest condolences to them.\n  Our Nation lost an amazing environmental activist with the passing of \nDorothy Green, but her legacy to the State of California and promotion \nof clean ocean water will live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10556-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALLENSWORTH, CALIFORNIA\n\n Mrs. Boxer. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of the Town of Allensworth, a town \nlocated in California's San Joaquin Valley founded by COL Allen \nAllensworth.\n  After his retirement, COL Allen Allensworth, who escaped slavery \nduring the Civil War to serve with the Union Army, arrived in \nCalifornia in hopes of developing a settlement where hard work and a \nstrong sense of community would enable the town's residents and future \ngenerations to realize their full potential as free citizens and \nwithout discrimination.\n  In 1908, the settlers eventually settled on a region located between \nFresno and Bakersfield in Tulare County, a site with an abundance of \nrich farm land, a site that they would name ``Allensworth'' in honor of \nthe Colonel whose belief in self-determination and liberty led them to \ncentral California.\n  In just a few years after its founding, the town of Allensworth grew \nfrom a remote outpost to a vibrant community with a school, church, and \na number of thriving businesses. The library in Allensworth was the \nfirst in Tulare County. Allensworth was a close-knit community where \nresidents often came together to participate in formal debates, plays, \nand a number of social activities.\n  After Colonel Allensworth's passing in 1914, a number of families \nremained in pursuit of his vision, and their dedication to the \nprinciples of freedom and liberty earned the town the title ``the town \nthat refused to die.''\n  In 1974, the California State Parks purchased the townsite of \nAllensworth, and it became the Colonel Allensworth Historic State Park, \nthe first State park that highlights the contributions made by African-\nAmerican pioneers to the State of California.\n  Today, the Allensworth Historic State Park, where many of the town's \noriginal buildings have been restored and reconstructed, provides a \nwindow for visitors to see the vision of COL Allen Allensworth, a true \nCalifornia pioneer.\n  The story of the town of Allensworth's years is a testament to the \nvalue of freedom and determination. As its many admirers gather to \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of Allensworth, I thank them for their \nsupport and wish them a successful and enjoyable visit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10556-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BRADLEY MOODY\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

On October 4, 2008, Officer Moody \nwas tragically injured in the line of duty, and passed away 3 days \nlater.\n  Officer Moody, 29 years old, was deeply committed to the city of \nRichmond. Shortly before his accident, he had received a commendation \nfor chasing down and arresting two suspects carrying concealed weapons \nin separate incidents in August 2008.\n  A K-9 officer and a member of the Richmond Police Department SWAT \nteam, Officer Moody was renowned for his extraordinary work ethic among \nfellow officers. He was also extremely personable; able to both fight \ncrime and interact with youth in the community. Throughout his career, \nOfficer Moody demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment \nto helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a respected and \nmodel member of the Richmond Police Department. Officer Moody's \ncolleagues will always remember him for his professionalism and \ndevotion to serving the public.\n  Officer Moody was a loving husband, proud father, and devoted friend. \nHe is survived by his wife, Susan, a former Richmond police dispatcher, \nand two young children. Officer Moody served the city of Richmond with \nhonor and dignity, and his contributions to his community and the many \nlives he touched will serve as a shining example of his legacy.\n  We will always be grateful for Officer Moody's service and the valor \nthat he displayed while serving and protecting the people of \nRichmond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10556-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10556-S10557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BARBRA STREISAND\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

In 1968, she earned the \nAcademy Award for Best Actress for her performance in her very first \nmotion picture, ``Funny Girl.'' In 1976, Barbra became the first female \ncomposer to win an Academy Award, for her song ``Evergreen'' from the \nfilm ``A Star Is Born.''\n  Barbra continued smashing glass ceilings when she became the first \nwoman ever to direct, write, and star in a major motion picture. \n``Yentl'' received five Academy Award nominations. She also directed, \nwrote, and starred in ``Prince of Tides,'' which received even more \nnominations, including one for Best Picture.

Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nDr. Valerie Woodruff--like me a native of West Virginia--upon her \nretirement as secretary of the Delaware Department of Education. \nValerie, known to her many admirers in the First State as Val, has \ndedicated the past 43 years of her career to education and served the \nlast 10 as Delaware's secretary of education, a position I was \nprivileged to nominated her to when I served as Delaware's Governor \nfrom 1993-2001.\n  After receiving her bachelor's degree in secondary education from the \nAlderson Broaddus College in Philippi, WV, Val began her career in \neducation as an English and social studies teacher at Bohemia Manor \nHigh School. She taught for 3 years before becoming a guidance \ncounselor and beginning to work towards her master's degree.\n  After receiving her master's degree in 1971 from the University of \nDelaware in guidance and counseling, Val moved to Delaware and became a \nguidance counselor at Delcastle Technical High School near Wilmington. \nFive years later, she became the school's assistant principal. During \nher time at Delcastle, she also served on the Governor's Advisory \nCouncil for Career and Vocational Education.\n  Val worked on her doctorate degree in vocational education and \ncurriculum development at Temple University while serving as assistant \nprincipal, then went on to become the principal at Middletown High \nSchool in 1984. She was an excellent principal, and her work did not go \nunnoticed. In June of 1990, she was selected as Principal of the Year \nby the Delaware Association of Secondary School Principals. During her \nwatch at Middletown High School, the first school-based wellness center \nwas established there. Today, in no small part because of her \nleadership, every public high school has a wellness center where \nstudents receive help and support to enable them to succeed in school \nand in life.\n  Later, Dr. Woodruff served as the associate secretary for improvement \nand assistance in the areas of curriculum and instruction at the \ndepartment of education for 7 years. In 1999, I nominated her be \nsecretary of education, overseeing the implementation of our State's \neducation improvement plan which focuses on rigorous academic \nstandards; objectively measuring student progress toward those \nstandards; and holding schools, school districts, students, educators \nand parents accountable for improving student achievement. Val has \nemerged as a national leader among our Nation's chief school officers \nand has worked closely with her peers and with the U.S. Department of \nEducation to develop and modify the Leave No Student Behind law and to \nnarrow the achievement in Delaware and across America.\n  Val has a long list of accomplishments and is leaving big shoes to \nfill for the next secretary of education. She is a member of many \nprestigious boards including the board of directors of the Council of \nChief State School Officers on which she was president from 2005-2006, \nthe Southern Regional Education Board on which she was the first K-12 \neducator to be elected vice-chair, and the Delaware Workforce \nInvestment Board.\n  Dr. Woodruff also currently serves on the Vision 2015 Steering and \nImplementation Committee and is on the President's Policy Council for \nthe Alliance for Excellent Education. In addition, she is a valued \nmember of the Delaware Mentoring Council and of the Delaware State \nChamber of Commerce Partnership.\n  Through her tireless efforts, Valerie Woodruff has made a positive \ndifference in the lives of tens of thousands of students in Delaware \nand, in doing so, has enhanced the quality of life in our State for \nyears to come. Upon her retirement, she will leave behind a legacy of \ncommitment to education and to public service for generations to \nfollow. I thank her for the friendship that we share, and I \ncongratulate her on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. In \nclosing, on behalf of the people of Delaware, I want to wish Val and \nher family the very best in all that lies ahead for each of \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10557-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING MERCY CLINICS, INC.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to extend my warm \ncongratulations to Mercy Clinics, Inc., based in Des Moines, for \nearning the prestigious 2008 Acclaim Award from the American Medical \nGroup Association. This award is an extraordinary honor, given annually \nto the medical group that best exemplifies delivery of the highest \nquality health care in the United States.\n  Mercy Clinics, Inc. operates health care facilities throughout the \ngreater Des Moines area, and has a long history of innovation. The 2008 \nAcclaim Award is just the latest national recognition of Mercy's \nexceptional commitment to high-quality patient care--something we \ndeeply appreciate in Iowa.\n  I prize my long-standing relationship with Mercy Medical Center in \nDes Moines, the partner of Mercy Clinics. I will be forever grateful to \nthe Sisters of Mercy for providing care to my chronically ill father, \nmany years ago, at a time when my family could not afford the costs of \nhospitalization. He received not only quality medical attention at \nMercy, but also a generous measure of caring and kindness that remain \nthe signature of Mercy Medical Center and Mercy Clinics to this day. \nThe way that Mercy has retained these traditional human factors while \nproviding state-of-the-art, 21st century clinical practice is obviously \na winning formula--indeed, an award-winning formula.\n  In presenting the award, the American Medical Group Association cited \nMercy Clinics' pioneering research into the best ways to care for \npeople with chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood \npressure. The staff at Mercy Clinics created a program called ``Medical \nHome,'' which includes a team of ``Health Coaches'' who review \npatients' medical records and provide ongoing support for patients both \nface-to-face and over the phone, including advice on nutrition, \nexercise, and treatment management. Outcomes showed significant \nimprovement in patient blood sugar and blood pressure control.\n  I salute the visionary leadership of Dr. David Swieskowski, vice \npresident for quality improvement for Mercy Clinics along with the \npartners who collaborated to make this project, not only successful, \nbut a national award winner: Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield provided \ngrant funding to hire the first health coaches and whose ``pay for \nperformance'' program rewards population based care; the Iowa \nFoundation for Medical Care who provided the Care Measures Disease \nRegistry; Des Moines University who collaborated on health coach \neducation and certification; Pfizer who provided initial health coach \ntraining in patient self-management support; the Institute for \nHealthcare Improvement whose IMPACT program model helped Mercy Clinics \nshape their program; and New Health Partnerships who also provided \ngrant assistance. I also commend the commitment to quality and \nexcellence that pervades the entire family of Mercy health care \nprofessionals.\n  I congratulate all of them for a job well done. I look forward to \nworking with them--and benefiting from their counsel--as the new 111th \nCongress addresses health care reform, with a strong emphasis on \nwellness and prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10557-3", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10557-S10558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN J.

Under his \nleadership, the chamber grew immensely, going from 450 members to \n1,820. John demonstrated a remarkable ability to bring people from all \nwalks of life together behind a project. He played an integral role in \nsecuring State and Federal funding for the extension of route 72, which \nwill help commuters in central Connecticut and provide a significant \nboost to merchants in downtown Bristol.\n  John's tenure with the chamber was the capstone of a lifetime spent \nserving Bristol. He was the mayor from 1984-1991, where he was elected \nto four terms. Before being elected mayor, he\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\nwas a cop for the Bristol Police Department. He has served as secretary \nof the Bristol Boys and Girls Club and as treasurer of the Metro \nChambers of Commerce organization, which is composed of the seven \nlargest chambers in Connecticut.

PARSONS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I pay tribute to Special \nAgent Matthew E. Parsons of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, \nNCIS, who is retiring from employment with the Federal Government on \nDecember 20, 2008. Special Agent Parsons is retiring after 36 years in \nlaw enforcement, with the last 27 years of Federal Government service \nwith NCIS. Of special note and atypical of his peers, he volunteered \nand recently completed a high risk assignment as the Director of the \nStrategic Counterintelligence Directorate, Multi-National Force-Iraq, \nBaghdad, Iraq.\n  During the course of Special Agent Parsons' career in government \nservice, he rose from a GS-7 to a GS-15 Special Agent. In his final \nposition with NCIS, he was assigned as the Assistant Director for \nFinancial Management & Planning at NCIS Headquarters, Washington Navy \nYard, Washington, DC.\n  Special Agent Parsons, Federal law enforcement career began August \n1981 with the Naval Investigative Service--the precursor of today's \nNCIS. His first assignment was to Norfolk, VA, at the time when the \nJohn Walker, Jr., spy ring was uncovered. During the early stages of \nthe investigation, Special Agent Parsons was assigned as the NIS case \nagent. In August 1985, he transferred to overseas duty at Yokosuka, \nJapan, where he continued working in the foreign counterintelligence \narena.\n  In 1988, Special Agent Parsons was transferred to Naval Air Station \nPatuxent River, MD. While conducting an investigation into a sensitive \nbreach of security, he developed the ground work for future NCIS \ncomputer investigations. Special Agent Parsons utilized innovative \nmethods to hone his computer investigative skills which ultimately led \nto the development of agency capabilities to conduct investigations of \nhacking, intrusions, and sabotage of U.S. Government computer systems \nand networks.\n  In December 1993, due to his outstanding efforts in computer crime \ninvestigations he was transferred to NCIS Headquarters to establish a \ncomputer crimes department for the agency. Special Agent Parsons and \nhis team, reaching nearly 50 members, developed agency and Department \nof Navy strategies and capabilities which included immediate reporting \nrequirements upon the slightest indication of a technological or \ninformation intrusion. In addition, he and his team worked closely with \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Armed Forces \nCenter for Child Protection in the forefront of keeping our Nation's \nfuture generation safe from exploitation through child pornography and \nonline predators.\n  In October 2000, Special Agent Parsons was promoted and transferred \nto Okinawa, Japan as the Resident Agent-in-Charge. During his tenure in \nOkinawa he led an office primarily responsible to support U.S. Marine \nCorps forces and operations throughout the East Asia and Pacific \nregion. He and his team developed a fly-away team concept capable of \nproviding on demand support to operating U.S. Naval forces. This \nexpeditionary team was tested in early October 2002 when a bomb \nexploded outside a popular restaurant in Zamboanga, Philippines, \nkilling two U.S. military members and injuring 20 others. Within 14 \nhours of the event, the NCIS Okinawa fly-away team was at the scene \nproviding invaluable criminal and forensic investigative support.\n  In May 2003, Special Agent Parsons was promoted Special Agent-in-\nCharge of the NCIS Far East Field Office in Yokosuka, Japan. It was \nduring this assignment that he developed a neighbor-to-neighbor program \nwhich forged a bond with the local Japanese community and served as an \nearly warning and indicator of potential criminal or terrorist threats \nto U.S. military personnel living within the community.\n  In January 2007, Special Agent Parsons was transferred to NCIS \nHeadquarters where he became the assistant director for financial \nmanagement and planning. Special Agent Parsons oversaw the agency's \nstrategic planning process, developed financial plans and budget \ninitiatives, and conducted evaluations of office implementation plans \nand performances.\n  Demonstrating the extent of his dedication to duty and exceptional \ncharacter, Special Agent Parsons volunteered for a high risk assignment \nas the Director of the Multi-National Force-Iraq Strategic \nCounterintelligence Directorate, SCID, Baghdad, Iraq. Serving in Iraq \nfrom December 29, 2007 until June 24, 2008, he led a 109-member joint-\nservice team in a complete strategic refocus of the mission resulting \nin increased collaboration among assets, increased standardization in \nreporting, and ultimately better support to the war fighter.\n  As a testament to his distinguished career, Special Agent Parsons \nreceived several awards including the Meritorious Civilian Services \nAward, the Department of Defense Global War on Terrorism Civilian \nService Medal and the NCIS Expeditionary Medal. Special Agent Parsons \nalso received numerous accolades from senior Navy leadership and \npublished six articles regarding computer crime investigations in \nprofessional periodicals.\n  The Navy, the State of Maryland, and the Nation are lucky to have had \nthe service of such a great Special Agent. He will be sorely missed. I \nwish him and his family all the best as they embark on the next chapter \nof their lives. Fair winds and following seas!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10558-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10558-S10559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING WILLIAM YUAN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate a \nyoung man who has not only achieved beyond his years but has also \nadvanced the state of the art of solar power technology. William Yuan \nof Beaverton, OR, is a seventh grader at Meadow Park Middle School \nwhose achievements are both jaw-dropping and important.\n  Recently, William earned a $25,000 scholarship from the Davidson \nInstitute and became a Davidson Fellow for his work in renewable energy \nresearch. William's project, ``A Highly-Efficient 3-Dimensional \nNanotube Solar Cell for Visible and UV Light,'' featured a novel solar \npanel that enables light absorption from visible to ultraviolet light. \nThe carbon nanotubes William designed can overcome the barriers of \nelectron movement, doubling the light-electricity conversion \nefficiency. His optimized design provides 500 times more light \nabsorption than commercially available solar cells and nine times more \nthan the cutting-edge, three-dimensional solar cell.\n  Given the current energy crisis, everyone must pitch in to reduce our \ndependence on oil consumption. In Congress and in the private sector, \nwe are working to facilitate advancements in renewable energies. \nHowever, we cannot be successful without brilliant minds like \nWilliam's.\n  Winning the Davidson scholarship is far from William's only \nachievement. This year alone, William won second place at the Northwest \nScience Expo, Best Engineering Project at the Institute of Electrical \nand Electronics Engineers, and second place at the Oregon Chess for \nSuccess State Tournament. The list goes on. Last year, William also \nreceived a junior black belt pum certification from the World Taekwondo \nHeadquarters in Seoul, Korea. He has also received a number of awards \nfrom various Intel Oregon competitions and First Place in Oregon in the \nJohns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth Talent Search in both \nquantitative and verbal sections.\n  At 12 years old, William is only just getting started. He intends to \ncontinue his research in renewable energy and eventually select a major \nfor his college study toward a Ph.D. degree. John F. Kennedy once said:\n\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\n\n       Our nation's first great leaders were also our first great \n     scholars.\n\n  I look forward to watching William progress as a scholar and a \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10559-1", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RANDY PAPE\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, one of the great privileges of \npublic life is meeting people who make a difference through the sheer \nstrength of their personalities and their enthusiasm for wanting to \nmake the world a better place. One of those people was Randy Pape. I \nrise today to recognize what Randy meant to my State and to me \npersonally.\n  On Thursday, November 6, Randy died of a heart attack at the all-too-\nyoung age of 58. News accounts of his passing referred to Randy as a \n``Eugene businessman'' who built his family's small implement business \ninto a regional giant employing 2,000 people in seven States.\n  But Randy was much more that. He was vintage Oregonian--relentless, \neffective, and tenacious. To Randy, no project was too big, no public \nservice too small.\n  He was also my friend, and I will miss him every day.\n  My most enduring image is of a smiling Randy reacting to some idea \nthat would improve the lives of Oregonians--actually, of everybody--by \npumping his arm and saying: ``We've got to do it. We've got to do it.'' \nThe sound of his voice will always be with me, urging me on to embrace \nthe things he believed in with the same enthusiasm.\n  Randy lived in Eugene all his life, but gave himself to the entire \nState. Growing his grandfather's business from a local equipment sales \noperation to a seven-State conglomerate was just a part of what he \naccomplished. During his life he helped raise nearly $600 million for \nbuildings at his alma mater, the University of Oregon. His tenure on \nthe Oregon Transportation Commission resulted in a $1.3 billion, 10-\nyear program of bridge repair and replacement that remade Interstate 5, \nthe heart of Oregon's transportation system. As head of the United Way \nof Lane County's fundraising campaign, he set a $1 million goal that \neveryone thought was impossible and then achieved it. He served on the \nboard of The Nature Conservancy of Oregon, the Oregon Trail Council of \nBoy Scouts of America, as well as other nonprofit organizations such as \nthe Oregon Business Council Steering Committee.\n  Randy had two other great passions that can never be overlooked. \nThere was his love for Susie, his wife of 34 years, and their three \nwonderful and successful sons, Ryan, Christian and Jordan. Then there \nwas his unflagging devotion to the University of Oregon Ducks football \nteam. In fact, Randy and Susie met at a U of O football game in 1971.\n  This is only a partial list of what Randy helped achieve for my \nState, but it is a window into who Randy Pape was and what he was \ncapable of doing. His wife described him best: ``He was the most \npositive person, the most upbeat. He was a joy to live with.''\n  In 1997, Randy was diagnosed with a severe form of cancer and wasn't \nexpected to live that long. But in true Randy Pape fashion, he fought \non, never losing that trademark enthusiasm and determination. In the \nend, it was not the cancer that took him from us. It was something \nthat, ironically, he had more of than anyone I have ever known his \nheart.\n  I know that Randy would take great satisfaction in cheating the \ncancer that tried to kill him. As his oldest son, Ryan, said: ``I know \nhe's looking down from heaven right now saying, Guys, I beat the \ncancer.' ''\n  I would say: ``Randy, of course you did.''\n  Randy Pape was a great Oregonian who will always have a place in my \nheart and in the hearts of the thousands of people who knew him and \nwere touched by his unselfishness and dedication to doing the right \nthing.\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, the late Oregon Governor Tom \nMcCall once said:\n\n       Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. They \n     are individuals who say, ``This is my community and it is my \n     responsibility to make it better.''\n\n  The community of Eugene and the entire State of Oregon lost a true \nhero 2 weeks ago with the untimely passing of Randy Pape. I have had \nthe privilege of dealing with countless community leaders during my 12 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, but I can't think of anyone who was more \ndedicated to making his community, State, and Nation better than was \nRandy.\n  As the chief executive officer of The Pape Group, a 2,000-employee, \nseven-State conglomerate of industrial equipment, aviation and \nrecycling businesses, Randy was one of Oregon's most respected and \nadmired corporate leaders.\n  Guiding his business empire was more than a full-time job, yet Randy \nfound time to give his talent and treasure to an endless variety of \nworthy causes. There was no bigger booster of his alma mater, the \nUniversity of Oregon, than Randy. There was no better cheerleader and \nfundraiser for the United Way than Randy. As a member of the Oregon \nTransportation Commission, there was no better advocate for Oregon's \nroads and highways than Randy. There was no more committed member of \nthe Nature Conservancy of Oregon, and the Oregon Trail Council of Boy \nScouts of America than Randy. I had no wiser counselor than Randy.\n  And above all, there was no one who loved and cherished his family \nmore than Randy.\n  Randy's wonderful wife, Susie, was at his side for 34 years. She knew \nhim better than anyone else, and she captured him better than anyone \nelse, when she said:\n\n       He was the most positive person, the most upbeat. He was a \n     joy to live with.\n\n  Randy was justifiably very proud of his three sons, Ryan, Christian, \nand Jordan, all of whom chose to follow their dad into the family \nbusiness, and all of whom inherited his values of honesty, decency, and \na dedication to making their community better.\n  The Greek poet Sophocles, once wrote:\n\n       One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day \n     has been.'' For his family, his friends, his community, his \n     State, and our Nation, the evening of Randy's life came much, \n     much too soon. But let us take solace in the fact that in \n     that evening, Randy Pape could look back at a life filled \n     with the love of family; a life filled with accomplishment; a \n     life filled with making a positive difference; a life filled \n     with the heroism that came from making his community better, \n     and say: The day has indeed been splendid. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/11/17/senate-section/article/S10559-2", "month": "11", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10559-S10560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING RECESS\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on October 3, 2008, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the House has agreed to the following concurrent resolution, in \nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Levin, and Ms. \n        Stabenow):\n  S. 3684. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan above-the-line deduction against individual income tax for interest \nin indebtedness and for State sales and excise taxes with respect to \nthe purchase of certain motor vehicles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our economy is in shambles. People are \nlosing their jobs, they are losing their life savings, and they are \nlosing their homes. Congress must act and we must act now.\n  I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, that this \nsession of the Congress and this session of the Senate should not be \ncalled a lameduck. We should neither be lame nor should we duck the big \nissue facing our country. We have helped out. If you look at what we \nhave done already--well, we have already done a bailout. We helped the \nsharks and we helped the whales. Now it is time to help the minnows, \nthe little guy and gal, the American consumer.\n  I have that solution. Today, I introduce legislation, cosponsored by \nmy colleague from Missouri, to save jobs in the American automobile \nindustry, to help consumers, and get our economy back on track. It is \nsimple, it is straightforward, and it is bipartisan. It is also timely \nand temporary.\n  My bill would save jobs. What is it that I want to do? I want to \nstimulate demand in the automobile industry so people actually come \ninto showrooms and buy cars, minivans, or light trucks. Why is this a \ngood idea? Actually, if you buy a car, someone has to make it, someone \nhas to sell it, someone has to service it, and someone has to provide \nadministrative services. This is good for manufacturers, the dealers, \nand the suppliers. It could save considerable jobs in the auto \nindustry.\n  My bill is not about bailouts. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. Six \nmillion jobs are at stake in the American car industry. One out of ten \njobs in America relies on the auto industry. Right now, the facts are \ngloomy. Sales are down. The auto industry has already cut over 100,000 \njobs. The 30,000 American dealerships in this country are at risk of \nlosing 37,000 jobs. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let the \nAmerican automobile industry implode.\n  I believe we can help by getting the consumers into the showroom, \nhave them feel that Government is on their side in helping them with \none of the biggest purchases during this tough time.\n  What does this amendment do? My bill is simple. If you buy a \npassenger car, minivan, or light truck between November 12 of this year \nand December 31 of 2009, you will get a tax deduction for your sales or \nexcise tax and the interest on your loan. Families can save anywhere \nfrom $2,000 to $5,000 by the Mikulski-Bond bill.\n  This is a big deal because, next to the purchase of your home, the \npurchase of your automobile is your next big ticket.\n  It is targeted. I cap it at families with an income of over $250,000 \na year. It focuses on the middle-income and the middle-class family \ncars. It is also timely because we need to know that the biggest 6-week \nperiod for automobile sales is between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. \nThey sell other cars during 6-week periods, but between Thanksgiving \nand New Year's\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nEve is the biggest 6-week sale. This bill also helps the environment \nbecause it gets more people in more fuel-efficient cars.\n  This bill is not limited to only American cars. It focuses on any \ncar, recognizing that many automobiles are now made in southern States, \nas Texas does Toyotas; Kentucky does Toyotas; Tennessee does Nissans. \nAny way we look at it, even though it might have a foreign logo, it is \nAmerican jobs doing the manufacturing.\n  What would this mean? I have here a chart--it is bigger than me--for \na Dodge minivan. The average minivans cost about $25,500.\n  On a 4-year loan at an 8 percent excise tax, it would result in a \nsavings of anywhere, depending on the State, from $1,500 to $2,000.\n  I have already heard from people all over this country how that, plus \nthe deals being offered by manufacturers and dealers, could result in \nbeing able to buy a minivan for under $20,000 a year.\n  This would be fantastic. I could put up chart after chart for the \nMalibu, for the Ford pickup 150, for the Toyota Camry. This would \nstimulate demand. Just think what it means. People could come into a \nshowroom of their choice, and if we passed this bill--it would be \nretroactive to the day I announced they could actually buy something \nthat would put them on the road with a car that is more fuel efficient \nwith lower carbon emissions.\n  At the same time, jobs, jobs, jobs. As I said, there are 30,000 new \ncar dealerships nationwide. They employ close to 1 million people. In \nmy own home State there are 300 dealerships. People do not realize that \ndealers in many rural parts of my State usually employ over 50 people \nin sales, the auto mechanics, as well as the administrative positions. \nThis legislation would help them because they would actually be \nworking. It would help the people who are actually making those.\n  Senator Specter said he has been traveling the State. I have been \ntraveling mine too. I went to the General Motors plant in Maryland at \nWhite Marsh where they make the new power transmission. Right now they \ncan make a Tahoe hybrid, a Tahoe, a big muscle car, that with the \nhybrid technology they have now, can get the same mileage as a Toyota \nCamry.\n  If you also talk to the people who worked there, they could employ \n1,000; they now employ 250 people. If you were with me in the car \ndealership and would talk to people such as the mechanic--I talked to a \nmechanic who works for a Chevy dealer in Bethesda. He has worked there \nfor 23 years.\n  He said to me: Senator Barb, all my life I have loved to work on \ncars. I just love it. I love to fix them; I love to repair them. If \nthey are new, I want to make sure they are fit for duty. I have earned \na good living. I have been happy. I think I have helped make a lot of \nother people happy. But the only way I can stay happy is if I continue \nto work. I have a mortgage. I have two kids in college. Maybe they are \ngoing to go into engineering, I do not know, but I know if we do not \nget more people into this dealership my job could be gone.\n  Talk to the dealer. The dealer's name is Sam. The first thing you \nknow about him is he wears the little Rotary pin on his lapel because \nhe is the guy who not only provides jobs, tries to provide good deals \nto customers, but also is the one who is part of the Chamber of \nCommerce, part of the United Way.\n  We are talking about people who are part of the fabric of our \nsociety. We are not talking about an abstraction. We are not talking \nabout a single ZIP code like Wall Street. We are talking about the \nautomobile industry in every State and every community. So when we help \nthem, we are helping ourselves.\n  People say: what is the cost of this, Senator Barb? Well, I will tell \nyou. It is about $8 billion. They go: Oh, well, we just spent $350 \nbillion and threw it down the rat hole. We do not have anything to show \nfor this $350 billion but more arrogance and more greed. While they \nwant Americans to dine on Lean Cuisine, they are dining on spa cuisine.\n  So I think it is time we help people in our own community, help the \nconsumers who want to participate in the economy. Clunkers get traded \nin, and we also help them. Maybe you know somebody who works for a \nhedge fund, I do not. But I do know the people who work for the \nautomobile industry--whether it is the dealers or the receptionist who \ncame to work 43 years ago right out of high school who said: Senator \nBarb, we could not sell cars in those days, but I have been here in and \nout of this same dealer for 43 years, raised my kids, earned a good \nliving, did the back office work. I want to keep on doing it. I am not \nready for Social Security, and, for God's sake, do not put it in Wall \nStreet.\n  Well, I say do not put Social Security on Wall Street and do not put \nanother nickel on Wall Street. If we are going to help with our \neconomy, let's do it where it creates jobs.\n  I wanted to explain the bill I have introduced today that I am going \nto bring up as part of our economic recovery plan on Wednesday. But \nmost of all, what I wanted to say is, the Congress should not go home \nuntil we see how we are going to help this economy get rolling.\n  I think my bill which has been cosponsored by Senator Bond puts \nwheels on the American economy, and I hope I have victory on it later \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to join and partner \nwith my good friend, Senator Mikulski, on this initiative to save \nAmerican jobs, help American families, support the auto industry, as \nshe has just said, and put America back on wheels.\n  During those tough economic times, we believe this proposal will help \nAmerican families afford the cars, small trucks, and SUVs they need to \nget to work, to take their kids to school, and encourage investment \nneeded to boost auto sales which will help save American jobs, help \nmiddle-class families, and support the auto industry.\n  Selling cars, again, is one of the most important things we can do \nfor the entire auto industry, by encouraging now tentative buyers who \nare worried about making the payments to go ahead and purchase. This is \nthe best way to get our auto industry back to work and provide the jobs \npeople need.\n  In my home State of Missouri and throughout the Nation car sales have \ndeclined sharply in recent months, and there will likely be a further \ndecline as the economy struggles. Cars and trucks are one of the \nlargest purchases for households. Most rely on some kind of financing \nto acquire the vehicles.\n  By making interest payments and sales and excise taxes deductible, \nthis program will help middle-class families afford the cars, SUVs, and \nlight trucks they need to get to work and take their kids to school. \nThis should mean real savings to middle-class families who are \nstruggling to pay a mortgage or rent, buy groceries, and afford health \ncare.\n  This proposal also helps the struggling auto industry and millions of \njobs that are dependent on them: auto suppliers, steel and glass \nmanufacturers, and the car dealers.\n  There are closing car dealerships in Missouri. They are shutting \ntheir doors, laying off workers, cutting jobs. Others are facing real \nsqueezes. They, too, may be facing this same crisis if they do not get \npeople purchasing cars.\n  With our economy shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past \nseveral months, it is critical that we act now to prevent further \nlosses to an industry that touches the entire Nation.\n  Now, in addition to this tax proposal, I think we must take action to \nprovide bridge loan financing to Detroit's big three auto companies. \nThe idea of getting Government involved in the free market is \ntroublesome and potentially dangerous to the health of our system, but \nI strongly believe we have to act in unique times of crisis when \nmillions of workers are in danger of losing their jobs. We are clearly \nin this unique crisis. We are experiencing a crisis unparalleled since \nthe Great Depression.\n  It is for that reason that I will not turn my back on hundreds of \nthousands of Missouri jobs. Now is the time to act. Unlike many other \nindustries, the auto industry touches, as I said, millions of \nmanufacturing and servicing jobs across the Nation.\n  Over 100,000 auto workers are in assembly plants, more than 1 million \nworkers are at auto dealerships in every State, over 300,000 workers \nare in the wholesale end of the auto industry,\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\nover 800,000 workers work in auto repair, and over 500,000 workers are \nin auto parts plants.\n  These autoworkers are not just in big cities such as Detroit. \nAutoworkers are found supporting families in small- and medium-sized \ncommunities across rural America.\n  In my home State of Missouri, small towns such as Maryville in \nnorthwest Missouri have 10,000 people, and 1,800 families depend upon \nthe 200 workers at the Federal-Mogul plant. They are making steering \nsystems. Closing that plant will be a tough blow to the Maryville \ncommunity dependent upon it.\n  We have 500 jobs at the Dura plant in Moberly, 400 at the Gates plant \nin Versailles, 170 at the Modine plant in Joplin. On and on it goes, \nlike a long list of just about every Missouri small- and medium-sized \ntown. We cannot afford to pull the plug on the manufacturing backbone \nof rural America.\n  These auto-dependent jobs, whether they are union or not--and many \nare not--provide very good wages. They are manufacturing jobs that \nsupport middle-class families. They provide health care benefits for \nfamilies, retirement for the elderly, and a couple weeks of paid \nvacation. Without these blue-collar jobs, many of these middle-class \nfamilies would slip back into lower incomes with no health care, little \nhope for college, and an uncertain future. We have to fight for working \npeople and their jobs and not allow their employers to go under.\n  Despite the real need for temporary emergency assistance to save jobs \nin Missouri and across the country, I do not support a blank check from \nthe Government. I want to make sure we are not simply throwing good \nmoney after bad. It is critical that any rescue include three basic \nprinciples: First, the bill must have strong taxpayer protection. This \nmeans any bill must ensure that taxpayers are repaid for their \nemergency assistance and that taxpayers share in the turnaround profits \nof participating automakers.\n  Second, the bill must include executive accountability so that failed \nexecutives are not rewarded for poor management. I do not know about \nyou, but I am offended when I read in the paper that companies getting \nFederal bailout money are using it to pay bonuses. Some of them said \nthey have already set the bonuses aside. Well, if they set the bonuses \naside, they set them aside as their company was going down. Getting \nmoney from the Federal Government should not enable them to make those \nbonus payments.\n  I have seen one major Wall Street firm saying it is going to stop \nbonuses until this crisis is over. I think that is something we should \ncommend. I think that is a practice that ought to be followed.\n  Third, and most important--and this is key--the bill must include \nsignificant financial reform so that recipients of taxpayer funds \ndemonstrate that they have a plan to ensure long-term competitiveness, \nhealth, and profitability by bringing their costs under control.\n  Funds should be conditioned on a strong restructuring plan for the \nindustry and for each recipient to have funds so that this aid is a \nbridge to somewhere, not a bridge to nowhere. That is why I need to \nemphasize the need for a real financial strategy that will put the \nDetroit big three on the road to competitiveness, health, and \nprofitability.\n  I believe we ought to set up a system where a responsible Government \nagency, a Secretary-level official, has to approve the continuing \nplans, the goals, the definable standards that must be met, and that \nofficial ought to hold them accountable for accomplishing the purposes, \ncutting the costs, and making the tough business decisions that are \nnecessary to assure profitability.\n  Well, these are things I believe most of my colleagues want to see. I \ndo not believe anybody wants to see the auto industry go down. But \nthere is real concern that if we put in some money now, we may be back \nseeing them in the same condition several months down the road.\n  Well, the time has come for the auto industry to lay out for \nGovernment officials in their ability to approve the release of these \nfunds if they have a plan. And as they go forward, they ought to be \nrequired to show the approving official that they are taking those \nsteps that are necessary to make their plants and their companies \nprofitable.\n  Some ask: Why don't we just allow the automakers to fall into \nbankruptcy like some in the airline industry? We all know bankruptcy \nhas successfully allowed many airlines to get back in the air. I am \nafraid it would be a disaster for the thousands of parts and service \nbusinesses dependent on major automakers. How would they get credit to \nrun their operations to supply a company in bankruptcy? How would the \nbankrupt company in the current crisis get the credit it needs to \nemerge from bankruptcy? Who is going to buy a car from a bankrupt \ncompany? What protections would they have for their warranties and \nother requirements they have for servicing?\n  Others say a financial rescue has no place in the free market. I \nagree that generally that is a good question. But even free markets \nneed oversight and a safety net. That is why we have the Federal \nReserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation. Each of these agencies is designed to \ntake emergency actions in times of emergency. Clearly, that is what we \nhave. That is why we should respond now.\n  There have been a lot of discussions on the source of funding for the \nauto industry, whether it should come out of the Treasury's Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, or TARP, or the Department of Energy's Section \n136 program. I am pleased to see that there seems to be broad support \nfor assisting the auto industry despite the differences in funding. I \nsupport either or both of these measures of support, provided we meet \nthe conditions I laid out which include significantly laying out a plan \nto profitability, cost cutting that will be approved and then will be \nmonitored by the appropriate Government official who has the power to \ncontinue to release the funds.\n  I will discuss in other remarks how the TARP has changed in purpose \nfrom what we were told it would be. It has continued to change. I am \nafraid it has caused a great deal of uncertainty, which, obviously, \nmarkets do not like. But before closing, I wish to suggest an area \nwhere there is great need and where I believe the funds under the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program can and should be used to give the \neconomy a major boost, creating the jobs we badly need, and that is in \nState and local government infrastructure.\n  Despite the Government's efforts to thaw the credit crunch, State and \nlocal governments continue to face hardships in municipal bond \nfinancing. People were telling me, once we got the money into the \nbanks, credit would loosen up and municipal bonds could be sold. So \nfar, we are not seeing that. State and local bond and debt financing is \nstill a problem. In Missouri and throughout the Nation, many \ninfrastructure projects are being delayed or scaled back due to credit \nproblems, the inability to get credit, and they have not faced it in \nmany years.\n  Even State and local governments with high credit ratings are \nstruggling to obtain affordable financing. In Missouri, for example, we \nhave some $800 million approved in debt to rebuild our bridges. The \ncity of Kansas City, MO, has $200 million it is ready to spend on its \nwater and sewer infrastructure. The St. Louis Airport is badly in need \nof funding for $100 million in upgrades to facilitate commerce and \ncontinue to provide jobs. I believe the funds should be used to \npurchase those portions of those debts that can be used to put people \nto work in 2009. Not all of the $800 million on fixing bridges is going \nto be spent in 1 year, but there should be a reasonable judgment as to \nhow much work can be started when construction season begins in the \nspring.\n  We ought to be willing to have the Federal Government provide the \nfunding and get the debt issuance in return, which, if they fund it at \nthe current going rate for debt with the Federal Government, should be \na no-cost ultimate cost to the taxpayer or an addition to the debt. But \nwhat these infrastructure jobs will do right now is provide work so \nthat working men and women will be able to do things such as buy cars, \nprovide for their families, spend the money to get the economy growing \nagain.\n  I urge Treasury to consider assisting the municipal bond market \nthrough the TARP program. It will not only\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\nboost infrastructure investments, build the critical infrastructure we \nneed to make our economy go forward, but it will create jobs. As has \nbeen said many times before by people a lot smarter than I, a good job \nis the best social policy we have. A good job is the basis of the \neconomy.\n  What we are advocating today in the bill I cosponsored with Senator \nMikulski is a way to get cars sold so they will create jobs all up and \ndown the chain in the auto industry and provide a bridge to somewhere \nfor the future of the auto industry so they will get their costs under \ncontrol, keep them out of bankruptcy, and make the changes that are \nneeded to be competitive in the national and the world market.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in the legislation by Senator \nMikulski and also in pushing to use the TARP funds for investment in \nmunicipal bonds that will put people to work on infrastructure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3685. A bill to prohibit the selling and counterfeiting of tickets \nfor a Presidential inaugural ceremony; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor as chairman of the \nRules Committee and as chairman of the Joint House-Senate Inaugural \nCommittee. I come to introduce legislation to prohibit the selling and \ncounterfeiting of tickets to the President's inauguration ceremony.\n  The inauguration of the President of the United States is one of the \nmost important rituals of our democracy, and the chance to witness this \nsolemn event should not be bought and sold similar to tickets to a \nfootball game. This is not a football game. This is a dignified and \ncritical moment of transition in Government, a moment of which \nAmericans have always been proud because it is, in fact, the strength \nof our democracy--the fact that all across this great land people go to \nthe polls and elect the next President of the United States, they don't \ntake to the streets, they don't take to weapons. They elect the next \nPresident of the United States.\n  We have all read the news reports: Tickets bid on the Internet for \n$5,000 apiece, some going as high as $40,000 each. Internet sites today \nare selling tickets they do not have and will not have unless somehow, \nsome way they obtain them. I find it unconscionable.\n  These tickets are supposed to be free for people, for the volunteers \nwho gave up their weekends, walking miles door to door to encourage \nvoters to turn out at the polls on election day, for Members of the \nAfrican-American community to see one of their own take the oath of \noffice, the highest office in the land, for schoolchildren to witness \nhistory, and for the American public to watch this affirmation of our \nConstitution, this peaceful transition from one administration to \nanother.\n  This is going to be a major civic event of our time. Excitement is at \nan all time high, and every one of us has received more phone calls for \ntickets than we could possibly ever meet. People are desperate to \nbecome part of it, to touch it, to be around, to feel it, to listen to \nit, and they are coming from all over the country. We could have more \nthan 1.5 million people descend on the Nation's Capital for this \ninauguration.\n  Congress has the responsibility of overseeing this historic event. So \nwe must ensure that the inauguration has all the respect and dignity it \ndeserves.\n  These tickets are supposed to be free for the people. No one should \nhave to pay for them. Once more, these tickets are not yet even \navailable. They will not be distributed to congressional offices until \nthe end of the week before the inauguration. And then the offices will \nrequire in-person pickup, with secure identification. But they will be \nfree and they should stay that way.\n  I can tell you what I am going to do. We will ask people to pick up \ntheir tickets the day before the inauguration in my office. Everyone \nwill submit their name, their address, and their driver's license. They \nmust be who they are if there are tickets waiting for them. I believe \nthis kind of procedure essentially deters unscrupulous people from \nselling these tickets on the Internet. No Web sites or other ticket \noutlets have inaugural swearing-in tickets to sell, despite what some \nof them claim.\n  This legislation is aimed at stopping those who seek to profit by \nselling these tickets. It would also target those who seek to dupe the \npublic with fraudulent tickets or those who merely promise but can't \ndeliver on tickets that they do not actually have.\n  I want to say one thing. We are working now to see if there is any \ncreative way we might be able to secure more tickets for the House and \nthe Senate. We have followed protocol with exactly the same \ndistribution system that existed in prior inaugurals, but it is clear \nthat there are not as many tickets as there are requests.\n  Those who violate the law under this legislation, if in fact it \npasses, would face a class A misdemeanor with a substantial fine, \nimprisonment up to 1 year, or both. I am also very pleased to tell you, \nMr. President, that eBay and StubHub announced last week that they will \nnot allow the sale of inaugural swearing-in tickets on any of their Web \nsites. I want to take this opportunity to thank them and to commend \nthem for leading the way.\n  It is my hope that Congress will pass this legislation this week. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting it on a hotline. I think \nit is very important to establish once and for all that tickets to the \ninauguration of the next President of the United States are not issues \nof commerce, they are free tickets to be given to the people.\n  So I hope that this week this legislation can pass unanimously by \nthis body. I send it to the desk and thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3686. A bill to establish an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation to \ncoordinate the responsibilities of the Department of the Treasury, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing \nAdministration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Neighborhood \nReinvestment Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and other Federal \nGovernment entities regarding foreclosure prevention, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am now introducing legislation captioned ``The \nForeclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008.'' It \nwould create an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation inside the Treasury \nDepartment, to coordinate a great many efforts. The core purpose of \nthis legislation is to provide Federal endorsement and financial \nassistance for setting up programs such as those now in existence in \nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh, and similar programs which exist in New \nYork, New Jersey, Ohio, and Connecticut, that suspend foreclosure until \nthere has been an opportunity, under court supervision, to have the \nborrower and the lender sit down to try to work out a plan to avoid \nforeclosure. My full statement, which I will ask consent to place in \nthe Record, goes into some great detail about the problems that exist \nat the present time regarding foreclosures.\n  In addition to the legislation I am proposing, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation has proposed a program aimed at preventing an \nestimated 1.5 million foreclosures in the next year. I have talked to \nthe FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair, and think her proposal is a good one. \nThe legislation I am proposing and the program Chairwoman Bair has \nproposed would supplement legislation which is now pending in the \nCongress. Last October, Senator Durbin and I separately introduced \nbills that would permit mortgages to be modified by the bankruptcy \ncourts. However, Senator Durbin's legislation would permit the court to \nmodify the principal sum. I think that goes too far and would have the \nundesirable consequence of making it more difficult to obtain a \nmortgage in the future. My legislation authorizes the bankruptcy courts \nto modify interest rates on variable interest rate mortgages. In many \ncases, there was not full disclosure to borrowers who took out these \nloans. Then they found that their mortgage went from $1,200 a month, \nfor illustrative purposes, to $2,000.\n  It is my hope that Congress would stay in session beyond just this \nweek. It seems to me the economic problems\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\nwe faced last July, before we adjourned for the month of August, \nrequired our remaining in session; I urged the leaders of the Senate to \nkeep the body in session during August. And, I urged the President to \ncall the Congress back into session. It seems to me the problem of \ndelinquent mortgages and foreclosures is critical at the moment. I \nnoticed Senator Dodd was quoted in the Washington Post last Friday as \nsaying he plans to introduce legislation and that he thought the FDIC \nproposal was a good one.\n  We are finding so many people are facing the threat of foreclosure. \nThis is an issue which ought to be considered further. Congress ought \nto stay in session, ought to work these issues through, and ought to \nremain in session long enough to consider the details necessary to make \na rational judgment on the proposal of economic aid to General Motors \nand the other companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my floor statement on \nthe mortgage issue and the full text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record as if set forth in full on the Senate floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Floor Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on Introduction of the \n    Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008\n\n       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \n     ``Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of \n     2008.'' The bill amends the recently passed Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act and the Housing and Economic \n     Recovery Act passed last July to ensure that more attention \n     and resources are given to the urgent need to prevent home \n     foreclosures and to stabilize the housing market.\n       The bill creates an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation in the \n     Treasury Department. This Office will coordinate and foster \n     foreclosure prevention efforts of the Treasury Department, \n     the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve, the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, and other federal agencies. \n     The Office will also support and collaborate in foreclosure \n     prevention efforts with state and local government agencies, \n     state and local courts, and community based non-profit \n     organizations, such as the State Foreclosure Prevention \n     Working Group.\n       The current economic turmoil began with a housing market \n     collapse that has had devastating consequences across the \n     entire financial system. Widespread mortgage modification \n     will address the root cause of the current crisis. Despite \n     talk and efforts since early 2007 to encourage voluntary loan \n     modification, the pace of affordable and sustainable \n     modifications has not been of sufficient scale to contain the \n     harm to our communities and our economy.\n       This month, HUD made a preliminary projection that only \n     about 20,000 homeowners may be helped by the Hope for \n     Homeowners program created as part of the Housing and \n     Economic Recovery Act, instead of the anticipated 400,000. In \n     October, a Federal Reserve Governor expressed concerns about \n     the recent rise of shady companies that masquerade as non-\n     profit foreclosure prevention organizations, and then charge \n     distressed borrowers thousands of dollars for their services. \n     Congress must act to ensure that homeowners are getting the \n     information and help they need to prevent avoidable \n     foreclosures.\n       For the second quarter of 2008, foreclosure filings \n     nationwide were up 121 percent over the second quarter of \n     2007. Comparing third quarter filings, the 2008 increase over \n     2007 is 71 percent. Today there are more than 1.5 million \n     houses in foreclosure--three times the normal rate--and \n     approximately 3.5 million other homeowners are behind on \n     their mortgage payments. Too many families are losing their \n     homes even when it makes more sense for the lenders to let \n     them stay and make payments on a sustainable, modified \n     mortgage. And despite reports from industry groups that there \n     have been many modifications, consumer groups say many of \n     these modifications simply spread missed payments over the \n     remaining life of the loan, which has the perverse effect of \n     raising, not lowering, the monthly payment. A recent Credit \n     Suisse report found that of those mortgages where the monthly \n     payments increased, 44 percent were more than 60 days \n     delinquent after 8 months. By contrast, of those mortgages \n     that received an interest rate reduction, only 15 percent \n     were more than 60 days delinquent after 8 months. Similarly, \n     of those mortgages where the principal balance was reduced \n     only 23 percent were delinquent. .\n       In some regions of the country the housing and job markets \n     are holding up fairly well, but in other areas the increase \n     in foreclosures is or will be devastating. But there is some \n     good news: in some of the areas that have been hardest hit, \n     there are newly instituted state-court based mortgage \n     foreclosure diversion programs that require conciliation \n     conferences between lenders and borrowers before a \n     foreclosure or sheriff sale may proceed. In some places, \n     there are hundreds of trained pro bono attorneys willing to \n     help homeowners. Homeowners need these programs because, even \n     though many states have housing financing programs, \n     homeowners may not know about them and they may not know that \n     lenders may offer modifications. A recent policy paper by the \n     Mortgage Bankers Association of America showed that borrowers \n     in 21% of foreclosures initiated in the third quarter of 2007 \n     either could not be located or would not respond to repeated \n     attempts by lenders to contact them. According to a report by \n     Freddie Mac, 57 percent of late-paying borrowers do not know \n     that their lenders may offer alternatives to help avoid \n     foreclosure.\n       The October 17, 2008 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing I \n     held in Pittsburgh explored Allegheny County's foreclosure \n     prevention program, which is at an early stage. The \n     Philadelphia hearing I held on October 24, 2008 explored a \n     program that was adopted in April 2008, and it appears to be \n     working. In the Philadelphia Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion \n     Program's first few months, there were 1,019 mortgage \n     foreclosure cases scheduled for conciliation conferences. In \n     467 cases (46%), borrowers did not participate. Of the 552 \n     (54%) in which borrowers did participate, there was a \n     ``success'' rate of 80%--meaning the homeowners remained in \n     their homes as a result of settlement, postponement, or \n     bankruptcy. Only 2 properties (.4%) were ordered to be sold \n     at sheriff sale. The delays allow for more negotiation, or, \n     in some cases for ``graceful exits'' so families can find a \n     new place to live.\n       The witnesses at the Philadelphia hearing testified about \n     successful outcomes for homeowners. One witness, Tania \n     Harrigan, testified that her family fell behind in mortgage \n     payments when her husband was laid off. They filed for \n     bankruptcy but could not afford to pay the fees; the \n     bankruptcy suit was dismissed and the house was listed for \n     sheriff sale for November 4, 2008. Through the Philadelphia \n     foreclosure prevention program, the interest rate was lowered \n     from 9.75% to 7%, which reduced the monthly payment from $437 \n     to $411. The lender waived $6,500 in late fees and the \n     arrearage was put back into a new 30-year fixed rate \n     mortgage. Another homeowner who was contacted through the \n     program's door-to-door outreach initiative had an adjustable \n     rate mortgage modified from a 22% interest rate to a fixed \n     rate of 6%. Another homeowner saw a reduction in her monthly \n     payments from $1479 to $1124 after the interest rate went \n     from 9.9% to 5.5%. These were ``voluntary'' in the sense that \n     the court did not impose the terms of the modifications. But \n     the court does require communication, research and \n     preparation before the conference. The court makes \n     foreclosure a last resort instead of the first step by \n     ensuring that servicers or lenders are not simply ignoring \n     alternatives to foreclosure.\n       A city employee testified that, as a result of coordinated \n     outreach, calls to the Save Your Home Philly Hotline, which \n     sets up appointments with housing counselors, tripled from \n     150 per month at the beginning of the year to 460 per month \n     currently. City-funded neighborhood assistance groups who \n     have access to court foreclosure files go door-to-door to \n     reach homeowners. The participation rate in the conciliation \n     program for homeowners who answered the door and spoke to the \n     outreach team was 73 percent, compared to 48 percent for \n     families that received no such outreach. The city also funds \n     Community Legal Services to provide legal assistance to \n     distressed homeowners and training to the hundreds of \n     volunteer attorneys who represent clients pro bono.\n       New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Connecticut and Florida have \n     similar programs. As I've noted, Pittsburgh is also adopting \n     a foreclosure diversion program. Common Pleas Court Judge \n     Annette Rizzo in Philadelphia testified that she has had many \n     inquiries about the foreclosure diversion program from \n     numerous cities, states, and even from Sweden. These are good \n     developments, and they should be nurtured.\n       That is what this legislation would do. It creates a \n     federal Office of Foreclosure Evaluation that will encourage \n     and assist cities and states in adopting mortgage foreclosure \n     diversion programs. The Office will also conduct an \n     informational campaign so that homeowners learn of state and \n     federal housing finance programs that are available to help \n     them, as well as other resources such as free counseling and \n     legal representation by community legal services groups and \n     local bar associations.\n       The states and cities are making progress, but federal \n     assistance would help. The bill permits certain HUD Community \n     Block Grant funds to be used for foreclosure prevention \n     programs that provide free counseling and legal aid. \n     Currently those funds may only be used for rehabilitation of \n     vacant or foreclosed properties. There is also a provision \n     that will free up funds so they may be used to support \n     programs that provide legal advice and representation to \n     homeowners in foreclosure actions; the current restriction on \n     using funds for litigation is overly broad. Unlike some plans \n     discussed in the press, this bill does not call for direct \n     payments to borrowers. Rather, it makes federal funds \n     available to support state and local foreclosure \n     prevention programs that work.\n       The bill also addresses another reason there are not more \n     affordable and sustainable loan modifications--even though \n     modifications usually leave lenders with more money than the \n     50 cents on the dollar that a foreclosure sale typically \n     brings them. Up until the last 10 or 15 years, a mortgage \n     loan\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n     involved two parties--the borrower and a bank that both \n     originated the loan and retained the default risk. If the \n     individual borrower had trouble, it was in the bank's \n     interest to adjust the terms of the loan. But that is no \n     longer the model. Through securitization, the risk of default \n     has been transferred to investors. There is no longer a \n     single entity that has an interest in reworking failing \n     loans. The loans are pooled together and the stream of \n     payments from those mortgages is divided up into securities \n     owned by investors all over the world. A mortgage servicer \n     manages the pools of loans and distributes the payments to \n     investors. It is the mortgage servicer who has the ability to \n     restructure a mortgage or foreclose on the property. However, \n     the servicers do not have the same incentives that banks used \n     to have. The way many pooling and servicing agreements (PSAs) \n     are written, there may be no incentives for the servicers to \n     restructure the loans. Servicers typically get paid a fee if \n     they foreclose, but may have to absorb the cost of \n     renegotiating the loans. One of the first steps the Office of \n     Foreclosure Evaluation should take is to encourage servicers \n     to use technology that would standardize the income to \n     expense and loan resolution process to keep costs down. The \n     Office also should determine what incentives may be needed to \n     encourage servicers to modify contracts. It may ultimately be \n     appropriate for the government to offer servicers a flat fee \n     for each sustainable, affordable modification completed \n     within a certain time period to help cover their additional \n     costs.\n       Perhaps a more significant roadblock is that servicers are \n     worried they may be sued by some of the investors. Many \n     servicers still are thinking that it is best to simply pursue \n     foreclosures. Congress tried to address this concern in the \n     Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and again in the \n     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, by clarifying that, \n     unless the contract or PSA clearly provides otherwise, the \n     duty owed by the servicer to investors is owed to the entire \n     pool and not to any individual groups or tranches of \n     investors, but the servicers still appear to be reluctant or \n     slow to modify.\n       The concerns of the servicers or lenders may not be \n     unfounded. Recently, lawyers claiming to represent investors \n     are challenging the settlement between Countrywide and 11 \n     attorneys general; the settlement proposes to modify the \n     loans of 400,000 borrowers. An October 24, 2008 article in \n     the New York Times reported that certain hedge funds are \n     opposing loan modifications because it might hurt their \n     investments. At least two funds recently have warned \n     servicers that they might be sued if they participated in \n     government-backed plans to renegotiate delinquent loans. \n     Congress must take action to protect homeowners who are \n     getting caught in the middle. So far disputes over loan \n     modifications have been theoretical because most mortgage \n     servicers are not aggressively altering the terms of loans, \n     but as a matter of public policy, we cannot let fear of tort \n     and contract claims cause grave harm to consumers and the \n     entire economy.\n       The bill addresses the litigation threat by requiring \n     investors' attorneys to conduct a careful inquiry into the \n     factual and legal bases of their claims, including \n     consideration of the recent statutory clarification that the \n     servicer's duty is to the entire pool of investors or \n     beneficial owners. The attorneys also would have to obtain, \n     as a prerequisite to filing suit, a certification from the \n     new Office of Foreclosure Evaluation that the loan \n     modifications in question were unreasonable or not permitted \n     by restrictions on Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits \n     under the Internal Revenue Code. This opinion would be \n     admissible, but not conclusive. These administrative \n     prerequisites should result in more uniformity, guidance and \n     clarity regarding applicable legal standards and best \n     practices for servicers, taking into account the public \n     interest and current threat to our economy posed by barriers \n     to reasonable modification. This is not complete immunity \n     from suit. If the litigation threat continues to impede \n     modifications, Congress may have to hold hearings to consider \n     sufficient safeguards for servicers--taking into \n     consideration the importance of having capital available for \n     the mortgage market.\n       In addition, although financial services industry groups \n     have criticized arbitrary quotas in PSAs that limit the \n     percentage of loans in a pool that may be modified, some PSAs \n     do contain such quotas. These quotas may have seemed \n     reasonable before the housing market crashed, but they do not \n     make sense now, are against public policy and, to the extent \n     these quotas are less than 25% of the total, they are \n     rendered unenforceable by this bill.\n       Finally, to ensure we have reliable data regarding mortgage \n     loan modifications, the bill requires mortgage servicers to \n     report detailed data to the Office of Foreclosure Evaluation. \n     The bill also requires the Office to submit reports to \n     Congress. This data will help the Office and Congress \n     understand whether voluntary efforts are sufficient, and what \n     specific barriers there may be to case-by-case loan \n     modifications, including specific provisions in pooling and \n     service agreements that may be impeding reasonable steps to \n     avoid foreclosures.\n       In the end, case-by-case loan modifications may not be \n     sufficient to appreciably slow the rate of foreclosures, in \n     which case the government may have to consider other options. \n     In that regard, I believe the proposal made recently by \n     Sheila Bair, the Chairman of the FDIC, deserves close \n     consideration. Ms. Bair's proposal is based on the FDIC's \n     real world experience with 5000 troubled mortgages at IndyMac \n     Bank, which the FDIC recently took over. Under the proposal, \n     delinquent homeowners would have their mortgage payments \n     reduced to as low as 31 percent of their monthly income. The \n     modifications would be based on interest rate reductions, \n     extension of the term of the mortgage, and principal \n     forbearance--in that order. The same protocol would be \n     applied to all delinquent mortgages, rather than having a \n     case-by-case assessment of each mortgage. The Bair proposal \n     may have the advantage of enabling rapid modification of \n     large numbers of mortgages, stemming the tide of \n     foreclosures. If a modified loan defaults later, the \n     government would share up to half of the losses. The proposal \n     would be funded under the $700 billion financial rescue \n     package. I spoke to Ms. Bair last week, and she estimates her \n     proposal could reach up to 2.2 million mortgages and enable \n     1.5 million homeowners to keep their homes. If effective, \n     across-the-board rather than case-by-case modifications may \n     be necessary.\n       In the meantime, the Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage \n     Loan Modification Act of 2008 will encourage servicers to \n     engage in greater numbers of case-by-case mortgage \n     modifications. This should be a goal those on both sides of \n     the aisle can agree to. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3688.

laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, but under section 107 of title 38, United States \n     Code, the service of certain other Filipino veterans is \n     deemed not to be active service for purposes of such laws.\n       (6) These other Filipino veterans only receive certain \n     benefits under title 38, United States Code, and, depending \n     on where they legally reside, are paid such benefit amounts \n     at reduced rates.\n       (7) The benefits such veterans receive include service-\n     connected compensation benefits paid under chapter 11 of \n     title 38, United States Code, dependency indemnity \n     compensation survivor benefits paid under chapter 13 of title \n     38, United States Code, and burial benefits under chapters 23 \n     and 24 of title 38, United States Code, and such benefits are \n     paid to beneficiaries at the rate of $0.50 per dollar \n     authorized, unless they lawfully reside in the United States.\n       (8) Dependents' educational assistance under chapter 35 of \n     title 38, United States Code, is also payable for the \n     dependents of such veterans at the rate of $0.50 per dollar \n     authorized, regardless of the veterans' residency.\n       (b) Compensation Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--There is in the general fund of the \n     Treasury a fund to be known as the ``Filipino

A bill to help struggling families stay in their homes and \nto ensure that taxpayers are protected when the Secretary of the \nTreasury purchases equity shares in financial situations; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just before the Congress paused for the elections, we \npassed one of the most historic--and contentious--pieces of legislation \nin my 26 years in Washington. We gave the Treasury Department the \nauthority to spend $700 billion in taxpayer funds to prevent the \ncomplete meltdown of the financial system, which in turn would \nhopefully prevent the overall economy from descending into a deep and \npainful recession.\n  I didn't like voting for that bill, but I joined the majority of my \ncolleagues in doing so because not voting for it was even worse. I hope \nin the end that we were right.\n  However, there are two areas that I do not believe were adequately \naddressed in that legislation: helping families save their homes from \nforeclosure and protecting taxpayers from the misuse of their dollars \nby the bankers that receive them. Today I am introducing legislation--\nthe Homeowner Assistance and Taxpayer Protection Act--to address both \nconcerns.\n  For far too long the Bush administration has relied on the voluntary \nefforts of the mortgage servicers to rework millions of troubled \nmortgages on a case by case basis. These voluntary efforts have been \nand still are insufficient. There aren't strong enough incentives for \nthe servicers to pursue work-outs. Servicers aren't equipped to handle \nthe huge volume of mortgages at risk. Far-flung investors who own \npieces of many mortgages, and who often refuse to let servicers rework \nmortgages even in the cases where the servicers would like to help, \npresent legal obstacles. And the mortgage industry has failed to take \nstrong action against foreclosures, even if it is in their own best \ninterests. The $700 billion rescue bill encouraged the administration \nto take stronger steps to help homeowners, but did not require the \nGovernment to do so.\n  My bill would bring real hope to families who fear that they will \nlose their\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\nhomes, by doing three things. First, it would require Treasury, the \nFederal Reserve, the FDIC, and FHFA to restructure all loans that meet \nthe criteria established in the Hope for Homeowners program to make the \nmortgages affordable. That means mortgages these regulators own or in \nwhich they have a controlling interest must be restructured if a \nreworked mortgage can be paid by the homeowner and is viable \neconomically for the creditors. The Emergency Economic Stabilization \nAct as it is currently written only encourages the regulators to \nrestructure those loans, rather than requiring them to do so.\n  Second, it would require servicers to restructure all loans that \nqualify for the Hope for Homeowners program, rather than simply \nencouraging them to do so as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act is \ncurrently written.\n  And, finally, it would allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on \nprimary residences. As I have argued for months now, this is the single \nmost important thing we can do to spur nationwide systematic mortgage \nrestructurings.\n  The financial crisis will not ease, and the economy will not begin to \nrecover, until we address the root cause of the crisis: the failed \nmortgage market. My bill would do just that.\n  The rescue bill also failed to put in place enough taxpayer \nprotections. Congress meant for banks to use the money provided by the \nTreasury to lend to qualified borrowers, rather than enriching their \nshareholders and executives. Recent reports indicating that AIG will \nlavish more than a half billion dollars on its employees at the same \ntime that it receives an even larger $152 billion taxpayer bailout than \noriginally announced speaks loudly to this problem.\n  My bill would try to address this concern. The bill would bar banks \nparticipating in the Capital Purchase Program authorized by the \nEmergency Economic Stabilization Act from increasing common share \ndividends as long as the Government owns preferred shares. It also \nwould require participating banks to reduce the next year's dividends \nin an amount equal to the compensation paid to the top five executives \nin excess of $500,000.\n  The bill would not bar companies receiving assistance from the \nTreasury from paying their executives, nor would it bar them from \npaying dividends. But it would ensure that financial institutions think \ncarefully before redirecting taxpayer-injected dollars away from \nlending for the good of the economy towards compensation for the good \nof its own executives and shareholders.\n  The debate on how to help stabilize the financial sector will \ncertainly continue into the 111th Congress, and I intend to continue to \nfight for homeowners and for the taxpayers so that we get our economy \nmoving again as quickly as we can, and as prudently as we can.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
