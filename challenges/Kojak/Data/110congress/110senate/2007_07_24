CHESTNUT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to say a brief word about a couple of \nmatters. As we heard in the prayer offered by Admiral Black, some will \nremember that day 9 years ago when these two officers were killed. I \nremember it for a number of reasons, not the least of which, when I \nattended law school, I went to law school during the daytime and worked \na full-time swing shift, a night shift, as a Capitol police officer. My \nservice as a Capitol policeman was not one where I showed any bravery \nor courage or any valor; I was directing traffic much of the time. That \nwas the most dangerous job I did.\n  But 9 years ago today, two police officers did exemplify courage and \nvalor. These two Capitol police officers, Special Agent Gibson and \nOfficer Jacob Chestnut, were stationed by the east entrance on the \nHouse side. At 3:40 in the afternoon, a man with a gun tried\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\nto force his way past them. When Officer Chestnut blocked his path, the \ngunman shot him point-blank in the chest and killed him. Special Agent \nGibson then warned nearby tourists and staff to seek cover. In fact, he \nchased the gunman down the hallway. He was headed for the House \nleadership's office. When they exchanged gunfire, one tourist was hit. \nOfficer Gibson was also hit and died from his wounds, as did Officer \nChestnut.\n  A plaque has been placed in the Capitol Building where the \nconfrontation took place, and their names are carved in the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Memorial recognizing their sacrifice.\n  I knew Officer Gibson. Senate Democrats had a retreat. During that \nretreat, my wife became very ill one night. Special Agent Gibson was \nthe first one there. He was carrying all the resuscitation equipment. \nHe was sweating. He had run from the office where the police were \nstationed to take care of my wife. I remember how kind, thoughtful, and \nconsiderate he was, and how gentle he was.\n\n  I didn't know Officer Chestnut other than exchanging greetings when I \nmet him, but his reputation was outstanding, and his actions that day \nproved his enormous strength of character.\n  I think of the brave police officers who protect me every day, Mr. \nPresident, with the skill and hard work I see firsthand each day. I \nalso think of all the law enforcement men and women who keep this \nbuilding and those who serve within it safe. We should all be grateful, \nbut I am grateful beyond words.\n  So on this somber anniversary, I will lay a wreath and observe a \nmoment of silence for these two heroic men we lost. Our hearts, and \ncertainly our thoughts, are with the families of Special Agent Gibson \nand Officer Chestnut. I have met their families on a number of \noccasions. We hope that remembering them is some comfort to them that \nthe sacrifice of their loved ones will be forever remembered with our \ngratitude and utmost respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9796-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to convey this \ninformation to the distinguished Republican leader. I have not had time \nbecause the decision was just made this morning. I want to go over the \ncalendar for the remainder of this year.\n  We, of course, know what we have to do this week and next week. We \nneed to complete the work on the Homeland Security appropriations bill, \nwhich is so important, with the 9/11 recommendations to become \neffective soon, and we have the National Intelligence Estimate report \njust rendered which indicates we have to be vigilant at home. We must \ncomplete the appropriations bill dealing with homeland security before \nwe leave this work period.\n  We also need to do our work on SCHIP, children's health care. The \nFinance Committee, on a very bipartisan vote--17 to 4--passed that \nmatter out of committee. It was led by Senators Grassley, Baucus, \nRockefeller, and Hatch. What came out of that committee has been a \ncompromise. That is how bipartisanship works. As reported in the \nCongressional Daily yesterday, that matter should have more than 60 \nvotes. So if there is, in fact, an effort to slow that bill down, it \nappears on a bipartisan basis we can move it forward. It is certainly \nimportant legislation, and we need to complete it.\n  We also, as I just mentioned, need to complete the conference report \ndealing with the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We expect that to be \npassed in the House this week. The conference committee, basically, has \nwrapped up all its work on that bill. It has been very heartwarming \nthat the conference has been led by Senators Lieberman and Collins, and \nwe had an actual conference, just as we used to have around here all \nthe time. The first conference committee meeting was mobbed with press \nlooking in. That is the way it used to be. A real conference report \nwill come out of that conference committee, and that is very important.\n  Finally, we are going to complete the ethics legislation. I want to \ntee up so that when we come back in September, we will have some work \nto do without looking for something to do. What I would like to do is \nmove to the VA-Military Construction appropriations bill. We will do \nthat one way or the other. I hope on a motion to proceed that I will \nnot have to file cloture, but if I have to, that is what I will do. So \nwhen we get back in September, we will have something to work on.\n  Let's talk about September. Whenever we leave here, Mr. President--\nand, as I have indicated, I hope it is next Friday, but that may not be \nthe case if we have to do some extra days to complete our work--when we \ncome back, of course, September 3 is a holiday, so we will come back on \nSeptember 4. September 4 will be treated as most of our Mondays are \ntreated. We will have a vote at 5:15 p.m. or thereabouts that evening, \nand we will work that week.\n  On September 10--everyone is on notice--we will be in session that \nday, and we will have votes before noon. It is not going to be 5:15 \np.m. Everyone knows that is going to be an early vote day. Why? Because \non September 10, 11, and 12, we will have full work days. We have to \ncomplete our work by 6 o'clock on September 12 because that is the \nbeginning of the Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah. We will be out of \nsession September 13 and 14. There will be no votes on Monday, \nSeptember 17. It will be a work day, but we will not have votes. And \nthen we are going to work the remainder of that week, the remainder of \nthe next week, and the remainder of the next week. We could have--and I \nwill try to give the distinguished Republican leader and all Senators \nnotice--we may, because of what we are working on, have to have some \nMonday votes earlier than 5:15 p.m. We will try to announce it a week \nahead of time so people can make arrangements.\n  Then, on October 8, which is a holiday, Columbus Day, we are going to \nhave that as a home State work period. That whole week, we are going to \nbe out of session; that is, October 9, 10, 11, 12, we will be out of \nsession. We will come back on October 15 and work that day. We will \nhave votes on October 15. I don't expect early votes. We will have \nvotes on the 15th. We hope we can complete work for the session by \nNovember 16. If we cannot, then we have to come back. We will come back \non December 3 and complete our work. That will give us 3 weeks before \nChristmas. I hope we don't have to do that. I think it will be good for \neverybody if we can complete our work on November 16.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, if he has \nany questions about this, I will be happy to answer them. I apologize \nfor not being able to give this information to him first, but the \ndecision I was waiting to make was what to do on September 17, as to \nwhether that will be a vote day. We decided it will not. I am now in \nposition to state this publicly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9796-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9796-S9797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WOUNDED WARRIOR AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I leave the podium, I wish to say a \ncouple words about another important piece of legislation.\n  Earlier this year, Americans were shocked by reports of the crisis at \nWalter Reed and other armed services medical facilities. It wasn't just \nWalter Reed, but that was the picture everyone saw. We learned that \nmany of our courageous men and women wounded in service to our Nation \nwere receiving unacceptably poor treatment and care upon their return \nto our shores.\n  I learned from this morning's news that there is a big lawsuit filed \nby Afghan and Iraqi veterans. Hundreds of thousands have joined \ntogether in a lawsuit against the Veterans' Administration. I do not \nprocedurally understand how that is going to go forward, but it was in \nthe morning headline news.\n  There is now, according to this news report, about a half a million \nbacklog requests for Iraqi veterans to get care.\n  We learned during the early look at Walter Reed and other facilities \nnot only was the veterans' care system ripe for bureaucratic failures, \nbut even the physical facilities failed to meet a minimal level of \nacceptable quality.\n  The American people were outraged by these facts, and I am glad to \nsay the Senate took prompt action. The Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committees held a rare joint hearing to identify the best ways \nto make right the existing failures and to prevent similar injustices \nfrom ever happening again. Members of these committees\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nworked together in an entirely bipartisan manner. Last month, they \nintroduced the Wounded Warriors bill, which was entered as an amendment \nto the Defense authorization bill. The Wounded Warrior amendment \naddresses the substandard facilities, which we have all read about and \nhave visited, such as Walter Reed, and the lack of seamless transition \nwhen medical care for troops is transferred from the Department of \nDefense to the Veterans' Administration, which often leads to \ndiminished care.\n  The legislation also looks at the inadequacy of severance pay to help \nthose who have sacrificed so much already to support their families \nwhile they recover, and the need to improve sharing of medical records \nbetween the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  It addresses the inadequate care and treatment for traumatic brain \ninjury and post-traumatic stress syndrome by authorizing $50 million \nfor improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. We saw this \nproblem highlighted, as I have indicated, in the morning news. There \nare a number of stories about that, but the main story is in the L.A. \nTimes, which cited a report by a special Pentagon task force showing \nthat 38 percent of soldiers and 50 percent of National Guard members \ncome home from Iraq and Afghanistan with mental health issues. Yet only \n27 of these 1,400 VA hospitals have inpatient post-traumatic stress \ndisorder programs.\n  Finally, the Wounded Warrior legislation provides support for wounded \ntroops whose health insurance programs, such as the TRICARE program for \nretired veterans, have allowed gaps in medical coverage and treatment.\n  In the next few days, I intend to take the Wounded Warrior amendment \nfrom the Defense authorization bill--there were additions made to that \nfrom the time it left committee--and I will seek unanimous consent that \nwe pass it now. The rest of it, with rare exception in the Defense \nauthorization bill, if we passed it yesterday, wouldn't kick in until \nthe beginning of the fiscal year. But the Wounded Warrior amendment \nlegislation becomes law upon passage and approval. I hope we can do \nthat. This would make these provisions immediately effective when the \nPresident signs this. Given the immediate care these people need, and \nthe immediate need to act on the Wounded Warrior amendment, which has \noverwhelming bipartisan support, I am hoping we can all work together \nto pass it before we leave here. If we have to do it by unanimous \nconsent, I hope we can do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9797-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

That is a classic example of \nhow we ought to operate more often in the Senate, and I hope we will \nreach that high standard more frequently for the balance of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9797-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPPORTING AMERICA'S GLORIOUS FABRIC\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, from America's earliest days, bravery \nhas been essential. A group of courageous farmers were the first to \nstand against the British. The Declaration of Independence was a death \nwarrant for anyone who signed it. The Constitutional Convention took \nplace in a shuttered room. The Founders were brave, and they knew \nbravery would be needed to maintain what they had built. As Washington \nwrote when the veterans of 1776 began to pass away:\n\n       Thus some of the pillars of the revolution fall. May our \n     country never want props to support the glorious fabric.\n\n  We remember today two men who supported the glorious fabric of our \ncountry. Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Gibson gave their lives on a \nFriday afternoon while standing sentry at the gates of this great \ncitadel of liberty. The Chambers had fallen silent for the week, \nstaffers were celebrating the passage of a law, tourists were studying \nold plaques, and the President was getting ready for a weekend trip to \nhis camp when a madman pierced the calm routine of daily life in \nWashington, and a brave grandfather and young father stood strong \nagainst him.\n  Their heroism was duplicated by the Senator-surgeon who tried to keep \nthe killer and his victims alive, by the British tourist who rushed to \none of the victims' side to hear his last words, by the horde of \nofficers who rushed the gunman. When the flags fell, thousands of \nAmericans called the Capitol to grieve. Thousands more showed up to \nmourn the fallen officers and to honor the ideals they died for. An act \nof savagery had roused a nation to mercy and compassion. It was an \ninstinct we would see again on an even darker day 3 years later.\n  We are grateful for the lives of these good men and for their \nsacrifice. They were not sunshine patriots. They were brave Americans \nwho stood their ground, as Americans so often do, to ensure that the \nceremony of freedom would go on. It does. It will.

The senior Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2381, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have a modification to my amendment \nthat is at the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nmodified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2381), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n\n     __. DEMONSTRATION AND CERTIFICATION REGARDING THE USE OF \n                   CERTAIN FEDERAL FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--No Federal funds received by an \n     institution of higher education or other postsecondary \n     educational institution may be used to pay any person for \n     influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee \n     of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee \n     of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in \n     connection with any Federal action described in subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Applicability.--The prohibition in subsection (a) \n     applies with respect to the following Federal actions:\n       (1) The awarding of any Federal contract.\n       (2) The making of any Federal grant.\n       (3) The making of any Federal loan.\n       (4) The entering into of any Federal cooperative agreement.\n       (5) The extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or \n     modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or \n     cooperative agreement.\n       (c) Lobbying and Earmarks.--No Federal student aid funding \n     may be used to hire a registered lobbyist or pay any person \n     or entity for securing an earmark.\n       (d) Demonstration and Certification.--Each institution of \n     higher education or other postsecondary educational \n     institution receiving Federal funding, as a condition for \n     receiving such funding, shall annually demonstrate and \n     certify to the Secretary of Education that the requirements \n     of subsections (a) through (c) have been met.\n       (e) Actions to Implement and Enforce.--The Secretary of \n     Education shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure \n     that the provisions of this section are vigorously \n     implemented and enforced.\n\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment gives the assurance to our \ncolleagues here in the Senate that over the evening we were able to \nwork with Senator Coburn and to take into consideration his concerns to \ndo this in a way which I think is consistent with our legislation. I am \nvery pleased the Senator from Oklahoma and I, and Senator Enzi, were \nable to come to agreement on this amendment.\n  We all agree that universities should not be using Federal money for \nlobbying. That is why our amendment bans it. We all agree that Federal \nstudent aid should not be used to secure an earmark. That is why our \namendment bans it. We all agree there should be a mechanism to ensure \nthat these rules are being followed, and that is why our amendment \nrequires colleges to certify they are following the rules.\n  This amendment will keep the Federal funds from being used for \nlobbying while maintaining the ability of colleges to engage in \nappropriate communications with Government officials. It will allow \npreeminent research scientists to communicate with the NIH about cancer \nresearch; it will allow meteorologists to advise Homeland Security on \nbetter ways to predict and prepare for imminent natural disasters; and \nit will allow scientists to convey to the Department of Defense the \nlatest advances in armor and other protections for our troops.\n  This amendment strikes a good balance between prohibiting the \ninappropriate use of Federal student aid dollars while keeping the door \nopen for colleges and employees and officials to communicate with \nGovernment in other important matters. That is what our amendment does, \nso I am pleased we could come up with an agreement, and I thank the \nSenator for his concern and for his cooperation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of S. 1642, the \nHigher Education Amendments of 2007.\n  This important bipartisan legislation, which I helped craft as a \nMember of the Senate Education Committee, would reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act for the first time since 1998, expand college access and \naffordability for students and their families, and ensure that teachers \nhave the necessary skills and supports to effectively raise student \nachievement in the classroom.\n  This bill builds on our passage last week of the Higher Education \nAccess Act, which makes a nearly $14 billion investment in additional \nneed-based grant assistance for low-income students. That bill also \nhelps middle-class students and families pay down and manage their loan \ndebt by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their \ndiscretionary income. And it sends a signal about the need for more \ntalented young people to become nurses, teachers, and librarians by \noffering them loan forgiveness if they continue in public-service \nprofessions for 10 years.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill aimed at making it easier for \nfamilies to fill out the financial aid form that all students have to \nfill out to see if they can get tuition assistance. I called the bill \nthe FAFSA Act, Financial Aid Form Simplification and Access Act. It is \nbased on the recommendations of experts and should help make a \nsometimes difficult process less time consuming and frustrating. First, \nit would phase out the complex, one-size-fits-all long form at 7 pages \nand over 90 questions, using the savings to employ ``smart'' technology \nto create a tailored online application form to ensure that students \nanswer only the minimum number of questions necessary. Second, the bill \nwould establish a short paper EZ-FAFSA application form, similar to the \nIRS's 1040-EZ, for the lowest-income students. Third, this legislation \nallows students to apply for financial aid earlier, and it creates a \npilot program to test an early application system under which students \napply for aid and receive an aid estimate or determination in their \njunior year of high school. I am pleased that these provisions are \nincluded in the bill the Senate is passing today.\n  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 also include provisions from \nanother bill that I introduced earlier this year, the ACCESS Act. \nAccessing College through Comprehensive Early Outreach and State \nPartnerships Act--S. 938, modeled on successful programs like Indiana's \n21st Century Scholars Program. Indeed, students in the Indiana \ninitiative were nearly five times more likely than nonparticipants to \nenroll in college. The ACCESS Act creates a new incentive under the \nLeveraging Educational Assistance Partnership or LEAP program to spur \nstates to form partnerships with colleges, businesses, and \nphilanthropies to increase the amount of need-based grants. This new \ninitiative would also make sure that students are aware of this \nopportunity for more aid in the 7th grade and provide early \nintervention, mentoring, and outreach services so they can stay on \ntrack for college. Again, research has shown that successful college \naccess programs offer these components, and I am glad the bill before \nus includes them.\n  Furthermore, the Higher Education Amendments include several \nprovisions from my PRREP--Preparing, Recruiting, and Retaining \nEducation Professionals--Act, S. 1231, to strengthen the existing \nTeacher Quality Enhancement Grants program and improve college teacher \npreparation programs. These provisions ensure that prospective and \nbeginning teachers, including for the first time, early childhood \neducators, have effective teaching skills, intensive, year-long pre-\nservice clinical experiences, and high-quality, sustained multiyear \nmentoring and support in their first years of teaching. Too often, new \nteachers lack this kind of training and leave the profession. This bill \naims to change that.\n  This legislation also includes my LIBRARIAN--Librarian Incentive to \nBoost Recruitment and Retention in Areas of Need--Act, S. 1121, to \nprovide Perkins student loan forgiveness for full-time librarians with \na master's degree in library science. Librarians working full-time in \nlow-income areas would qualify for up to 100 percent Perkins student \nloan forgiveness depending on their number of years of experience. \nIndeed, a love of reading and books is essential to an educated \nworkforce, but too often schools go without a trained librarian.\n  We hear often that serving in the military permits our military \npersonnel to gain help with the costs of college when they leave the \nservice, but all too often it is not enough. That is why I included \nlanguage in this bill to increase Perkins loan forgiveness for members \nof the Armed Forces from 50 to 100 percent. The legislation also \nincludes provisions I authored to create a career pathway for students \nwith disabilities by providing training and support to middle school, \nhigh school, and university staff to encourage interest and \nunderstanding of educational and work-based opportunities for students, \nincluding those with disabilities, in disability-related fields.\n  I am also pleased this reauthorization bill includes provisions \nresponding to recently uncovered conflicts of interests between lenders \nand college financial aid offices. This legislation provides students \nand families with increased disclosure about special arrangements \nbetween lenders and colleges and the terms and conditions of a school's \n``preferred lender list''; prohibits payments, gifts, and other \ninducements from lenders to colleges and financial aid administrators; \nand requires colleges to establish and follow a student loan code of \nconduct.\n  The bill we are passing today is significant legislation that \naddresses one of the top concerns of American families. It tackles the \ntwin goals of increased college access and affordability for students \nand their families as was intended when the Higher Education Act was \ncreated in 1965. It represents an important step in ensuring that every \nstudent with the drive and talent to go to college has the opportunity \nto do so. I thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, and their \nstaffs, particularly Carmel Martin, J.D. LaRock, Missy Rohrbach, Erin \nRenner, and Emma Vadehra for their excellent work on this bill. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this important \nbill becomes law, so that we continue our commitment to creating and \nexpanding educational opportunities for all students.\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote for the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act because it will open the doors of college \nto more students across the country. I want to commend Senator Kennedy \nfor his leadership on this bill. I have been honored to work with him \nand the other members of the committee to produce this comprehensive \nsolution.\n  In response to the recent student loan scandals, this bill reforms \nthe student loan process so that it puts the interests of students \nfirst and makes the system more transparent. To help address rising \ncollege costs, this bill takes a number of steps to increase user-\nfriendly information available to students and parents about college \ncosts. I am also pleased that this bill will make it easier for \nstudents to apply for financial aid by replacing the current 10-page \napplication with a new 2-page version. This bill offers more help for \nstudents from disadvantaged backgrounds. Specifically, it strengthens \nTRIO programs to make students more prepared for higher education. It \nalso expands and improves GEAR UP programs, which are a critical tool \nto help guide and prepare disadvantaged students for high school \ngraduation and college enrollment.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill includes my proposal to train \nmath and literacy coaches in colleges of education. As I have been \nworking to improve our schools, I have recognized that we need to \nprovide additional support to students in math and reading. By \naddressing those areas, we can improve the graduation rate and help \nstudents graduate prepared for college and careers. When I introduced \nthe PASS Act, S. 611, earlier this year, I included reading and math \ncoaches as a key way to improve the graduation rate. I am pleased that \nthis higher education reauthorization includes a grants program that \nwill help train those coaches, so we have a ready pipeline of qualified \ncoaches to address these critical areas.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Chairman \nKennedy and Ranking Member Enzi on passage of this very important \nlegislation. I also thank them for their assistance in including within \nthe Higher Education Amendments Act of 2007 a bill I have worked on, \nthe Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program.\n  The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program will \nbring us one step closer to making sure that every child has the \nopportunity to go to college. Our current higher education system is \nriddled with barriers that students must overcome to obtain the keys to \ntheir future--a college education. This program will break down some of \nthose very barriers by making an early promise of Federal aid to \nstudents early enough in their academic careers so that the reality of \na college education is firmly in their grasp.\n  How we choose to support our students today will have broad \nramifications for not only them but for our country 10, 20, and 30 \nyears down the road. The consequences are dire if we do not take a more \naggressive approach to make sure the doors to a college education are \nopen wide enough so every student that wants to pursue a college \neducation can do so regardless of their family income. If we maintain \nthe status quo, the outlook for too many students is grim. Take, for \nexample, the fact that over the next decade 2 million college-ready \nstudents from households with an income below $50,000 will not attend \ncollege because they cannot afford the costs. Every door we fail to \nopen for our students is a door closed--a missed opportunity--for our \ncountry down the road.\n  I commend my colleagues for their leadership in developing meaningful \nreforms regarding the cost of and access to a college education in this \nbill as well as the recently passed Higher Education Access Act of \n2007. I am pleased that the Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment \nDemonstration Program is one component of those reforms--providing \nstudents and their families with a commitment of Federal aid early in \ntheir academic careers, information about the costs of college, and \ninformation about the various types of available financial aid. Right \nnow, students don't find out whether they are eligible for Federal aid \nuntil their senior year--much less how much they will receive. This \ntimeframe doesn't work for many families. Making a commitment--a \npromise--of Federal aid to students at an early age will begin the \nconversation about college earlier and continue it through the day they \nreceive the acceptance letters from the schools of their choice.\n  If you have seen the news articles, or if you are putting a child \nthrough college, you know that the cost of a college education can be \ndaunting to a student and their family. Many children think--\nerroneously--that they can't afford to go to college, and they go \nthrough high school thinking their futures are limited. We should not \nwait to tell those that need it that they will receive help to pay for \ncollege. Committing a Pell grant--the maximum of which is $4,310 under \ncurrent law and $5,400 in the Senate-passed Higher Education Access \nAct--will critically alter the expectations of low-income students. For \nthose students whose future plans often do not include college, this \nprogram will provide a financial promise, and the hope that comes with \nknowing you can afford a college degree.\n  Under this early commitment plan, four States will receive funding \nfor a demonstration program, each of which will work with two cohorts \nof up to 10,000 8th grade students; one in school year 2008-2009, and \none in school year 2009-2010. Schools with a National School Lunch \nProgram participation rate above 50 percent would be eligible for the \nprogram, and by using the same eligibility criteria as the National \nSchool Lunch Program, students would be identified based on need in the \n8th grade.\n  The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program will \nalso provide funding for states, in conjunction with the participating \nlocal educational agencies, to conduct targeted information campaigns \nbeginning in the 8th grade and continuing through students' senior \nyear. These campaigns will inform students and their families of the \nprogram and provide information about the cost of a college education, \nstate and federal financial assistance, and the average amount of aid \nawards. A targeted information campaign, along with a guarantee of a \nPell grant, will allow families and students to not just plan ahead for \ncollege, but to dream of a future that includes higher education.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, marks the culmination of yet another \njourney towards making college more affordable with the passage of the \nHigher Education Amendments, and with the passage several days ago of \nthe Higher Education Reconciliation Act. It represents the single \nlargest Federal investment in higher education since the GI bill. I am \npleased to support this legislation because it reflects a commitment to \nexpanding access to higher education and making it more affordable. It \nopens the door to those previously denied educational opportunity due \nto a lack of adequate financial resources or who could not carry the \nburden of excessive student loan obligations.\n  This legislation is a great victory for students and families across \nAmerica, including my home State of Michigan, which would receive over \n$80 million above the current $429.8 million in new assistance for the \nupcoming academic year and an additional $689.6 million over the next 5 \nyears.\n  I have long supported efforts in the Senate to expand the \navailability of student aid and to ensure that students have access to \na postsecondary education, including raising the maximum Pell grant \naward. This much-needed legislation increases the maximum Pell grant \nfrom $4,310 to $5,100 in 2008, building upon our efforts in February of \nthis year when we passed a significant increase in the maximum Pell \ngrant award to $4,310 from $4,050, the first increase in 4 years.\n  This legislation also increases the income level at which a student \nis eligible for the maximum Pell grant; caps monthly student loan \npayments at 15 percent of discretionary income; encourages public \nservice by providing loan forgiveness for borrowers who commit to \npublic service; simplifies the financial aid process for all students; \nand reforms the student loan system so that it works for students \nrather than lenders.\n  There is one fact that we cannot escape, which is that more and more \nstudents and families are struggling to pay for college at a time when \naccess\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\nto a higher education is increasingly important in a competitive, \nglobal economy where training beyond a high school education is \nrequired.\n  The legislation will protect working students by increasing the \namount of student income sheltered from the financial aid process. The \ncap on Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's \ndiscretionary income will bring much-needed relief to students with the \nburden of excessive loans. For example, a social worker in Michigan \nwith one child earning $45,620, with student loan debt of $19,000, \nwould have his or her monthly payments reduced by 12 percent. Forgiving \nthe debt of borrowers who continue in public service careers, such as \nlaw enforcement, nursing or teaching for 10 years will be provided \nsignificant relief under this bill. For instance, a starting teacher in \nMichigan earning $35,557 with the State average loan debt of $18,942 \ncould have monthly payments reduced by 20 percent. After 10 years of \nteaching, all remaining debt would be forgiven, in this case, a benefit \nworth $10,906.\n  A student's access to higher education ought not depend on his or her \nfamily's income. Working families and aspiring students across this \ncountry are struggling to obtain the financial resources to secure a \ncollege education. Low and middle income students who have managed to \nenter and stay in college are graduating with unprecedented levels of \ndebt. This legislation responds to this crisis.\n  The passage of this bipartisan legislation is a notable \naccomplishment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I first want to thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the HELP Committee--Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi--for their leadership in bringing this important legislation to \nthe floor. I also appreciate their willingness to incorporate the ideas \nand concerns of the various committee members. I am pleased to urge my \ncolleagues to support this comprehensive package to improve higher \neducation. This is a worthy conclusion to the discussion that began \nlast week, with the passage of the Higher Education Access Act, to make \ncollege more affordable and more accessible.\n  Education is the centerpiece of a deal America has entered into with \nits students: if you work hard, if you gain the right set of skills, \nand if you accept responsibility for your learning, you have a chance \nfor a better life. That is the basic premise of education in our \ncountry.\n  And this deal includes a college degree. A college education and a \ndiploma improve the chance of getting a good job, increase earning \npotential, and ease entry into the middle class.\n  Last week, we passed legislation making a college degree more \naccessible for many students, by increasing student financial aid. \nToday, we must move forward on the remainder of a comprehensive package \nfor college students and their families. In this legislation, we are \nasking colleges themselves to look more closely at the increases in \ntheir costs, and to report more information, so that students and \nfamilies have a clearer picture of the cost of attendance.\n  We are reforming the student loan system, by shedding more light on \nthe process, illuminating more clearly the arrangements between \ncolleges and lenders, and prohibiting payments that give some lenders \nan unfair advantage. Instead, we must make sure that the system works \nto the advantage of students. We must act to curb the financial abuses \nthat have been so widely reported at a few institutions, and that have \nhurt too many students. In this legislation, we have also increased \naccess for many by making the process more user-friendly, by \nsimplifying the financial aid application process, and by helping \nstudents plan for their college education earlier in their high school \ncareer. All these provisions of the Higher Education Amendments are \nworthy of the support of my colleagues.\n  There are two provisions in this legislation which I would especially \nlike to thank my colleagues on the HELP Committee for supporting, and \nadvancing. The first establishes an innovative method for teacher \npreparation. We know that teachers are the most important resource for \nstudents in our schools. And yet, too many students in high-need \nschools are taught by inadequately prepared teachers, who are often not \nready for the challenges they face, and who often choose to leave the \nclassroom too soon.\n  We must recruit talented Americans to become teachers, and we must \nhelp transform teaching, restoring its luster as a profession. We must \nbetter prepare prospective teachers, so that when they join the \nprofession, they are successful and choose to stay, so that their \nstudents may share in that success. As we ask teachers and school \nleaders to accept more responsibility for student learning, we must do \nour part to adequately prepare teachers to achieve success.\n  Research shows that good preparation programs can make novice \nteachers effective more rapidly. This legislation includes a provision \nfor residency programs to effectively prepare teachers for the reality \nof challenging classrooms. Teaching Residency Programs are school-based \nprograms in which prospective teachers teach alongside a mentor teacher \nfor one year, while undertaking coursework to attain teacher \ncertification. Graduates of the program are placed in high-needs \nschools and continue to receive strong mentoring and support for their \nfirst years of teaching.\n  I am particularly proud that such Teaching Residency Programs are \nincluded in title II of these Higher Education Amendments, because it \nis a model of effective teacher preparation that I have advocated since \nbefore I was elected to the Senate. I have seen firsthand the success \nof such a program in Chicago.\n  Teaching Residency Programs are based on what we know works best to \nprepare teachers. We know that mentoring is critical to help novice \nteachers improve their skills, and to retain many who might otherwise \nleave the profession within their first few years. We can no longer \nafford to lose high quality teachers because they are not adequately \nsupported, or because they realize that they are not progressing in \ntheir chosen profession.\n  I am also pleased that the Higher Education Amendments we consider \ntoday contain a provision to support predominantly Black institutions--\na proposal first suggested by my good friend, Representative Danny \nDavis. These are colleges which serve a growing number of African-\nAmerican students, most of whom are the first in their families to go \nto college and most of whom receive student financial aid. It is \nappropriate that we support such institutions, to help ensure that \nthese colleges, in turn, support the efforts and talents of these \nstudents. Over the years, Congress has acknowledged the key role of \nsimilar institutions through provisions supporting historically Black \ncolleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other \ncolleges and universities whose mission includes educational \nopportunities for minority students.\n  The Higher Education Amendments we consider today contain much that \nwill help our students be more successful. I am proud to have been \ninvolved in developing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nWisconsin's students and families. Students work hard to get into \ncollege. Along with their families, they are working even harder to pay \nfor college. However, the high cost of college, combined with the slow \ngrowth of family income and insufficient grant aid is pricing many \nWisconsin students out of a college education. Today help is on the \nway.\n  To reverse this trend the Senate has acted on two bills that will \nsignificantly improve access to college and make a college education \nmore affordable for students and families. The Higher Education Access \nAct will provide $17.3 billion in new aid to students, paid for through \nreforms to the student loan industry, and the Higher Education \nAmendments extends a variety of important programs, such as--work \nstudy, Perkins loans and TRIO. Both bills passed with strong bipartisan \nsupport and together, they represent a major victory for students and \nfamilies.\n  Wisconsin students will benefit from $32 million of new financial \naid, including an increase in the maximum Pell award from $4,310 to \n$5,100 next school\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nyear. Pell-eligible students should expect an additional $430 in aid to \nhelp offset the cost of school. This legislation will also cap loan \npayments at 15 percent of a student's discretionary income, bringing \nneeded relief to students from excessive loan burdens. Lastly, this \nbill provides loan forgiveness for students who choose careers in \npublic service such as, nursing, teaching, or law enforcement for 10 \nyears.\n  The Senate has made college access and affordability a top priority. \nI am proud of the bipartisan way the Senate has acted to give students \naround the country access to college and a chance at a better and more \nproductive life. I am proud to support this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \nreauthorization of the Tribally Controlled College or University \nAssistance Act of 1978, which is reauthorized in conjunction with the \nHigher Education Act. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I have been working closely with the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee to ensure that amendments enhancing tribal \ncolleges and universities are included in S. 1642, the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act.\n  Title IX of S. 1642 reauthorizes the Tribally Controlled College or \nUniversity Assistance Act of 1978 and includes a new title to authorize \nDepartment of the Interior funding for institutional operations of the \ntwo tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical \ninstitutions: United Tribes Technical College and Navajo Technical \nCollege. Funding authorized under the Tribally Controlled College or \nUniversity Assistance Act is essential as it provides the resources \nnecessary for these institutions to continue to provide high quality, \nculturally relevant higher education opportunities for Indian students \nin Indian country.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of the Nation's tribal colleges and \nuniversities because I see how they benefit both their communities and \nindividual students. There are 34 tribal colleges and universities \nthroughout the United States. My home State of North Dakota is \nfortunate to have five of these remarkable institutions.\n  Tribal colleges and universities offer a wide range of accredited \nacademic programs including many from areas of high need such as \nteacher education, business administration, and nursing. In addition to \ncollege level programming, tribal colleges and universities also offer \nmuch needed high school completion programs, job training, and college \npreparatory courses.\n  These vital institutions are essential to their tribal communities, \nmany of them serving as community centers, public libraries, tribal \narchives, career and business centers, economic development centers, \npublic meeting places and child and elder care centers.\n  Approximately 28,000 American Indian and Alaska Native students \nattend tribally controlled colleges and universities across the \ncountry. Tribal colleges are located in isolated, remote areas, with \nhigh unemployment rates where average family income is approximately \n$14,000.00--27 percent below the Federal poverty level. As a result, \nthe cost of attending a mainstream institution, which for many \nreservation communities is several hours away, is prohibitively high, \nespecially when tuition, travel, housing, textbooks, and other expenses \nare considered.\n  Most students attending tribal colleges are the first generation in \ntheir family to go to college. American Indians who earn a bachelor's \ndegree or higher can expect to earn two times as much as those with a \nhigh school diploma and four times as much as those with no high school \ndiploma. Tribal colleges are proven agents of change and provide real \nhope for the future of their graduates and their tribal economies.\n  I have been fortunate enough to hear from many American Indian \nstudents who have benefited from tribal colleges and universities, \nincluding one young woman who faced many challenges growing up on the \nTurtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota.\n  As a young child, this young woman often felt isolated at school, but \nrealized at a very young age that education was the key to making a \nbetter life for herself and enriching her community. This belief stayed \nwith her throughout a particularly challenging period of her life in \nwhich she dropped out of high school and became a mother. This series \nof events provided her with even more incentive to seek education, so \nshe enrolled in the Turtle Mountain Tribal College. She loved college, \nexcelled and has earned her Ph.D. Her story illustrates the important \nrole tribal colleges play in lifting Indian children and young adults, \nwho have faced so many obstacles and adversity in their lives, out of \npoverty and despair.\n  In addition to the Tribal College Act reauthorization, S. 1642 \nreauthorizes a program for developing institutions under title III of \nthe Higher Education Act specifically for the Nation's tribal colleges \nand universities. I fully support the adoption of the proposed changes \nthat I believe will greatly enhance the tribal college's ability to \nprovide higher education opportunities to their reservation \ncommunities.\n  Lastly, I applaud all institutions that serve American Indian \nstudents but we need to make sure that the proposed new title III \nprogram for ``Native American-serving, nontribal institutions'' \nincluded in S. 1642 does not negatively impact the already limited \nfunding available for tribal colleges and universities.\n  I remain committed to finding ways to increase access to quality \npostsecondary opportunities for American Indian students and to further \nstrengthen the capacity of tribal colleges. S. 1642 provides solid \nsteps towards doing just that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of passage of \nthe Higher Education Act of 2007.\n  Last week, the Senate took an important step toward increasing access \nto higher education for low-income students by passing the Higher \nEducation Access Act of 2007 which would increase student aid by \napproximately $17 billion by cutting Federal subsidies to lenders and \nbanks. Today, the Senate expands on last week's important work by \npassing the Higher Education Act of 2007, which reauthorizes programs \nunder the Higher Education Act of 1965, including title II teacher \neducation programs and title IV student aid programs.\n  Many students today dream of going to college but face hurdles to \nmaking that dream a reality, including financial hurdles, which for \nmany low-income students can become insurmountable. This legislation \nhelps students make their dreams of going to college a reality by \nreauthorizing a number of important programs that I support, including \nthe Pell grant program, TRIO, GEAR UP, and LEAP. These programs seek to \nreduce the financial and college preparation barriers that many \nstudents face when applying to and attending college.\n  Higher education is one of the most important investments our Federal \nGovernment can make, and Congress created need-based student financial \naid programs to ensure that individuals from low-income families are \nnot denied postsecondary education because they cannot afford it. I am \ndeeply concerned about the emergence of a widening educational gap \nbetween rich and poor. Statistics illustrate that students from low-\nincome families are pursuing postsecondary education at a much slower \nrate than individuals from middle and upper income families.\n  Increasing the maximum award for Pell grants can help in closing the \ngap between college attendance rates of low-income students and \nstudents from middle and upper income families. I have led and \nsupported many efforts to increase the maximum Pell grant award in \nrecent years, including earlier this year when I joined with Senators \nKennedy, Collins, and Coleman in leading letters to the Senate Budget \nand Appropriations supporting the highest possible increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant award. I am pleased that the Higher Education Act of \n2007 increases the authorized maximum for Pell grants to $6,300 by the \n2011-2012 academic year, and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto push for fiscally responsible increases in the Pell grant program in \nthe coming years.\n  This legislation also makes important changes to the title II, \nTeacher Quality Partnership Grant Program to better train and prepare \nteachers for working in our Nation's classrooms. Access to high-quality \nteachers is a key determinant in student academic success at the \nelementary and secondary level. The provisions in this\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\nlegislation that promote mentoring and training new teachers through \nresidency programs will help to ensure that new teachers entering our \nNation's schools are better prepared and receive the support they need \nduring their beginning years of teaching.\n  I was also pleased that the committee accepted language into the \nmanagers' package to ensure that the grants for training of teachers \nwill promote a wide range of teaching skills, including measuring \nstudents on different forms of assessment, such as performance-based \nmeasures, student portfolios, and formative assessments. In an era of \nincreased accountability at the local, State, and Federal level, we \nneed to do all we can to promote more responsible and accurate \nassessment of students in our K-12 schools.\n  I remain concerned about the increased use of high-stakes \nstandardized testing at the K-12 level, including using high-stakes \nstandardized tests to make decisions regarding school accountability. \nBy broadening the definition of student learning and teaching skills as \nthis new title II language does, we can better ensure that teachers are \ntrained to more accurately and responsibly measure student achievement \nthrough alternatives to high- stakes standardized testing.\n  This bill also takes important steps toward addressing the abuses in \nthe student loan industry by requiring lenders, banks, and universities \nto provide more disclosure to students before these students take out \neducation loans. The bill also prohibits campus employees from \nreceiving gifts of more than nominal value from lenders or banks. I was \npleased to cosponsor Senator Kennedy's Student Loan Sunshine Act \nearlier this year and support the inclusion of those legislative \nprovisions in this reauthorization bill.\n  The bill also includes language based on previous legislation I \nintroduced that defines the terms ``different campus'' and ``different \npopulation'' for purposes of administering the Federal TRIO Program. I \nhave long supported increased funding for TRIO Programs which provide \neducation outreach services and support students from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds as they pursue higher education. The language included in \nthis bill ensures that higher education institutions with branch \ncampuses geographically apart from each other can compete on equal \nfooting for the important TRIO grants.\n  I am concerned that this bill may not adequately protect the privacy \nof individuals whose information is contained in Federal and State \ndatabases. Almost a year ago, I wrote to the Secretary of Education's \nCommission on the Future of Higher Education regarding the Commission's \nfirst draft report which contained language proposing the creation of a \nnational student unit record tracking system, and I questioned whether \nsuch a system, if created, could adequately protect the privacy \ninterests of the students it would be tracking. The bill, while \npurporting to prohibit such systems, exempts any existing data systems \nthat are used to operate programs authorized by the act, as well as any \nsuccessor systems. Moreover, while the bill includes provisions to \nrestrict access to the National Student Loan Data System, it includes \nno similar provisions for other Federal databases.\n  The bill also includes a pilot grant program to develop State-level \npostsecondary student data systems in five States. Grant recipients \nmust comply with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which \nprohibits certain policies and practices relating to disclosure of \ninformation; however, I believe additional protections may be necessary \nto ensure individual privacy. I plan to work with my colleagues on \nthese matters as the bill moves forward.\n  Mr. President, the Higher Education Act of 1965 was one of the key \nGreat Society programs that sought to extend the opportunity to pursue \nhigher education to Americans of all backgrounds, regardless of their \neconomic circumstances. With Senate passage of both the Higher \nEducation Act today and the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 last \nweek, we have acted to continue and expand upon these essential college \naccess programs. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \ncoming weeks and years to continue to support and strengthen higher \neducation programs. In an increasingly global and competitive 21st \ncentury, ensuring access to higher education for all Americans who wish \nto pursue it must remain a priority in Congress for many years to come.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to speak on behalf of an amendment I \nwas very proud to cosponsor with Senator Warner, the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, that was passed by a unanimous vote while I was outside \nthe Senate when we came into session yesterday. I thank Senator Warner \nfor his leadership on this bill, and I express my appreciation to the \nSenate for their support.\n  This amendment is called the minority-serving institution digital and \nwireless technology opportunity amendment. It will help close what is \nclearly a digital divide at minority institutions in the country. This \nwas a bipartisan effort, as I pointed out, and it is directed toward \nensuring we are addressing the current needs that exist in our colleges \nand universities by giving our students an opportunity to compete with \nanyone anywhere around the world.\n  Over 60 percent of jobs require information technology skills these \ndays, and many jobs in the information technology field pay \nsignificantly higher salaries.\n  It is vital to our global competitiveness that all institutions of \nhigher education provide their students with access to the most current \ninformation technology and equipment.\n  I commend our leadership and the HELP Committee for making these \nsorts of issues a priority on the bill we voted on today and for \nensuring that our students have the tools necessary to succeed and \ncompete in our changing economy.\n  This particular amendment will establish a new grant program to be \nadministered by the Secretary of Education to assist historically Black \ncolleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal \ncolleges. These grants have a 5-year time period in which they have to \nbe used. I believe they are highly appropriate in helping these \nminority institutions reach a level playing field.\n  Virginia is home to six historically Black colleges and \nuniversities--Norfolk State University, St. Paul's College, Virginia \nUnion University, Hampton University, Virginia University of Lynchburg, \nand Virginia State University. These are examples of some of the \nuniversities that will be helped by this amendment.\n  Investing in our minority-serving institutions will give our students \nan opportunity to compete far more effectively in our global economy.\n  This amendment addresses the inequality of access to technology that \nexists in many cases because of technical and economic restraints.\n  I am looking forward to working closely with the appropriators to \nensure that necessary funds are provided for this critical program.\n  I again thank my colleagues, in particular the esteemed senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for helping make adoption of this \nimportant amendment possible.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, with the passage of the Higher Education \nAmendments of 2007, we have given the millions of students and families \nthe key to unlock the door to a college education and the American \ndream. This bill represents an incredible victory for students and \nfamilies, and we can be proud that in this new Congress we have renewed \nour commitment to students working hard to achieve the promise of \nAmerica.\n  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 is the first reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Act in nearly a decade and is the result of 2 \nyears of bipartisan compromise. This legislation will reform the \nstudent loan industry and serve the best interests of our students.\n  I believe student loans should be an investment in the future. Sadly, \nfor too many students, their student loans have become a barrier to \nfollowing their dreams. That is why I am pleased this bill includes \nprovisions from my Student Borrower Bill of Rights Act. My provisions \nwill ensure all student borrowers have accurate and timely information \non their loans and will provide much needed help to borrowers with \ndisabilities. These provisions are a major step forward for students \nwho have become disabled and are overwhelmed with student loan debt.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\n  I am proud this legislation also includes provisions from my Non-\nTraditional Student Success Act, as the number of nontraditional \nstudents continues to increase on college campuses across America. \nThese are students with children, students working while studying, and \nso many others. By including a provision to make Pell grants available \nyear around, the Higher Education Amendments of 2007 provides the \ncritical support these students need to complete their college \neducation and makes college more accessible and affordable for them.\n  I also worked with my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee to author two new initiatives to help more students \narrive at college ready for success. The first provision will provide \nthe training and support necessary to place 10,000 new teachers in \ndisadvantaged communities over the next 3 years. The other provision \nwill supply comprehensive data and offer targeted assistance to \nincrease the college-going rates of high school students in \ndisadvantaged communities.\n  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 will produce transparency in \ncollege cost for students. It will also promote strategies to recruit \nand prepare qualified teachers and will invest in financial literacy \nfor students and parents. This legislation will simplify the Free \nApplication for Federal Student Aid to improve the process of applying \nfor student assistance and give families tools to plan for the cost of \nhigher education. In addition, this bill will improve the TRIO/Upward \nBound and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness of Undergraduate \nPrograms, strengthening the pathway to higher education for millions of \nlow-income and first-generation students.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. I thank \nmy Senate colleagues for making this groundbreaking investment in the \nnext generation of American leaders.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed \ntoday 5-year extension of the Higher Education Act to renew major \nprograms that help ensure our Nation's students attain a college \ndegree.\n  This legislation, with strong bipartisan support, also includes new \nmeasures to address rising college costs and would reform the student \nloan system so that it better serves students.\n  Last week, the Senate passed an important piece of legislation that \nwill provide over $17 billion in new grant aid to low-income college \nstudents--$2.5 billion of which would go to help California's students \nafford college.\n  Nationwide, students and their families are struggling to pay the \ngrowing costs of a college education.\n  Four-year public university costs increased 52 percent, while the \nmedian family income only increased 3 percent during the school years \nfrom 1995-96 to 2005-06.\n  In California, even after financial aid is taken into account, 33 \npercent of the median family income is needed to pay for 1 year of \ncollege at a 4-year public college.\n  As a result, many students rely on loans to finance their education--\nthe percentage of undergraduates at 4-year public colleges with student \nloans has risen to 66 percent, especially among low-income students.\n  At the same time, lenders have been provided substantial government \nsubsidies beyond what is required for participation and competition.\n  Specifically, this bill would raise the authorized level for the Pell \ngrant maximum award by $1,990 over 5 years--from the current $4,310 \nlevel to $6,300; authorize the U.S. Department of Education to award \ncompetitive grants for Teacher Preparation Programs that help recruit \nand retain high-quality teachers in high-need schools; improve programs \nthat help low-income middle and high school students prepare for \ncollege. For example, GEAR UP program grantees, which serve over \n150,000 California students, would be permitted to use funds for \ntutoring, extended school day programs or scholarships; create a \nnationwide ``Higher Education Price Increase Watch List'' of colleges \nwhose costs are increasing at a rate greater than other schools and \ncreate a higher education price comparison index to help students and \nparents compare college tuition costs; require colleges to recommend \nlenders to their students based on the best interests of the students. \nIt also prohibits payments from lenders to schools that create \nconflicts of interest; and simplify student financial aid forms by \ncreating a new 2-page form for low-income students, and phasing out the \ncurrent 10-page form for all applicants within 5 years.\n  The key reforms in this legislation will help ensure that college is \nmore affordable for our young people and that they receive the \neducation they deserve to succeed in our global economy. I am pleased \nthat the Senate will pass this important legislation today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senator Enzi and \nSenator Kennedy for making sure that the managers' package includes my \namendment to add Kentucky State University to the list of historically \nBlack colleges and universities, HBCU, that are eligible to receive \nfunding for their graduate programs.\n  Kentucky State enjoys a proud heritage as the Commonwealth's only \nHBCU. Chartered by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1886, Kentucky \nState is one of the 15 original HBCUs recognized in the historic \nMorrill Act of 1890. In recent years, Kentucky State has developed \nstrong undergraduate and graduate programs in the natural sciences, \nmost notably aquaculture.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to visit with Kentucky State's \npresident, Dr. Mary Evans Sias. During our meeting, Dr. Sias called my \nattention to the fact that Kentucky State's graduate programs were not \neligible to receive the Federal funding set aside for HBCU graduate \nprograms because the institution was not among those schools listed in \nthe Higher Education Act.\n  I told Dr. Sias I would try to help Kentucky State, and last week I \nintroduced legislation, S. 1826, to add Kentucky State to the list of \neligible institutions under the Higher Education Act. I thank my \ncolleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, for including this \nlegislation in their managers' package. I am confident that it will go \na long ways towards strengthening Kentucky State's ability to serve the \nCommonwealth's students.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, paying for college is harder than it used \nto be. Over the last 5 years, the combined cost of tuition, fees, room \nand board at 4-year public colleges and universities increased by 42 \npercent, and more students are leaving college saddled with debt. More \nthan two-thirds of 4-year college students now borrow to pay for \nschool, and their average debt more than doubled between 1993 and 2004.\n  Unfortunately, we have learned that some lenders and some \nuniversities are engaging in practices that are not always based on \nwhat is in the best interests of the students. The New York Times \nrevealed that some lenders have offered schools incentives to be placed \non a college's ``preferred lender'' list. One example was an all-\nexpense paid trip to the Caribbean for school officials and their \nspouses to attend an education ``summit'' held at a luxury five-star \nbeachfront resort. Between symposiums and discussions on how important \nit is to address the cost of higher education, guests could enjoy \ncomplimentary water and beach sports, volleyball, and access to an 18-\nhole championship golf course, a 10-court tennis complex, two \nbeachfront pools, and a luxury spa. News of the trip drew such a \nnegative response that the sponsor of the trip, Loan to Learn, \nultimately cancelled it. Other examples of incentives to schools \ninclude iPods given away at a financial aid administrators meeting and \nbonuses based on how much students borrow. Nothing about these \nincentives ensure that the lenders or the schools are looking to \nprovide the best loan available for students.\n  The bill we are considering on the floor today, the renewal of the \nHigher Education Act, includes major provisions from a bill Senator \nKennedy and I introduced earlier this year, the Student Loan Sunshine \nAct. The Student Loan Sunshine Act reforms the student loan system so \nthat it works for students, not lenders. The bill we are considering \ntoday ensures that colleges are recommending lenders to students based \non the best interest of students, not the self-interest of financial \naid officers. We protect students and parents from exploitation by \nlenders. Lenders are prohibited from providing inducements to colleges \nand financial aid administrators that create conflicts of interest. It \nalso ensures that students\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nand their families have only the facts and can feel confident that they \nare receiving the best deal on their college loan.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes key provisions from \nlegislation I introduced earlier this year, the Campus Law Enforcement \nEmergency Response Act. Shortly after the Virginia Tech shootings, I \nintroduced legislation to ensure that all colleges and universities \ndevelop emergency response procedures and campus notification systems, \nand test them at least annually.\n  The Higher Education Amendments Act before us today includes key \nelements of that bill. For example, the bill requires colleges and \nuniversities to develop procedures for responding to large-scale \nemergencies on campus and to test those procedures at least annually. \nThis includes procedures for promptly notifying the campus community in \ncase of such emergencies, a new competitive grant program to improve \nemergency response, and a new role for the Departments of Education, \nJustice, and Homeland Security to advise colleges and universities on \nmodel emergency response procedures and best practices. The language \nadded to this bill will ensure that our colleges and universities are \nbetter prepared for emergency situations, and it will better protect \nthose who live and work on college campuses from threats to their \nsecurity.\n  This bill also simplifies the financial aid process, creates a pilot \nprogram to allow students to receive a financial aid estimate in their \njunior year of high school so they can make more informed choices when \nselecting which college to apply to.\n  The bill makes an important attempt to provide students and parents \nwith more information on the cost of higher education. As I mentioned \nearlier, the cost of higher education has gone through the roof. Every \ntime I meet with the presidents of colleges and universities from \nIllinois I ask them: What can we do to control the skyrocketing cost of \nhigher education? This bill will create a Higher Education Price \nIncrease Watch List, which will include a ranking of each institution \nof higher education whose tuition and fees are rising faster than the \naverage. It directs the Secretary of Education to develop model price \ncalculators to help students and families determine the net price of an \ninstitution of higher education. Universities will be required to \npublish this information in their application materials so it is easily \naccessible to prospective students. If we want to take a serious look \nat the rising cost of higher education, we have to make more \ninformation available to students and families about the real cost of \nattending college.\n  The Higher Education Amendments Act we are considering on the floor \ntoday strengthens many of the successful provisions of the Higher \nEducation Act. It also addresses some of the new problems and issues \nthat have emerged in the area of higher education, including unethical \npractices in the student loan system, threats to the safety of our \nstudents on campuses, and the rising cost of college.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, we have 20 minutes, and \nI want to give notice to our colleagues there will be two votes. There \nwill be the vote on this perfecting amendment, which has been \nintroduced by myself and Senator Coburn and others, and then the final \npassage. That will be in approximately, I don't know, 15 or 17 minutes.\n  How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts has \n7 minutes remaining and the Senator from Wyoming has 10.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will make some concluding comments, and \nI ask the Chair to let me know when there is 1 minute left, if the \nChair would be so kind.\n  The Declaration of Independence proclaimed that we are all created \nequal. Our Constitution demands that we promote the general welfare. \nThe words carved above the entrance to the Supreme Court are ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' There is nothing more basic to who we are as \nAmericans than those immortal words that lie at the foundation of our \ndemocracy, in that everyone counts, everyone matters, and everyone has \na role to play in our society.\n  From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the mainstay \nof our society and the engine of the American dream. Our Nation's \nFounders knew that an educated citizenry would strengthen our land and \nbuild up the values and character that make us Americans. They invested \nin education because they looked to the future and saw an even greater \nAmerica over the growing horizon.\n  We looked forward when we passed the GI bill, and it allowed service \nmen and women coming back from the Second World War to get a college \neducation. They became the greatest generation. The GI bill produced \n67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 teachers, and 450,000 \nengineers. It funded the education of three Presidents, three Supreme \nCourt Justices, and about a dozen Senators who served in this Chamber.\n  That is the kind of vision we have had in America when it comes to \neducation, and it is our vision today as we reclaim our destiny and \ninvest once again in the next generation.\n  In these past few days, we have made a new promise to American \nstudents and families--a promise to invest more as a nation, to ensure \nthat all of our young people--and we mean all--regardless of \nbackground, get the education they deserve and the training they need \nto succeed in today's global economy.\n  We have pledged here in the Senate that it doesn't matter where you \nare from; what matters is where you are going. No American should be \ndenied the right to go to college because of money.\n  Last week, we showed this commitment again when we made another new \npromise to students, providing them with the largest new investment in \nstudent aid since the GI bill. We increased the Pell grants. We \nprovided relief for student loans by saying your monthly payments will \nnever exceed 15 percent of your monthly income. We said: If you become \na teacher, a firefighter, or enter other public service jobs, your \nloans will be forgiven after 10 years.\n  The bill before us brings about other key reforms that will make \ncollege more affordable to young Americans. Our legislation will take \nsteps to ensure that the student loan system is working in the best \ninterest of students by pursuing needed ethic reforms in the student \nloan industry. It will simplify the Federal financial aid application \nand delivery process to ensure that a complex system does not work as a \nbarrier to access for low-income students. It demands that colleges do \ntheir part to keep college costs down. If we do our part to provide \nneeded student aid, they must do their part to keep their tuition and \nfees reasonable.\n\n  It will reform and improve our teacher preparation system. Teachers \nare the backbone of our K-12 education system and this bill will \npromote high-quality teacher preparation programs and help recruit and \nretain high-quality teachers in high-need schools.\n  I thank all my colleagues, and in particular all the colleagues on \nthe committee for the work they put in on this legislation. I \nespecially thank Mike Enzi, our ranking member, for all his leadership \non this bipartisan legislation. This has been in the works for over 2 \nyears--close to 2 years. I thank all the staff who have worked so hard \nover the past months to make this happen.\n  I want to personally mention those who have worked so hard on my \nstaff. I would like to thank Michael Myers, who does a great job on all \nof the undertakings of our committee, and I am enormously grateful for \nhis leadership and his friendship. I would like to thank Carmel Martin \nand J.D. LaRock, Missy Rohrbach, Nick Bath, Erin Renner, Emma Vadehra, \nDavid Johns, Raquel Alvarenga, Liz Maher, Jennifer Fay, Ches Garrison, \nDave Ryan, Jay McCarthy, Lily Clark, Patrick Flaherty, and Brendan \nGants.\n  As we mentioned, this has been a bipartisan effort, and I would also \nlike to thank Senator Enzi's wonderful staff. Senator Enzi pointed out \nthat they have worked very well and closely together, as we have seen \nover the course of the year. This is a major undertaking, and to be \nable to get this kind of joint effort on it has been a great tribute to \nall of those who have worked so hard. These staff members make such a \ndifference to Senator Enzi, and\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\nthey have to me: Katherine McGuire, Ilyse Schuman, Greg Dean, Beth \nBuehlmann, Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Lindsay Hunsicker, and Kelly \nHastings.\n  I would also like to thank MaryEllen McGuire, Sean Maher and Roger \nHollingsworth of Senator Dodd's staff; Rob Barron of Senator Harkin's \nstaff; Robin Juliano of Senator Mikulski's staff; Michael Yudin of \nSenator Bingaman's staff; Kathryn Young of Senator Murray's staff; Seth \nGerson of Senator Reed's staff; Mildred Otero of Senator Clinton's \nstaff; Steve Robinson of Senator Obama's staff; Huck Gutman of Senator \nSanders' staff; Will Jawando of Senator Brown's staff.\n  I would like to thank especially Senator Conrad and his terrific \nstaff who have worked with us on these bills: Mary Naylor, Joan Huffer, \nRobin Hiestand, and Lisa Konwinski.\n  I would also like to thank David Cleary of Senator Alexander's staff; \nAllison Dembeck of Senator Gregg's staff; Celia Sims of Senator Burr's \nstaff; Glee Smith of Senator Isakson's staff; Karen McCarthy of Senator \nMurkowski's staff; Juliann Andreen of Senator Hatch's staff; Suzanne \nSingleterry of Senator Allard's staff; Alison Anway of Senator Roberts' \nstaff; and Matt Blackburn of Senator Coburn's staff, all of whom put in \nmany hours making both of these bills a reality.\n  I would also like to thank the Parliamentarian, Alan Frumin, and \nAssistant Parliamentarians Elizabeth MacDonough, Peter Robinson, and \nLeigh Hildebrand for their assistance throughout the process. I would \nlike to thank Paul Cullinan at the Congressional Budget Office, and his \nextremely knowledgeable and capable team--Deborah Kalcevic and Justin \nHumphrey--for working late nights and through the weekends to model and \nestimate the budgetary effects of the complex provisions in this bill. \nI thank them for their tireless dedication and commitment to \nunderstanding the intricacies of the law. I would also like to thank \nMark Koster, Kristin Romero, and Amy Gaynor in the Senate Legislative \nCounsel's office, who also worked many long hours to assist the \ncommittee in drafting the language and working out the technical issues \nin the bill. Finally I would like to thank the members of the education \nteam at the Congressional Research Service--Adam Stoll, Charmaine \nMercer, Jeff Kuenzi, and Dave Smole whose expertise was invaluable \nthroughout this process.\n  This legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in the \ncommittee, and I hope it will see the same broad support today. We know \neducation is the real key to opportunity. This legislation reflects \nthat knowledge. It is a commitment I believe we must make to ensure \neducational opportunity to each and every young person in this country.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation. Our students \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is always exciting when we get down to \nthe end of a bill, particularly a bill where there has been good \nbipartisan participation and achievement, and this is one of those. \nThis reauthorization bill we have been considering was reported out of \nthe HELP Committee by a vote of 20 to nothing. It is the result of 3 \nyears of bipartisan negotiations, and we can point to ideas in the bill \nin which both the Republican and Democratic members of the committee \nand people outside the committee have participated, proposed, and have \nwound up in the bill. In the end, it is a product with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  I would mention it is not going to be a perfect bill. I would be \nwilling to say that about any bill we pass out of here, it is always a \nwork in progress until it finally gets signed by the President. Quite \noften when they get signed by the President, they are not perfect bills \neither, but they are a perfect compromise when they get signed. That \nmeans both sides give a little bit, and we concentrate on those areas \nwhere there can be agreement. There are a lot of things both sides \nwould like to have in this bill, but they are divisive rather than \ninclusive, and we have left out those divisive things, for the most \npart.\n  In conference committee, we will take care of some of the other \nthings that are slightly divisive to make them more inclusive so the \nfinal bill will help as many students as possible. When I say \n``students,'' I am not just talking about college students. One of the \nthings I hear back in Wyoming is: What about the kids who want to go to \ntech school? We include that sort of thing in here too. That is a \nprogram where they can get a certification that is recognized \nthroughout the United States.\n  My wife was at the National Apprenticeship conference. It was the \n75th anniversary of certification for apprenticeships and the theme \nsong there was done by a friend of mine from Alaska who is the \nballadeer of Alaska. I am sure many of you have heard this song. It is: \n``I am an Educated Man.'' It talks about a person who has a little bit \nof trouble with the book-learning stuff, but if you give him a problem \nhe can solve with his hands, he is an educated man. There are still a \nlot of jobs out there--and there always will be a lot of jobs out \nthere--for which you have to have hands-on work. We cannot exclude \nthose people from the education system. They are absolutely essential \nto our lives. This bill does some things for the ones who want to go to \ntech school too.\n  Senator Warner, in a speech the other day mentioned, when he first \nwent into the military, about a third of the people whom he went \nthrough basic training with couldn't read or write. When they were \nassigned to a ship, there were jobs on those ships those people could \ndo without being able to read or write. Today, the battleships are \nbigger and they are much more technical. It is a whole different level \nof education that has to be done for the people who run those \nbattleships and do the jobs that are needed on the battleships.\n  That is what has happened with jobs throughout this country. Jobs \nchange. It is very important that people who are in high school now \nrealize that when they enter the job market, they are probably going to \nhave 14 different careers--not 14 different jobs, not 14 different \nemployers--14 different careers. Of those 14, 10 have not even been \ninvented yet.\n  It is very important to get a good education so people throughout \ntheir lives can transition to the new jobs that are happening--because \nthat will be happening. Those who do not get the knowledge and the \ncapability to make the transfer to new careers will be left behind. We \ndo not want that to happen.\n  This committee is in charge of education from birth to death. We have \nHead Start--we have already passed that through the Senate and it is in \nconference now. That takes care of preschool. Of course, we have 64 \nother programs besides that that deal with preschool, and we probably \nneed to do something about the proliferation of programs that have a \nlot of overlap in that area, but we have the Head Start one already \ngoing through the process.\n  The next bill we have been told we will work on in the committee is \nNo Child Left Behind. That takes care of kindergarten through 12th \ngrade. There has been a commission that has been formed that has \npresented us with a lot of ideas about what needs to be done. It is a \nbipartisan commission. I am sure a lot of that will be incorporated in \nthe bill. There has been good bipartisan work in the committee on the \nideas that have to be incorporated, some of the tweaks that have to be \nin No Child Left Behind to make it work even better. There is quite a \nbit of agreement. It has worked, but it can work better. We will be \nworking on that next.\n  Of course, this is the Higher Education Act. We did it in two pieces. \nI will have some more comments about that in a moment.\n  But there is another piece missing, and I am hoping our committee \nwill work on that soon, and that is the Workforce Investment Act. We \npassed that through the Senate twice, unanimously, in each of the \nprevious two Congresses, but it has never been conferenced. We need to \nget that done; we could train 900,000 people a year to do higher \nskilled jobs. We don't need to keep exporting those jobs because we \nlack people with the skills. We need to train people with the skills. \nThat is a bill that will do it. I think we have a good basis to work \nfrom on that and, again, a way to find bipartisan agreement. Some of \nthe fear in the past is\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\nwhat might happen in conference. The ones who had the fear of what \nmight happen in conference will now be in charge of the conference, so \nthat is not an excuse. We have to get that one done.\n  Education in America is both a right and privilege, and we have to \nget people to recognize the value of that privilege as we make sure all \nof them can have the education we promised--and we have made some very \nsignificant promises in those areas and have fulfilled many of them. \nThis bill we are working on today is one of those. I am pleased we have \nbeen able to have both the reconciliation bill and the reauthorization \nbill considered within 5 days of one another.\n  By considering the entirety of the Higher Education Act, we are \nensuring continued quality in the Federal student loan programs, while \nproviding disclosure of information that students and their families \nneed to make informed financial decisions. Those informed financial \ndecisions--or uninformed ones--will have a significant impact on their \nfuture.\n  This is the second time in as many Congresses we have been on the \nbrink of systemic reform of the Federal higher education programs. \nHowever, this time we will cross the brink and make these programs more \nefficient, as well as more effective. We will be allowed to meet the \nchallenge of making higher education more accessible, more affordable, \nand particularly more accountable.\n  The American system of higher education is renowned throughout the \nworld. American students will now be provided with the tools and \nassistance contained in both of these bills to complete their higher \neducation and training and to acquire the necessary knowledge and \nskills to be successful in the 21st century economy.\n  I supported reporting both bills out of committee. I did so with the \nexpectation that they would be considered together as a whole by the \nSenate. I am very pleased that the Senate Democratic leadership worked \nwith me and my colleagues to provide this opportunity to have an open \nand full debate on all aspects of the Higher Education Act. I look \nforward to moving both these bills together and ensuring a \ncomprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. There is no \nreason they cannot be combined at this point in time.\n  As debate on this legislation comes to a close, it is necessary to \nthank those who have worked long and hard on this bill. First and \nforemost, I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy. I would like to thank \nhim for his commitment to keeping this process bipartisan and working \nwith me and my Republican colleagues on the HELP Committee throughout \nthis entire process, for maintaining an open position on ideas, and \nfollowing through with those with focus so we could actually wind up \nwith a bill.\n  And I thank him for his approach to the committee process so we use \nthe markup to see what the intensity is and the number of improvements \nthat are being suggested and not make it a straight up-or-down approach \nso we can modify them so they fit and we get the kind of bipartisanship \nthat we have at this point in time. That is a tremendous task. I think \nour committee must handle about 40 percent of the things that come \nbefore the Senate, so it is a wide-ranging task and he does a marvelous \njob with it and he has been very inclusive and I thank him and \ncongratulate him for that.\n  I thank those on my staff who have worked tirelessly--when I say \n``tirelessly,'' I mean both sides have worked through evenings, \nweekends, and reached compromises--and later I will mention more \nspecifically some of those people.\n  I think I have used my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from Tennessee--if he would like to \nmake use of my last minute to talk about education. He is a former \nSecretary of Education. He has been very much involved in education \npolicy. If he would like to say a word to conclude our discussion?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Tennessee \nis recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The American people should be grateful to Senator Kennedy and the \ncommittee and I believe this Senate, for increasing the opportunity for \nAmericans of all ages to continue their education and, second, for \ncontinuing what arguably is our strongest asset in competition \nworldwide, our system of higher education.\n  I can recall the former President of Brazil saying to a number of us \nbefore he went back to Brazil: What we remember about the United \nStates, he said, is the American University. There is nothing like it \nanywhere in the world and we have a responsibility to continue to keep \nit excellent and provide access to it.\n  I thank the chairman for offering me this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to ask for the yeas and nays \non my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, George Mitchell told me this. Of course, I \ndidn't believe him, but I do now. One of my most difficult jobs is \ntrying to determine when votes take place and what the schedule is.\n  I have not had a chance to speak to my friend, the comanager of this \nbill. But I believe it would be in the best interests of the body--I \nhave conferred with the staff of Senator McConnell--that we have these \nvotes--we have two votes is my understanding. All debate has been \ncompleted; is that right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. We have one procedural matter we \nhave to address, but then we will have the two votes.\n  Mr. REID. The procedural matter would not take any time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I am doing this \nbecause I want everyone to be happy, and we don't need unanimous \nconsent, but I am going to ask unanimous consent that the first vote \noccur at 12:25; then the second one occur--the second vote will be a \n10-minute vote--and that there be no speeches in between the votes, we \njust vote on both of them, one right after the other.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, doesn't that \nrun us into the policy meetings? We have some really important things \nto cover.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to Mr. Schiappa. He understands that. He was \ngoing to speak to either Senator Hutchison or Senator McConnell. We \nhave not heard anything back from them. We will try it at 12:20 with \nthe same unanimous consent request I previously mentioned, except 5 \nminutes earlier.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first vote will be at 12:20 and the \nsecond vote on final passage be immediately after the first vote, with \nno speeches in between.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: In lieu of \nvoting now, there will be no votes until 12:20?\n  Mr. REID. What would happen, I have asked Senator Cochran and Senator \nByrd to give their opening statements on homeland security.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like about 2 minutes to finish up \nthe thank-yous on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have lots of time for thank-yous \nnow. Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd need to work their way up here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I ask for the yeas \nand nays both on my amendment and on final passage. I ask that it be in \norder now. I ask also unanimous consent that the yeas and nays on the \nCoburn amendment be vitiated.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The yeas and nays are vitiated on the Coburn amendment.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So the first amendment vote will be at 12:20. It will be \non the Kennedy amendment. Is that correct?\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\n  And following that, the vote will be on final passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first amendment will be the \nKennedy amendment at 12:20, followed immediately by final passage.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ran out of time before I could thank \nmembers of my staff and others' staff who have participated in this \nbipartisan effort to get the Higher Education Act reauthorized. I would \nlike to do that at this time because this bill is proof that a \nbipartisan effort can get a bill done.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Katherine McGuire, who is my \ncommittee staff director. She does an excellent job of keeping the \ntrains running on time on a multitude of issues all at once. Her first \nhigher education reauthorization was back in the early 1990s. She also \nprovides an attitude and a focus that says: Let's get things done. And \nshe is able to work with the other side, and has proven that she is \ntrustworthy and knowledgeable on the issues. That goes a long way in \nmaking sure there can be a bipartisan effort, that willingness to work \nwithin common parameters and principles which helps us to get all of \nthose things done.\n  I especially wish to thank Beth Buehlmann, who is my education policy \ndirector. Beth has devoted her career to improving educational \nopportunities for all Americans. From her work as a math teacher to her \ndevotion to workforce training, Beth really knows what she is doing and \nbrings extraordinary energy to the issue every day. Her knowledge and \nleadership have shaped education policy in our country over the last 30 \nyears. She provides the same kind of focus and direction on education \nissues that Katherine does for the entire committee.\n  I also wish to thank the rest of the education team who greatly \ncontributed to the bill: Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Lindsay Hunsicker, \nand Kelly Hastings. They have worked diligently and, as I have \nmentioned, through weekends and evenings.\n  I also wish to thank Ilyse Schuman and her fantastic knowledge of \nworking a bill through the Senate floor. She is one of the few lawyers \nI have on my staff. She gives that group of people a good name with \nher, again, work ethic, knowledge of the law, and wordsmithing.\n  I wish to thank Amy Shank, who is my budget expert, and has been \ndoing that for several years. She knows the rules and the requirements \nand the capabilities of the budget process and keeps us all on our toes \nand ensures our work meets the budget requirements.\n  Finally, Greg Dean, who did a great job of organizing the amendment \nprocess. He is so attentive and he scurried to make sure that every \nlittle detail is plugged and that we are all up to speed on every one \nof those little details.\n  I would also like to thank members of Senator Kennedy's staff for \ntheir hard work: Michael Myers does a great job of coordinating with us \nand providing leadership on the issues, since they are in the \nleadership now. Senator Kennedy's staff director does that kind of work \nand is very cooperative with our side and sensitive to the priorities \nwe bring up.\n  I thank Carmel Martin, J.D. LaRock, Missy Rohrbach, Emma Vadehra, and \nErin Renner for their expertise on the issues. You should see the \ntalent of these people and their knowledge of education, which you do \nnot get to see, but you get to see the result of their work as we \npresent it. Sometimes we do not do justice to all of the effort that \nthey have put in.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all of the members of the HELP \nCommittee and their staffs for their hard work throughout the process. \nThis is one of the most demanding committees. We cover, as I mentioned, \n40 percent of the issues that come before the Senate. That requires a \nlot of time, a lot of knowledge, and such a wide variety of issues that \nI think the members get a college education about every month, a \ncollege course of education about every month as we cover these \ndifferent issues. I appreciate their help especially working on this \ncollege education bill.\n  It has been an interesting road and about 3 years' worth of work and \nall of it on a bipartisan basis. I thank all of those who have \nparticipated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming is typically \nthoughtful and gracious about his staff and mine as well.\n  As I said, I will include in the Record the wonderful work of all of \nthe other staff.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the second \nvote, the Senate then recess for the party conferences.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor on \nthe Kennedy-Coburn amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand there will not be final \naction on any of this legislation except for the final two votes. Am I \ncorrect on that?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     BRIGHAM YOUNG AND THE PIONEERS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today is July 24, which probably means \nnot very much to most of the people in this Chamber, but in my home \nState, July 24 is close to the biggest day of the year. July 24 is the \nday that Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers came down \nthe canyon outside of Salt Lake Valley and decided that was the place \nwhere they would stop. They had been coming across the Plains for \nmonths looking for a place to settle, and as Brigham Young rose up out \nof his wagon at the mouth of the canyon and looked down over the \nvalley, he stared for a few moments and then turned to his associates \nand said: It is enough. This is the right place. They decided that was \nwhere they would settle. This date, therefore, became enshrined as the \nfounding date of the State of Utah, and it has been celebrated with a \nparade ever since.\n  I remember as a young child being taken by my parents to sit in the \nupper window of a department store overlooking Main Street in Salt Lake \nCity and watching as the floats and the cars went down the street.\n  I remember, as a little boy, that there was always one float that had \na big banner on it that said ``Pioneers;'' that is, these are people \nwho had actually come across the Plains before the railroad, either \nwalking or in covered wagons--or primarily a combination of both--and \nhad arrived in the valley. They were still alive when I was a little \nboy to watch them. One of them was my grandfather, who had been born in \nBirmingham, England, and been carried as a 2- and 3-year-old across the \nPlains by his father and mother and landed in Salt Lake City in the \n1860s prior to the coming of the railroad.\n  I watched every parade, and that group of pioneers kept getting \nsmaller and smaller each year. Finally, there was a parade where there \nwere no pioneers. There was no one who had been part of that trek. But \nthe parade lives on.\n  Senator Hatch and I were both scheduled to be in it today, as I have \nbeen in virtually every July 24 parade since I have been elected. But \nvotes here on the floor of the Senate have made it impossible for us to \ndo that and at the same time discharge our duties. So I simply wish to \ntake note here on July 24 of the importance of that event and make this \ncomment about it that I think may have some relevance to what we are \ndoing today.\n  Those people came to Utah because they had no other choice. They came \nto Utah because they were--the first group of them--finally driven out \nof every other place in the United States where they had tried to \nsettle. They had created a settlement in Ohio, and they were driven \nout. They had created a settlement in Missouri, and they were driven \nout. They had created a settlement in Illinois, and they were driven \nout. And there were many in their group who decided: We have had \nenough.\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\n  They decided to stay in the Midwest, give up their religion, give up \ntheir commitment to the cause that had held them together, and settle \ndown in the hopes they would have peace with their neighbors. But that \nhardy group that decided they were not going to give up, that they were \ngoing to move someplace where everyone would leave them alone, \ndeliberately chose Salt Lake Valley because nothing had ever been \nraised there before. It was part of the great American desert. John C. \nFreemont, the great frontiersman, offered $1,000 for the first bushel \nof corn that could be raised in Salt Lake Valley. They faced enormous \nadversity to do what they did, to demonstrate their commitment to their \nreligion and their convictions.\n  After 9/11, President Bush spoke to us in the National Cathedral, and \nhe talked about adversity. Quoting an unknown source, he said: \nAdversity introduces us to ourselves. As the descendant of some of \nthose pioneers, that is a lesson worth reminding ourselves of at least \nonce a year. Adversity introduces us to ourselves. Those people, as \nthey went through that adversity, discovered who they were and \ndetermined that they would not linger on the past and their adversity \nbut they would be confident about their future. They built there in \nthat forsaken valley not only trees and crops and houses but the \nfoundation of a movement that now moves around the world.\n  I am grateful to them for what they did. I am grateful to them for \nthe legacy of reminding us that the future is more important than the \npast, that our opportunities are more important than our grievances, \nand that when adversity has told us who we are, we should, in the words \nof a hymn they sang as they moved across the plains: Gird up our loins, \nfresh courage take, and move forward in the conviction that our God \nwill never us forsake.\n  Today, on July 24, I share that with my fellow Senators in the belief \nthat it is still good advice for our future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Utah in his \ncomments. Many of the citizens of my State are members of the LDS \nChurch and obviously strong leaders who have done exactly in Idaho what \nhe said his forebears did in Utah. They made the deserts bloom, and \nthey built a culture and a religious base that serves my State so very \nwell today.\n\n\n                           Western Wildfires\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nsomething that is going on in the West as we speak, that is a tragedy \nin reality and something that certainly we all ought to be aware of. As \nI got on the plane Friday morning in Minneapolis in my commute to \nIdaho, a group of young men and women got on my plane: firefighters of \nthe State of Missouri. They were flying to Idaho to help Idahoans \nextinguish the wildfires burning there. I thank them and all of the \nbrave firefighters who have been battling these immense wildfires in a \nseason that is dramatic as we speak.\n  I got on the plane yesterday morning in Boise to return to \nWashington. Another group of young men and women, bedraggled, tired, \nand smelling of smoke, got on the plane to fly back to Minneapolis. \nThat was another group of firefighters who were flown in from the \nEastern United States to help out in Idaho and the Great Basin West. \nThey were simply tired and returning home.\n  We are, in Idaho and in the West, at this moment experiencing one of \nthe most dramatic wildfire seasons in our history. I say that because \nthe season in reality has just started. From a historic perspective, it \nis late July, August, and September that the fire season we think of on \nour public lands, both forested and grasslands, usually begins.\n  Last year, we went through the worst fire season in history based on \ntotal acreage burned. As I speak, we are now ahead of last year and \nburning even greater. Headlines in the local largest daily in Idaho \nyesterday said: more fires burning in Idaho than any other State in the \nNation, well over 600,000 acres burned and many burning.\n  Yesterday morning, five counties in the State of Idaho were declared \na state of emergency due to those wildfires burning. Currently, the \nlargest fire burning in the United States is the Murphy complex, \nestimated to be 570,000 acres; 7,500 people were evacuated from the \narea. Evacuations were being ordered across the State due to the number \nof fires and the extreme of the fire behavior: 100-degree temperatures \nin an area where that extraordinary heat has reduced the dew point to \nsuch a situation that anything that grows becomes kindling for a \nwildfire.\n  Of the 72 large fires in the United States, half of those burning \ntoday are in the State of Nevada and in my State of Idaho. The weather \noutlook has gone from bad to horrible, as these temperatures continue \nand as the Great Basin of the United States progressively dries out. \nMore hot and dry weather is expected along with dry lightning, fires, \nand wind storms. As these lightning storms sweep through, literally \nthousands of strikes occur, and hundreds of fires can be set in one \nevening across the public lands of the West.\n  As I mentioned, the 2006 fire season broke several records, including \nacreage. By the end of this week, we will have surpassed that increase \nas it relates to time and place of the fire season. We have obviously \nnot yet burned the 10 million acres of last year, but by measurement \nthis fire season is now worse.\n  Almost 100 years ago, the Forest Service started something. They \nstarted with a commitment and a philosophy to full fire suppression. \nNow I take you to a little bit of history as to what may be producing \nthe very dramatic fire season we experienced last year and the year \nbefore, and we are now experiencing today. During that time, the Forest \nService's aim was to extinguish every fire, man-made or lightning \ncaused. With the exception of the last 15 years, the timber industry, \non our public lands, enjoyed booming success during the same period. So \nwhile Mother Nature was not allowed to burn the forest, man was allowed \nto come in over the last 100 years and thin and clean. We called it \nlogging. That produced the timber for the home and building industries. \nAs a result, it is arguable that wildfires were kept somewhat under \ncontrol. Not only did we put the fires out, but we were taking the \nfuels off the land.\n\n  In the 1990s, during the Clinton years, as a result of the impact of \na variety of public policies, from the Endangered Species Act to the \nNew Forest Management Act to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, \nand a lot of other combinations, we began to progressively reduce the \noverall cut of timber on public lands. In the 8 years of Bill Clinton, \nwe reduced the allowable cut.\n  Here are the figures on this chart. It is patterned by revenue flow. \nWe reduced the allowable cut of timber on our public lands by 80 \npercent--not 8 percent, by well over 80 percent. So if you follow the \ngreen line on this chart, you follow the revenue flow that was coming \nfrom our public lands through the U.S. Forest Service. Of course, it \nwas during that time that the Forest Service had money. As a result, \nthey had the money to fight the fires. Then you see the decline on the \nchart.\n  As we discontinued timber harvests on our public lands, the revenue \nno longer was produced. But something else was happening. We were \nleaving on our public lands dramatic increases in timber and brush and, \nin today's situation, fuel for the fires.\n  So in part, the West is burning today because of public policy, \nbecause of attitude, not because of Mother Nature. Mother Nature has \nebbed and flowed over time. But when Mother Nature is taken out of \nbalance by man's practices and policies, dramatic results can occur. As \nthe revenues declined and they paralleled human activity on the public \nlands, dramatic increases in fire resulted.\n  What do we do about it? For the last several years I have stood on \nthe Senate floor and participated in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and chaired the Forestry Subcommittee for many of these years \nand have said openly and publicly: We, by our public policy, have \ndestroyed the U.S. Forest Service. We bankrupted it. It no longer has \nany money. In so doing, we keep putting greater burden on it, and we \nwon't fund it.\n  We are not in the habit of funding it because timber sales \nhistorically funded the U.S. Forest Service. It not only funded all of \ntheir practices, both logging and trail clearing and wildlife\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nmanagement and habitat control, it did something else: It put money \ninto the U.S. Treasury. We created a unique balance over the last 100 \nyears because you can't predict a fire season. You have the revenue \nflow coming in. So we simply borrowed the money to fight fires from the \ndifferent accounts of the U.S. Forest Service and at the end of the \nyear, when the fire season was over and all the bills were paid, we \nsimply replenished all of the accounts of the U.S. Forest Service that \nit used to manage the different components of the Forest Service \nitself.\n  It no longer happens today. We are still borrowing money from \naccounts to fight fires, but there is no money in the accounts. At the \nend of the year, because of tight budgets, we don't replenish the money \nfrom the general fund of the U.S. Government. There is no money there. \nTimber receipts used to fund the money, used to create the balance, \nused to do a lot of things. They no longer exist, in large part because \nof public policy.\n  What is happening in Idaho and across the West at this moment, when \nyou see the valleys full of smoke and the mountains full of smoke and \nthe skies with dark bands of carbon-filled air across the West, our \nnatural resources are literally going up in smoke. What is burning out \nthere are trees. It is also watersheds and water quality and wildlife \nhabitat. All of that is disappearing in a ball of fire, and it should \nnot be that way.\n  What are the solutions? Throwing more money at fire suppression? \nWell, we have been doing that by ever increasing amounts every year for \nthe last 5 or 6 years, to the tune of billions of dollars annually.\n  I am the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. \nI put in another half billion dollars to fight fires, and it will \nquickly go up in smoke at the rate the fires are burning in the West.\n  What is the solution? More active management? Yes. More active \nmanagement on our public lands will help the fire situation because \nactive management--if you look at the Healthy Forests Act we passed \nseveral years ago--means you are in there thinning, you are in there \ncleaning the underbrush, you are doing the kind of things that fire \nwould have done naturally 100 years ago. But we changed the \ncircumstance, and we changed the environment.\n  Fire is unique in that it can be beneficial if it is handled \nappropriately. If you have 100 trees per acre, and fire is allowed to \namble through and burn out all of the underbrush, it does not kill the \ntree, in many instances. But if you have 400 trees per acre of the kind \nwe have allowed to happen over the last good number of decades, then it \nburns everything because the fire is so intense by the volume of fuel \non the forest floor. That is a circumstance the West is experiencing, \nas we speak.\n  Fire is a unique natural disaster because humankind has found a way \nto fight it. It can change the situation that breeds fire. How do you \nfight a tornado? Well, you cannot. Yet it is called a natural disaster. \nHow do you fight a hurricane? Well, you cannot. You can predict them, \nand you get out of their way, because it is a natural disaster. How do \nyou fight a wildfire? Give me a shovel, give me the tools, give me a \nbetter environment--a managed environment, if you will--and I can fight \na wildfire. Do not allow Federal judges to be land managers. Allow \nforesters to be land managers in the right context of public policy and \nyou can fight a wildfire. Give me the tools necessary in the local \ncommunities to do so, and you can fight a wildfire. Allow me to use a \nchain saw selectively in the forest to thin them and clean them, and \nyou can fight a wildfire. But, all in the name of the environment, we \nhave decided to do none of these. We have decided to simply preserve \nand allow it to be natural.\n  Let me conclude with these thoughts. The fires that are burning in \nthe West today are not natural. They are hotter, they are more intense, \nthey are more destructive than any forest fires we have seen in our \nforests literally within a century. The reason is quite simple. The 100 \ntrees per acre I talked about that Lewis and Clark might have ambled \nthrough 200 years ago are the same acres in which there are now 400 \ntrees. Because of the heat and the drought, they are dead or dying, and \nthey have created a fuel load on our forest floor that is \nunprecedented. Yet, we, by public policy, have tied the hands of our \nland managers. As a result, literally millions of acres are now burning \nannually. For what reason? I believe it is because we, as a manager of \npublic and natural resources, have failed.\n  There are reasonable ways to do so. There is an alternative besides \nsimply locking it up and letting it burn. Yes, the skies of Idaho and \nthe Great Basin West are full of smoke at this moment. That smoke is \nour natural resources going up in smoke, literally.\n  If we are worried about climate change, and we are worried about the \ncarbon we are putting into the atmosphere, the fires on the public \nlands of this Nation this year will put more carbon in the atmosphere \nthan any 1 year of automobile driving. Yet somehow there are those who \nare willing to ignore it only in the reality that it is nature and \nuncontrollable. I would argue that is not true because 30 years ago we \ndid not have these kinds of fires, and 20 years ago we did not have \nthem, even though we had peaks of drought and dryness and heat.\n  Our professionals told us some time ago if we did not become, once \nagain, active managers of our public land resource it would go up in \nsmoke--and it is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Homeland Security Appropriations\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will proceed to \nthe Homeland Security bill. I speak in advance of that happening.\n  In every State of the Union Address since the terrorist attacks on 9/\n11, the President has raised the specter of another attack. This past \nJanuary, the President said--hear me, the President said:\n\n       Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the \n     shoreless ambitions of this enemy . . . I wish I could report \n     to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. It remains \n     the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper \n     tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement and military \n     action to do our duty . . . to protect the American people.\n\n  Let me say that again. The President said:\n\n       Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the \n     shoreless ambitions of this enemy . . . I wish I could report \n     to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. It remains \n     the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper \n     tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement and military \n     action to do our duty--\n\n  To do our duty--\n\n     to protect the American people.\n\n  And yet despite the President's warnings and the President's \npromises, the President's budget failed to commit significant resources \nto address these dangers. Too often the Department of Homeland Security \nsettles for security that looks good on paper but leaves serious gaps \nin the defense of our homeland. There is too much rhetoric on homeland \nsecurity and too little action; too much wind--too much wind--and not \nenough wisdom.\n  Despite the August 2006 arrests in Britain of terrorists determined \nto blow passenger aircraft out of the sky over the Atlantic, we still \ndon't have proven technology to detect liquid explosives.\n  I wish to say that again. Hear me now; hear me. Despite the August \n2006 arrests in Britain of terrorists determined to blow passenger \naircraft out of the sky over the Atlantic, we still don't have proven \ntechnology to detect liquid explosives.\n  On an average day, 7,500 tons of cargo is placed in the holds of \npassenger aircraft at our Nation's airports, little of which is \nscreened for explosives and virtually none is screened for radiation. \nOur seaports remain vulnerable. Our police, firefighters, emergency \nmedical teams, and emergency managers remain understaffed and \nunderprepared to handle the challenges of the times.\n  The White House--hear me down there--the White House talks a good\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\ngame, but talk is cheap, cheap, cheap. But security is not cheap. The \nWhite House asserted that its budget proposes an 8-percent increase for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. However, after sifting through the \ngimmicks, we found that it is a 1.7-percent increase above current \nfunding. That is barely enough to cover inflation for existing \nprograms. More paper security; more paper security. More failed \npromises; more failed promises. We have a responsibility. We have a \nresponsibility; yes, we have a responsibility to the people of this \ncountry to do better, and this legislation meets that responsibility.\n  For border security, the bill provides the funds to hire 3,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents. The bill also includes $1 billion for border \nfencing, infrastructure, and technology. Our bill adds funds for 4,000 \nnew detention beds, 3,050 more detention beds than are requested by the \nPresident. Get that? We commit the funds that are essential for a \ncoordinated, comprehensive border security effort.\n  Real security cannot be done on the cheap. Hear me. Real security \ncannot be done on the cheap.\n  For aviation security, the bill invests funds that will help save \nlives, and it may be your life, it may be your life, it may be your \nlife, maybe someone's life whom you know, it may be some child's life, \nbut it cannot be done on the cheap.\n  Despite a documented need for $3.6 billion to purchase and install \nexplosives detection systems, the President--get this--the President, \nthe President of the United States, proposes to cut, the explosives \ndetection program by 17 percent. The bill provides $89.4 million above \nthe President's request to purchase and install explosives detection \nequipment at airports. That is for you, the people of this country, to \ninstall this equipment at airports for your security.\n  We take on the challenge of screening cargo before it is loaded onto \naircraft, which you, the people of this country--the passengers--will \nboard.\n  The bill includes $66 million, $10 million above the request--$10 \nmillion above the President's request--to deploy 70 additional canine \nteams--God bless them, those good, great dogs--to deploy 70 additional \ncanine teams, and more screening technology at airports nationwide, at \nairports where the people of this country will board nationwide.\n  Funds are also provided to establish 20 radiation screening teams at \nkey U.S. international airports to inspect aircraft and cargo. You, the \npeople out there, will be boarding these aircraft. Let me say it again. \nFunds are also provided to establish 20 radiation screening teams at \nkey U.S. international airports to inspect aircraft, which you will \nboard, and cargo, which will be boarded by you, the people. All of this \nmoney is well spent. It will protect human lives and cargo and \naircraft.\n  In this legislation, we also speed up the work on disaster \npreparation. Two years ago--how soon we forget--just 2 years ago, \nHurricane Katrina demonstrated our dismal failure in dealing with a \nmajor disaster. Hurricane Rita showed that we do not know how to \norganize an effective mass evacuation. I want to say that again. \nHurricane Rita showed that we do not know how to organize an effective \nmass evacuation. Now, we better get on it. We better get with it. I am \ngoing to say it once again: Hurricane Rita showed that we--that is you \nand that is me--do not know how to organize an effective mass \nevacuation. That is hard to believe.\n  Maybe it isn't so hard.\n  The White House After Action Report on the hurricanes concluded, and \nI quote from that report. I am quoting from the White House After \nAction Report, not my report.\n\n       We are not as prepared as we need to be at all levels \n     within this country.\n\n  We are not as prepared as we need to be at all levels within the \ncountry. What an understatement. What an understatement. Yet the \nPresident's budget proposes a $1.2 billion cut--a cut--in vital \nhomeland security grant programs, including funds for disaster \npreparations and first responder training. Where, oh where, is the \nsense in that?\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security's own estimates, \ntwo-thirds of the States and urban areas do not have adequate plans to \nrespond to a catastrophic event. This legislation rejects the proposed \nbudget cuts and puts us on the right track--planning and training for a \ncatastrophic event.\n  The bill that is before the Senate increases first responder funding \nby $644 million. The President signed the SAFE Port Act last year with \ngreat fanfare. Yet 9 months later, his budget--the President's budget--\nincludes no additional funds for the new security requirements \ncontained in the law that the President signed. This bill makes good on \nthe promises of the SAFE Port Act, hiring specialists to help inspect \nthe 11 million containers that come into the United States every year. \nThe bill commits funds directly to our ports to tighten security.\n  Let me say that again: The bill commits funds directly to our ports \nto tighten security--security for you, the people out there--at the \nports. Port security grants are increased by $190 million to the fully \nauthorized level of $400 million. We double the frequency of \nunannounced Coast Guard inspections at our port facilities.\n  Get that? You better wake up out there. I am going to say it again: \nWe double the frequency of unannounced Coast Guard inspections at our \nport facilities, and we fund the installation of radiation detection \nequipment at our ports to guard against nuclear weapons and dirty \nbombs. I will say that again: We fund the installation of radiation \ndetection equipment at our ports to guard against nuclear weapons and \ndirty bombs.\n  The threat at our ports needs to be addressed now. It is foolish to \ndelay any longer. In order to restore the ill-considered cuts proposed \nby the President for equipping and training our first responders, and \nto fund the increases that I have described for border, port, and \naviation security, the bill exceeds the President's request by $2.25 \nbillion.\n  Incredibly, President Bush has threatened to veto the homeland \nsecurity funding bill. Why? Because of what he, the President, labels \nas excessive spending. Excessive spending. That is what President Bush \nsaid. Let me read that again: President Bush has threatened to veto the \nhomeland security funding bill--that is for you, the people out there \nin the hills and valleys of this great land. Why? He has threatened to \nveto the homeland security funding bill because of what he labels as \nexcessive spending.\n  The $2.25 billion increase in this bill is about what we spend in 1 \nweek--1 week--in Iraq. Let me say that again. Now listen to me. Hear me \nnow. Incredibly, President Bush has threatened to veto the homeland \nsecurity funding bill because of what he labels as excessive spending. \nYet the $2.25 billion increase in this bill is about what we spend in 1 \nweek in Iraq.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Secretary of Homeland Security was quoted as \nsaying that it was his gut feeling that the United States faces an \nincreased threat of attack this summer. Now, that is not Robert Byrd \nmaking that assertion. Let me say it again. Just 2 weeks ago, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security was quoted as saying--did you hear \nthat--he was quoted as saying that it was his gut feeling--that is \npretty deep--that our country faces an increased threat of attack this \nsummer. That is now, isn't it? This is July. This summer.\n  On the heels of the Secretary's warnings, the administration, our \nadministration, the Bush administration, has released its latest \nNational Intelligence Estimate concerning the terrorist threat to the \nU.S. homeland. Where is that? Here, the U.S. homeland. I will quote \nfrom the report. This is not Robert Byrd talking, this is the report, \nthe National Intelligence Estimate, concerning the terrorist threat to \nthe U.S. homeland.\n\n       We judge the U.S. Homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qaida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the Homeland--\n\n  That is my homeland. That is your homeland.\n\n      and a continued effort by these terrorist groups to adapt \n     and improve their capabilities. . . .[W]e judge that al-Qaida \n     will intensify its efforts to put operatives here.\n\n  Where? Not out there, here. Here is everywhere in our homeland.\n\n       As a result, we judge that the United States currently is \n     in a heightened threat\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\n     environment. . . .We assess that al-Qaida's Homeland plotting \n     is likely to continue to focus on prominent political, \n     economic and infrastructure targets with the goal of \n     producing mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, \n     significant economic aftershocks, and/or fear among the U.S. \n     population.\n\n  These are the words written by the best intelligence analysts in our \nGovernment. Those are the words that should force our Government, both \nin the executive and in the legislative branches, to reevaluate the \npriority that we are giving to funding to stop terrorist attacks \nagainst this country, our country--my country, your country, our \ncountry.\n  I call on the President--yes, I call on the President of the United \nStates--to reconsider his veto threat in light of the concerns raised \nby his own administration.\n  The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is critical to the \nsafety of our citizens. The potential threats are enormous. The \nCongress must strike a balance that preserves our cherished freedoms \nand provides for enhanced security.\n  We need to stop squabbling and pass the Homeland Security bill for \nthe President's speedy signature. This is no time to jockey for \npolitical points or to argue over minor differences. The Appropriations \nCommittee, by a vote of 29 to 0, has produced a balanced and \nresponsible bill which needs action now.\n  I thank Senator Cochran and his able staff for their support in \nproducing this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just one \nmoment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased this afternoon to join \nSenator Byrd in presenting the appropriations bill for the Department \nof Homeland Security for the next fiscal year. I might say, having sat \nhere and listened to all the comments of the distinguished chairman, \nthere is another side to the story on some of the issues that he \nraised, and I assure the Senate that they will have an opportunity to \nhear the other side.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague. \nThe Senate needs to hear the other side; all sides, all sides. I thank \nmy colleague, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2381\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am going to quote from the report.\n  I will say that again so that the audience out there in the homeland \nwill understand just exactly what is going on here.\n  Just last week, the administration released its latest National \nIntelligence Estimate concerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. \nhomeland. We are talking about the Bush administration's latest \nNational Intelligence Estimate. I will quote from the report. Hear me, \nI am quoting from the report of the administration, the Bush \nadministration, from its latest National Intelligence Estimate \nconcerning the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. Hear me:\n\n       We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next 3 years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qa'ida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the U.S. homeland and a continued effort by these \n     terrorist groups to adapt and improve their capabilities. . . \n     . [W]e judge that al-Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put \n     operatives here.\n\n  Let me say that again. Listen. Just last week, the administration \nreleased its latest National Intelligence Estimate concerning the \nterrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. That is right here--not \nsomewhere else--the U.S. homeland. And I will quote from this report \nfrom the Bush administration:\n\n       We judge the U.S. homeland will face a persistent and \n     evolving terrorist threat over the next 3 years. The main \n     threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and cells, \n     especially al-Qa'ida, driven by their undiminished intent to \n     attack the homeland and a continued effort by these terrorist \n     groups to adapt and improve their capabilities. . . . [W]e \n     judge that al-Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put \n     operatives here.\n\n  Not somewhere else--here. Those are the words that should force our \nGovernment, both in the executive and in the legislative branches, to \nreevaluate the priority that we are giving to funding to stop terrorist \nattacks against this country--our country, your country, my country. I \nlook forward to a good debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia in presenting the fiscal year 2008 \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the courtesies of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and his staff and all members \nof the Appropriations Committee during our hearings and the preparation \nof this bill. We haven't agreed on everything, but this bill reflects \nour best effort to reach a fair resolution of our differences.\n  I had hoped, for instance, that we could have held the overall level \nof proposed spending to no more than the President requested in his \nbudget that was submitted to the Congress earlier this year. I am \npleased that the bill recommends approval of the President's budget \nrequest for border security and includes 3,000 new Border Patrol \nagents, $1 billion for continued work on the virtual fence, and other \ntactical infrastructure. Funding above the President's request is added \nto accommodate an additional 3,000 detention beds.\n  One of the consistent criticisms we hear about the Department is its \nchallenges to hire the right people for the right jobs and to reduce \nits reliance on contractors. Unfortunately, the bill before us proposes \nto cut the human resource accounts significantly. These cuts handicap \nthe Department in getting the right people into the right jobs to \naddress many of the issues critics have complained about. We can all \nagree that the Department should be focused on hiring and retaining the \nbest personnel it can.\n  Succession planning, diversity initiatives, performance management, \nand workforce relations are all critical issues. By underfunding the \nprograms that are designed to meet these challenges, we run the risk of \ncreating a cycle of unmet promises and potential. This Department is \ntoo important for that.\n  I must also express my concern that this bill restricts the \nobligation of funds in 10 instances. While I recognize this is within \nthe power of the Appropriations Committee and is sometimes necessary, I \nthink we have overdone it in this bill.\n  In three separate instances, this bill provides reductions in funding \nfor the Deputy Secretary of the Department of $1,000 per day if certain \ndeadlines are not met. I would prefer to express our concerns in some \nother way and at least consider reasons that may have caused the \ndeadlines to have been missed before automatically reducing \nappropriated accounts. I am equally frustrated with the Department's \ninability to meet deadlines Congress sets, and I expect the Department \nto meet statutory deadlines, but this approach is not workable.\n  The report accompanying this bill is harshly critical of the \nadministration's handling of security at Federal facilities. These are \nFederal facilities which receive protection from the Federal Protective \nService, and I do not agree with that. The Federal Protective Service \nhas worked hard to rationalize its fee structure and its mission since \njoining the Department of Homeland Security. It has not yet finished \nthe process. But the administration remains deeply committed to the \nsafety and security of all Government employees.\n  The report accompanying this bill also criticizes the Department for \nlegislation Congress has passed. It is unlikely that all Senators agree \nwith all of the legislation that is enacted here, but to blame it on \nthe executive branch agency charged with carrying out the law is hard \nto rationalize. It is unfair and it is wrong.\n  Last year, the Appropriations Committee worked very closely with the \nauthorizing committees to craft a compromise on chemical site security \nlanguage. Chairman Byrd's leadership last\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\nyear led to the enactment of a provision in the fiscal year 2007 act \nthat will lead to regulating the chemical sector for the first time. I \nintend to continue to work with the chairman to ensure sufficient \nresources are provided to the Department so enforcement of these \nregulations is achieved.\n  I am pleased the committee is recommending nearly full funding for \nthe Coast Guard's Deepwater recapitalization effort as well as support \nfor the Transportation Security Administration, Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, and infrastructure protection. These are activities \nwhich are needed to continue to improve the security of our homeland, \nand generous funding is fully justified.\n  This bill comes to the Senate floor during a time when our \nintelligence community has judged that the Nation is, and I quote, ``in \na heightened threat environment.'' While there continues to be no \ncredible specific intelligence to suggest an imminent threat, recent \nevents in the United Kingdom serve to remind us of the very serious \nnature and the potential consequences of terrorist attacks.\n  I hope we can move expeditiously to pass this bill so that we can \nbegin conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, earlier remarks today on the floor of the Senate may \nhave suggested that the Department of Homeland Security isn't doing its \njob.\n  Well, today, this one day, the Department of Homeland Security will \nprocess more than 1.1 million passengers and pedestrians, including \n680,000 aliens arriving at our Nation's airports and seaports.\n\n  Today, the Department will inspect more than 70,900 trucks and \ncontainers, 580 vessels, 2,459 aircraft, and 327,042 privately owned \nvehicles coming into this country. It will house and care for 19,000 \naliens in detention facilities. It will screen approximately 2 million \npassengers and their 1.6 million pieces of checked baggage before they \nboard commercial aircraft. It will make 63 arrests at ports of entry \nand 2,984 apprehensions between ports for illegal entry. It will \nintercept 27,000 prohibited items at airport checkpoints, including \nover 3,000 knives. It will train more than 3,500 Federal officers and \nagents from more than 80 different Federal agencies as well as State, \nlocal, tribal, and international officers and agents.\n  Today, the Coast Guard will save 14 lives, assist 123 people in \ndistress, and respond to 12 oil and hazardous chemical spills.\n  Today, the Department of Homeland Security will naturalize more than \n1,900 new citizens. It will conduct 135,000 national security \nbackground checks on those applying for immigration benefits. It will \nprocess 30,000 applications for immigrant benefits. It will help \nAmerican parents adopt nearly 125 foreign-born orphans. The Department \nwill help protect an additional 104 homes from the devastating effects \nof flooding and protect dozens of high-profile Government officials, \nincluding Members of this body, the President, and the Vice President \nof the United States, visiting heads of state, and former Presidents.\n  This list of daily accomplishments provides just a sample of the \nimportant responsibilities and roles of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. To accomplish these responsibilities, this bill provides \n$36.4 billion in discretionary spending and $1.1 billion in mandatory \nspending for fiscal year 2008.\n  I must point out that this bill provides $2.25 billion more in \ndiscretionary appropriations than the amount proposed by the President \nin his budget submission to the Congress. The bulk of the increase from \nthe President's request level, $1.8 billion, is devoted to increasing \ngrants to States and localities. These proposed increases would come \nquickly on the heels of nearly $300 million being added for grants \ncontained in the Emergency Appropriations Act, which was enacted in \nMay.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report warned about grant programs becoming \nentrenched as entitlement programs for State and local governments. We \nneed to make a strong and successful effort to ensure that all funds we \nappropriate are fully justified.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to considering any amendments Senators \nmay suggest to the bill and to continuing our work to ensure we produce \na work product that will reflect credit on the Senate and provide the \nfunds that are important to the carrying out of duties and \nresponsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security for the next \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my able friend from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, for his comments related to securing our chemical \nplants. He and I will work together--as we always have, as we always \ndo--to ensure that the Department has the resources it needs to enforce \nthe new chemical security standards.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we face extremely serious threats here at \nhome, and that is why it is so important that the Senate pass the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill that is now before us.\n  This bill is designed to help strengthen our security at the Federal \nlevel, at the State level, and at the local level. From our local \nfirehouses and our police departments, to our borders, airports, and \nseaports, this bill will help our country be more secure and better \nable to respond to any disasters we may encounter.\n  This year, in his budget, President Bush sought to cut funding for \nfirst responders and for emergency planning. And, frankly, he failed to \nadequately fund border security and port security. But here in the \nSenate, we have a different view. We want to invest in our security \nhere at home, and we have written and signed a bill that I believe \nreflects the right priorities for this country.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to serve on the Appropriations Committee \nand on the Homeland Security Subcommittee under our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Byrd. No one cares more about the American people and \nno one has worked harder on this bill than Senator Byrd. Thanks to his \nefforts, and those of Senator Cochran, the bill that is before us \npassed our subcommittee unanimously, and it passed the full \nAppropriations Committee unanimously as well. That strong support we \nsaw in both the subcommittee and full committee is really critical \nbecause the President has threatened to veto this bill. He thinks it \nspends too much on homeland security.\n  The President is welcome to make that argument, but in these times \nwhen we are facing terror threats and natural disasters, the American \npeople want us to provide more support for homeland security, not less.\n  There are many very important investments in this bill. I wish to \nfocus on three of them in which I have a special interest because I \ncome as a Senator from a border State and my State has some of the \nNation's busiest cargo ports, and I am an advocate for the local law \nenforcement, first responders, and emergency planners.\n  This bill will provide more resources for our border security. It \nactually provides an additional $240 million for new immigration-\nrelated homeland security costs. Those costs are not funded in the \nPresident's bill. As we all work to step up enforcement at our borders, \nwe have to provide the resources from the Federal Government. That is \nwhy this bill does that.\n  I am also especially pleased that this bill boosts our investment in \nport security. Over the years I have worked with all of the \nstakeholders to make our ports more secure. Last year, in fact, the \nSenate passed the Murray-Collins GreenLane bill, now known as the SAFE \nPorts Act. The President of the United States signed our bill into law \nbut he did not provide adequate funding so we could carry out the \nprovisions of that legislation. We have been working to fix that here \nin the Senate. We started in the supplemental bill that passed a few \nmonths ago, where we boosted funding for port security grants, hiring \nmore customs inspectors. We are continuing that work with this bill by \nfully funding port security grants for the first time ever.\n  This bill provides $60 million as well to create Coast Guard \ninteragency operation centers. Those are centers that will allow the \nFederal Government, local governments, and State authorities to \ncoordinate their efforts in maritime security.\n  The final part of this bill I want to quickly mention will be a \ntremendous help to our responders, to our emergency planners, and to \nour local law\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\nenforcement agencies. In his budget the President cut the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program in half. This bill restores that cut. \nIt is going to raise those State grants from the President's level of \n$250 million to the appropriate level of $525 million.\n  Our States and our cities have huge security needs and many of those \nneeds go unmet today. I believe the Federal Government, which is in \ncharge of our Nation's security, has a role in sharing that burden.\n  In addition, the budget of the President drastically cuts the Law \nEnforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. To me, that is out of touch \nwith what our local law enforcement leaders at home are telling us they \nneed. They are telling us they need more help, not less, so I am very \npleased that in this bill we save that important program so it can \ncontinue to help our local law enforcement officials. This grant \nprovides funds for antiterrorism to our first responders in each of our \nStates. That is an area we have to strengthen, and we do so with the \nbill now before the Senate.\n  Given the strong support this bill got in subcommittee and in full \ncommittee, I am hopeful this Senate will pass it fairly quickly over \nthe next several days by a wide margin. Then, of course, it will be up \nto the President to decide if the American people will get the security \nthey deserve.\n  As I said a few minutes ago, President Bush has threatened to veto \nthis bill because he says it spends too much on homeland security. \nThink about that for a minute. Our intelligence agencies warned us last \nTuesday that al-Qaida is undiminished in its goal of attacking our \nhomeland. What does the President say? He wants to cut funding for our \nfirst responders. That report found that al-Qaida is rebuilding its \ncapabilities, its leadership is intact, and it continues to plan high-\nimpact plots. That is what the President's NIE is telling us.\n  What is the President saying? Right now he wants to cut funding for \nour local antiterror efforts. Our intelligence experts ``judge that al-\nQaida will intensify its efforts to put operatives here,'' on our soil, \nhere, but the President wants to cut funding to enforce our borders.\n  We have all this evidence we need to be more secure here at home and \nwe have the President's budget that makes us less secure at home. If \nthe President wants to veto this bill, he is going to have to explain \nto the American people why the police department down the street from \nyou is going to be getting less support. He is going to have to explain \nwhy the fire station around the corner is going to get less help. He is \ngoing to have to explain why your community can't develop an emergency \nplan so they are prepared for any disaster that may occur. If the \nPresident plans to veto this bill, he is going to have to make the case \nto the American people.\n  I say I am proud of this bill, I am proud of the work of the \ncommittee, and I know it will help our communities take the steps they \nmust to keep us all safe.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to quickly pass this bill, vote for it, \nand move it along the process so we can say we have done our part to \nmake our communities more secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to thank and I do thank--I don't \njust want to say I want to thank, I do thank Senator Murray for her \nkind remarks. She has made important contributions. She always makes \nimportant contributions. And she has made important contributions to \nthis critical legislation. Senator Murray has developed expertise in \nthe field of homeland security, particularly with regard to port \nsecurity.\n  Let me say that again. Senator Murray has developed expertise in the \nfield of homeland security, particularly with regard to port security. \nThat takes time, that takes effort, that takes work. You just don't \ndevelop expertise by rising on the Senate floor and saying ``I've got \nit.'' No. It takes time, it takes labor, it takes toil, it takes work, \nit takes thought. Senator Murray has developed expertise in the field \nof homeland security. That is your security. That is my security. That \nis your security, I say to the people out there in the homeland, in the \ngreat mountains and valleys of this country.\n  Senator Murray has developed expertise in the field of homeland \nsecurity, particularly with regard to port security. I have come to \nrely on her expertise and I look forward to her assistance as we \nprocess this very important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the two legislators who bring this bill \nto the floor of the Senate are serious and thoughtful legislators. \nSenator Byrd and Senator Cochran have been around this place for some \nwhile. They have been on the Appropriations Committee. Both have \nchaired that committee. I am pleased to be here to support their work. \nI think this is a very important subcommittee and one that funds \ncritically important programs for this country. But I want to say that \nunlike other subcommittees on Appropriations--one of which I chair and \nwill hopefully bring that bill to the floor of the Senate--this \nsubcommittee's actions and this subcommittee's product represent an \nurgency for this country. We probably don't say that about every \nsubcommittee because we need to fund the things we need to do, but this \nis urgent. I want to describe why it is urgent.\n  I come from a small town of 300 people in the southwestern corner of \nmy State. I was thinking as I was sitting here waiting to speak, this \nis called homeland security. If, in fact, this were a decision and \ndeliberation by my hometown and the subject was hometown security and \nwe knew what the most serious threat to our town was, we would go find \nthat threat and try to eliminate it.\n  I want to tell you why I believe it is an urgent circumstance to pass \nthis legislation. My colleague from Washington described the National \nIntelligence Estimate of last week. I am going to talk about that just \na bit before I talk about the funding of the accounts in this \nlegislation that is so important to fighting terrorism--that is \nproviding security for our ports and security in aviation, law \nenforcement, border protection, and so on.\n  Last week the National Intelligence Estimate was provided to us, both \nin a classified and an unclassified version. Here is what it said, in \npart:\n\n       Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist \n     threat to the homeland . . . we assess the group has \n     protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack \n     capability, including: A safe haven in the Pakistan federally \n     administered tribal areas, operational lieutenants, and its \n     top leadership.\n\n  Let me say that again. The National Intelligence Estimate says to us \nthe greatest threat, the most serious terrorist threat to the \nhomeland--that means the most serious threat to the United States of \nAmerica and to our homeland--is an organization called al-Qaida. They \nhave protected or regenerated key elements of their homeland attack \ncapability, including a safe haven in the Pakistan federally \nadministered tribal areas.\n  That is a different subject on which I spoke about recently. There \nought not be 1 square inch of ground on this planet that would be safe \nfor Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Six years after 9/11, there ought not \nbe 1 square inch on this entire planet Earth that is a safe haven or \nprotected secure hideaway for the greatest or most serious threat to \nour country.\n  This should not be a surprise to us, the National Intelligence \nEstimate. We have been reading the accounts. This is from June 26, \nJonathan Landay from the McClatchy Bureau:\n\n       While the U.S. presses its war against insurgents linked to \n     al-Qaida in Iraq, Osama bin Laden's group is recruiting, \n     regrouping and rebuilding in a new sanctuary along the border \n     between Afghanistan and Pakistan, senior U.S. military and \n     intelligence and law enforcement officials said. The threat \n     from the radical Islamic enclave in Waziristan is more \n     dangerous than that from Iraq, which President Bush and his \n     aides call the central front in the war on terrorism, said \n     some current and former U.S. officials and experts.\n\n  A month or two prior to that, senior leaders of al-Qaida operating \nfrom Pakistan over the past year have set up a band of training camps \nin tribal regions near the Afghan border, according to American \nintelligence and counterterrorism officials. American officials said \nthere was mounting evidence\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nthat Osama bin Laden and his deputy al Zawahiri had been steadily \nbuilding an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistani tribal area of \nnorth Waziristan.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. What does this mean, that the Senator just said? Tell us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it means if the most serious threat to our \ncountry exists from a terrorist organization that has rebuilt and \nregenerated its capability to attack us in our homeland--and that is \nwhat our National Intelligence Estimate tells us--it means homeland \nsecurity is ever more important and the investments in that homeland \nsecurity, in the accounts such as port security, aviation security, \nborder security, are so unbelievably important. That is why I called \nthis bill ``urgent.'' There is an urgency about passing this bill \nbecause of this serious threat.\n  Mr. BYRD. And what is this bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This bill is the Homeland Security Appropriations bill \nwhich provides the kinds of protections that we need for the threats \nand attacks against our homeland. When I describe what the National \nIntelligence Estimate last week said was the most serious threat to our \ncountry, I described that that threat comes from those who will attempt \nto cross our borders. Therefore, this bill has border security.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That threat may come from those who might try to board \nairplanes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is addressed by the issue of aviation security. That \nthreat may come from someone nailing themselves into a container with \nfood and telephones and a heater----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As we heard happened before, and was shipped into a port \nin this country in the middle of a container ship with a weapon of mass \ndestruction or some other device by which they can attack this country. \nThat is why this legislation of this Appropriations subcommittee \ncontains port security. That is why there is an urgency about all of \nthese issues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield further.\n  Mr. BYRD. Say that again, will you please, Senator. I want the people \nof America to hear what you just said.\n  The point is very simple. There is an urgency in this appropriations \nsubcommittee bill that I think is beyond the importance of other bills. \nWhy? Because we have been told in recent weeks there is a gut feeling \non the part of the person who heads our Homeland Security Agency that \nwe may be attacked again.\n  We have been told by the National Intelligence Estimate that the al-\nQaida organization has reconstituted and regenerated itself and is the \nmost serious threat to attack the homeland of the United States of \nAmerica. If that is the case, and we have been warned--let me describe, \nagain, the August 2001 Presidential daily briefing was headlined this: \n``Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S.''\n  That is what the President received in August of 2001.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, you say the President. What are you talking about?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The President of the United States, in August 2001, \nreceived this Presidential daily briefing with this title: ``Bin Laden \nDetermined to Strike in the U.S.''\n  My point is, in July 2007, nearly 6 years later, July 2007, the \nintelligence assessment from the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center \nsays this: ``Al-Qaida better positioned to strike in the West.''\n  Nearly 6 years later, those who attacked our country and murdered \nthousands of innocent Americans, we are told by those who provide the \nintelligence for this country that they are in a better position now to \nattack this country in its homeland.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator, I think that is worth hearing again. I want the \nAmerican people to hear what you have said.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say it in a different way, concluding in the same \nmanner. I am not, with this, describing one person, one organization, \none philosophy at fault. I am saying there is something wrong with \nrespect to what I think is a failure here, that is a significant \nfailure, part of which I hope and believe can be remedied by the bill \nthat has been put together by Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran, dealing \nwith homeland security.\n  It has been almost 6 years since the terrorists attacked this country \non 9/11/2001. After almost 6 years and two wars in two countries and \nwell over half a trillion dollars spent at home and abroad, the deaths \nof thousands in our military and the wounding of tens of thousands in \nour military, after all that period of time, we are told there is a \nsanctuary, a safe haven, a safe harbor for the leaders of the greatest \nthreat to this country, the leaders of al-Qaida.\n  My point is, there ought not be anywhere safe on the face of this \nplanet. If the greatest threat to our country exists in the leadership \nof this organization that is rebuilding training camps and terrorist \ntraining camps, then we have done something wrong. We must, as the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from Mississippi suggested \nin this bill, we must rebuild our capabilities to defend ourselves \nagainst an attack on our homeland.\n  But even as we do that, we must rededicate ourselves as a country to \nsave the first and most important job, the first and most important \neffort, to go after and eliminate the terrorist threat. I mean, it gets \nback to the debate we have had with--I respect other people's views on \nthis, but we are going door to door in Baghdad with our soldiers in the \nmiddle of sectarian violence or a civil war when, in fact, the greatest \nthreat to our country is in the hills somewhere between Afghanistan and \nPakistan, building training camps and having the greatest capacity to \nattack our homeland because they have regenerated their strength.\n  In my judgment, that is a failure. So we have to rededicate ourselves \non two points. No. 1, I believe we have to find a way to extract \nourselves from the civil war in Iraq. Yes, we need to continue to do \nseveral things in force protection for our forces, training the Iraqi \nsecurity and Iraqi police and Iraqi soldiers for Iraq's security, and \nalso taking on the areas in Iraq where al-Qaida does exist.\n  But what is principally happening in Iraq is not about al-Qaida and \nterrorism, what is principally happening in Iraq is about sectarian \nviolence and a civil war. My point is, we ought to see if we cannot \nmake sure that we will change the policies in this country and begin to \nstart fighting terrorists first.\n  That ought to be the priority. If the terrorists, al-Qaida, Osama bin \nLaden and their leadership, represent the greatest threat to this \ncountry, then why is that not the process by which we fight terrorists \nfirst? Instead, we are bogged down going door to door in Baghdad. Well, \nhere is what we have. We have a piece of legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate now that deals with homeland security.\n  We want homeland security, we want it to succeed. We want to be safe \nand secure with the ways to do that. One is to do what we have done and \ntry to strengthen our ports, strengthen aviation, strengthen our \nborders. The legislation that has been brought to us today does all of \nthat and more. This has money for mass transit security. Well, that is \ncritically important. We know the danger and the potential danger to \nour subway systems, as we have seen in London with terrorist attacks.\n  Port security. We have had discussions on the floor of this Senate \nthat go on and on and on, but we have these ships that come into our \nports with giant containers. We are going to spend, I think in the \nappropriations bill on defense, we are going to spend $10 to $11 \nbillion to try to provide an electronic catcher's mitt for \nintercontinental ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads.\n  So if we can create a catcher's mitt of some type, or hit a bullet \nwith a bullet when an ICBM is coming in with a nuclear warhead, we are \ngoing to spend $10 to $11 billion to try to solve that problem. The \nmore likely attack with a nuclear weapon is a ship, a container ship, \npulling up to a port at 3 to 4 miles an hour, pulling up at the dock of \none of America's major cities with a container right smack in the \nmiddle of the ship containing a weapon of mass destruction. That is the \nmost likely threat against this country. We are not spending $10 or $11 \nbillion to deal with that.\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\n  I went to a seaport once. In fact, I went to a seaport in Seattle, \nWA, because I do not know much about seaports. I come from a State that \nis not boundaried by water. So I wished to see what security was like \nat the seaport.\n  One of the things I remember from that visit was they had opened a \ncontainer. Now, they do not open very many. I believe we have something \nakin to 11 million containers come into this country on container \nships, 11 million containers. I believe it is somewhere around 3 to 5 \npercent are inspected, and 97 or 95 percent are not inspected.\n\n  They opened the container. It was a refrigerated container. I was \nkind of curious. So I looked at the back of it. There it was, 100-pound \nbags of broccoli from Poland. I said: Well, I see now this is a giant \ncontainer full of frozen broccoli from Poland. I can see now that \nbecause you opened the door in the back and you have cut open a couple \nof bags.\n  I said, what is the middle of this container? I see what is in the \nback. What is deep in the middle of this container?\n  Well, we do not know that. We assume it is frozen broccoli. We pulled \nsome bags out to make sure there was broccoli in this container. But \nthe fact is, they did not check that, they could not check it. So \nmillions of containers come in and they are not checked.\n  Now we have what amounts to kind of a CAT-scan device for big trucks \nand containers, very expensive, but it is kind of like a CAT scan for \nyour body; you run it past the container and you can see right through \nthe container and see what is in it. It is very expensive, very \ndifficult to get done on 11 million containers. The same is true for \nair cargo. We have a Herculean task to protect this country against \nthose who are perfectly willing to kill themselves, as long as they can \nkill many innocent people. This is a very difficult proposition.\n  So again, I say to the chairman and ranking member on the \nsubcommittee, I think they have done a terrific job. I deeply \nappreciate their work. I share the comments of my colleague, Senator \nMurray from Washington, about it, with respect to border protection and \nthe Coast Guard and all those issues they have had to deal with, \nwithout unlimited money. The fact is, we have some limited funding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Who is the chairman and ranking member?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the chairman of the subcommittee is the Honorable \nSenator Byrd from West Virginia, and the ranking member, of course, is \nSenator Cochran from Mississippi.\n  Let me say to both of them, if they do not mind my saying it, at a \ntime when there is all this discussion in the newspapers about nobody \ngets along, things have deteriorated in the Senate, the fact is, I \nthink the evidence exists all across this Senate Chamber, it exists \ncertainly with the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and Senator \nCochran, that they not only get along, they work together. They have \nput together a terrific piece of legislation.\n  That is called cooperation. There is a lot of it in this Chamber, \nparticularly on the Appropriations Committee, which makes me proud \nbecause I think that is the way the Senate ought to work.\n  Now, if you will permit me, however, if the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Mississippi will accommodate me for one \nadditional moment while I say wonderful things about their work, I do \nwish to make a cautionary comment about FEMA because we are funding \nFEMA to the tune of $6.89 billion in this legislation. I am a big fan \nof FEMA--used to be a big fan of FEMA, I should say. I am not anymore. \nI hope and pray that maybe it gets its act together. It does not appear \nto me it is quite there yet.\n  But in my State, we evacuated, 10 years ago, an entire city, the \nlargest mass evacuation since the Civil War, when Grand Forks was \nflooded and then had a fire in the middle of the flood, and a city of \nnearly 50,000 people was evacuated because of the floods in the Red \nRiver Valley.\n  We had FEMA show up. Unbelievable, James Lee Witt and FEMA, they knew \nwhat they were doing. They were outstanding. Everybody believed they \nhelped that community come back together and fight that flood and deal \nwith the consequences and come roaring back. Ten years later, that is a \ngreat success story.\n  FEMA, regrettably, has, in my judgment, been part of the problem \nrather than part of the solution. We have natural disasters that occur \nin this country. Hurricane Katrina comes to mind. FEMA obviously was a \ndisgrace with respect to--at least many in FEMA were disgraceful in the \nway they responded to that. I wish to tell the chairman and the ranking \nmember of one example I discovered out of many examples.\n  I wish to tell you about it because as we fund FEMA--and we must; we \ndo not have a choice. When natural disasters strike, we have to have \nthe funding to go to those folks, whether it is a hurricane or a flood \nor drought, we have to go to those people and say: You are not alone. \nThis country is with you. This country wants to help you.\n  But I wish to tell you a story about what happened to FEMA, as I \nconclude. I was on the phone one day to a guy named Paul Mullinax. Paul \nMullinax had a refrigerated truck in Florida. He was one of those \ntruckers who responded when FEMA wanted to send ice down to the victims \nin the gulf. When Katrina hit and you had the evacuations and the \ndislocations and all that trouble, they needed ice. Paul Mullinax was a \ntrucker with a refrigerated truck. So he contacted FEMA, as did \nthousands of others. He went to New York. He was told go to New York to \npick up ice. So he went to New York to pick up some ice. He was told: \nTake it to Missouri. When he got to Missouri, he was told: Take it to \nMississippi. When he got to Mississippi, he sat there on the tarmac of \nan old military installation, along with over 100 other truckers. Here \nis a picture of Paul. This is actually Paul's route right here. New \nYork to Missouri to Alabama, and then, here is a photo of Paul. He sat \nat a military installation in front of his truck for about 12 days.\n  Then he was told: I want you to take the ice back to Massachusetts. \nSo ice, destined for the victims of Katrina, was picked up in New York, \ntaken to Missouri, and then in this case Arkansas--excuse me, Alabama--\nand then it was offloaded in Massachusetts.\n  The reason I tell you that story right now is because that story \nended last week. That ice--and by the way, it cost $15,000 for the \ntaxpayers to pay Paul Mullinax to pick up New York ice to take to the \nvictims of Katrina, to go to Missouri, to Alabama and finally be told, \nafter sitting there for 12 days, to go drive it to Massachusetts to \noffload it--that ice has now been stored for 2 years and this week was \ndiscarded by FEMA because they felt maybe after 2 years the ice was \ncontaminated.\n  So the taxpayers took a bath. The storage of that ice was around $20 \nmillion. The taxpayers took a bath. The victims never got the ice they \nneeded. People such as Paul Mullinax, this guy here, said, after \ndriving his truck all that distance: I got paid, but this was wrong for \nthe American taxpayers. Somebody ought to answer for it.\n  I have spent 2 years trying to figure out who gave the orders on ice \ntransport in FEMA. And you, by God, cannot find the answer. You cannot \nfind the answer. I know many of the top people in FEMA were cronies, \nhad nothing to do or no experience at all with dealing with disasters \nand emergency preparedness, who did not know anything about it. So the \nresult was a complete breakdown. This is just one example.\n\n  In some ways I regret taking time during this debate, but when else? \nWe are going to give FEMA $6.9 billion. I want FEMA to work. I want us \nto be proud of FEMA. I don't want political cronies running it. I don't \nwant someone like Paul Mullinax who hauls ice for victims to scratch \nhis head and say: What on Earth has happened? Where has common sense \ngone? How is it I am told to pick up ice in New York and deliver to it \nMassachusetts, when it is supposed to be helping victims in Mississippi \nand Louisiana?\n  As we fund FEMA, I hope we will also do a lot of oversight in the \nauthorizing committees because there is something fundamentally wrong. \nWe all know that, and we need to fix it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Something wrong, yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Having said all that and given the requisite compliments \nto everyone on the floor--compliments I sincerely mean in this case--\nabout a bill I believe is urgent, I hope we can move ahead. If there \nare amendments to the bill, I hope people will come and\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\noffer them, that they will allow us to vote on them, that we won't have \ndelay, and in the next couple of days we will demonstrate with this \nfirst appropriations bill that we can pass appropriations bills. We can \ndo that because we will cooperate to get them done.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If we come to the floor in the next couple days and see \ndelay on Homeland Security, I am going to be one disappointed person.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of all the bills, we ought to be saying: Let's lock arms \nand do this in a reasonable time; let's do this with the leadership of \nSenator Byrd and Senator Cochran.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's do it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2638, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $36.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2008, which will result in new outlays of $21.3 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $38.4 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and $10 million below its allocation for outlays. No \npoints of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     H.R. 2638, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS, 2008\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     $1,131    $35,308    $36,439\n    Outlays............................      1,267     37,140     38,407\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     36,439\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     38,417\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................      1,137     35,125     36,262\n    Outlays............................      1,270     36,872     38,142\nPresident's Request\n    Budget Authority...................      1,142     33,054     34,196\n    Outlays............................      1,272     36,537     37,809\n \n   Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........        -10\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget Authority...................         -6        183        177\n    Outlays............................         -3        268        265\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................        -11      2,254      2,243\n    Outlays............................         -5        603        598\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2384 to Amendment No. 2383\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so I may call up amendment 2384.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent is not required. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2384 to amendment No. 2383.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow for expanded uses of funding allocated to Louisiana \n under the hazard mitigation program while preserving the goals of the \n   program to reduce future damage from disasters through mitigation)\n\n       On page 69, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 536. PROHIBITION OF RESTRICTION ON USE OF AMOUNTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     shall not prohibit the use by the State of Louisiana under \n     the Road Home Program of that State of any amounts described \n     in subsection (e), based upon the existence or extent of any \n     requirement or condition under that program that--\n       (1) limits the amount made available to an eligible \n     homeowner who does not agree to remain an owner and occupant \n     of a home in Louisiana; or\n       (2) waives the applicability of any limitation described in \n     paragraph (1) for eligible homeowners who are elderly or \n     senior citizens.\n       (b) Procedures.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency shall identify and implement mechanisms to \n     simplify the expedited distribution of amounts described in \n     subsection (e), including--\n       (1) creating a programmatic cost-benefit analysis to \n     provide a means of conducting cost-benefit analysis by \n     project type and geographic factors rather than on a \n     structure-by-structure basis; and\n       (2) developing a streamlined environmental review process \n     to significantly speed the approval of project applications.\n       (c) Waiver.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), in \n     using amounts described in subsection (e), the President \n     shall waive the requirements of section 206.434(c) of title \n     44, Code of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar \n     regulation or ruling), or specify alternative requirements, \n     upon a request by the State of Louisiana that such waiver is \n     required to facilitate the timely use of funds or a guarantee \n     provided under section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c).\n       (2) Exception.--The President may not waive any requirement \n     relating to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, \n     or, except as provided in subsection (b), the environment \n     under paragraph (1).\n       (d) Savings Provision.--Except as provided in subsections \n     (a), (b), and (c), section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     5170c) shall apply to amounts described in subsection (e) \n     that are used by the State of Louisiana under the Road Home \n     Program of that State.\n       (e) Covered Amounts.--The amounts described in this \n     subsection are any amounts provided to the State of Louisiana \n     because of Hurricane Katrina of 2005 or Hurricane Rita of \n     2005 under the hazard mitigation grant program of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency under section 404 of the Robert \n     T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5170c).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this is an important amendment for the \nState of Louisiana. It would be not the whole solution but a \nsignificant part of the solution to a real problem--even a crisis--we \nhave with our recovery from Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.\n  This Congress and, in fact, the American people have been enormously \ngenerous in terms of responding to the devastation of those storms. One \nof the best examples of that unprecedented generosity is the billions \nof dollars the American taxpayer, through Congress, sent to the \ndevastated areas to help people who were wiped out and had enormous \nuninsured losses. At the time there was a big debate: Shouldn't these \nfolks have had more insurance? Shouldn't they have done this or that?\n  Congress and the American people got it right, recognizing that the \nevent was unprecedented and recognizing, in the case of Louisiana, that \nmost of the losses were caused by the actual failures of Federal \nlevees. The levees broke. They broke from underneath. They were \ninadequately engineered. That caused devastating losses to folks \nthroughout the greater New Orleans area in particular.\n  The American people and Congress responded generously. In the case of \nLouisiana, most of that money went into what was called the Road Home \nProgram to help compensate folks for enormous uninsured losses, up to \n$150,000 per household. That is the good news. It was unprecedented \ngenerosity. Again, we say thank you for that.\n  The bad news is that months later, it was determined that \nappropriated money would not be enough and, in fact, the Road Home \nProgram was running short because even more claims were coming in than \nhad been anticipated and calculated. So there is a shortfall in the \nprogram which is at the very heart of our ongoing struggle to recover.\n  My amendment will not fix all of that shortfall, but it would fix a \nbig part of it. It would be a big piece of the puzzle, a big part of \nthe solution, without costing the Federal taxpayer any more money.\n  There is something called the Hazard Mitigation Program that is \nalways involved when there are natural disasters. Because of the scope \nand size of the devastation of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, following \nthose storms, that Hazard Mitigation Program would send $1.2 billion to \nLouisiana. We wish to use that money in the context of the Road Home \nProgram to help meet that shortfall, to help bridge the gap, to help \nfund that program. However, there are some technical requirements under \nnormal hazard mitigation rules that prevent us from doing that. My \namendment would waive those few technical requirements so the hazard \nmitigation money, $1.2 billion in this case, could\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\nbe used in the context of the Road Home Program to help bridge the gap, \nto help make people whole.\n  It is important and accurate that I underscore that these \nrequirements are technical. They are things that are normal \nrequirements of hazard mitigation, but nothing I am waiving with this \namendment would go to the heart of the hazard mitigation purpose. \nCongress, in setting up the program, wanted to make sure funds would be \nused to mitigate hazards, to make sure the same sort of losses don't \nhappen again, to build higher, better, stronger, smarter. Nothing in my \namendment gets away from that fundamental intent. That is important \nbecause I don't want to get away from the mandate and neither do most \npeople in the House or the Senate.\n  Again, I underscore, this amendment would help fund our Road Home \nshortfall, would not cost the Federal taxpayer any more money, would \npreserve and honor the intent of the Hazard Mitigation Program by \nmaking sure the funds went to true hazard mitigation, rebuilding higher \nand better and stronger and smarter, not simply allowing people to \nrebuild any way they could build before. What it would do is waive \ncertain technical requirements to make all of this work. That is \nappropriate given the unprecedented scope, size, and nature of the \ndisasters about which we are talking.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to look hard at the amendment and then \nsupport it, because this funding shortfall within the Road Home Program \nis a real impediment to our ongoing challenge and struggle to recover. \nThis amendment would be a major piece of the puzzle to solve the \nproblem without costing the Federal taxpayer any more money and without \nthrowing out the window the very significant and smart focus of the \nHazard Mitigation Program. It would make us build smarter and stronger \nand higher but still help get people back, make them whole, rebuild \nthrough the Road Home Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Moment of Silence\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nobserve a moment of silence in memory of Detective John Gibson and \nOfficer Jacob Chestnut who lost their lives on July 24, 1998, \nprotecting the men and women who visit and work in this building.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been watching the floor, and not \nmuch is happening. What we are going to try to do now, with the consent \nof the two managers, is move to something the Republican leader has \nworked on for many years, and that is the Burma sanctions legislation. \nThat will take about an hour. That will take us to 5 o'clock or \nthereabouts, if we do it right away. But in conferring with the two \nmanagers--this is an important appropriations bill--we want to get this \nthing to conference so that for any problems the White House has with \nit, they can weigh in and try to work this out so we can send the \nPresident a bill. So if we do not have amendments start coming in \ntonight or in the morning, we will move to third reading.\n  I have laid out, in as much detail as I could, alerting everybody \nwhat we need to do this work period. I think I am like most everyone. \nWe have worked long and hard. We had one work period during this year \nthat was 7 weeks long. We have worked hard. We have worked late nights. \nWe have worked a couple of weekends. We worked all night last week. We \nhave things we need to do at home in our States.\n  Speaking for this Senator, 90 percent of the people in the State of \nNevada are in Reno and Las Vegas, but that makes up a relatively small \npart of the area of the State of Nevada. I have 10 percent of the \npeople in the State of Nevada whom I also represent, and I need to \nvisit with them. I have a wonderful trip scheduled this August to make \na tour of places I do not have the opportunity to get to very much. \nWith the rules changes we have made and the lack of air travel, I have \nto drive. I cannot take a train. There is no air travel. So I will \ndrive around there. I am looking forward to it.\n  The reason I mention that is we have a lot to do when we go home in \nAugust. People have things to do, just as I do. But I told people we \nhave to finish this Homeland Security appropriations bill. We have to \ncomplete SCHIP, which is a bipartisan bill. It was reported out of the \nFinance Committee 17 to 4. The two big cheerleaders we have for that \nlegislation are Senators Baucus and Grassley. We need to finish that. \nThe 9/11 Commission recommendations conference, Senator Lieberman \ninformed me earlier today, should be completed very shortly, within a \nmatter of hours. Then we have ethics and lobbying reform. We have to do \nthat before we leave here.\n  I hope we can do all this by a week from Friday, but if we have a lot \nof delays, we cannot do that. I have said it a number of times, but we \nare going to finish that stuff before we leave. If there are \ninsurmountable obstacles, one of the obstacles that is not \ninsurmountable is to stay here until we get it done. So this is not a \nthreat. I have indicated this is what we needed to do weeks and weeks \nago.\n  So I hope we can have some cooperation. We need to get appropriations \nbills done. I had a conversation with Josh Bolten today, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff. We are trying to figure out some way we can \nwork together on this issue. I hope we can. One way we could start is \nto finish this bill.\n  One thing I didn't mention--it won't take a vote--but the Tuesday we \nget back here after the break, we are going to be on another \nappropriations bill. If we cannot get a motion to proceed agreed to, \nthen we will file cloture on it and have cloture the day we get back.\n  I also telegraph my punches here, so there is no surprise; the next \nbill I want to move to is the VA-Military Construction appropriations \nbill. The subcommittee has changed a little bit from in the past, but \nmy friend from Mississippi can remember when we used to do the Military \nConstruction bill in wrap-up. There was no discussion on it at all. We \nknow it has more jurisdiction than it had in the past. I chaired that \nSubcommittee on Military Construction for a while. It was really a good \nexperience. You understand what our military leaders need. They have a \nprocess they go through to put on the drawing board what they would \nlike, but we never give them everything they want. But, with rare \nexceptions, these are not just things we throw in; we work this out \nwith the military. So that is what we are going to move to when we get \nback.\n  I laid out the schedule, and we have to move to third reading if we \ndo not have some amendments here. We will wait until the morning. We \nshould give everybody a chance.\n  Also, I say to the managers of this bill, I do not want to file \ncloture. I really don't want to file cloture. I hope on an \nappropriations bill we do not have to file cloture. Now, I know I \ncannot control unusual amendments on my side, and I know the \ndistinguished former chairman and ranking member of this committee \ncannot control them on his side, but I hope it will not be necessary to \nhave cloture as a result of amendments that have nothing to do with \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, one of the things I did not do when I \ntalked about the Burma sanctions bill--because I was so focused on the \nRepublican leader--was to mention that working with him side by side on \nthis legislation has been Senator Feinstein. She has worked on this \nvery much. So, again, this is something we can bring to the floor that \nis bipartisan. But I apologize for not mentioning her name because she \nhas worked on this very long and hard herself.\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9819-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Webb, wishes to speak as in morning business for a \nperiod of time of up to--how long? It does not matter. I would like to \nknow.\n  Mr. WEBB. I would estimate 10 minutes, Mr. Leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nstatement by the Senator from Virginia is completed--I ask the Senator \nfrom Virginia, would you rather complete your statement now? You are \nhere ready to go; is that right?\n  Mr. WEBB. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator completes his statement--whenever that might be in the next 10 \nor so minutes, but that be today--the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 44, which was received from the House. I \nfurther ask consent that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees and that following the use \nor yielding back of time, the joint resolution be read a third time and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage, without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, just briefly reserving the right to \nobject, I was unclear if the majority leader was trying to get the \nSenator from Virginia up right now. I have a very brief statement \nrelated to the joint resolution we are proceeding to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what I would suggest is--and I am sure my \nfriend from Virginia would have no objection--the Senator from \nKentucky, the Republican leader, would make his statement, and it would \nbe made as if during the half hour's time. Would that be OK?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. So you would make that now. I know you have things going on \nin your office.\n  Is that OK with the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. WEBB. It is certainly OK with me. Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. So I modify my request to let the Senator from Kentucky \nspeak for however long he desires for up to 30 minutes on the Burma \nresolution; following that, we go to Senator Webb. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my consent request be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we now on \nH.J. Res. 44?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. My understanding of the consent is that the \nSenator would speak against the half hour that was allotted on the \nresolution. Then we would go back to morning business briefly for a \nstatement from Senator Webb. And then we would return for the rest of \nthe half hour of debate on the resolution the Senate will consider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9819-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9819-S9822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n APPROVING THE RENEWAL OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE BURMESE \n                   FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the clerk to report the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 44) approving the renewal of \n     import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this legislation continues the \nsanctions already in place against Burma's illegitimate Peace and \nDevelopment Council. If enacted, these sanctions will continue to show \nthe SPDC that the United States stands squarely with the long-suffering \npeople of Burma and against its brutal regime.\n  Just last month, the International Committee of the Red Cross \ncondemned the actions of the Burmese regime--a rare vocal stance for an \norganization that has historically worked to bring about change behind \nthe scenes. The ICRC's statement, according to international observers, \nis the harshest it has issued since the Rwandan genocide more than 12 \nyears ago.\n  Burma's sham reforms are not fooling the Red Cross and they should \nnot be fooling anyone else. The SPDC recently resumed its so-called \nconstitutional convention, a convention in which most delegates were \nselected by the regime itself and in which delegates are not allowed to \noffer draft changes without permission. Criticism of the draft \nconstitution is prohibited by law. One notable provision in the draft \nforbids the spouse of a foreign national from sitting in Parliament, an \naddition clearly aimed at National League for Democracy leader and \nNobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, whose British husband died \nin 1999.\n  The SPDC calls the convention a ``roadmap'' to democracy. But on the \nSPDC's map, the destination is not freedom, it is tyranny.\n  Until the NLD and Burma's ethnic minorities are fully included in the \ngoverning process, until this process reflects true democratic \nprinciples, this convention should be shunned--shunned--by the \ninternational community. A sham constitutional process is a step \nbackwards, not forward.\n  With that said, there are some encouraging signs. International \npressure on the Burmese regime has begun to increase. Members of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asia Nations have expressed concern about the \nSPDC's behavior, and much like the ICRC's condemnation, recent \nstatements of ASEAN members represent a departure from traditional \npractice. Clearly, there is growing international impatience with the \nBurmese regime.\n  I am proud to say that the United States has long been at the \nvanguard of the movement to democratize Burma. Others, such as ASEAN, \nare following our lead. They are beginning to recognize the moral \nimperative to help the people of this beleaguered nation.\n  I am also proud of the continued unified stance taken by the Senate \nover the years with respect to Burma. On Monday, the Senate Finance \nCommittee voted out this bill unanimously. The legislation has 60 \ncosponsors and once again enjoys broad bipartisan support.\n  I am pleased to be joined again by my good friend and cosponsor, the \nsenior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. I also thank Rich \nHarper of her staff for all the hard work he has put forward to make \nthis legislation possible. On the Republican side, my good friend \nSenator McCain continues to use his respected voice to support the \nBurmese people.\n  It is time for the Senate, once again, to go on record and show that \nwe stand with the people of Burma. As we do, we can be confident of \ntheir gratitude.\n  In a recent book on the plight of the Burmese people by author Emma \nLarkin, a Burmese man urges outside nations to keep the pressure on. \n``Change has to come from outside,'' he says. ``The world must pinch \nBurma harder. . . . Give any money to these generals and it is like \nwatching a poisonous plant grow.''\n  Let's show that we stand for freedom and against oppression, for real \ndemocratic progress and against hollow promises of reform, against the \npoisonous plant that is the SPDC.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to support adoption of this joint \nresolution.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays for when we ultimately \nget back to the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I wish to address two issues this \nafternoon. Before I do, I say to the Republican leader that I will \ngladly support his\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\njoint resolution. I spent time in Burma. I have observed the situation \non the ground. We do need to engage Burma and assist in its movement \ntoward better political conditions, but I believe sanctions are clearly \nappropriate.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Webb are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nremaining in the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Darfur\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I return to the floor to discuss the \nongoing genocide in Darfur. Most of the discussion on the floor of the \nSenate and in Congress for the last several weeks has been about Iraq, \nand appropriately so, yet the time spent dealing with the failed policy \nin Iraq is a stark reminder of how it also distracts us from so many \nother critical issues around the world. One issue in particular is the \n4-year humanitarian tragedy in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  Sadly, in front of the global community's eyes, we have witnessed \nunspeakable horror--mass killings, rape, torture, the torching of homes \nand entire villages. The estimates of death are wide ranging, from \n200,000 to 400,000. Some 2\\1/2\\ million people have been displaced from \ntheir homes, and there is a mounting refugee crisis in neighboring Chad \nand the Central African Republic.\n  Despite a worldwide call for action, the tragedy continues. The \ngenocide in Sudan is becoming increasingly complicated and tragic. The \nviolence threatens to destabilize an entire region, and without change \nthere is little end in sight. Today, we have an important opportunity \nto break the cycle of violence, an opportunity that we must seize.\n  After years of duplicity and stalling, Sudanese President Bashir \nagreed last month to a significantly expanded joint United Nations-\nAfrican Union peacekeeping force. We have to seize that opportunity and \nseize it quickly. Unfortunately, there are already disturbing signs \nthis window may be closing. Yesterday, the Washington Post covered a \nvisit by President Bashir to the Darfur section of his country. \nPresident Bashir said that people there were ``living normal lives;'' \nthat only 9,000 people had died and that ``most of Darfur is now secure \nand enjoying real peace.'' He rejected foreign intervention in the \nconflict.\n  This crisis has gone on long enough. Over 2 years ago, President Bush \ndeclared a genocide in Darfur. Secretary of State Colin Powell joined \nin that chorus. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also agreed. And \nthe President said: Not on my watch--remembering the horror of Rwanda, \nwhere 800,000 people died in a genocide during the Clinton \nadministration. President Clinton did not respond at that time, has \nregretted it ever since, and said so publicly. President Bush said the \nsame thing would not happen in his administration. I have reminded the \nPresident now several times on the floor of the Senate and personally \nthat his administration is coming to an end. If he is going to do \nanything about the crisis and genocide in Darfur, he needs to move and \nmove quickly.\n  The need is simple: rapid deployment of a full peacekeeping force. We \nhave seen this type of urgency with other peacekeeping forces, \nincluding last year in Lebanon, and we must act with similar speed for \nthe people, the victims, suffering in Darfur.\n  Last week, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and I had a good \nconversation. He returned my call on the telephone and we spoke for a \nfew minutes. We talked about the importance of rapidly deploying a new \npeacekeeping force and of working toward a long-term political \nsettlement in this region. It is my hope that our United States \nAmbassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, will work closely \nwith Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to make these steps a reality.\n  The U.N. Security Council will be meeting soon to authorize this \nforce. The Security Council should be firm in its mandate and its \ntimeline.\n  The needs are clear. The force must have sufficient resources and \nnumbers. We can help. The United States has resources set aside for \npeacekeeping efforts in the world. I can't think of many more pressing \nthan the genocide in Darfur. If we are not providing soldiers, we \ncertainly need to be providing resources.\n  It must have a strong chapter VII mandate for protecting civilians, \npeacekeepers, and humanitarian workers. Some of these nongovernmental \norganizations, these humanitarian workers, have been the victims of the \nviolence in Darfur. Men and women who are risking their lives to \nprovide the basic necessities of life have been the targets themselves, \nfor the jingaweit militia and all the violence taking place there. This \nU.N. force must have a clear command-and-control structure and firm \ntimetable. It should be clear day-to-day operational instructions come \nfrom the United Nations. The U.N. mandate must set benchmarks and hold \nthe Sudanese Government accountable for any failure to cooperate. In \nparticular, there should be no room for further stalling or \nreinterpretation by the Sudanese Government. We have been blindsided \ntoo many times by President Bashir of Sudan, who has said so many times \nthere is no problem in Darfur; you can bring in a force; no, I have \nchanged my mind.\n  As this man has weaved back and forth, more and more innocent people \nhave died and been displaced from their homes. We must match this \npeacekeeping force with a renewed diplomatic effort to bring about a \nlong-term political settlement, including naming a Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary General to monitor implementation of a \ncomprehensive peace agreement.\n  The force must be deployed immediately. The notion that we are going \nto do this months from now is unacceptable.\n  Finally, we need a long-term political settlement to match the \npeacekeeping effort. I call on the United States, the United Nations, \nand the African Union to continue intensive negotiations with all \nparties.\n  I also strongly urge all parties, including those representing \nnonsignatory Darfur rebel movements, to participate fully in the U.N.-\nAfrican Union-led negotiations and to tirelessly cooperate in the \neffort to bring about a political solution that will return peace and \nstability to the people of Darfur.\n  Those who choose not to participate leave themselves open to further \ninternational isolation and sanction. Each day we delay on peacekeeping \nand political settlement efforts leads to more death, more rape, more \nhuman suffering, more people displaced from their homes, more desperate \nrefugees. Each day we delay, the crisis becomes more complex, with \nincreased violence and numbers of refugees spilling over into \nneighboring countries creating burdens and instabilities there. Each \nday we delay gives President Bashir another opportunity to stall and \nback away from his commitment. Each day we delay is a further \nindictment of the global community's failure to act decisively in the \nface of genocide.\n  We must not wait another day. Let us not forget the major export of \nSudan is oil. The major company in Sudan that is drilling the oil and \nexporting it is PetroChina, a company controlled by the Chinese \nGovernment. The Chinese need to be involved in this as well, first at \nthe United Nations and then beyond.\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\n  A few weeks ago, after an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal \nwritten by Mia Farrow, the actress, the Chinese finally responded and \nmade some overtures toward the Bashir Government, saying they had to \nact. We have not heard anything since.\n  It is time for the Chinese to step up. If they want to be part of \nthis global community, they should stand on the side of civilized \nconduct. They should condemn the genocide in Darfur and do more.\n  In closing, I thank President Bush, Secretary General Ban, and U.N. \nAmbassador Khalilzad. I want them to know there is strong support in \nthe Congress for swift action to field this peacekeeping force. Many of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle have spoken out for years on \nthe need to do more to halt the genocide in Darfur. We will and we must \ncontinue to focus this concern on doing everything we can to halt this \ngenocide.\n  I hope we have an active voice and role in this debate in the Senate. \nYes, we can do many things--our legislative business--but not ignoring \nthe rest of the world. I hope, in the next 2 weeks, we can take action \non the floor to adopt resolutions and to make it clear, on a bipartisan \nbasis, we want the U.N. peacekeeping force to act and act quickly in \nresponse.\n  We should also be working with the Ambassadors from countries that \nare represented in the African Union, as well as those on the Security \nCouncil, to reassure them that the United States wants swift action. We \nneed to make sure our appropriations bills reflect the need for \nresources to make this a success. As the President said more than 2 \nyears ago, ``Not on my watch.'' We in the Congress, we in the Senate, \nshould say the same, and we should follow that statement with action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois on his remarks. Not only were they heartfelt but \nthey were certainly cogent and certainly correct.\n  My warmest congratulations to the, Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I come to speak to the passage of \nthe joint resolution renewing the import sanctions on Burma for another \nyear. This legislation has been introduced for several years now by \nSenator McConnell and myself. I began working on this issue with \nSenator Bill Cohen a long time ago when he was in this body.\n  Yesterday, the House passed the joint resolution by voice vote and \nthe Senate Finance Committee reported the McConnell-Feinstein bill to \nthe Senate floor on a unanimous bipartisan basis, so I urge my \ncolleagues to pass this resolution.\n  These sanctions are set to expire in 2 days, that is July 26, and any \ndelay will only serve to benefit the ruling military junta in Burma--\nthe State Peace and Development Council is its name--at the expense of \nNobel Peace Prize Laureate and leader of the National League for \nDemocracy Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition in Burma.\n  I remind my colleagues that the National League for Democracy, headed \nby Aung San Suu Kyi, decisively won the last parliamentary elections in \n1989. These sanctions will be renewed for 1 year, so we will have a \nchance to discuss them in a year if the military junta should decide to \nmake some reforms. But, simply put, the junta to date has failed to \ntake any meaningful steps to release Suu Kyi and other political \nprisoners. There are over a thousand political prisoners many of her \npolitical party, elected to the Parliament, who remain in prison.\n  Last month, we celebrated the 62nd birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi. She \nspent her day, as she has for most of her past 17 years, alone and \nunder house arrest--17 long years alone in a house in Burma, with no \ncommunication with the outside world. In May, the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council renewed her sentence for yet another year.\n  I am heartened to know the Senate and the international community are \ncoming together to ensure the abuses and injustices of the military \njunta in Burma do not go unnoticed.\n  Earlier this year, 45 Senators signed a letter to U.N. Secretary Ban \nKi-moon, urging him to get personally involved in pressing for Suu \nKyi's release. In a recent letter addressed to the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, a distinguished group of 59 former heads of State, \nincluding former Filipino President Corazon Aquino, former Czech \nPresident Vaclav Havel, former British Prime Minister John Major, and \nformer Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush, \ncalled for the regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi. They correctly noted \nthat:\n\n       Aung San Suu Kyi is not calling for revolution in Burma but \n     rather peaceful, nonviolent dialog between the military, \n     National League for Democracy, and Burma's ethnic groups.\n\n  What kind of threat can that be to a government? The calls for Suu \nKyi's release are also coming from Burma's neighbors. The Association \nof Southwest Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, now recognizes that Burma's \nactions are not an internal matter but a significant threat to peace \nand stability in the region. At a meeting of senior diplomats last \nmonth, ASEAN made a clear call for Aung San Suu Kyi's release. That \ncall is so welcome. I would like to encourage ASEAN to continue to \nspeak out.\n  Last month, the women of the Senate--and you were one, Madam \nPresident--came together to form the Women's Caucus on Burma, to \nexpress our solidarity with Suu Kyi, to call for her immediate release \nand urge the United Nations to pass a binding resolution on Burma.\n  We did not do this in vain. The United Nations did pass a resolution \nearlier this year, but unfortunately it was vetoed by China and Russia. \nAt our inaugural event, we were pleased to be joined by First Lady \nLaura Bush, who added her own voice to those calling for peace and \ndemocracy in Burma.\n  Our message is spreading and it is clear and we will not remain \nsilent. We will not stand still until Aung San Suu Kyi and all \npolitical prisoners are released and democratic government is restored \nin Burma. Let us not forget that this human rights situation compels us \nto action. Consider this: There are still 1,300 political prisoners in \njail. According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, over 3,000 villages \nhave been destroyed by the military junta; 70,000 child soldiers have \nbeen forcibly recruited; and over half a million people are internally \ndisplaced in Burma today; and over 1 million people have fled Burma in \nthe past two decades, destabilizing Burma's neighbors.\n  The practice of rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by \nthe Burmese military. Use of forced labor is widespread. Human \ntrafficking is rampant. Burma is the world's second largest opium \nproducer, after Afghanistan, and increasingly a source of trafficking \nof synthetic narcotics.\n  Sanctions are not a panacea for every problem, and in many cases they \ndon't work, but in this instance, we still hope they can be effective. \nSuu Kyi herself has said this:\n\n       We would like the world to know that economic sanctions do \n     not hurt the common people of Burma. We would like the \n     European Community, the United States and the rest of the \n     world to be aware that sanctions do help the movement for \n     democracy in Burma.\n\n  Members of this body, this is an amazing woman, a Nobel Peace Prize \nwinner, under house arrest for the better part of 17 years because her \nparty was democratically elected to lead Burma. We should speak out. \nThis resolution is one way of doing that.\n  I urge its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of \nH.J. Res. 44, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. This legislation \nwill send a strong message to the military leaders of Burma, by \nrenewing sanctions on their repressive regime.\n  As cochairman of the Senate Women's Caucus on Burma, I have closely \nmonitored the political situation in that country, including the \ninspiring leadership of a brave Burmese woman named Aung San Suu Kyi. A \nformer winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi has dedicated \nher life for the cause of democracy in her country, including spending \nmost of the last 17 years in detention.\n  I have been proud to stand with the other women of the Senate on \nbehalf of\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\nAung San Suu Kyi. In May 2007, I joined with Senator Feinstein, Senator \nCollins, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Stabenow, and First Lady Laura Bush \nat a press event to show our concern for Aung San Suu Kyi, and the need \nfor the U.S. Government to stand in solidarity with the people of \nBurma.\n  By passing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we are reengaging \non this vitally important issue, but we can do, and must do, more. The \nU.S. should use its influence with the international community to put \nmore pressure on the Burmese to stop the murder, oppression and \nimprisonment of its critics.\n   I know that Aung San Suu Kyi--and the people of Burma--will applaud \nthis landmark legislation. I am proud to cosponsor it, and I urge my \nSenate colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to offer a few comments on H.J. \nRes. 44, which will renew the import ban we first imposed on Burma in \n2003.\n  The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act was our response to the \nreprehensible attack on the National League for Democracy which \noccurred on May 30, 2003, and the arrest of many NLD officials, \nincluding their leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  I worked with my colleagues, Senator McConnell and Senator Baucus, to \ndevelop and pass that legislation. We authorized a ban on imports from \nBurma, subject to annual renewal by Congress.\n  As Senator Baucus and I noted after the Senate passed that \nlegislation, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act contains a guarantee \nof ongoing congressional oversight. We felt it was important that the \nCongress revisit the issue of trade sanctions on Burma each year. That \nway, Congress can consider whether, in light of any changed \ncircumstances, it is appropriate to renew the ban on Burmese imports \nfor another year.\n  Unfortunately, the situation in Burma has not improved. The human \nrights record in Burma remains extremely poor. There is a pattern of \ngovernment policies that suppress liberties. The abuses have been \nextensive and the trend continues to worsen. There are reportedly over \n1,000 political-prisoners in jail. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 11 \nout the past 18 years under house arrest.\n  In December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a \nresolution expressing its grave concern over human rights violations in \nBurma. In addition, Burma poses serious risks to peace and security in \nthe region. This is not the time to reward the bad actions of the \nillegitimate Burmese Government.\n  We should send a strong signal to the military junta that their \nongoing behavior is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof continuing the trade sanctions against Burma for another year.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, ``Do what you can, with what you have, \nwhere you are.'' These essential principles for action, articulated by \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt, aptly apply to America's sanctions policy \nagainst the Burmese Government.\n  Four years ago, Congress enacted the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003 in response to the Burmese junta's brutal crackdown on \ndemocracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers. At the time, \nthere were few options available to the Congress to change events in \nBurma. Congress did what it could with the tools available at that \ntime.\n  Tragically, 4 years later, conditions in Burma have worsened. Suu Kyi \nremains under house arrest, which she has endured for most of the last \ntwo decades. The junta continues to commit gross human rights \nviolations including extrajudicial killings, rape, and torture. \nSecurity forces continue to compel citizens into forced labor, and beat \nand abuse prisoners. And the junta's poor economic policies have made \nBurma one of the most impoverished countries in Asia.\n  When Congress considered the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act in \n2003, I expressed reservations about whether these new sanctions would \nhave the desired effect. Too often, unilateral sanctions only worsen \nthe plight of the oppressed people we seek to support. Too often, they \nfail to weaken the tyrannical governments at which they are targeted. \nThat is why Senator Grassley and I worked together to ensure that the \nimport sanctions would not be open-ended. We agreed to revisit the ban \non an annual basis to ensure that they remain the proper policy to \naddress America's human rights concerns with Burma.\n  Over the last year, we have seen limited progress in our efforts to \nenlist the cooperation of Burma's trading partners to isolate the \nregime. The European Union has renewed its sanctions against Burma. \nSome ASEAN-member countries, which previously declined to publicly \ncriticize the Burmese Government, are now calling for change. But none \nof these measures yet amounts to a unified and forceful deterrent to \nBurma's ruling military junta.\n  Democracy, national reconciliation, and respect for human rights in \nBurma can only be achieved if we enlist more than just the moral \nsupport of other countries. We must enlist Burma's trading partners, \nparticularly its neighbors, to take more concrete actions that put real \neconomic and political pressure on the military generals. I urge the \nadministration to intensify its efforts to garner international \ncooperation to isolate the junta. I will support renewal of the import \nban on Burma, because I am hopeful that we will see greater progress in \nthe year ahead. In renewing the import ban on Burma, I believe we will \nfollow the right course of action: to do what we can, with the best \ntools available, where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nthe joint resolution for the third time.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res 44) was ordered to a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is on the passage of the joint resolution.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. Earlier, the Senator from \nLouisiana offered amendment No. 2384.

BORDER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Grants Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award \n     grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to provide assistance to such \n     agency to address--\n       (A) criminal activity that occurs in the jurisdiction of \n     such agency by virtue of such agency's proximity to the \n     United States border; and\n       (B) the impact of any lack of security along the United \n     States border.\n       (2) Duration.--Grants may be awarded under this subsection \n     during fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (3) Competitive basis.--The Secretary shall award grants \n     under this subsection on a competitive basis, except that the \n     Secretary shall give priority to applications from any \n     eligible law enforcement agency serving a community--\n       (A) with a population of less than 50,000; and\n       (B) located no more than 100 miles from a United States \n     border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--Grants awarded pursuant to subsection \n     (a) may only be used to provide additional resources for an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to address criminal activity \n     occurring along any such border, including--\n       (1) to obtain equipment;\n       (2) to hire additional personnel;\n       (3) to upgrade and maintain law enforcement technology;\n       (4) to cover operational costs, including overtime and \n     transportation costs; and\n       (5) such other resources as are available to assist that \n     agency.\n       (c) Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Each eligible law enforcement agency \n     seeking a grant under this section shall submit an \n     application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, \n     and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may \n     reasonably require.\n       (2) Contents.--Each application submitted pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) describe the activities for which assistance under this \n     section is sought; and\n       (B) provide such additional assurances as the Secretary \n     determines to be essential to ensure compliance with the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Eligible law enforcement agency.--The term ``eligible \n     law enforcement agency'' means a tribal, State, or local law \n     enforcement agency--\n       (A) located in a county no more than 100 miles from a \n     United States border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico; or\n       (B) located in a county more than 100 miles from any such \n     border, but where such county has been certified by the \n     Secretary as a High Impact Area.\n       (2) High impact area.--The term ``High Impact Area'' means \n     any county designated by the Secretary as such, taking into \n     consideration--\n       (A) whether local law enforcement agencies in that county \n     have the resources to protect the lives, property, safety, or \n     welfare of the residents of that county;\n       (B) the relationship between any lack of security along the \n     United States border and the rise, if any, of criminal \n     activity in that county; and\n       (C) any other unique challenges that local law enforcement \n     face due to a lack of security along the United States \n     border.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       (2) Division of authorized funds.--Of the amounts \n     authorized under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) \\2/3\\ shall be set aside for eligible law enforcement \n     agencies located in the 6 States with the largest number of \n     undocumented alien apprehensions; and\n       (B) \\1/3\\ shall be set aside for areas designated as a High \n     Impact Area under subsection (d).\n       (f) Supplement Not Supplant.--Amounts appropriated for \n     grants under this section shall be used to supplement and not \n     supplant other State and local public funds obligated for the \n     purposes provided under this title.\n\n     SEC. 603. ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is aimed at providing \nneeded assistance to law enforcement agencies to address the problem of \ncriminal activity along our Nation's borders. The legislation is \ncosponsored by myself, Senator Domenici, Senator Hutchison, and Senator \nCornyn. It has passed the Senate on two previous occasions, including \nlast year as part of the Senate's 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill.\n  Specifically, the amendment establishes a competitive grant program \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security to help local law \nenforcement that is situated along our borders to cover some of the \ncosts they incur as a result of having to deal with illegal \nimmigration, with drug trafficking, with stolen vehicles, and with \nother border-related crimes. The amendment authorizes $50 million a \nyear to enable law enforcement within 100 miles of the border to hire \nadditional personnel and obtain the equipment and cover the overtime \nand transportation costs they incur in these activities. Law \nenforcement outside of this geographic limit that is provided for in \nthe amendment would be eligible if the Secretary of Homeland Security \ncertified that they were located in a ``High Impact Area.''\n  The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with Canada and 1,989 \nmiles of border with Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies \nthat are located along these borders are small, rural departments that \nare charged with patrolling large areas of land with very few officers \nand very limited resources. According to a 2001 study of the U.S.-\nMexico Border Counties Coalition, criminal justice costs associated \nwith illegal immigration exceed $89 million each year. Counties along \nthe southwest border are some of the poorest in the country and are not \nin a good position to cover these additional costs.\n  For far too long, local law enforcement agencies operating along our \nborders have had to incur significant costs due to the inability of \nGovernment to secure our Nation's borders. It is time that the Federal \nGovernment recognize that border communities should not have to bear \nthis burden alone. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I am informed this amendment has been cleared by both sides, and I \nthink we are ready to go to a vote on it, unless the managers wish \nadditional debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed this amendment. It is as \nthe Senator from New Mexico said, a matter that has been before the \nbody\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nbefore and has been previously approved. We have no objection to \nproceeding as suggested by the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2388) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers, Senators \nByrd and Cochran. We have done some work this afternoon. We are getting \na feel of the legislation. Senator Cantwell has an amendment she will \noffer at the appropriate time. Maybe it can be worked out with the \nmanagers. If it cannot, we certainly are not going to be able to debate \nit all tonight. We are working on the warrior legislation. If we decide \nto finish that tonight, that will be done by unanimous consent and \nwon't require a rollcall vote. At least it won't require one tonight. \nSo I think that with a number of balls being up in the air--and we are \nwaiting for other Senators to come and offer amendments--we will have \nno more rollcall votes tonight.\n  I suggest, though, that Senators should understand that tomorrow is \nWednesday and we really need to finish this bill. I hope Senators who \nhave amendments to offer will do that. I checked with the managers, and \nI have spoken with Senator Cochran. Tomorrow, if we are in a period \nwhere there are no amendments being offered, we will move to third \nreading. If people want to improve this bill in any way that they feel \nappropriate, the way to do it is to come and offer an amendment.\n  I have said today--and I say it again--I don't want to file cloture \non the bill. I think it would set a pattern for how we need to work on \nappropriations bills. Let's get this done in the regular order. In \nfact, I said earlier today--and I will say it again--I have spoken to \nthe President's Chief of Staff about appropriations bills generally. My \nfeeling is that we will be happy to sit down and talk to the \nPresident's people about an overall program to get these bills passed. \nIn the meantime, let's do them one at a time. The power of the White \nHouse, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican President, comes when \nwe have the conference, anyway.\n  Again, I hope we can work within the regular order to get this \npassed. I notify all Senate offices that there will be no more rollcall \nvotes tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, we have not been able to clear the Wounded \nWarrior legislation. It is my understanding the minority is looking at \nthat again tonight. Hopefully, we can get it done tomorrow.\n  When I come in in the morning, when the Senate convenes, I am going \nto ask consent again to pass that. This is one of the opportunities we \nhave to really do something for the troops. The Defense authorization \nbill, the other stuff in it, doesn't become effective until the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, October 1, but this, Wounded Warrior, \nbecomes effective upon passage and approval, so it would really be good \nif we could do that sooner rather than later. As soon as we complete it \nhere, we will be that much closer to being able to get that to the \nPresident. The House can do it very quickly.\n  I was meeting with the Speaker this afternoon. It is amazing what \nthey can do in just a short period of time. I went over my list of \nthings I wanted to complete for the Senate this next couple of weeks: \nThis appropriations bill we are working on now, SCHIP, the conference \nreport on ethics, and then the one on \n9/11.\n  She had two pages of things they were going to do in the next couple \nof weeks.

Mr. President, during the last year I have listened to a \nlot of things Ohioans have said, have told me, as I have traveled from \nCleveland to Portsmouth, and from Toledo to Cincinnati and from \nYoungstown to Lima and Bryan. I have heard repeatedly, particularly \nmiddle class and working families talk about lost opportunity, that \nthey do not have the same opportunity for wage increases, do not have \nthe same opportunity to join a union, do not have the same opportunity \nto send their kids to college.\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\n  Earlier today, we passed legislation--overwhelmingly, bipartisanly--\nfinally, to raise Pell grants to increase the opportunity for young \npeople to go to school. Pell grants had not been increased in years and \nyears and years.\n  We know for students in Ohio, for example, the cost of a public \neducation at a 4-year public school has gone up, in the last 5 years, \n53 percent. The cost of a private education at a 4-year private school \nhas gone up 28 percent. Yet the average wage in Ohio only went up 3 \npercent. So we have private education going up this much, public \neducation going up this much, and wages increasing only slightly. That \nis why the legislation the Senate passed earlier and legislation the \nHouse is working on absolutely will matter to provide opportunity for \nmiddle-class kids.\n  At the same time, as I traveled the State, I heard people talk about \ntax policy. It is clear to people in Akron, in Youngstown, it is clear \nto people in Dayton and Middletown, and Hamilton and Gallipolis and \nGalion, OH, that too often the wealthy have paid, as their income goes \nup and up and up, very little in taxes, relatively, while middle-class \nfamilies get more and more of a burden.\n  We saw, from 1946 to 1973, in the history of this country, economic \nopportunities for poor families and working families grew. Then, from \n1973 to 2000, we saw it pretty much level out. We have seen those \nfamilies who are working hard, playing by the rules, not even enjoying \nincreases at all in their wages. In fact, they have fallen behind in \ntoo many cases.\n  That is why today, in addition to passing the bill providing \nopportunity for students to go to Ohio State or Hiram College or the \nUniversity of Toledo or the University of Steubenville, students in \nOhio have more opportunity--after this bill becomes law, if we can get \nthe President to sign it--than they had yesterday.\n  Today is also a cause to celebrate. Today the minimum wage goes into \neffect. It is the first raise in 10 years. For 300,000 working Ohioans, \n13 million workers nationwide, they will see their wages go up today.\n  For 10 years, worker productivity has gone up. In this country, more \nproductive workers meant higher income workers. But too often we have \nseen a disconnect between productivity and wages. While American \nworkers are continually more productive, their wages have not gone up. \nWhether that is a minimum wage worker, whether it is a worker making \n$20 an hour, it is way too common.\n  Today, we did something about it for those minimum wage workers. \nBecause of workers in this country--minimum wage and higher income \nworkers--because of what they did last November, voting for change, \nminimum wage workers have the increase in the pay they deserve and have \nearned.\n  It is a good day for American workers. It is especially a good day \nfor minimum wage workers. We have lots more work to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9825-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAQ CONTINGENCY PLANS\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, an issue I wish to address today relates to \na request that Senator Clinton, my colleague from New York, made to the \nSecretary of Defense back in May, asking that appropriate oversight \ncommittees in the Congress, particularly the Armed Services Committee \non which I serve, as does the Presiding Officer, be given briefings \nregarding what current contingency plans might exist in the Department \nof Defense if we do, in fact, begin a withdrawal of our forces from \nIraq.\n  The Secretary of Defense did not respond to the Senator from New York \ndirectly. Instead, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Eric \nEdelman, wrote her a letter with which she took great umbrage last \nweekend stating, and I quote from Mr. Edelman's letter, ``that \npremature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from \nIraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon \nits allies in Iraq, much as we are perceived to have done in Vietnam, \nLebanon, and Somalia.''\n  He then said at the end of his letter:\n\n       It is a longstanding departmental policy that operational \n     plans, including contingency plans, are not released outside \n     of the department.\n\n  I have great concerns about this letter, having spent 5 years working \nin the Pentagon and knowing these sorts of letters require coordination \namong the highest offices inside the Pentagon. I ask that the Secretary \nof Defense clarify that position of the Department of Defense on the \nmatters that his Under Secretary addressed.\n  Is it the policy of the Department of Defense that a discussion of \nthe withdrawal of forces reinforces enemy propaganda and that we might \nbe abandoning our allies, as we are perceived to have done in Lebanon \nand Somalia?\n  The first thing I ask is, what allies did we abandon in Lebanon and \nSomalia?--I was in Lebanon as a journalist. We went into Lebanon as \npart of a U.N. peacekeeping force in order to separate warring \nfactions. We were there purely on a mission of peace. We were not there \nto side with one faction or another. In Somalia, it was basically gang \nwarfare. We all know that now.\n  This is the kind of rhetoric that, in my opinion, was designed purely \nfor the purpose of attacking Senator Clinton rather than addressing the \nissues that we need to be looking at.\n  There is probably no greater testimony to that than to just go back \nto the bill that Senator Warner and Senator Lugar offered as an \namendment on the Defense authorization bill, which was just pulled \nbecause this amendment--which was put together after careful thought by \nthe former chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the former \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, two of the esteemed \nleaders of the Republican Party--asked for the same thing. In fact, it \ncalled for the same thing.\n  Senator Warner and Senator Lugar were stating in this amendment that \nthe President should require, among other things, a report to be \npresented to the Congress no later than October 16, 2007, which \nspecifically addressed the same issues that Senator Clinton asked to be \naddressed in her letter, showing what the plans might be and when they \nmight be executable in the event we decide to withdraw our forces from \nIraq.\n  Also, I think it is a legitimate question for people in Congress to \nbe asking when we look back at the way we ended up going into Iraq. I \nwas not a Member of this body, but I watched, as did so many Americans, \non television as this body and the House of Representatives had \nadministration officials testifying. They asked in the runup to this \nwar how long we were going to be in Iraq, and the answer was a litany. \nIt was as long as is necessary and not 1 day more.\n  For Under Secretary Edelman to in any way indicate that it is the \npolicy of this administration that they do not have to share the \nthought they are putting into these options is totally out of line.\n  For that reason, I joined with Senator Clinton, Senator Bayh, and \nSenator Byrd in a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee specifically asking that we have hearings in the Armed \nServices Committee that will address these issues. If the \nadministration wants to go into closed hearings, that is fine. But I am \nasking today, No. 1, that the Secretary of Defense clarify for us what \nhis beliefs are with respect to the rhetoric that came out of a letter \nthat took 2 months to be generated from his Department in response to \nwhat Senator Clinton asked for; and then secondly, that the other \nMembers of this body join me in expressing their concern on this issue.\n  We have to have contingency plans. It is within the purview of the \nCongress for us to examine them. Again, I ask Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to put their eyes on this and join me in this expression of \nconcern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9825-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9825-S9826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      NATIONAL HISTORY DAY WINNERS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY.

I am proud to say that these \nstudents were selected from more than 2,000 finalists by the National \nHistory Day program to present their projects.\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\n  Leigh Douglas presented a performance titled, ``Traditional Irish \nMusic and Dance: Triumphing over Tragedy'' at the Smithsonian American \nArt Museum. Helen Lee's exhibit titled, ``The Triangle Factory Fire: \nTragedy and Triumph for the American Worker,'' and Brian Maskal's \nexhibit, ``Atomic Bomb: A Race for Triumph or Tragedy'' were displayed \nat the National Archives and Records Administration.\n  These students created projects that add important perspectives to \nthe way we think about American history. Lee's exhibit explored how a \nworkplace tragedy reshaped the role of the American worker. Douglas's \nperformance illustrated the ability of Irish dance and music to provide \nstrength, unity and tradition within the community. Maskal articulately \nportrayed the role of the atom bomb in the 20th century and how it too \nhas reshaped the way we view the world. I am proud of the dedication \nand hard work of these students from Washington State.\n  I would like to commend the National History Day Program for \nempowering students like Leigh Douglas, Helen Lee, and Brian Maskal to \ntake a deeper look into history so we can better understand and address \nthe problems our Nation faces today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9826-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING WARREN BERRY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania opposing the provisions of the Energy Policy Act \n     of 1992 that preempt the authority of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania to determine land use policies; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 129\n\n       Whereas, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPact) was passed \n     by the Congress on July 29, 2005, and signed into law on \n     August 8, 2005; and\n       Whereas, the EPact was promoted as a comprehensive approach \n     to growing energy needs and designed to guarantee development \n     of domestic fuel production and energy supply, thereby ending \n     United States dependence on foreign oil; and\n       Whereas, provisions of the omnibus legislation touch on \n     nearly every segment of energy production and use, including \n     nuclear power, electricity, natural gas, fossil fuels, \n     renewable energy and competitive generation; and\n       Whereas, a provision of Title XII of the EPact, \n     Electricity, however, preempts what have long been \n     fundamental powers of state and local governments; and\n       Whereas, section 1221, for example, transfers the authority \n     to approve the siting of certain transmission lines from \n     state governments and their political subdivisions to \n     agencies of the Federal Government; and\n       Whereas, section 1221(a) of EPact directs the Untied States \n     Secretary of Energy to, in consultation with states, conduct \n     periodic nationwide studies of electric transmission \n     congestion; and\n       Whereas, the Secretary of Energy released its initial \n     National Electric Transmission Congestion study in August \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, based upon the findings of any congestion study, \n     the Secretary of Energy may designate ``any geographical area \n     experiencing electric energy transmission capacity \n     constraints or congestion that adversely affects customers'' \n     as ``national interest electric transmission corridor'' or \n     national corridor; and\n       Whereas, section 1221(b) further conveys to the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to issue \n     permits for construction or modification of electric \n     transmission facilities situated or proposed to be situated \n     in any Department of Energy designated national interest \n     electric transmission corridor; and\n       Whereas, the FERC would be able to override the authority \n     of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to issue a \n     certificate of public convenience to approve and locate a \n     transmission line in a Department of Energy designated \n     national interest electric transmission corridor if:\n       (1) the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission had no \n     authority to approve a specified transmission line proposal \n     or would fail to consider interstate benefits of the proposed \n     transmission line:\n       (2) the applicant would not qualify for a certificate of \n     public convenience issued by the Pennsylvania Public Utility \n     Commission because it does not serve end-use customers in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania;\n       (3) the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission would fail \n     to act on an application for approval to locate and construct \n     the new transmission line within one year of the filing of an \n     application or one year after designation as a national \n     interest electric transmission corridor, whichever is later; \n     or\n       (4) the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission would \n     condition its approval in such a manner that the proposed \n     construction or modification would not significantly reduce \n     transmission congestion or would not be economically \n     feasible; and\n       Whereas, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and its \n     predecessor, the Public Service Commission, have had \n     jurisdictional and regulatory authority over public utilities \n     and public utility service, including the review and approval \n     of applications for the location and construction of \n     transmission lines in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania since \n     1913, or for 94 years; and\n       Whereas, the designation of national interest electric \n     transmission corridors in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n     coupled with FERC ``backstop'' authority to issue permits to \n     site a transmission line and thereby override the \n     recommendations of the Pennsylvania Public Utility \n     Commission, would give electric utilities access to Federal \n     eminent domain authority; and\n       Whereas, if FERC would institute its ``backstop'' \n     authority, the holder of a FERC-issued permit would be \n     empowered to exercise the right of eminent domain to condemn \n     and acquire private property to locate and construct the \n     transmission line; and\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2006, Allegheny Power and the PJM \n     Interconnection, the Regional Transmission Organization that \n     coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or \n     parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, including \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, filed for early designation \n     as a national interest electric transmission corridor a 240-\n     mile, 500 kV transmission line which would extend from \n     southwestern Pennsylvania, traverse West Virginia and \n     terminate in northern Virginia; and\n       Whereas, on October 10, 2006, the PJM Interconnection \n     submitted another request to the Department of Energy for \n     early designation of three additional national interest \n     electric transmission corridors that will encompass nearly \n     all of the Mid-Atlantic region; and\n       Whereas, the early request filed with the United States \n     Department of Energy by Allegheny Power and the PJM \n     Interconnection, if granted, will include significant acreage \n     of land in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2007, the United States Department of \n     Energy released drafts of two national interest electric \n     transmission corridor designations, including the Mid-\n     Atlantic Area National Corridor; and\n       Whereas, the Mid-Atlantic area National Corridor \n     designation includes counties in Ohio, West Virginia, \n     Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, Virginia and includes all \n     of New Jersey, Delaware and the District of Columbia; and\n       Whereas, Fifty of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's 67 \n     counties, or 75% of the land within the Commonwealth's \n     geographic borders, are included in the Mid-Atlantic Area \n     National Corridor designation; and\n       Whereas, in its release announcing the draft national \n     interest electric transmission corridor designations, the \n     Department of Energy revealed that it would convene three \n     public meetings during a 60-day comment period; and\n       Whereas, in its April 26, 2007, announcement, the \n     Department of Energy revealed that public meetings would be \n     held in New York, Virginia and California during the 60-day \n     comment period; and\n       Whereas, some local governments, citizens and preservation \n     groups that would be directly impacted by the designation of \n     national interest electric transmission corridors in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\n     and some other affected states contacted the Department of \n     Energy to express their disappointment and concern that no \n     public meetings were planned for Pennsylvania and other \n     affected states during the 60-day comment period; and\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2007, the Department of Energy announced \n     that it would hold four additional meetings during the 60-day \n     public comment period in some states, including the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that would be impacted by the \n     national interest electric transmission corridor \n     designations; and\n       Whereas, the Pennsylvania public meeting will be convened \n     in the month of June in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, the 60-day comment period for the Mid-Atlantic \n     Area National Corridor designation is scheduled to and on \n     July 6, 2007; and\n       Whereas, it is alleged that the transmission lines proposed \n     to be located and constructed in the Mid-Atlantic Area \n     National Corridor would be used to relieve energy congestion \n     and constraints and improve electric reliability in \n     population centers of the East Coast; and\n       Whereas, designation of national interest electric \n     transmission corridors in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     could diminish or eliminate the role of the Pennsylvania \n     Public Utility Commission, the administrative agency of the \n     Commonwealth that has regulatory authority over the approval \n     of applications for the location and construction of \n     transmission lines; and\n       Whereas, designation of national interest electric \n     transmission corridors would also adversely limit or \n     completely eliminate the roles of the Office of Consumer \n     Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate; and\n       Whereas, the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of \n     Small Business Advocate are administrative agencies of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that were expressly established \n     by Pennsylvania statute to represent the interests of \n     consumers and small businesses, respectively, in proceedings \n     before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, including \n     certain matters related to the location and construction of \n     transmission lines; and\n       Whereas, designation of national interest electric \n     transmission corridors and FERC's accompanying ``backstop'' \n     authority could diminish or even eliminate the roles of other \n     administrative agencies of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     that were established for the express purpose of protecting \n     Pennsylvania's economic, natural, historical, cultural and \n     recreational resources, including the Departments of \n     Environmental Protection, Conservation and Natural Resources, \n     Agriculture and Transportation as well as the Game Commission \n     and the Historical and Museum Commission; and\n       Whereas, designation of national interest electric \n     transmission corridors in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     would undermine and in some cases eliminate the \n     Commonwealth's ability to determinate, manage and control \n     land use policies, including land use policies on its \n     agricultural lands, forest reserves, recreational areas, game \n     lands and other natural and environmentally sensitive areas: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania recognize fully \n     the energy and environmental challenges facing the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in general and the United States \n     in particular; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate believes that demand for energy \n     continues to be a concern nationwide, especially in major \n     population centers, and that an effective national energy \n     policy must include increased emphasis on conservation, \n     renewable energy, energy-efficient alternatives, demand-side \n     management, innovations and new technologies while \n     simultaneously providing incentives to increase domestic \n     production and supply; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognize that an effective \n     energy policy must be addressed nationally but should reflect \n     traditional state and local authority over environmental and \n     energy matters; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate oppose the provisions of EPact \n     which preempt the authority of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and its political subdivisions to determined \n     land use policies and which usurp the traditional and \n     fundamental authority of the Pennsylvania Public Utility \n     Commission to review and approve applications for the \n     location and construction of transmission lines in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge the members of the \n     Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation to support legislation \n     to repeal section 1221 of EPact and thereby preserve the \n     fundamental rights of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and \n     its people to determine the future of land use policies; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the residing officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-170. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to review and consider \n     eliminating provisions of federal law which reduce Social \n     Security benefits for those receiving pension benefits from \n     federal, state, or local government retirement systems or \n     funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 114\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a federal, \n     state, or local retirement or pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement benefits, in \n     addition to working in employment covered under Social \n     Security and paying into the Social Security system; and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, because the Social Security benefit statements do \n     not calculate the GPO and the WEP, many public employees in \n     Louisiana are unaware that their expected Social Security \n     benefits shown on such statements will be significantly lower \n     or nonexistent due to the service in public employment \n     through which they are members of a Louisiana public \n     retirement or pension system or fund; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and the longer \n     life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of her citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and the WEP Social Security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2007 (H.R. 82 or S. 206) or a \n     similar instrument. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-171. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of New Hampshire urging Congress to amend the No \n     Child Left Behind Act with consideration of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures' task force recommendations; \n     to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                      Senate Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in 2002 the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted \n     on a bipartisan basis, which has as its purpose bringing \n     academic achievement in language arts, mathematics, and \n     science to students who are not presently achieving at \n     proficiency levels; and\n       Whereas, in 2004 the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures created a bipartisan task force to study the No \n     Child Left Behind Act and the task force suggested specific \n     changes to make the No Child Left Behind Act more workable, \n     more responsive to variations among the states, and more \n     effective in improving education; and\n       Whereas, a stated goal of the No Child Left Behind Act is \n     to provide flexibility for states to improve academic \n     achievement and to close the achievement gap, the task force \n     found that more flexibility should be granted to states to \n     implement the No Child Left Behind Act; and\n       Whereas, the New Hampshire general court had representation \n     on the bipartisan task force and concurs with the spirit of \n     the recommendations of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures; and\n       Whereas, a well-designed growth model, with multiple forms \n     of assessment, is a more meaningful and accurate measure of \n     student success than the No Child Left Behind Act model of \n     identifying schools in need of improvement; and\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act mandates a costly \n     sequence of intervention services, which the task force found \n     to be inflexible and instead recommended states to be allowed \n     to decide the interventions when\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\n     a school is ``in need of improvement'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the New Hampshire general court urges the \n     Congress of the United States to amend the No Child Left \n     Behind Act with consideration of the National Conference of \n     State Legislatures' task force recommendations, to allow each \n     state department of education the flexibility to monitor, \n     supervise, and evaluate each school's effectiveness in \n     documenting the physical, personal, social, and academic \n     growth of each child; and\n       That the New Hampshire general court urges the Congress of \n     the United States to request a Government Accountability \n     Office evaluation of the costs to states and local school \n     districts of complying with the No Child Left Behind Act \n     requirements and of achieving the 100 percent proficiency \n     goals of the No Child Left Behind Act; and\n       That the senate clerk send copies of this resolution to the \n     President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of the New Hampshire \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-172. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Pennsylvania urging Congress to repeal the REAL ID Act or \n     delay its implementation until such time as sufficient funds \n     are available to adequately cover the costs of implementation \n     and amendment is made to preserve essential civil rights; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in May 2005 the Congress of the United States \n     passed the REAL ID Act of 2005 (REAL ID Act) as part of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the \n     Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief Act, 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-13), which was signed into law on May 11, 2005, and \n     which becomes fully effective May 11, 2008; and\n       Whereas, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     denounces terrorism in all its forms and condemns all acts of \n     terrorism by any entity, wherever the acts occur; and\n       Whereas, any new security measures to protect against \n     terrorist attacks should be carefully designed to enhance \n     public safety without infringing on the civil liberties and \n     rights of citizens; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act constitutes an unfunded mandate by \n     the Federal Government to the states; and\n       Whereas, it will cost the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania an \n     estimated $100 million to implement the REAL ID Act; and\n       Whereas, the implementation of the REAL ID Act intrudes \n     upon the states' sovereign power to determine their own \n     policies for identification, licensure and credentialing of \n     individuals residing therein; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act requires the creation of a massive \n     public sector database containing information on every \n     American that is accessible to all motor vehicle agency \n     employees and law enforcement officers nationwide and that \n     can be used to gather and manage information on citizens, \n     which is neither the business nor the responsibility of \n     government; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act enables the creation of additional \n     massive private sector databases, combining both \n     transactional information and driver's license information \n     gained from scanning the machine-readable information \n     contained on every driver's license; and\n       Whereas, these public and private databases are likely to \n     contain numerous errors and false information, creating \n     significant hardship for Americans attempting to verify their \n     identities in order to fly, open a bank account or perform \n     any of the numerous functions required to live in the United \n     States today; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act requires a driver's license to \n     contain a person's actual home address and makes no exception \n     for individuals in potential danger, such as undercover law \n     enforcement officials or victims of domestic violence, \n     stalking or criminal harassment; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act contains onerous record \n     verification provisions that place unreasonable burdens on \n     Pennsylvanians renewing their driver's licenses; and\n       Whereas, some of the intended privacy requirements of the \n     REAL ID Act, such as the use of common machine-readable \n     technology and state maintenance of a database that can be \n     shared with the United States Government and agencies of \n     other states, may actually make it more likely that a \n     federally required driver's license or state identification \n     card, or the information about the bearer on which the \n     license or card is based, will be stolen, sold or otherwise \n     used for purposes that were never intended or that are \n     criminally related than if the REAL ID Act had not been \n     enacted; and\n       Whereas, these potential breaches in privacy that could \n     result directly from compliance with the REAL ID Act may \n     violate the right to privacy of thousands of Pennsylvanians; \n     and\n       Whereas, identification-based security provides only \n     limited security benefits because it can be avoided by \n     defrauding or corrupting card issuers and because it gives no \n     protection against people not already known to be planning or \n     committing wrongful acts; and\n       Whereas, a growing number of states have proposed and \n     passed legislation that opposes the implementation of the \n     REAL ID Act: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania support the intention of the United States \n     Government to prevent terrorism, but not at the expense of \n     the essential civil rights and liberties of the citizens of \n     this country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate oppose any portion of the REAL ID \n     Act that violates the rights and liberties guaranteed under \n     the Constitution of Pennsylvania or the Constitution of the \n     United States, including the Bill of Rights; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge the Pennsylvania \n     Congressional Delegation to support measures to repeal the \n     REAL ID Act or to delay its implementation until such time as \n     sufficient funds are available to adequately cover the costs \n     of implementation and amendment is made to preserve essential \n     civil rights and liberties of the citizens of this country; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9831-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BYRD, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Further Revised Allocation to \n     Subcommittees of Budget Totals from the Concurrent Resolution \n     for Fiscal Year 2008'' (Rept.

A bill to control violent crime; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a crime bill \nthat I hope all of my colleagues will support. Several of my colleagues \nand I have worked with the Department of Justice to develop an \nimportant comprehensive crime bill which will provide new tools to law \nenforcement and prosecutors across the country.\n  This is an important issue. The New York Times wrote recently that \nviolent crime was on the rise in our larger cities. Murder, robbery and \ngun assaults seem to be on the rise in midsized to large cities. \nExperts attribute this increase, in part, to the spread of drug use, \ngangs, high poverty, a record number of people being released from \nprison, and easy access to guns and a willingness to settle disputes \nwith them.\n  This comprehensive crime bill will help law enforcement officers and \nprosecutors beat back this rise in violent crimes. It is an extensive \nbill but let me discuss a few of its provisions here.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has worked to crack down on \nchild predators. From the PROTECT Act in 2003 to last year's Adam Walsh \nAct, Congress has made clear that those who commit crimes against our \nchildren will face swift and severe punishment. The bill I am \nintroducing today builds on this momentum and adds additional tools to \nthe prosecutorial arsenal. Among the changes provided in this bill is \nan increase in the punishments for a variety of sex offenses, including \nproviding mandatory minimums for possession of child pornography. The \nbill would triple the criminal fines available against electronic \nservice providers who knowingly and willfully fail to report child \npornography and would make it a Federal crime to participate in the sex \ntourism trade in order to produce child pornography.\n  We must protect the most vulnerable of us, children, and these \nprovisions will continue this progress.\n  The bill amends the armed career criminal statute to create a tiered \npunishment approach such that defendants with more serious criminal \nhistories who use guns will face harsher punishments, including \nmandatory minimum prison sentences. Additionally, the bill also \nincreases the statute of limitations for violent crimes from 5 to 10 \nyears.\n  The bill also makes some technical but important changes to the gun \nstatutes. For instance, the bill inserts an interstate commerce \njurisdictional statement in 18 U.S.C. 924h cases, the statute that \nprohibits the transfer of firearms to others who intend to use those \nfirearms in a drug trafficking or violent crime. This corrects a post \nLopez congressional oversight and ensures that if this statute is used, \nit will not be struck down. Additionally, this bill provides that those \nfelons who are arrested for possession of firearms will be detained \nwithout bail pending trial.\n  We need to send a strong message of deterrence to those who would \nillegally use firearms. This bill sends that message loud and clear.\n  Finally, the bill includes some significant changes to critical \nterrorism statutes. For instance, this bill criminalizes providing \nfinancial support to families of suicide bombers. It also increases \npenalties for those convicted of material support and denies Federal \nbenefits to convicted terrorists.\n  These are but a few of the provisions contained in this bill. \nCongress must continue to evaluate and, when necessary, provide needed \ntools to law enforcement to enable those public servants to effectively \ndo their job.\n  This bill does that and I hope that my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1862. A bill to provide for the exchange and conveyance of certain \nNational Forest land and other land in southeast Arizona, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southeast \nArizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2007. This bill \nfacilitates an important land exchange in Arizona that will provide for \nthe acquisition and protection of environmentally sensitive lands while \nproviding a much needed economic engine for the people of Superior, AZ, \nand the surrounding communities. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMcCain as an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  This is not the first time Senator McCain and I have introduced this \nland exchange legislation. In 2005, we introduced S. 1122. S. 1122 was \nlater modified and reintroduced in 2006 as S. 2466. S. 2466, as \nintroduced, reflected the painstaking negotiated compromises and public \nfeedback that we received with respect to the bill. S. 2466 had a \nfavorable hearing before the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands \nin the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in May 2006. At \nthat hearing, both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management \ntestified in support of the bill. The bill, however, was not enacted in \nthe last Congress. I am pleased to say we are back again this year with \na bill that includes some new provisions based on the work of the \nstakeholders to continue to improve the bill.\n  The exchange facilitates the conveyance to Resolution Copper of \napproximately 3,025 acres of National Forest System land, 3 miles \noutside of Superior, Arizona in the historic Pioneer Mining District. \nThe acreage commonly called ``Oak Flat'' would be traded to Resolution \nCopper to facilitate future exploration, and possible development, of \nwhat may be one of the largest deposits of copper ore ever discovered \nin North America. The 3,025 acres of Federal lands are intermingled \nwith, or lie next to, private lands already owned by Resolution Copper, \nand are located south and east of Resolution's existing underground \nMagma copper mine. Approximately 75 percent\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\nof the Federal land is already blanketed by federally authorized mining \nclaims owned by Resolution Copper that give it the right to explore and \ndevelop the minerals. Given the intermingled ownership, the public \nsafety issues that may be associated with mining activities, and the \nsignificant financial investment Resolution Copper must make to even \ndetermine whether development of a mine is feasible, it makes sense, \nfor Resolution Copper to own the entire Oak Flat area.\n  However, we also recognize that there are public impacts associated \nwith transferring Oak Flat out of federal ownership. This bill goes far \nin addressing these impacts. Let me explain. First, the land exchange \nis conditioned on the execution of a permanent conservation easement to \nprotect Apache Leap, a spectacular cliff area rich in cultural history \non the western side of the Federal parcel. Although the conservation \neasement has been a feature in this bill since it was first introduced, \nwe have expanded and strengthened the protections required by the \neasement. The easement will now apply to the entire Apache Leap \nescarpment totaling approximately 695 acres up from the 562 acres that \nwere protected in the original bill. To address concerns that were \nraised that the mining operation might still affect the area, the \nconservation easement will not just prohibit surface development, it \nwill also prohibit commercial mineral extraction under the easement \narea. In addition, the exchange includes a fund endowment for the \nimplementation of the terms of the conservation easement.\n  The Oak Flat Campground, consisting of 16 rustic tent/RV sites, is \nlocated on the north side of the parcel, adjacent to U.S. Highway 60. \nRecognizing that the campground is used by the community and others, we \nare requiring that this campground be replaced on the Globe Ranger \nDistrict at Resolution Copper's expense. Public access to this \ncampground will not immediately terminate on enactment of the \nlegislation: The bill stipulates continued public access to the \ncampground for two years after enactment.\n  We also heard from the public that climbing and bouldering are \nimportant recreational resources at Oak Flat. For this reason, we \nincluded a placeholder in S. 1122 for additional climbing provisions as \na good faith offer to the climbing community to work with us and \nResolution Copper to address the loss of public access to climbing at \nOak Flat in a way that would not compromise public safety. A compromise \nwas reached by the stakeholders to continue temporary interim access to \nsome climbing at Oak Flat; and execute a license between Resolution \nCopper and Access Fund, a national advocacy climbing organization, to \nallow climbers to gain access to popular climbing sites located on \nResolution Copper's private land. This compromise along with the \ndiscovery of ``Tamo,'' a climbing gem in the Tam O'Shanter Mountains, \nwhich is slated to become Arizona's newest State park, are examples of \nhow parties coming together can turn an unfortunate situation into a \nwin-win.\n  We had hoped we would be able to make a similar announcement with \nregard to the cultural resource concerns that were raised by the San \nCarlos Apache Tribe in May of last year. Unfortunately, that is not the \ncase. I am still hopeful, however, and I will continue to reach out to \nthe Yavapai and Apache tribes as this bill moves through the \nlegislative process.\n  In return for conveying the Federal land to Resolution Copper, the \nForest Service and Bureau of Land Management will receive eight parcels \nof private land, totaling 4,583 acres plus $7.5 million to be placed in \na trust account to be expended by the United States on additional \nconservation lands in Arizona. The parcels included in this bill have \nbeen identified, and are strongly endorsed for acquisition by the \nArizona Audubon Society, Nature Conservancy, Trust for Public Land, \nSonoran Institute, Arizona Game and Fish Department, and numerous \nothers. They include lands along the San Pedro River, an important \ninternationally recognized migratory bird corridor, riparian and \nwetland habitat for threatened and endangered animal and plant species, \nincluding the southwestern willow flycatcher and the hedgehog cactus, \nand magnificent canyons and forests that are home to big game species. \nMost of the parcels are in holdings whose acquisition will enable more \neffective management of the federal land. It is in the public interest \nto bring these conservation lands into Federal ownership for the \nenjoyment of future generations.\n  Although the focus of this bill is the land exchange between \nResolution Copper and the U.S., it also includes provisions allowing \nfor the conveyance of Federal lands to the town of Superior. These \nlands include the town cemetery, lands around the town airport, and a \nFederal reversionary interest that exists at the airport site. These \nlands are included in the proposed exchange to help the town to provide \nits municipal needs and expand and diversify its economic development.\n  Though I have described the many benefits of and the important \ncompromises that are part of this exchange, you may be asking why we \nare legislating this land exchange. Why not use the existing \nadministrative land exchange process? The answer is that this exchange \ncan only be accomplished legislatively because the Forest Service does \nnot have the authority to convey away Federal lands in order to acquire \nother lands outside the boundaries of the National Forest System, no \nmatter how ecologically valuable.\n  This bill contains procedural safeguards and conditions that ensure \nit is an equal value exchange in the public interest. I will highlight \nsome of those safeguards: First, it requires that all appraisals of the \nlands must follow standard federal practice and be performed in \naccordance with appraisal standards promulgated by the U.S. Department \nof Justice. All appraisals must also be formally reviewed, and \napproved, by the Secretary of Agriculture. Second, to ensure the \nFederal Government gets full value for the Federal parcel it is giving \nup, the Federal parcel will be appraised to include the minerals and \nappraised as if unencumbered by the private mining claims that detract \nfrom the fair market value of the land. These are important provisions \nnot required by federal law. They are especially significant given that \nover 75 percent of the Federal parcel is covered by mining claims owned \nby Resolution Copper and the bulk of the value of the Federal parcel is \nexpected to be the minerals. Third, the Apache Leap conservation \neasement is expressly excluded from the valuation of the Federal land, \npreventing any possibility that this easement would devalue the Federal \nland. By following standard appraisal practices and including these \nadditional safeguards in the valuation process, the U.S., and \nultimately the taxpayer, will receive full fair market value for both \nthe land and the minerals it contains.\n  With this land exchange we can preserve lands that advance the \nimportant public objectives of protecting wildlife habitat, cultural \nresources, the watershed, and aesthetic values, while generating \neconomic, recreation, and employment opportunities for state and local \nresidents. I hope we approve the legislation at the earliest possible \ndate. It is a winning scenario for our environment and our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1863. A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Robert M. La Follette, Sr., in \nrecognition of his important contributions to the Progressive movement, \nthe State of Wisconsin, and the United States; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary \nlife of Robert M. La Follette, Sr. This week, on June 14, people around \nmy home State of Wisconsin will mark the 152nd anniversary of La \nFollette's birth. Throughout his life, La Follette was revered for his \ntireless service to the people of Wisconsin and to the people of the \nU.S. His dogged, full-steam-ahead approach to his life's work earned \nhim the nickname ``Fighting Bob.''\n  Robert Marion La Follette, Sr., was born on June 14, 1855, in \nPrimrose, a small town southwest of Madison in Dane County. He \ngraduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n1879 and, after being admitted to the State bar, began his long career \nin public service as Dane County district attorney.\n  La Follette was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, \nand he served three terms as a member of that body, where he was a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  After losing his campaign for reelection in 1890, La Follette \nreturned to Wisconsin and continued to serve the people of my state as \na judge. Upon his exit from Washington DC, a reporter wrote, La \nFollette ``is popular at home, popular with his colleagues, and popular \nin the House. He is so good a fellow that even his enemies like him.''\n  He was elected the 20th Governor of Wisconsin in 1900. He served in \nthat office until 1906, when he stepped down in order to serve the \npeople of Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate, where he remained until his \ndeath in 1925.\n  As a founder of the national progressive movement, La Follette \nchampioned progressive causes as governor of Wisconsin and in the U.S. \nCongress. As governor, he advanced an agenda that included the \ncountry's first workers compensation system, direct election of U.S. \nSenators, and railroad rate and tax reforms. Collectively, these \nreforms would become known as the ``Wisconsin Idea.'' As governor, La \nFollette also supported cooperation between the state and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin.\n  His terms in the House of Representatives and the Senate were spent \nfighting for women's rights, working to limit the power of monopolies, \nand opposing pork barrel legislation. La Follette also advocated \nelectoral reforms, and he brought his support of the direct election of \nU.S. Senators to this body. His efforts were brought to fruition with \nthe ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913. Fighting Bob also \nworked tirelessly to hold the Government accountable, and was a key \nfigure in exposing the Teapot Dome Scandal.\n  La Follette earned the respect of such notable Americans as Frederick \nDouglass, Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman Upton for making \ncivil rights one of his trademark issues. At a speech before the 1886 \ngraduating class of Howard University, La Follette said, ``We are one \npeople, one by truth, one almost by blood. Our lives run side by side, \nour ashes rest in the same soil. [Seize] the waiting world of \nopportunity. Separatism is snobbish stupidity, it is supreme folly, to \ntalk of non-contact, or exclusion!''\n  La Follette ran for President three times, twice as a Republican and \nonce on the Progressive ticket. In 1924, as the Progressive candidate \nfor President, La Follette garnered more than 17 percent of the popular \nvote and carried the State of Wisconsin.\n  La Follette's years of public service were not without controversy. \nIn 1917, he filibustered a bill to allow the arming of U.S. merchant \nships in response to a series of German submarine attacks. His \nfilibuster was successful in blocking passage of this bill in the \nclosing hours of the 64th Congress. Soon after, La Follette was one of \nonly six Senators who voted against U.S. entry into World War I.\n  Fighting Bob was outspoken in his belief that the right to free \nspeech did not end when war began. In the fall of 1917, La Follette \ngave a speech about the war in Minnesota, and he was misquoted in press \nreports as saying that he supported the sinking of the Lusitania. The \nWisconsin State Legislature condemned his supposed statement as \ntreason, and some of La Follette's Senate colleagues introduced a \nresolution to expel him. In response to this action, he delivered his \nseminal floor address, ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' on October 16, 1917. \nIf you listen closely, you can almost hear his strong voice echoing \nthrough this chamber as he said: ``Mr. President, our government, above \nall others, is founded on the right of the people freely to discuss all \nmatters pertaining to their government, in war not less than in peace, \nfor in this government, the people are the rulers in war no less than \nin peace.''\n  Of the expulsion petition filed against him, La Follette said:\n\n       I am aware, Mr. President, that in pursuance of this \n     general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, \n     requests from various individuals and certain organizations \n     have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this \n     body, and that such requests have been referred to and \n     considered by one of the Committees of the Senate.\n       If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I \n     should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their \n     consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have \n     been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the \n     same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the \n     mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth \n     of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided by \n     such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and directed by \n     a solemn conviction of right and duty.\n\n  This powerful speech led to a Senate investigation of whether La \nFollette's conduct constituted treason. In 1919, following the end of \nWorld War I, the Senate dropped its investigation and reimbursed La \nFollette for the legal fees he incurred as a result of the expulsion \npetition and corresponding investigation. This incident is indicative \nof Fighting Bob's commitment to his ideals and of his tenacious spirit.\n  La Follette died on June 18, 1925, in Washington, DC., while serving \nWisconsin in this body. His daughter noted, ``His passing was \nmysteriously peaceful for one who had stood so long on the battle \nline.'' Mourners visited the Wisconsin Capitol to view his body, and \npaid respects in a crowd nearing 50,000 people. La Follette's son, \nRobert M. La Follette, Jr., was appointed to his father's seat, and \nwent on to be elected in his own right and to serve in this body for \nmore than 20 years, following the progressive path blazed by his \nfather.\n  La Follette has been honored a number of times for his unwavering \ncommitment to his ideals and for his service to the people of Wisconsin \nand of the U.S.\n  During the 109th Congress, I was proud to support Senate passage of a \nbill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Tammy \nBaldwin that named the post office at 215 Martin Luther King, Jr., \nBoulevard in Madison in La Follette's honor. I commend Congresswomen \nBaldwin for her efforts to pass that bill and I am pleased she is \nintroducing House companion measures of the legislation I am \nintroducing today in the Senate.\n  The Library of Congress recognized La Follette in 1985 by naming the \nCongressional Research Service reading room in the Madison Building in \nhonor of both Fighting Bob and his son, Robert M. La Follette, Jr., for \ntheir shared commitment to the development of a legislative research \nservice to support the U.S. Congress. In his autobiography, Fighting \nBob noted that, as governor of Wisconsin, he ``made it a . . . policy \nto bring all the reserves of knowledge and inspiration of the \nuniversity more fully to the service of the people. . . . Many of the \nuniversity staff are now in State service, and a bureau of \ninvestigation and research established as a legislative reference \nlibrary . . . has proved of the greatest assistance to the legislature \nin furnishing the latest and best thought of the advanced students of \nGovernment in this and other countries.'' He went on to call this \nservice ``a model which the Federal government and ultimately every \nstate in the union will follow.'' Thus, the legislative reference \nservice that La Follette created in Madison served as the basis for his \nwork to create the Congressional Research Service at the Library of \nCongress.\n  The La Follette Reading Room was dedicated on March 5, 1985, the \n100th anniversary of Fighting Bob being sworn in for his first term as \na Member of Congress.\n  Across this magnificent Capitol in National Statuary Hall, Fighting \nBob is forever immortalized in white marble, still proudly representing \nthe state of Wisconsin. His statue resides in the Old House Chamber, \nnow known as National Statuary Hall, among those of other notable \nfigures who have made their marks in American history. One of the few \nseated statues is that of Fighting Bob. Though he is sitting, he is \nshown with one foot forward, and one hand on the arm of his chair, as \nif he is about to leap to his feet and begin a robust speech.\n  When then-Senator John F. Kennedy's five-member Special Committee on \nthe Senate Reception Room chose La Follette as one of the ``Five \nOutstanding Senators'' whose portraits would hang outside of this \nchamber in the Senate reception room, he was described as being a \n``ceaseless battler for\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\nthe underprivileged'' and a ``courageous independent.'' Today, his \npainting still hangs just outside this chamber, where it bears witness \nto the proceedings of this body--and, perhaps, challenges his \nsuccessors here to continue fighting for the social and government \nreforms he championed.\n  Mr. President, to honor Robert M. La Follette, Sr., during the week \nof the anniversary of his birth, today I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl; the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy; and the junior Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Brown.\n  I am introducing a bill that would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins to commemorate Fighting Bob's life and legacy. \nThe second bill that I am introducing today, 1864, would authorize the \nPresident to posthumously award a gold medal on behalf of Congress to \nRobert M. La Follette, Sr. The minting of a commemorative coin and the \nawarding of the Congressional Gold Medal would be fitting tributes to \nthe memory of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and to his deeply held \nbeliefs and long record of service to his state and to his country. I \nhope that my colleagues will support these proposals.\n  Let us never forget Robert M. La Follette, Sr.'s character, his \nintegrity, his deep commitment to Progressive causes, and his \nunwillingness to waver from doing what he thought was right. The Senate \nhas known no greater champion of the common man and woman, no greater \nenemy of corruption and cronyism, than ``Fighting Bob'' La Follette, \nand it is an honor to speak in the same chamber, and serve the same \ngreat state, as he did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 278--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n      ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF ITS SUSPENSION OF \n    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTIONAL ARMED FORCES IN EUROPE TREATY\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \nDeMint) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 278\n\n       Whereas the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, \n     signed at Paris November 19, 1990 (``the CFE Treaty''), was \n     agreed upon and signed by 22 States Parties in order to \n     establish predictability, transparency, and stability in the \n     balance of conventional military forces and equipment in an \n     area of Europe stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural \n     Mountains;\n       Whereas there are now 30 States Parties to the CFE Treaty, \n     including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, \n     Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Germany, \n     Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, \n     Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the \n     Russian Federation, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, the \n     United Kingdom, and the United States;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty is recognized as one of the most \n     successful arms control treaties of the modern era and has \n     served as a cornerstone of European security as the continent \n     emerged from the shadows of the Cold War;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty facilitated the destruction or \n     conversion of over 52,000 battle tanks, armored combat \n     vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft, and attack \n     helicopters;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty continues to enable an unprecedented \n     level of transparency into military equipment holdings and \n     troop deployments in Europe, including over 4,000 on-site \n     inspections of military units and installations implemented \n     since the entry into force of the Treaty;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1999, at the Organization for \n     Security and Co-operation in Europe Summit in Istanbul, \n     Turkey, the parties to the CFE Treaty signed an Adaptation \n     Agreement to reflect the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the \n     expansion of membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (``NATO''), and other changes in the European \n     geopolitical environment;\n       Whereas, at the time of the signing of the Adaptation \n     Agreement, the Russian Federation made a series of pledges, \n     known as the Istanbul Commitments, to withdraw its remaining \n     military forces and equipment from the territory of Georgia \n     and Moldova or otherwise negotiate consensual agreements on \n     their continued presence;\n       Whereas while the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     taken initial steps towards fulfilling the Istanbul \n     Commitments, it continues to maintain troops and associated \n     equipment in both Georgia and Moldova without the express \n     sovereign consent of the governments of either of those \n     countries, and the United States and other parties to the CFE \n     Treaty have therefore refrained from taking steps to ratify \n     the Adaptation Agreement;\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2007, President of the Russian \n     Federation, Vladimir Putin, in a speech to the Federation \n     Council of the Russian Federation, announced his intention to \n     initiate an unspecified ``moratorium'' on Russian compliance \n     with the CFE Treaty, citing the refusal of NATO Members to \n     ratify the Adaptation Agreement, concerns over the proposed \n     United States missile defense deployment in Poland and the \n     Czech Republic, and new basing arrangements between the \n     United States Government and the Governments of Bulgaria and \n     Romania as unacceptable encroachments on the security of the \n     Russian Federation;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation \n     subsequently requested, as is its right under the CFE Treaty, \n     an Extraordinary Conference to discuss its outstanding \n     concerns, which was held from June 12 to June 15, 2007, in \n     Vienna, Austria;\n       Whereas, on July 14, 2007, President Putin issued a formal \n     decree announcing the intention of the Russian Federation to \n     suspend compliance with the CFE Treaty after providing 150 \n     days advance notice to the other CFE Treaty signatories;\n       Whereas President Putin justified his decision on \n     ``extraordinary circumstances'' that ``affect the security of \n     the Russian Federation and require immediate measures'';\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty provides a formal mechanism for \n     withdrawal of a State Party from the Treaty following 150 \n     days of notice, but does not contain any provision for \n     suspension; and\n       Whereas the Department of State, in responding to the \n     announcement by the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     suspend compliance with the CFE Treaty, declared, ``The \n     United States is disappointed by the Russian announcement of \n     its intention to suspend implementation of the Conventional \n     Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. The United States \n     remains committed to CFE's full implementation. We also \n     remain committed to the ratification and entry into force of \n     the Adapted CFE Treaty. We look forward to continuing to \n     engage with Russia and the other States Parties to the Treaty \n     to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 \n     CFE States.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the decision of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation to suspend \n     implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in \n     Europe, signed at Paris November 19, 1990 (``the CFE \n     Treaty''), is a regrettable step that will unnecessarily \n     heighten tensions in Europe;\n       (2) the Senate recognizes the enduring value of the CFE \n     Treaty as a cornerstone of European security and affirms its \n     support for the basic principles of transparency, \n     accountability, host country consent for the stationing of \n     foreign military forces, and the rule of law embodied in the \n     CFE Treaty and the 1999 Adaptation Agreement thereto;\n       (3) the Senate strongly urges the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to reconsider its suspension of CFE implementation \n     and engage with the other parties to the CFE Treaty to \n     resolve outstanding problems and establish an agreed approach \n     leading to the eventual implementation of the Adaption \n     Agreement to the CFE Treaty;\n       (4) the Senate calls on the Russian Federation to fulfill \n     its Istanbul Commitments of 1999 and move speedily to \n     withdraw all remaining forces and military equipment from \n     Georgia and Moldova;\n       (5) the Senate encourages all parties to the CFE Treaty to \n     engage the Russian Federation in seeking innovative and \n     constructive mechanisms to fully implement the Istanbul \n     Commitments, consistent with the principles and objectives of \n     the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and making full use of OSCE mechanisms;\n       (6) the Senate calls on all States Parties to ensure that \n     the resolution of the current disputes surrounding the CFE \n     Treaty be considered a priority at the highest political \n     levels, recognizing that the CFE Treaty is important both as \n     an arms control treaty and as an essential building block for \n     stable relations between the Russian Federation and \n     neighboring countries in Europe; and\n       (7) the Senate encourages officials of the Government of \n     the Russian Federation to refrain from belligerent statements \n     that only further polarize relations and jeopardize security \n     in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9837-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9837-S9838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 279--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1882 TREATY OF PEACE, AMITY, COMMERCE AND \nNAVIGATION BETWEEN THE KINGDOM AND CHOSUN (KOREA) AND THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Webb, and Mr. \nIsakson) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n                              S. Res. 279\n\n       Whereas both the Republic of Korea and the United States \n     are fully democratic states with a common commitment to human \n     rights and the rule of law;\n       Whereas 2007 marks the 125th anniversary of the Treaty of \n     Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation between the Kingdom of \n     Chosun (Korea) and the United States, concluded May 22, 1882, \n     which was a seminal moment in relations between the United \n     States and Korea;\n       Whereas the treaty contemplates ``everlasting amity and \n     friendship between the two peoples'', a tradition that both \n     state signatories have worked to achieve during the past 125 \n     years;\n       Whereas 2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the entry into \n     force of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, \n     with Protocol, signed at Seoul November 28, 1956 (8 UST \n     2217), between the United States and the Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea share a \n     mutual interest in the peaceful denuclearization of the \n     Korean peninsula;\n       Whereas nearly 40,000 citizens of the United States gave \n     their lives during the Korean War with the hope that the \n     Republic of Korea would remain free and independent;\n       Whereas the Mutual Defense Treaty, signed at Washington \n     October 1, 1953 (5 UST 2368), between the United States and \n     the Republic of Korea, has led to more than 50 years of \n     effective deterrence against attack by the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas 29,000 troops from the United States remain \n     stationed in the Republic of Korea as a tangible sign of the \n     commitment of the United States to the security of the \n     Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea is the fourth largest \n     contributor of troops to the peacekeeping effort in Iraq and \n     continues its tradition of supporting the United States in \n     key armed struggles;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea is making a significant \n     military and financial contribution to building lasting \n     stability in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea \n     continuously work to modernize their security relationship \n     through annual Security Consultative Meetings between their \n     defense ministers, the Strategic Consultation for Allied \n     Partnership Dialogue, and various lower-level forums;\n       Whereas the economic partnership between the United States \n     and the Republic of Korea has contributed to significant \n     economic growth for both countries;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea is the seventh largest \n     trading partner of the United States, and the United States \n     is the third largest trading partner of the Republic of \n     Korea;\n       Whereas the Free Trade Agreement between the United States \n     of America and the Republic of Korea, done at Washington June \n     30, 2007, is the first free trade agreement between the \n     United States and a Northeast Asian nation, paving the way \n     for greater economic efficiency and consumer benefits in both \n     countries;\n       Whereas nearly 2,000,000 Korean-Americans contribute to the \n     fabric of life in the United States and link the United \n     States to Korea on a personal basis;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea sends more international \n     students to the United States than any other country; and\n       Whereas the strong relationship between the United States \n     and the Republic of Korea across many fronts has proven \n     beneficial for both countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the strength and endurance of the alliance between the \n     United States and the Republic of Korea should be \n     acknowledged and celebrated;\n       (2) the Free Trade Agreement between the United States of \n     America and the Republic of Korea, done at Washington June \n     30, 2007, highlights the vibrancy and diversity of the common \n     interests of the United States and the Republic of Korea and \n     should be fully implemented by both countries;\n       (3) the United States should sustain substantive dialogue \n     with both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's \n     Republic of Korea, with the expectation of the eventual \n     unification of the Korean peninsula, as it was at the signing \n     of the Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce and Navigation \n     between the Kingdom of Chosun (Korea) and the United States, \n     concluded May 22, 1882;\n       (4) working with the Republic of Korea to foster greater \n     regional cooperation in East Asia should be a priority of the \n     United States, as such cooperation brings long and short term \n     benefits to all those involved; and\n       (5) the United States and the Republic of Korea should \n     strive to develop further a more global perspective in their \n     partnership, with the goal of addressing international \n     priorities such as the fight against terrorism, the promotion \n     of human rights, the enhancement of democracy, and support \n     for peacekeeping.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncommemorating the 125th anniversary of the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, \nCommerce, and Navigation between the Kingdom of Chosun, Korea, and the \nUnited States Treaty provisions covered the appointment of diplomatic \nand consular representatives, care for U.S. ships in distress or \nneeding fuel, and protection for American citizens. The treaty also \nallowed that Koreans could work in the United States.\n  As President Reagan noted on the 100th anniversary of the treaty \nsigning, ``This Treaty marked a chapter in the history of northeast \nAsia and was the auspicious beginning of an enduring partnership \nbetween the United States and Korea.''\n  Initial efforts in 1880 by U.S. Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt to \nnegotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce with Korea were \nunsuccessful. However, in an interesting similarity to current events, \nChinese officials assisted in this endeavor. Viceroy Li Hongzhang, a \nleading Chinese figure, invited Commodore Shufeldt to visit China so \nthat discussions could be held regarding the U.S. efforts for a treaty \nwith Korea. In May of 1882, in part due to Chinese assistance, \nagreement was reached. Commodore Shufeldt and Minister Sin Hon among \nothers, participated in the treaty ceremony in Inchon. After it arrived \nin the United States, the treaty was ratified the following January.\n  The Republic of Korea-United States partnership covers economic, \neducational, security, and other fronts. Nearly 40,000 American \ncitizens gave their lives during the Korean War with the hope that the \nRepublic of Korea would remain free and independent. The U.S. \nDepartment of Defense reports that over 8,000 American personnel remain \nmissing from their service in that war, with nearly 200 of those from \nmy home State of Indiana.\n  Today, approximately 2 million Korean-Americans contribute to the \nfabric of life in the United States, and serve as an important link, on \na personal basis, with the Republic of Korea. I am pleased to introduce \nthis resolution with deep appreciation for this important bilateral \nrelationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9838-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9838-S9839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 280--CONGRATULATING THE ANAHEIM DUCKS FOR WINNING THE \n                     2007 STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF SENATE ON IMMIGRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 28th, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, \n     rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill to provide for \n     comprehensive immigration reform.\n       (2) Illegal immigration remains the top domestic issue in \n     the United States.\n       (3) The people of the United States continue to feel the \n     effects of a failed immigration system on a daily basis, and \n     they have not forgotten that Congress and the President have \n     a duty to address the issue of illegal immigration and the \n     security of the international borders of the United States.\n       (4) People from across the United States have shared with \n     members of the Senate their wide ranging and passionate \n     opinions on how best to reform the immigration system.\n       (5) There is no consensus on an approach to comprehensive \n     immigration reform that does not first secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (6) There is unanimity that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to, and immediately should, secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (7) Border security is an integral part of national \n     security.\n       (8) The greatest obstacle the Federal Government faces with \n     respect to the people of the United States is a lack of trust \n     that the Federal Government will secure the international \n     borders of the United States.\n       (9) This lack of trust is rooted in the past failures of \n     the Federal Government to uphold and enforce immigration laws \n     and the failure of the Federal Government to secure the \n     international borders of the United States.\n       (10) Failure to uphold and enforce immigration laws has \n     eroded respect for those laws and eliminated the faith of the \n     people of the United States in the ability of their elected \n     officials to responsibly administer immigration programs.\n       (11) It is necessary to regain the trust of the people of \n     the United States in the competency of the Federal Government \n     to enforce immigration laws and manage the immigration \n     system.\n       (12) Securing the borders of the United States would serve \n     as a starting point to begin to address other issues \n     surrounding immigration reform on which there is not \n     consensus.\n       (13) Congress has not fully funded some interior and border \n     security activities that it has authorized.\n       (14) The President of the United States can initiate \n     emergency spending by designating\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\n     certain spending as ``emergency spending'' in a request to \n     the Congress.\n       (15) The lack of security on the international borders of \n     the United States rises to the level of an emergency.\n       (16) The Border Patrol are apprehending some, but not all, \n     individuals from countries that the Secretary of State has \n     determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism who cross or attempt to cross \n     illegally into the United States.\n       (17) The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a \n     human smuggling ring that has been bringing Iraqis and other \n     Middle Eastern individuals across the international borders \n     of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should work to regain the trust \n     of the people of the United States in its ability of the \n     Federal Government to secure the international borders of the \n     United States;\n       (2) in order to restore the credibility of the Federal \n     Government on this critical issue, the Federal Government \n     should prove its ability to enforce immigration laws by \n     taking actions such as securing the border, stopping the flow \n     of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, and \n     creating a tamper-proof biometric identification card for \n     foreign workers; and\n       (3) the President should request emergency spending that \n     fully funds--\n       (A) existing interior and border security authorizations \n     that have not been funded by Congress; and\n       (B) the border and interior security initiatives contained \n     in the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform \n     and for other purposes (S. 1639) introduced in the Senate on \n     June 18, 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2393.

This talented crew battled their \nopponents throughout a 2-month marathon playoff and proudly wear the \ntitle of ``champions.''\n  The Ducks' championship represents the first time that the storied \nStanley Cup has been able to call my State, California, its home. We \nCalifornians are proud to host this trophy, and we look forward to \nhaving it return many more times to our state in the future.\n  The Ducks have begun a new era of hockey in Southern California and I \nam sure they will attempt to defend their title with the same heart, \nsacrifice and passion that brought the Stanley Cup to Anaheim this \nyear.\n  The Ducks have proven that hockey is alive and well in California.\n  I also look forward to seeing the other hockey franchises in \nCalifornia, the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks, compete with the \nAnaheim Ducks for hockey's greatest prize in the coming years.\n  The Anaheim Ducks players, coaches, management, and owners have made \ntheir community and their fans proud.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand adjourned until 9:30 a.m., \nWednesday, July 25; that on Wednesday, following the prayer and pledge, \nthe Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be \ndeemed expired and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day; that there then be a period of morning business \nfor 60 minutes, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \nhalf and the majority controlling the second half; that at the close of \nmorning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2638.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I turn to my distinguished colleague, the \nRepublican leader, and ask if he has any statements.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have nothing to add. I look forward \nto making progress on the bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. I say that the Republican leader wasn't on the floor, but I \nwill repeat for his benefit what I said a little while ago. I spoke to \nJosh Bolton earlier today about the appropriations bills. Of course, it \nwould be great if we could have an overall scheme as to how we can \ncomplete them. In the meantime, if we can get them done, we should \nproceed through these bills one at a time and recognize that the power \nof the White House, whether it is a Democratic President, a Republican \nPresident in the appropriations process, comes during the conferences, \nanyway. The House can move things very quickly. So all these are ready \nto go to conference. I hope we can move through these individual \nappropriations bills and hopefully have some recognition of what we are \ngoing to try to accomplish in conference before we go to conference and \nwork some of these out.\n  The first test will be this bill we are working on now. There has \nbeen some moving on it today. Senator Cochran is the one who suggested \nto me if there is no progress tomorrow, that we should move to third \nreading. When I say ``no progress,'' people just waiting around, not \noffering any amendments. So that is where we are. I hope we can finish \nthis soon, do what we need to do on SCHIP, and do the 9/11 conference \nreport, which I understand is almost\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\nfinished. When I say almost, 100 percent of it needs to be done, and 99 \npercent of that has been done.\n  We have taken out the language the Republicans did not want, \nespecially the President, dealing with the union situation. Even though \nit was hard for us to swallow, we took that out to make it more \npalatable to my friends on the other side. We will come back in \nSeptember rested and invigorated and ready to do some other things for \nthe country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would add with regard to the \nappropriations bills, as the majority leader knows, I have said both \npublicly and to him privately, it is my preference to pass each of the \nbills. We are running considerably behind the House. We have got a long \nway to go, but I think there will be a lot of cooperation on our side \nin trying to get the appropriations bills signed and get them down to \nthe President. We have a recent history of malfunction on both sides. \nLast year when the majority was in my party, we failed to pass 11 out \nof 13 appropriations bills. In 2002, when the Democrats were in the \nmajority, they did the same thing. So there is ample opportunity to \npoint fingers at both sides for not completing the appropriations \nprocess as we should. But I would predict to the majority leader there \nwill be a great deal of cooperation on our side in getting through \nthat, moving as rapidly as possible so we can function as we should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/24/senate-section/article/S9855-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
